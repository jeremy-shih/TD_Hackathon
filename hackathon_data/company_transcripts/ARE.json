[Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Paula Schwartz","Thank you, and good afternoon. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel.","Joel Marcus","Thank you, Paula, and welcome everybody to the fourth quarter and year-end 2018 conference call, and happy new year and healthy new year to everybody. With me today are Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia and Dean Shigenaga. And as I always do, I want to thank the entire Alexandria family for an operationally outstanding fourth quarter and year ended 2018. A quick look at Page 4 of our press release highlights our, I think, and depicts our amazing collective accomplishments as of year-end, including our all-time high-end revenues. Each of the speakers will get into these -- the quality of our tenants, the quality of our cash flows, our leasing stats, our margins, our credit rating, our exposure to variable rate debt and importantly, very importantly, our leverage is lowest we've ever had in the history of the company.","So with that, I'd like to talk a little bit about -- since our founding, we've always been blessed to be an idea-based meritocracy culture. And as a very mission-driven company, we operate at the highest standards and levels of integrity and ethical behavior. And we have among the best disclosure and transparency hard earned over our 22 years as a public company and so recognized by NAREIT."," nd when we speak about corporate social responsibility, which is a big buzzword in the industry today, we at Alexandria try to live it every day. In 2018, among many notable accomplishments, our team volunteered over 2,600 collective hours to important nonprofit causes and 49 of our team members ran the New York City Marathon and raised over almost $0.25 million for Memorial Sloan-Kettering's cancer fund research.","At Investor Day on November 28, in addition to giving what we felt was very good guidance for 2019, we also gave investors and analysts our framework for our 5-year growth plan where Alexandria has the potential to double rental revenues from 2018 to 2022 on what we own on balance sheet today, assuming a positive macro and industry environment. And I think it's important to understand why we can articulate such a bold and positive framework. It really is based on 3 key strategies. Number one is our business strategy. And in the 2004, '05 and '06 time frame, we pivoted from a single-asset strategy to a core cluster campus strategy and began and initiated major campuses in Mission Bay, New York City and Cambridge and beyond, which are now bearing huge cash flow -- high-quality cash flow results.","In addition to our business strategy, our financial strategy was pretty crucial coming out of the financial crisis of '08 and '09. For the years 2010 through 2013, we became critically important an investment-grade company with access to investment-grade debt, and we sold certain key land parcels including a very large site, which really was handled in an exquisite fashion by Steve Richardson, which now sits on where the Warriors Stadium is being built and where we're building two towers for Uber for part of their headquarters at Mission Bay.","And that really was critical to substantially lowering our leverage, which led to our significant outperformance in the years 2014 through 2018. And then thirdly, really, you have a business strategy, you have a financial strategy and then you have a management and personnel strategy. Those are the 3 kind of anchors of any really great company strategy.","And from 2008 onward, we did not layoff our construction development team during and after the market crash. Led by our very talented Vince Ciruzzi, we kept our great team and then continued to build as we came out of the crash to where it is today, where we have a super high level of operational excellence with delivery and cost management. We continue to build our core accounting and financial team with Dean's leadership and the regional operating teams headed by long-tenured level five leaders.","And probably one of the most important things we did was to appoint Peter Moglia as Chief Investment Officer during the crash, which radically professionalized our entire investment philosophy and approach to operations, acquisition, redevelopment and development. And Peter also brought a highly specialized experience base and knowledge base in financing, joint ventures and sales of partial interest.","If you look at Page 33 of the supplement, it really depicts the Alexandria management of our development pipeline, something that has become because of the financial strategy, the business strategy and the management strategy really enabled us to grow after and out of the crash. And you can see the stats there on Page 33, which I think are, Dean always is very proud, really I think exceptional for an economy.","Let me move very quickly before I hand it over to Steve on a quick summary of the Life Science industry. Venture capital had another historic year with -- and an all-time high with Life Science being funded to the tune of over $27 billion. San Francisco Bay was #1 with 32% of that, Greater Boston 21% and San Diego 9%. The FDA and the industry had a record year with 59 novel medicines approved by the FDA, a historic number. I'm not sure if they can match that in future years, but it was truly historic. Also, 2018 was a strong year for biotech IPOs, with 56 companies going public and raising accumulative $6.7 billion.","So we're very proud of both our real estate fundamentals and also the Life Science industry fundamentals.","So let me turn it over to Steve to get more color on the quarter and the year.","Stephen Richardson","Thank you, Joel. Alexandria as an innovator and leader in creating first-in-class life science clusters is very pleased to report healthy lab real estate fundamentals, featuring strong demand against the backdrop of constrained supply, and important to note, severely constrained supply in a few of our key submarkets that we'll detail in the following comments. Very quickly, 2018 was an absolutely excellent year. The highlights include a cash rent increase of 14.1%. Important to note that this is the highest during the past 10 years. 4.7 million square feet of leasing, the second highest during Alexandria's nearly 25-year history.","And this stat, I think, is critically important that percentage of early renewals and re-leasing this past year was 71%. And what's underneath that is a clear indication of a sense of urgency in the market amongst our client tenants. The quarter highlights include rental rate increases of 11.4% cash and an increase of $41 million in rental revenue, primarily due to the delivery of 300,000 square feet leased on a long-term basis to Merck in South San Francisco and Takeda in San Diego, both high-quality, investment-grade pharmaceutical companies.","Other key leases include Dendreon leasing 76,000 square feet in Seattle. That alone was a 44% GAAP increase, which is really a testament to the value and durability of Alexandria designed and operated lab improvements. Moving onto the East Coast. Gates Medical leased 52,000 square feet at [indiscernible] in Cambridge. An important GSA lab tenant leased 64,000 square feet at five Research in Maryland. Regenxbio also leased 132,000 square feet at a new project we have in Maryland. We also have an investment-grade pharmaceutical company that leased 66,000 square feet at a redevelopment project at 681 Gateway in South San Francisco. And finally, a very exciting early stage company insitro leased 35,000 square feet in South San Francisco as well.","Our leadership role in the country's leading life science clusters enable us to capitalize on these very solid lab real estate fundamentals. At the outset, I referenced a severely constrained supply dynamic and the details below include the Cambridge market with just a 1.1% vacancy rate with the lab demand at 2.1 million square feet, paired with another 1.9 million square feet of technology demand. Mission Bay and San Francisco has a 0% vacancy rate and Greater Stanford down on the peninsula has a 1.6% vacancy rate.","Overall, the San Francisco region's life science demand remained strong at 2.5 million square feet, while tech demand has actually increased to 7.8 million square feet in the area from San Francisco to Palo Alto. We are monitoring supply in South San Francisco with a potential for 2 new projects from new entrants in the market there. Moving north, Seattle's life science cluster in South Lake Union has become even tighter with the vacancy rate of less than 1% and lab demand increasing to 611,000 square feet. And important to note that this is against the backdrop of more than 3 million square feet of tech demand.","On the southern part of the West Coast, San Diego's UTC and Torrey Pines submarkets have a direct vacancy of 6.8%. And as well, we are seeing an increase of lab demand there to 1.6 million square feet. And finally, Maryland is healthy with nearly 500,000 square feet of demand and just a 4.6% vacancy rate.","I think the clear takeaway here is that the solid lab real estate fundamentals continue to be driven by the success of the life science industry, as Joel outlined. Alexandria as a trusted partner to the entire life science ecosystem is oftentimes collaborating with its clients for many months and even years on new projects. Page 33 of the supplemental details the accomplishments of our fully integrated, underwriting leasing and construction teams during the past 10 years with 4.1 million square feet 100% leased and 3 million square feet 30% -- 36% leased at the start of these Class A projects. As we consider new starts in our core markets that will continue to drive NAV, we will closely monitor these lab real estate fundamentals and continue leveraging our unique and strategic insights.","Take it away, Peter.","Peter Moglia","Thanks, Steve. I'm going to spend the next few minutes updating everybody on our fourth quarter deliveries, our near-term pipeline and our asset sales efforts. In the fourth quarter, we fully delivered 213 East Grand in South San Francisco to investment-grade tenant Merck. The initial stabilized cash yield is 6.5%, which is a healthy spread over what we believe would be a sub-5% cap rate if it was sold today. 9625 Towne Centre Drive in the prime University Town Center submarket of San Diego was fully delivered to investment-grade tenant Takeda. The initialized cash yield is 7.3%, which is 30 basis points greater than we initially projected and 160 points -- basis points over Green Street's cap rate for the submarket, so another great example of value creation.","Two assets in Maryland: 9900 Medical Center Drive in the prime Shady Grove submarket of Rockville and 704 Quince Orchard Road in Gaithersburg partially delivered in the fourth quarter. Both assets have pro forma yields approaching or exceeding 8.5%. The Maryland market is continuing to gain momentum, and we are well positioned to capture its growth, illustrated by 2 recent announcements touched on by Steve for build-to-suit, for public gene therapy companies, Regenxbio and Autolus. Those two projects will further diversify the region's tenant base and combined for over 250,000 square feet of lease space that we'll deliver in 2020. A portion of five Laboratory Drive was delivered as well in the fourth quarter, bringing nearly 1\/3 of that project into operation. Great leasing progress has continued there with 100% of the space either leased or under negotiation, prompting the need to expand this unique campus in RTP by beginning the development of the adjacent 9 Laboratory Drive property, which is also one of our 2020 deliveries.","Finally, one of our partial 2018 deliveries, 399 Binney, slipped into January because of pipe work performed by the city of Cambridge that interfered with our glazing installation and delay caused by the power company who were months late in hooking up permanent power. Both of those events were out of our control. The team did an amazing job mitigating these impacts down to a 1-month delay. And due to achieving economic terms above our initial underwriting, the associated cost impacts will not cause our return to dip below our pro forma yield of 6.7%. In fact, it will likely be higher once we complete delivery of the remaining 40,000 square feet. This asset resides in the sub-4.5% cap rate Cambridge market and is yet another example of our ability to create tremendous value for our shareholders.","2019 brings more of the same. With the 2.2 million square foot pipeline, including unconsolidated joint ventures, that is already 88% leased with another 2% under negotiation. We have construction loans in place for the joint ventured assets, reducing the total equity needed to complete these projects to approximately $450 million. 188 East Blaine Street continued its steady absorption, going from 33% leased in the third quarter to 49% leased at the end of the fourth. We have remained on track to achieve an initial stabilized cash yield of 6.7% in a market where institutional assets have been trading in low to mid-4s.","275 Second Avenue in Waltham, submarket of Greater Boston, has approximately 30,000 square feet left to deliver and is now 90% leased with a proposal out for the remaining 10%. It remains on track to achieve a 7.1% initial stabilized cash yield. 279 East Grand, which is an extension of our South San Francisco campus anchored by Alphabet subsidiary Verily is approximately 67% leased to Verily and 33% leased to an exciting new company that Steve mentioned insitro, which is developing new drugs by integrating machine learning techniques with recent groundbreaking discoveries in life science. This project is a testament of the high-quality value creation development team we have in place in the Bay Area as it's expected to deliver with an initial stabilized cash yield of a whopping 8.1%, likely a 300 basis point spread over its market cap rate.","The Bay Area team is also executing the redevelopment of 681 East Grand located only a few blocks from the 279 building. It is also anchored by an investment-grade tenant and is expected to stabilize the cash yield of 7.9%, also likely a 300 basis point spread above its market cap rate. In addition, they will be delivering the remaining 49,000 square feet at Alexandria Park in Palo Alto by the end of the second quarter. The space is fully leased to an investment-grade tenant and is projected to stabilize at a 6.7% yield in the low 5% cap rate submarket.","Finally, we're excited to be adding the redevelopment of 140,000 square feet of the Alexandria Life Science Factory in Long Island City to our 2019 pipeline. This property will serve to accommodate the expansion of our growing base of early stage companies in New York City and is expected to be a platform, from which to cede our development of the North Tower, which is anticipated deliver in the 2021-2022 time frame. I'll just touch on asset sales. We are pleased to update you that we have signed purchase and sale joint venture and ancillary documents effectuating the partial interest sale of 60% of the 388,000 square foot 75\/125 Binney project in Cambridge to a highly regarded U.S.-based institutional investor. The agreed-upon value of $1,880 per square foot represents a 4.3% cap rate on fourth quarter annualized net income and is a testament to the significant value that resides in our urban innovation campuses and our brand.","In addition, we have identified a number of assets that can be recycled into higher returns or joint ventured to provide an advantageous cost of capital relative to common equity. We are currently working with consultants to confirm our valuations and we will be iterating our disposition strategy based on these efforts and market conditions throughout the year. To sum it up, our value creation machine continues to run. And when we need to monetize it, we've been able to execute that flawlessly.","So I'll go ahead and pass it over to Dean.","Dean Shigenaga","Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. Let me just touch on an important topic before I jump into key highlights for the quarter and the full year. As Peter highlighted, we announced the execution of this P&S for the sale of the 60% interest core Class A property that was developed at 75\/125 Binney Street in Cambridge. The sale price is $1,880 per rentable square foot that represents a 4.3% cap rate on fourth quarter cash NOI annualized.","If you look back over the last 5 years, including this transaction, our dispositions aggregate $1.5 billion at an average cap rate in the mid-4% range. The key takeaways that our team has built a very high-quality asset base of Class A properties in some of the best real estate submarkets in the country, and we have built an industry-leading high-quality tenant roster. And both of these translate into one of the best portfolios of high-quality cash flows in the REIT industry today. We clearly have a very attractive high-value asset base and this P&S announcement today further supports this.","Our office lab properties should be valued at a premium to Class A office due to the quality of the real estate, high-quality tenant roster, lower long-term CapEx requirement, and importantly, our unique and differentiated business strategy, our platform, brand and highly experienced team. So let me get back to our comments on operating and financial results. I briefly want to cover our fourth quarter and 2018 results, balance sheet and improving credit metrics, growth and cash flows from operating activities and dividends, brief comment on sustainability and philanthropy efforts and our updated guidance for 2019.","From a real estate perspective, 2018 was truly an outstanding year with our entire team executing on our strategic goals. Real estate and life science industry fundamentals were strong in 2018, and 2019 will benefit from continued strength of fundamentals. 2018 was a year of record leasing, as you heard from Steve. $4.7 million rentable square feet executed with the highest cash rental rate growth in the past 10 years at 14.1%. Our outlook for 2019 leasing is strong as well. Contractual expirations are very manageable at only 5.2% of total annual rental revenue, and we're projecting 2019 cash rental rate increases in a range from 11% to 14%.","Strong occupancy was supported by our high-quality tenant roster and was up 50 basis points since January 1 to 97.3% at year-end. In 2019, we expect continued growth in occupancy to 98% at the midpoint of the range of our guidance, reflecting continued strong demand from some of the most innovative entities in the world. Our unique and differentiated business strategy focuses on high-quality cash flows from our collaborative life science and technology campuses in key urban innovation clusters. Class A properties in AAA locations generate 77% of our annual rental revenue today. Additionally, we have an industry-leading, high-quality tenant roster with 52% of our annual rental revenue from investment-grade rated or publicly traded large cap companies.","Fundamentals, record leasing, strong occupancy, collaborative campuses and Class A properties, our favorable lease structure with, one, annual rent escalations and, two, operating expense and CapEx recoveries and our high-quality tenant roster collectively contribute to our consistently strong same property performance. We've reported strong same property growth and NOI at 3.7% and 9.2% on a cash basis for 2018 and both exceeded our strong 10-year average performance. Our outlook for 2019 reflects continued strength with cash same-property NOI growth in the range of 6% to 8%. Adjusted EBITDA margins were strong at 69% and represents another top statistic in the REIT industry.","Operating expenses were up 17% during 2018 and includes the increase of 7.5% within the same property portfolio. This increase in same-property operating expenses was really higher in 2018 than a typical annual increase in OpEx in any given year was really driven to increases in property taxes related to recently completed construction and annual reassessments in certain markets. Keep in mind that our favorable lease structure includes the triple net provision in 97% of our leases and result in a recovery of operating expenses from our tenants. Our team's strong leasing philosophy in 2018 also included outstanding execution of lease-up of value creation projects. We executed 1.7 million rentable square feet of leases related to development and redevelopment of Class A properties, 90% of which related to 2019 deliveries. These leases provide significant initial contractual annual rents, aggregating $96 million and contain annual escalations to drive continued growth and cash rents.","Our venture investment and support company is focused on transforming the lives of people throughout the world. Since the beginning of 2018, new GAAP rules require that we recognize changes in the fair value of certain investments in earnings. As of December 31, our cost basis was $652 million or 4.5% of total assets, and we had unrealized gains of $240 million. Our net loss for the fourth quarter of $0.30 per share and earnings per share of $3.52 for the full year of '18 included unrealized losses of $83.5 million and unrealized gains of $136.8 million, respectively, due to changes in the fair value of certain nonreal estate investments.","Now turning to balance sheet and our improving credit metrics. We closed out 2018 with the strongest balance sheet in the history of the company in both -- in 2018 both Moody's and S&P highlighted improvement in our credit profile with Moody's increasing their rating to Baa1 stable and S&P increasing their outlook to BBB positive, really ranking ARE's ratings near the top of the office sector today. Our balance sheet leverage was solid at 5.4x based upon net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, and we remain very committed to strong and improving credit metrics. Briefly on cash flows and common stock dividend. We have a very high-quality growth in cash flows from operating activities after dividends and also hit an all-time high in 2018 at over $150 million, really due to strong execution of internal and external growth initiatives.","During the year, our Board of Directors approved two increases in our quarterly common stock dividends, resulting in an 8.1% growth in full year 2018 dividends over 2017. Our Board's policy continues to reflect our strategy of sharing growth in cash flows with our common stockholders, while retaining significant capital for reinvestment into new Class A properties. Briefly on sustainability and philanthropy efforts. We're clearly focused on creating sustainable and vibrant environments to support the development of breakthrough therapies and technologies to help cure disease, enhance nutrition and improve the way we live and work. We also focus on having a very positive and meaningful impact on the health, safety and well-being of our tenants, employees and communities in which we work and live.","We're very proud of our Green Star designation from GRESB and our team's pursuit of important 2025 goals to reduce the impact we have on the environment. 2018 was also a great year for our team's philanthropy and volunteerism efforts. Our team volunteered over 2,600 hours at more than 250 nonprofit organizations and provided mission-critical support to organizations, doing impactful work in the areas of medical research, STEM education, military support services and local communities.","Closing here on guidance. We updated our guidance for 2019 that was initially provided on November 28 at our annual Investor Day event. Our team's usual review of construction projects over the last 60 days identified opportunities to reduce projected construction in 2019 without -- or with no changes to projected delivery dates in 2019. Our updated guidance for 2019 assumes $100 million less in construction, representing a 7% reduction in overall spend. About half of this or 3.5% of our overall budget was reduced as a result of identifying usual conservative assumptions in our annual estimates. The other half of the reduction or another 3.5% of our budget was due to certain aspects of a particular construction project that were no longer a component of the final project. The key point here is that cost reductions did not impact the timing of project deliveries for 2019. The reduction in spend also resulted in reduction in our forecasted common equity needs by $100 million and a reduction of capitalization of interest, which is really a reduction of construction spend for the year.","I should also point out that capitalization of interest in the fourth quarter of '18 peaked at $19.9 million, up $2.5 million over the third quarter due to the buildup of CIP for the significant delivery of almost 650,000 rentable square feet of new Class A properties from our development and redevelopment activities really in the fourth quarter and into January of 2019. These deliveries will result in a reduction of capitalization of interest as we look into the first quarter of '19 in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2018. Our 2019 guidance for EPS was updated to a range from $1.95 to $2.15, and there was no change in the strong outlook of our 2019 FFO per share as adjusted at the midpoint of $6.95.","In closing, we truly had an outstanding year in 2018, and our team is off to a great start into 2019.","Let me turn it back over to Joel.","Joel Marcus","So operator, if we could go to Q&A, kindly?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Jamie Feldman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","James Feldman","I was hoping you could talk more about the pre-lease percentage of the 2020 development delivery pipeline? Can you provide more color on that?","Stephen Richardson","Jamie, it's Steve here. Yes, sure. As we look at the 2020 deliveries, we've got 5 different buildings that total about 560,000 square feet. In those projects right now, we're 81% leased, another 2% negotiating, so very substantially resolved in the 83% range there. We do have a number of other projects totaling about 1.3 million square feet slated for deliveries later in 2020. We're in active discussions with groups at a number of those projects, and we look forward to updating everybody as the year progresses.","Dean Shigenaga","And Jamie, if I could add, I would just remind you in my prepared comments that during the year of 2018, we executed 1.7 million rentable square feet related to the value creation pipeline. 90% of that related to deliveries that are occurring in 2019. So our team is hitting on all cylinders on lease-up of the value creation pipeline, and we're working hard to really get the remainder of the pipeline addressed, but we're excited about what we have already resolved.","James Feldman","Okay. Did I miss it somewhere that you actually say, which five are the leased?","Stephen Richardson","We haven't broken those out yet, Jamie. We'll be doing that in the future.","James Feldman","Can you say, which ones are leased?","Stephen Richardson","Yes. We've got couple down in San Diego and then the two projects at Medical Center Drive in Maryland.","James Feldman","Those are leased?","Stephen Richardson","Yes.","James Feldman","Okay. All right. And then, Dean, so your comment on the $100 million of less spend, does that -- is that getting pushed out into '20 or how do we think about it? Or is it just shrinking the total pipeline?","Dean Shigenaga","It is not pushing out much of the spend into '20. Most of it related to conservative two buckets, Jamie. One bucket was conservative assumptions that we were able to address over the last 2 months, which is pretty typical in a given year to be able to knock out 3%, 4%, 5% of the budget just by carefully challenging the forecasting. And then, we had 1 unique project that had a little bit of an element in it that as we looked harder at it, it wasn't something that we could accomplish in the final design and -- or ended up being a reduction to the overall cost of that project. So neither of them, Jamie, had anything to do with pushing the cost out to '20 or any delays on any of the projects.","James Feldman","Okay. And then, finally, I mean, as you think about the potential of doing more JV sales based on the great pricing in Cambridge, I mean, is there a scenario where you actually don't need any more common equity this year?","Dean Shigenaga","We have a modest number that remains, Jamie. I would say that dispositions are always a key component of our capital plan. We also have pretty unique opportunities to invest capital at great returns. So I don't know that it will fully eliminate it, but it's an important component.","Operator","The next question comes from Manny Korchman of Citi.","Emmanuel Korchman","Your markets have certainly had some massive rent growth, which is from -- given sort of those very low vacancy rates you discussed. Is there an elasticity curve to rent? Or could you push rent harder? And if so, why aren't we seeing even bigger mark-to-market or rent markups on rollovers?","Stephen Richardson","Manny, it's Steve here. Look, there's always a balance and I think we've been pretty consistent with that. These are repeat clients, multi-market clients. I think you've seen very significant statistics. With the outset, we referenced the highest cash increase this past year. So I don't think we've been shy at all about pushing rents. So we continue to engage on a long-term basis with these tenants, and I think we are hitting the mark and capturing the full value there. So stay tuned as the development pipeline continues to get leased up.","Peter Moglia","Manny, it's Peter Moglia. I also would like to remind everybody that one of the things that we really do well is incorporate annual increases into our leases and add a 3% per year clip by the time those leases roll, and we're still making some pretty great cash and GAAP increases over and above what happened during the lease, certainly, I think, speaks to our great execution on the leasing side.","Emmanuel Korchman","And maybe on a similar topic. Again, given those low vacancy rates, what's the re-lease-up for those multiples of demand that want to be in this market and just can't find the space?","Peter Moglia","Our 2019 and 2020 deliveries, to start.","Stephen Richardson","Yes. And to add to that, Manny, I think you see the early renewals and that one of the all-time highs at 71%. Clearly, the sense of urgency there, locking down space, figuring out how to expand when it's a high-class problem, but that is a challenge we have in a number of our markets.","Emmanuel Korchman","And one final one for Peter, if I could. Just what are your criteria when thinking about these JVs? So maybe more specifically, why was it 75\/125 that got JV-ed rather than one of your other Cambridge properties? And then as you look at expanding either the JV or the sales program, how do you think about what you're JV-ing?","Peter Moglia","I'm sorry. What's the last part of that? How do I think about what?","Emmanuel Korchman","Peter, just how do you think about what goes into a JV versus something you want to own -- wholly own going forward?","Peter Moglia","Yes, I think one of the key elements is, have we provided as much value as we possibly can up to this time? And is the ability to create more value later on? In the case of 75\/125 Binney, it's fully leased to great tenancy, but it goes for another, I believe, 12 years before you can actually get to the mark-to-market. So our partner is patient capital, and it will do well in 12 years when that lease rolls, but it's a great opportunity for us to monetize that and then put that money to work into our highly leased -- highly returned pipeline. So that is one of the things we certainly look at. And then as far as JV partners go, we've definitely looked for those that are -- understand our business and are easy to work with and trust in our judgment and our brand to deliver great results. And this particular partner recognize that, and I wouldn't be surprised if we do more business with them down the road.","Operator","The next question comes from Sheila McGrath of Evercore.","Sheila McGrath","Yes. I wanted to ask Peter a few more questions on the JV. Did you speak to one partner exclusively? Or were there many potential partners discussed? And what was the level of interest? And if you could just give us a little insight on where the rents in that asset mark versus current market rent?","Peter Moglia","Okay, the first one, the current rents, I believe, are in the mid-70s and the market rent there is conservatively in the low to mid-80s. So that -- the answer is that piece. As far as marketing, we had a strategy to message to investors that we wanted to work with because that is a very important thing as far as who we partner with. It's not all about the cost or the purchase price. It has a lot to do with the culture of who we're dealing with because we want to make sure we're very aligned. So we had a small, targeted audience that we approached. We had a valuation in mind that was very close to what we ended up with, and our buyers stepped up early and we were able to get it done. There were a number of other people contacted before we settled on the final choice, and we did receive an enormous amount of interest given that this product was in Cambridge and that there are a number of parties out there that want to JV with Alexandria and get into this life science real estate niche.","Sheila McGrath","Okay. that's helpful. Do you think that the people that you're in discussion with are starting to give the life science the lease structure and EBITDA margins more -- any consideration versus more traditional office?","Peter Moglia","I think that people definitely recognize on the CapEx side that we're very efficient in our operation versus office. I think they also look at our tenant roster and understand that they're not only investing in great real estate but they're getting credit behind it relative to office. So I think that's really what's driving it. Plus the industry is one of the driving forces of the economics of the United States. It's an industry that's very difficult to take offshore due to intellectual property issues. And obviously, it's a well-paying industry and our tenant base is very -- has very large balance sheets and is constantly looking to expand its pipeline for the future, and they have been looking to us to be a provider of that space.","Sheila McGrath","Okay, great, and just one more. You've allocated more capital to the Stanford kind of cluster via acquisitions. Can you just talk about that market and your vision there? Is demand kind of equally driven by tech and life science in that cluster?","Stephen Richardson","Sheila, it's Steve here. Having been in that market for 35 years, it was historically very well balanced between life science and technology. I mean, you had some very strong brand names down there with -- Merck historically has been a tenant in Stanford Research Park, Syntex, Alza and others. And what we've seen over time is tech has become larger and larger with Google, in particular, Facebook, even Apple begin crowding out to life science industry there. There is still strong demand for serial entrepreneurs, the venture capital on Sand Hill Road for people to be in that Greater Stanford cluster. So as we look at this very strategically, certainly with the acquisition in the Research Park, building out as we will the first new Class A lab facilities in San Carlos in over 20, 25 years, we think this is critically important to the industry and we've heard that directly from clients that we've worked with for a long, long time.","Operator","The next question comes from Tom Catherwood of BTIG.","William Catherwood","So we've seen a good deal of M&A activity in the life science sector. Obviously, some impacts your tenants, Bristol-Myers and Celgene and Takeda. How do -- kind of multi-part question here, but, a, how do you evaluate your exposure to any one tenant when these large companies are merging? And then the second part of it is, when companies merge, what has -- historically, what has been the impact on the real estate needs? And has it depended if it's a large-cap pharma or small-cap biotech? What's kind of been the impact on the need?","Joel Marcus","Yes. So Tom, this is Joel. So I think if you look at Page 26 of the supp, as we kind of think about -- we have really an all-star, highly diversified cast of top 20 tenants that make up more -- almost 45% of the rent. We always think about not trying to be overly concentrated. And I think if you look at the numbers, the percentage of aggregate rental revenues, we really don't have great exposure to any single company in a way that we think would be catastrophic or highly damaging to the company from Takeda at #1 at 3.6% down to FibroGen, which has a potential blockbuster product to oral erythropoietin to replace the injectable, at 1.4%. So I think we're pretty mindful of that. I think when you think about the Celgene\/Bristol-Myers -- Bristol-Myers' acquisition of Celgene, so you have our #7 acquiring our #5, but I think one thing to keep in mind is Bristol is leading some facilities in Seattle that we've re-leased at the Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center. And we believe on Celgene, as we luckily don't have any of Celgene's home campus in Summit, New Jersey, which I think where most of the cost synergies will come out of, but they have two important locations -- several with us but two of the most important are Juno in Seattle and the...","Stephen Richardson","Receptos.","Joel Marcus","Receptos, yes, in San Diego. Both of those, we believe, have mission-critical therapies that are critical to the acquisition and the value of the acquisition. So I think we feel pretty good overall about that combination.","William Catherwood","Got you. And then in general, in the past, in your experience, do kind of waves of mergers cause a large footprint reduction? Or does it totally depend on kind of the mission of the companies and what their drug pipeline looks like?","Joel Marcus","Yes, I think where you have large companies merging to large companies, I think you have a lot of cost synergies that shake out and you have a lot of home campuses, many of those are owned by the pharma companies themselves where things get reduced in size. But I think where you have pharma buying biotech, it isn't always true but I think more than -- more likely than not, those acquisitions are for the pipeline and the talent that you have. There are occasions where select biotechs are bought that have a single product opportunity, and those are pretty easy to spot. So when we lease to tenants, there are no tenants in our top 20 that have -- that are single product, onetime shots on goal. So we're really careful in our underwriting about that. That would be a bad outcome.","William Catherwood","Got it, got it. And then a quick question for Peter. You mentioned that the Maryland market continues to gain momentum as well as the lease-up then an RTP driving the start of the next development down there. Is this the case in those two markets where demand is relatively onetime in nature, as in the growth is related to a specific resource topic or 1 specific funding source? Or are those markets developing more sustainable ecosystems similar to your larger clusters?","Joel Marcus","Yes. So maybe let me talk -- I'll ask Peter to talk about real estate, but for a second, in Maryland, I think you have a resurgence over the last couple of years of tremendous amounts of dollars that have come into the National Institutes of Health. And overall, the government funding of biomedical research in that area has been stronger. You've also seen -- as Peter and Steve said, you've got certain new gene therapy or cell therapy companies that have emerged. There's a stronger base of venture capital in the areas located there and they raised funds that are in the $2 billion to $3 billion range. So that ecosystem actually has come back from a very nascent system. It was super vibrant in the early 2000s with the genetic revolution and sequencing, but then it kind of fell into a long kind of tenure, kind of non-growth situation but it's really coming out and we expect it to be not a onetime shot. North Carolina, I think what we've done is we've tried to move to where we think -- and we'll have a lot more to talk about this on the first quarter call, where we think the intersection of human health is both in fighting disease and then enhancing nutrition. And so we've made a stake in the ground and really created the first ever in the U.S. that we know of -- that we know about multi-tenant ag tech campus, and that's the one that I think Steve referred to that we've got about 100% lease or committed. Peter, you might comment.","Peter Moglia","Yes, I mean, I'll echo the comments on RTP. We certainly saw a trend few years ago of North Carolina being an optimal place for ag tech research, and we started making incremental investments over time. And as Joel said, we'll provide some more detail on that next quarter. In Maryland, I wanted to say that -- I think one of the things we're really happy about is that it used to be very dependent on government funding, and so you could basically chart the market based on the NIH budget. And of course, around 2008, 2009, we started to see that dip, and of course, the Maryland market went down. What has happened over the last few years is that we're seeing a lot of commercial companies coming into the areas because they want to be adjacent to the NIH and other institute -- government institutions because they're having the government cosponsor different programs. Kite, for example, has moved there because they're working with the NIH and the National Cancer Institute on projects, and then we saw a follow-up with Autolus, one of the tenants that is anchoring our new development at 9950 Medical Center. They're also a CAR-T company.","So that diversity is going to really dissipate the reliance on government, and that was really a key for us to gain the confidence to start investing more in there. And it's paid off because demand has just really been strong, and any thing that has come available has re-leased fairly quickly. And of course, now we've announced to build to suit, which will be the first new product developed in Maryland in well over a decade. So there's been a constrained supply for good reasons because there was very little growth over the last decade but that is now turning. And because we're well positioned with landholdings and redevelopment opportunities, we're able to capitalize on it and we're hoping that there'll be more good news in the future.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Carroll","Can you provide some color on the major near-term development starts the company is pursuing today? I know the North Tower is on that list, but are there any other major projects that we should be looking out for here over the next few quarters?","Stephen Richardson","Michael, it's Steve Richardson. Sure, I think as we've listed in the supplemental there, we've got a project in South San Francisco on Haskins Way. So we're beginning to do the predevelopment work and horizontal infrastructure. As I had talked about earlier down in the Greater Stanford cluster, the 825, 835 Industrial Road project as well, we're doing predevelopment work there down in San Diego at 3115 Merryfield, again, predevelopment work there; 1165 Eastlake. And these are all in markets where we don't have significant availabilities, and these are the result of ongoing conversations that we have with our client tenant base. So I just want to be clear on how these decisions are being made and how we're informing our plans to move forward, and I think 1165 Eastlake is a perfect case in point. The 1818 project has done extremely well. And then finally, down in North Carolina, as Joel and Peter were just commenting, the great success at 5 Lab Drive is leading us to start doing predevelopment work, getting 9 Lab Drive. And then 6 Davis Drive is also getting build-to-suit interest, very early discussions down there. So that kind of rounds out the 2020 deliveries, as we've been detailing them in the supplemental.","Michael Carroll","So when you think about breaking ground on these projects too, do you need to have some type of pre-lease percentage to break ground? Are you just happy if there's interest and there's no availability and you think that's going to be leased up over the two years it takes to complete and stabilize?","Stephen Richardson","Yes, I think what we've done historically, Michael, is we've looked at the predevelopment work and the horizontal work as necessary from a speed-to-market perspective, but then we monitor these very closely before we actually make the big capital investment and going vertically. And at that point, that's when we really look at having some type of kickoff tenant or anchor tenant in these projects. And as I detailed in my prepared remarks, 4 million square feet at the time of kickoff were fully leased at 100%, and the other 3.1 million square feet were roughly 1\/3 leased, so very significant and on both accounts, whether we were multi-tenant or single tenant.","Michael Carroll","Great. And then Steve, I know you mentioned in your prepared remarks the increased competition that you're seeing in South San Francisco. I mean, how do you think about that market today? And is that something that you still want to heavily invest in given the planned projects that are on top over the next few years?","Stephen Richardson","Yes, maybe stepping back at the Bay Area, we just had a strategic planning meeting, and I think what was highlighted is we are very, very well balanced in kind of the 4 key clusters, the SoMa market, the Mission Bay market, South San Francisco and Greater Stanford market, so not really overweight in any one market. We've been 100% leased in the region now for a number of years. South San Francisco continues to be a critically important market to us, and we think the Haskins project will provide a great platform for a number of different types of companies. Peter had highlighted it, 681 Gateway. We fully resolved that in very short order. We just started the redevelopment activities there. We're already 100% leased. So we monitor the competition very closely. I think we're significantly differentiated on a number of fronts, and we think our tenants respond to that very favorably as well.","Operator","The next question comes from Daniel Ismail of Green Street Advisors.","Daniel Ismail","Maybe to follow on that question, are you noticing any other pockets of new supply in any of your markets that is a cause for concern?","Stephen Richardson","Daniel, it's Steve again. No, not in particular. Again, Seattle's very tight. I would say Cambridge is severely constrained. We've talked about the Bay Area, really no significant ground-up development projects down in San Diego. So really, South San Francisco is the only sub-cluster that we're monitoring.","Daniel Ismail","Okay. And maybe just a bigger picture question for Joel. So prescription drug pricing is likely to come up in tonight's State of the Union address. Are there any expectations for drug price regulation in the next 12 to 18 months? And the -- and is there any potential impact on the pricing power for your tenants?","Joel Marcus","Well, I guess I'd say one thing. Could you imagine Congress agreeing on anything? But we did actually meet with Medicare recently and had some very good discussions with them. The President's desire is to try to eliminate the rebates and the middlemen fees, which make up -- so if you're an ethical drug company selling branded products, about 40% of the price of that goes off to third parties. And then in the discussion we had in Washington, it's clear that there are a lot of end user vendors, not the patient but the vendors who dispense these. So there are hospitals and other third parties that then mark the drugs up, some as much as 10x. And when it's buried, if you go in for surgery and it's $100,000 -- actually, I just had this happen personally to a family member, and they get a bill back that shows everything's paid for by insurance or reimbursed by insurance except drugs and the drug is $1,000 or $2,000. Oftentimes, that's marked up 2, 3, many times by the group that's dispensing it. So there's a real effort to go after the probably unreasonable markups and the middlemen who are taking 40% off of the list price before it ever gets to the consumer. Those are the two big areas that I think people are focused on but it's pretty clear. Remember, go back to basics.","Drugs only make up about 10% to 15% of overall health care cost, and 90% of all drugs that are sold are generic. So there's a lot of fire and talk about drug prices, but it doesn't fall wholly on the manufacture standpoint. I think what you may see is Medicare forcing out that middlemen rebate pricing whether that can be extended to a private pay. Remember, in U.S. insurance or U.S. health care, about 2\/3 are covered privately; about 1\/3 is covered through Medicare and government plans; and then there's about 8% to 10% which still are uncovered. So if Congress is going to act, they have to act on the 2\/3 and it would take both parties and I don't think that's going to happen, but it would go after the middlemen pricing and the unreasonable markups of the dispensary element of the system, if that's helpful.","Daniel Ismail","No, that's helpful. Maybe just a last one for Dean. On the sources of equity in 2019, should we be expecting that to be done in the form of a forward equity raise or of ATM throughout the year?","Dean Shigenaga","Manny, I think all of our -- whether it's debt or equity capital and dispositions for that matter...","Joel Marcus","Daniel.","Dean Shigenaga","I'm sorry, Dan, really dependent on market conditions. And when we hit that point in time or assess those, the environment, and execute, the capital needs on the equity front are fairly modest this year given the disposition program we have in place. So either option is available to us when we're ready for it.","Operator","And we have a follow-up from Manny Korchman of Citi.","Michael Bilerman","It's Michael Bilerman. Maybe Dean or Steve or Peter, whoever wants to take this, but just sort of following whole sort of capital discussion. And I recognize that if you're trading at a big premium to NAV, issuing equities at great use of capital, but when I think back to last 3 years, one of the things that you guys did was over-equitize a lot of your external growth via -- whether it was acquisitions or redevelopment or new development opportunities in order to delever the balance sheet, but the balance sheet now in the best position, better it ever has been, which is a great thing. But you think about the equity size of the company, and the company has gone from about 70 million shares outstanding to over -- well over 100 million shares outstanding. So the equity base has grown pretty dramatically. As you think about the capital commitments that are going to be coming down the road in 2020, 2021, 2022, just given the vast amount of opportunities that you already have within the company, do you think about more of a merchant build to take advantage of the significant value creation that you have in the development pipeline and maybe pre-selling more assets, like you just did at 75\/125 Binney, to raise that capital today when the market is hot and when you've put these commitments out there where you are getting great returns on the development?","Dean Shigenaga","Michael, good comments all around. You're right that we did raise more equity over the last few years to drive down improvement and leverage in our credit profile. 70 million to 100 million shares directionally sounds correct, but keep in mind we also grew bottom line FFO per share 60% if you include our growth through the end of 2019 here, so outstanding, top of the market REIT sector growth. I think the key to continuing to drive results as strong as that is to be disciplined with our value creation pipeline, both development, redevelopment and being disciplined on funding, which we will continue to do and utilize sources that makes sense. Over the years, I'd say 10-plus years, we've always thought about different alternatives, including what you just mentioned but we haven't pulled the trigger on it as far as some fund-type approach because it didn't just make sense for the business. So we do evaluate alternatives as the short answer your question, Michael, and we'll continue to be very prudent in how we execute the business.","Michael Bilerman","And I don't know necessarily they have to be a merchant bill fund or have a fund, but it just sounds like there is substantial institutional interest in your asset class, as evidenced by the sales that you've done and other sales in the marketplace that try to harvest some of that value today when you know that your commitment is going out or there could be a good arbitrage knowing it would be short-term dilutive but long-term NAV-accretive in doing that.","Dean Shigenaga","Yes, it's interesting as we step back over the last -- looking at this question today but we've thought differently about it, a variety of scenarios to fund the business over the last 1.5 decades, Michael, and we'll continue to brainstorm about different alternatives. But I think, again, the key here is to be focused and balanced on how we grow the business and how we fund it, and so we'll continue to brainstorm on the best solutions. And if something changes, we'll share it with the investor community as it develops.","Joel Marcus","Yes, on a number of assets, I think, Michael, we clearly would not joint venture, things like our center in New York or a number of assets in Cambridge. But the 75\/125, for the reasons Peter articulated, turned out to be a great opportunity both time, value and it's on the -- actually the same side of the street that 225 Binney is that we joint-ventured back a couple of years ago. So it's on the north side. It also is going through an interesting transition in tenant base. And as Peter said, we had wrung all the value out of it that we could be. We remember the times when we we're dealing with ARIAD. So that building has a long history, as you know well. So we're pretty careful about what we do, but I think Peter's deep expertise in this area and, I think, world-class relationship together with Tom and those on the ground in Cambridge, I think, give us a real set of opportunities to selectively mix a variety of forms of equity for our future growth. And also, on the future growth, we don't know what's going to happen come 2021, 2020 even. So we're pretty careful about the growth in the future.","Michael Bilerman","Right. Joel, have you -- I can't be the only one that's receiving emails from bio REIT [indiscernible] at yandex.com. Can you comment a little bit about what's happening with your eldest son and the lawsuits going back and forth regarding him starting a -- ran a labs thing in Europe and countersuing for the use of your logo and name and where this is headed?","Joel Marcus","Yes. So I think if you go back to what I said at the beginning, think of Alexandria as a company that has been around for 25 years. I think this year is actually our 25th anniversary. We've built a very special business. We were the first ones to really identify this business and really build this business. We've developed, I think, a unique business strategy, as I said in my prepared remarks. We've developed, I think, a great financial strategy that's been reflective of the market changes over the years. And I think most importantly, we've built an employee base and a management base that I would say is really second to none, very long-tenured people in all aspects of the company. We've had Jim Collins come in and help our people, and I think it's fair to say that if you look at anyone who is trying to bring any discredit or any cloud to the company, I think you can assume that, that is a meaningless approach. And I think that I'll let Jennifer Banks, who's our General Counsel, comment on the litigation. But I think just remember, you have a highly ethical, highly motivated company here made up of long-tenured people, and I think the kinds of things that are going on are clearly illegal and they're immoral and they will be dealt with in a very severe fashion.","Jennifer Banks","Michael, this is Jennifer Banks. I'm a General Counsel here and so I'll just jump in quickly. I mean, as I'm sure you can imagine, we don't comment on litigation matters. For litigation matters, like all company matters, we'll continue to always make all appropriate and required disclosures, but we don't have comment beyond that.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks.","Joel Marcus","Yes. Thank you, everybody. We appreciate your taking time to listen, appreciate the Q&A, and we look forward to talking to you at the first quarter results end of April or early May, and we'll bring you more detail on the -- on some of the ag tech strategies that we have in mind and appreciate it very much.

The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","I now would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus. Please go ahead, Joel.","Joel Marcus","Thanks, Paula, and welcome everybody to our third quarter call. With me today are Dean Shigenaga; Steve Richardson; Peter Moglia; Dan Ryan; and Tom Andrews.","The Harvard Business Review, September\/October 2017, had a really great quote that seems to exemplify this quarter's performance and it is neither great leadership nor brilliant strategy matters without operational excellence. And so to the women and men of the Alexandria family, thanks to each and every one of you from the bottom of my heart for a truly great third quarter 2017, a truly operational excellence.","Some of the notable accomplishments this quarter, we're pleased that the Green Star designation by GRESB was granted to Alexandria. It's actually quite hard to achieve for laboratory property type that operates 24\/7 as opposed to traditional office. And we were given the number one in the United States for health and wellbeing module, a very great kudos to our team in that regard. We're also very proud of our total return to date from IPO through the third quarter of 1211% compared to the RMS of 546% and the S&P 500 at 334%.","Common stock dividend is up 8% over last year at this time and the balance sheet as Dean will talk about is in the best shape ever in the history of the company. Revenues for the third quarter and year to date were up about 23%. 50% of our annual revenue is from investment grade tenants, really an industry-leading standard, not standard, but industry-leading stat.","Our average lease duration is about 9.4 years, coming from the top 20 tenants which are about 45% of our annual revenue. We made significant progress in bringing down our preferred stock outstanding to now less than about $75 million in the aggregate and we're working hard to achieve over time an upgrade in our investment grade rating. Importantly, our margins were up 200 basis points to 71% from a year ago at this time, Cash same store NOI at 7.8% and leasing spreads per renewal is up 24% GAAP, 10% cash, strong contributions from both San Francisco and Greater Boston.","We see we have continuing and consistent strong demand in our key life science markets. On the industry side, the NASDAQ biotech index is up about 18.5% this year. On the NIH funding at about $34 billion is very strong and the Senate currently has a bill to increase that next fiscal year up to $36.1 billion, and the House has a bill, $35.2 billion, so we feel we're in very good shape. The FDA has a new really superb commissioner, Scott Gottlieb, who we hosted about two weeks ago. He's breaking old barriers, less time for approvals, and trying to decrease the cost of clinical trials. All of which will be very, very important for not only the industry, but patients.","This year approvals to date 35 and we're on track potential to receive 40 drug approvals. About 46% are Alexandria tenants. Biomedical research this year will contribute on the philanthropy side, about $33 billion to overall funding which is a historic high. And venture capital funding this quarter were almost at $6 billion, the highest quarterly investment ever and on track to break $15 billion for the year for life science venture capital.","Worldwide total biopharma R&D is about $160 billion, and according to most IMS stats, to increase about 2.5% per year through 2022, which is a good sign. And also for the first time, U.S. scientists working in a lab had edited disease causing gene mutation out of a human embryo, a real amazing breakthrough and promises to really revolutionize disease treatment. As you recall, for much we said before, there are about 10,000 diseases known to mankind and only about 500 have been addressed medically. So we're at a 5% level really in the early innings.","On health insurance, keep the following in mind. About 67.5% are private insurance provided by employer or purchased directly by the consumer, 37.3% are government coverage and about 8.8% are uninsured. That's the playing field for 2016.","On external growth, we're on track to deliver this quarter: 510 Townsend to Stripe, whose recent valuation is about $9 billion; 505 Brannan to Pinterest, whose recent valuation is about $12 billion; ARE Spectrum in San Diego to Vertex, one of the best NASDAQ performers of the year, market cap today is about $36 billion; and the balance, 400 Dexter, we hope to conclude soon to Juno Therapeutics, whose recent valuation is about $5 billion.","On Page 36 of the supplemental, the projects we're delivering in 2018, 2019 are going well. 399 Binney, we're actually almost fully spoken for. 266 and 275 Second Avenue, pretty much fully leased, it was a tenant driven acquisition. Our Mission Bay towers for Uber, 100% leased there. Our 213 East Grand Avenue project, 100% leased to Merck.","Our 279 East Grand Avenue in San Francisco, we're about 50% in negotiations with current tenant. 681 Gateway, which we look forward to getting back next year in South San Francisco to move from office to laboratory in a pretty hot market, so we're very much forward - looking forward to redeveloping that and re-leasing it.","Our project at 9625 Town Centre Drive, 100% leased at Takeda. Our project at 1818 Fairview, before we go vertical, we're hoping to land an important tenant. Our 9900 Medical Centre Drive, a situation that we're trying to expand our core campus in the Rockville\/Maryland location. And 5 Triangle Drive, we're about 40% in negotiations with a range of important tenant, so things are actually moving very, very well.","On the acquisition side, we completed three acquisitions of note, one in Route 128 I just referred to, does specifically meet a tenant requirement. The acquisition in South San Francisco as well to specifically meet a tenant requirement, and Rockville acquisition do expand our key campus in Rockville. We will continue to make strategic acquisitions as appropriate, as we move forward through the fourth quarter and in the 2018.","And let me turn it over to Dean.","Dean Shigenaga","Thanks, Joel. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased with our continued strong execution by our team, again, quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. And remain on track to deliver 9.3% growth in FFO per share as adjusted for 2017.","We are in an excellent position today in five key areas: First, continued solid internal growth; second, continued solid and disciplined external growth; third, solid real estate and life science industry fundamentals; fourth, solid execution supported by a strong balance sheet; and fifth, an exceptional team led by highly experienced group of senior leaders that continue to execute and deliver exceptional results.","We've continued solid internal growth driven by the quality of our buildings, locations and strength of the real estate and life science industry fundamentals. In the third quarter, leasing volume was solid at 787,000 rentable square feet, in light of minimal contractual lease expirations. Rental rate growth was strong, and up 24.2% and 10% on a cash basis. The strong rental rate growth on leasing activity in the quarter will have limited benefit in the fourth quarter since most of the rental rate increases will commence in 2018.","Year-to-date, we executed 3.2 million rentable square feet of leasing, this activity included 1.9 million square feet of lease renewals and re-leasing of space, 61% of which was represented by early lease renewals related to contractual lease expirations in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Fundamentals in our submarkets remain very solid and continue to drive solid growth in net effective rents.","Leasing commissions and tenant improvements on lease renewals and re-leasing of space have remained minimal in 2017 as well as the prior year in 2016, and overall have remained very consistent year-to-year. Importantly, the growth in net effective rents in 2017 over 2016 reflects the growth in rental rates and it's not impacted by concessions. Same property NOI performance continues to generate consistently solid growth. Third quarter same property NOI growth was up 2.2% and 7.8% on a cash basis. Quarterly same property results may range a bit from time-to-time as compared to the results for a 12 month period.","Year-to-date 2017 same property NOI growth was 2.3% and 6.2% on a cash basis. And we're on track to meet our guidance of up 2% to 4%, and up 5.5% to 7.5% on a cash basis for 2017. Key drivers of our solid and high-quality same property cash NOI growth include contractual rent escalations in 95% of our leases, averaging about 3%. High quality and stable cash flows from a REIT industry-leading tenant roster with 50% of our annual rental revenue from investment-grade tenants.","And lastly, strong real estate and life science industry fundamentals driving continued rental rate growth on leasing activity.","EBITDA margins are very solid at 68% and reflect improvement over many quarters, primarily due to the growth in the scale of our business and improvement in the quality of our asset base with recently completed development of Class A properties.","We remain on track to hit our goals with our development and redevelopment projects in 2017. We are also on track with $91 million of our target $100 million of incremental net operating income commencing in 2017, with the remaining $8 million commencing in the first quarter of 2018 related to four recently executed leases, aggregating about 91,000 square feet at 100 Binney Street.","Briefly on 100 Binney Street, 79% of that project was placed in service in late September. The returns are very strong and are up from our initial forecast. We're now expecting an initial stabilized cash yield of 7.4%, highlighting the significant value our team has generated from this Class A facility leased to some of the most innovative entities in the world.","Improvement in yields were driven by both better-than-forecasted rental rates and a significant reduction in cost at completion. 75% of the cost reductions were driven by changes in the final design and use, and 25% from solid execution from our team on proactive management of a very high quality and innovative development project.","Our development pipeline and redevelopment projects undergoing construction as of 9\/30 consisted of the following. 1.5 million rentable square feet is highly leased at 81% and represents about 1.2 billion at completion, which includes about $540 million of cost to complete. We've got very solid initial cash yields averaging approximately 7% on our total investment and these amounts include 651,000 square feet that is 97% leased and on track for delivery in the fourth quarter.","Our team is also working diligently on leasing, marketing and preconstruction on another 1.3 million square feet spread across four development projects and one future redevelopment project. We have not yet commenced aboveground construction on these projects that are on average 45% committed and are expected to generate very solid initial cash yields of approximately 7%.","Turning briefly to net asset value. Certain of our development and redevelopment projects that were recently placed in the service have contractual rents aggregating $70 million that have not yet commenced. $60 million will commence through the next five quarters through third quarter of 2018 as follows about $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and then $23 million, $14 million, and $13 million in the first, second and third quarter of 2018.","Free rent periods on our pipeline of projects delivered in the third quarter and projects currently under construction generally range from three to six months with a few exceptions. Importantly, contractual cash rents will commence fairly quickly after these projects are placed into service.","Our balance sheet is in an excellent position today, we remain on track to achieve our leverage goals of 5.3 times to 5.8 times, both on net debt and a net debt plus preferred to adjusted EBITDA. Our fixed-charge coverage ratio was also very strong and north of 4 times, and liquidity is very significant at $1.7 billion. We continue to focus on improvement in our long-term cost to capital and maintaining significant liquidity for flexibility to execute our strategic goals.","In 2016 and year-to-date 2017, we redeemed or repurchased 293 million of preferred stock at weighted average annual dividend on those securities at about 6.7%. The retirement of preferred stock was part of our overall strategy to improve our capital structure and our balance sheet leverage. However, I should also mention that we believe, it's appropriate to utilize preferred stock as a source of capital. But for the moment, it was important to retire these securities.","During the third quarter, we issued 2.1 million shares through our aftermarket common stock offering program at about $120 per share. This efficient capital will be utilized to fund significant value creation opportunities through the development of new Class A buildings.","Additionally, we also will settle our outstanding forward equity sale agreements that represent about 4.8 million shares, and we'll settle that in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, our usual detailed assumptions included in our guidance for 2017 is disclosed on Page 5 of our supplemental package. We narrowed our range of guidance for FFO per share is adjusted to a range of $6.01 to $6.03 with no change in the midpoint of $6.02.","Briefly let me point out couple of comments for certain models out there, common shares outstanding as of 9\/30 was 94.3 million shares. And we have about 4.8 million shares under the forward equity sale agreements that we anticipate settling here in the fourth quarter. And that will be added to the outstanding share count.","Also, G&A expense as a percentage of total assets and total revenues have been improving and was approximately 0.64% and 6.8% respectively. We will provide guidance for 2018 earnings per share and FFO per share, along with detailed underlying assumptions at our annual investor day event on November 29. And therefore, we're unable to comment on details of our 2018 guidance until then. Keep in mind that real estate and life science industry fundamentals remain very solid, providing for a great operating environment going forward.","In closing, we are pleased with the continued strong results. We remain on track with our current pipeline of projects that are highly leased and have a great balance sheet to support our strategic goals and have an excellent team and senior leaders that drive strong execution. With that, I'll turn it back to Joel.","Joel Marcus","Operator, we'll go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will begin the question-and-answer session at this time. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Sheila McGrath","Yes, good afternoon. Joel, I was wondering if you could give us some insight on the revisions upward on the leasing spreads, how much of that was driven by tenants wanting to renew earlier than expiration? And do you see this trend continuing?","Joel Marcus","Yeah, let me have Dean comment on that, Sheila.","Dean Shigenaga","Hey, Sheila, it's Dean here. Yes, the key drivers of the growth in leasing or rental rate growth in the current quarter was driven primarily by early lease renewals. Like I said in prior quarters, it's pretty difficult to project early leasing activity on renewals. It's really contingent on the tenants' needs. But 61% of our re-leasing activity this year was driven by early renewals that go out over one to three years forward beyond the current year.","Looking forward, I suspect we'll continue to have opportunities. But they're really hard to predict and project at the moment.","Joel Marcus","But I think that underlines a - I think in a number of the key markets the tenants focus on trying to lock down space at current fair market rental rates and not kind of play the lottery for the future. And I think that bodes well for us.","Sheila McGrath","Okay. Great, and then, just as a follow-up, on the - I think this is guidance related for you, Dean. On the 91,000 square feet to be placed in service in first quarter, for 100 Binney, is that part of the driver of the higher capitalized interest in fourth quarter that you cite in kind of the footnote on guidance?","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah, Sheila, so the comment on our guidance page on Page 5, as it relates to being on the upper end of our range guidance for capped interest and on the lower end of the range for interest expense in net, which is the number reported on the income statement. It's actually really related to the acquisition of future value-creation opportunities.","I think the way to think about it Sheila is, as we acquire future value-creation projects, we're required to capitalize interest while we entitle the project. But these projects are actually funded with long-term capital and because by and large there is very little to no income at the moment, we equity fund the acquisitions. So we have growth in capped interest, but no corresponding growth in interest cost.","But the third point I'd probably make is that when you think about FFO per share, it's basically relatively neutral to earnings, because you're getting about a 4% yield from the capped interest on the investment. But you're having to equity fund that long-term for the moment.","Sheila McGrath","Okay. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Thanks, Sheila.","Operator","The next question will be from Manny Korchman with Citi. Please go ahead.","Emmanuel Korchman","Hey, guys, good afternoon. Maybe going back to just tenant growth plans and so the way they're approaching space, given the tight markets you operate in, sort of how are tenants thinking about the space they're going to need? And in those situations where they look around and there is just nothing new coming, how are they solving for that sort of need without having new space to build into?","Joel Marcus","Okay. So maybe let me ask Steve to address that.","Stephen Richardson","Yeah, hi, Manny, it's Steve. Yeah, a good example is the recent renewal and expansion that we had in Mission Bay with an existing tenant. It was in fact an early renewal, but it was also in combination with an expansion. So where we had existing tenants in place adjacent to this one dominant anchor tenant, they've gone ahead and committed at the end of the expiration of the adjacent tenant's terms to go ahead and expand into that space and through the long-term lease. So we're seeing a combination of - as Joel mentioned, locking down space, but then also controlling adjacent space for expansion.","Thomas Andrews","Yeah, Manny, it's Tom. Manny, it's Tom Andrews. I'll expand on that little bit too. I mean, in Cambridge, certainly, it's a very, very tight market. The current lab vacancy in East Cambridge is only about 1.5%. And so consequently, we're seeing tenants and their brokers get out into the market sooner than they normally would to look at their options for space. We're certainly seeing some tenants select different sub-markets, whether they're sub-urban or other urban sub-markets other than East Cambridge, because of the tightness of the market.","And we see some tenants try to figure out growth strategies that involve maybe trying to do some of their work remotely and having multiple locations. Sometimes it's a suburban location and an urban location together. So, tenants are doing different things to try to solve, and we're obviously working closely with our group of tenants and the prospects there in the market to try to help them solve their - for their space needs.","Emmanuel Korchman","Thanks for that. And then, Joel, maybe one for you, just in terms of succession, it's a topic we've spoken about on our prior calls. Can you give us an update on when we might find out more? Is it going to be at the Investor Day or do we need to wait until next year to find out sort of more on that plan?","Joel Marcus","I think I've said, I mean, that's a board ultimately timing decision et cetera and sometime on or before March 31, but you'll see, it will be totally seamless, so it should be great. As I said, we've been in the process for over two years, been coached by Jim Collins and we're very comfortable with the kind of the process.","Emmanuel Korchman","Okay. Thanks, everyone.","Joel Marcus","Yeah, thank you.","Operator","Our next question will be from Rich Anderson of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","Richard Anderson","Thanks. Good afternoon. When you have Pinterest, Stripe and Uber, including them I guess up and running, where does your tech exposure get you to as a percentage of the total portfolio? And maybe describe your level of comfort at that range.","Dean Shigenaga","Rich, it's Dean Shigenaga here. The percentage will creep up a little bit as we approach the end of the year. But I think all in all, you've got so much growth coming on line over the portfolio that it will mute that impact a little bit. We're probably going to approach somewhere around 10%. I don't have the exact statistic in front of me, but it's in that general range, Rich.","Joel Marcus","Yeah, in general, we meet with the - because they're all private companies. We meet with the companies quarterly, the senior management teams. Lot is written about each of these companies. They're well known. We think each one is a highly disruptive or disrupter in their space that is not a flash in the pan. These are not dot-com companies from the last generation.","Stripe has proven itself to be an amazingly broad-based company with amazing talent. I think Pinterest as well. Uber, you read a lot about, I think once they get their self-straight at the board level, I think they brought in a new CEO that I think will be able to rationalize the company. It's certainly is an important company and one that - whether it's worth $70 billion or $55 billion, I don't think it's much of an issue.","I think what they're doing in the marketplace and how they continue to execute, we see in their markets, I think is a testament to the company. But obviously, we pay a lot of attention to these companies and we have on staff several people who have our trained engineers and underwriters. So we're pretty good at understanding these companies be on the financial - I mean, any company obviously look at management, you look at financial strategy and you look at the niche, and so we pay a lot of attention to that.","Richard Anderson","Well, Pinterest is definitely disrupting my household, I'll say that\u2026","Joel Marcus","Your wife's busy on that, right?","Richard Anderson","This year, you combined asset sales and equity issuances as a one line item in your guidance, and most of that is come through equity channels, not to kind of tap you for in 2018 guidance number. But it seems to me, much to sell from a property perspective. Is that correct? I'm not looking for a guidance number, but just wondering, is there a non-core portfolio that's brewing behind the scenes that we're not seeing right now.","Joel Marcus","Well, I think, there is always a few odds and ends that are some legacy assets. We do hope to extricate ourselves from China and few other assets. But I think, the joint venture route is one that always - we used that pretty heavily a couple of years ago. So I think, we have multiple options out there. And we feel pretty good about, where we are today.","Richard Anderson","Okay. And last question. Drug company stocks have done okay, in terms of business, but their stocks have taken a little bit of a hit lately. I don't know if that's an Amazon risk about them getting into the business. I'm just curious, Joel, if you have a view about Amazon entering the business and being a disruptor, so to speak, and if that weighs on your mind at all at this point.","Joel Marcus","Yeah, I think, that's focused. I mean, pharmaceutical sales at the end point retail pharmacy sales are kind of where they're looking to disrupt. And so that's different than research driven manufacturers. And I've always thought that current system is pretty inefficient, when you have PBMs, the pharmacy benefit managers between the manufacturers and the ultimate users and so forth.","So I think, to me, I think, it's going to rationalize the system. But I don't think that's weighed so much on drug stocks, I think, each one has been somewhat individual. Celgene made a pretty major change in their 2020 guidance on overall revenues, Merck had an EU issue with Keytruda, their new cancer drug. I mean, each one is kind of the explainable. As I said, Vertex has kind of knocked the ball out of the park this year. A recent M&A transaction Kite, was purchased by Gilead for almost $12 billion, and just got approval on the second cancer immunotherapy.","So I think, we're pretty comfortable, the index, at least, on the biotech side is up, it was at almost 19% year-to-date, which is certainly outpaced many of the other industries. So I think, we feel pretty good, I think, the regulatory side is super positive with Scott Gottlieb. I think, the tenor [ph] in Washington is constructive, and I think, there is a positive business climate behind it.","And if the - whatever shape the current tax bill takes place and we're able to - the industry is able to repatriate both at the biotech and pharma level, hundreds of billons of dollars, maybe between $100 billion and $200 billion or more from overseas cash that's going to be a net positive for the industry. So I'm pretty bullish.","Richard Anderson","Outstanding. Thanks very much.","Joel Marcus","Yeah. Thanks, Rick.","Operator","The next question will be from Jamie Feldman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jamie Feldman","Great. Thank you. I guess, just taking with Richard's question or a similar topic. Just to throw into that, how do you think about the risk of just pharmaceutical pricing and all the rhetoric around trying to take pricing levels down? And how that will\u2026","Joel Marcus","Well, the reality is, drugs account for only about 10% to 15% of total healthcare spend, and they're the only sector that actually can drive cost down. Hepatitis C is a great example that disease is now curable. The problem is, and the reason that there was a lot of concern about, when Gilead came out with their cure product, Sovaldi, was that insurance companies, they capture you as a patient for a year. And if they have the choice of buying a cure for you or just maintaining you, because you maybe in somebody's health plan next year, what do you think they're going to do?","So it's less the price of the drug, because it's clear, if you can cure a disease, the downstream cost effect is huge. And then, if you translate that to metabolic diseases, you translate that to neurodegenerative diseases, imagine if we could cure, prevent or treat effectively Alzheimer's, dementia, the cost of the system way weigh down.","So I'm not too worried that, ultimately, high-quality drugs are going to make measurable impacts, are going to be well received in the system. The system needs some changing and the intermediaries are part of this issue that disaggregate, because PBMs typically want to see higher drug prices, so they can increase their margins on sale, because they get a benefit of the difference between the drug price and what ultimately the list price and what they sell it at.","So there's a number of misaligned incentives. And so it's the drug companies, the pharmacy benefit, managers and the manufacturers - the research manufacturers are able to kind of align themselves, and I think the system is going to actually work really well.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then the net effect is no dollar is getting squeezed out of - on your side of the business?","Joel Marcus","Yeah. I mean, the problem with the industry historically has been a lot of companies have historically just had incremental products that they extend life three months, five months, six months, 10 months. That's not a real important drug. And I think those will fall by the wayside, as they should.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. That's helpful. You guys mentioned net effective rent growth up year-over-year. Can you just talk through the major markets and how much you think it is up year-over-year and whether you think that growth is sustainable?","Dean Shigenaga","Well, sustainable is always a fun one to talk about and predict the future, Jamie. So maybe I'll just say that fundamentals remain solid, which is a great backdrop to enter into and going forward. But if you think about Cambridge, Mission Bay, South San Francisco, and even down in San Diego, I'd say, on average, you're upper - you're almost at top of the single-digit range for year-over-year growth in net effective rent.","But what I also mentioned in my commentary that's important is TIs and leasing commissions are fairly nominal on leasing renewals and releasing a space. So the net effective rent, you're seeing is really growth in rental rate, but they're one and the same as far as the growth year-over-year. So concessions are not impacting our markets today.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. How much are construction costs up over that same time? I know, they're less of an impact for your TIs, but just generally?","Joel Marcus","6% on average. That may vary in New York, maybe higher because of Hudson Yards and some of the big projects. But by and large, I think, we've given that number before, I think, across the country, we'd say 6% would be a reasonable average.","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah, unfortunately, Jamie, as we talked about on my commentary, the pipeline under construction and the pipeline that we have to lease right behind at about 1.3 million square feet that's really near-term stuff, we're still projecting about 7% overall cash yield on our total investment. So rents are definitely keeping up or outpacing the cost of construction for us.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then last for me, the 279 East Binney, you mentioned a tenant, I think, you said in the portfolio that's interested in that space. Would that leave some space behind?","Joel Marcus","I'm sorry. You may have misspoke. 399 Binney or 279 East Grand?","Jamie Feldman","I wrote it down quickly.","Joel Marcus","I thought you said 279 East Binney.","Jamie Feldman","I may have. The project where you said, you've got a tenant who's looking at 50% of the space and but be coming from the portfolio.","Joel Marcus","Yeah, that's the current tenant, a Google subsidiary fairly whose in the campus.","Jamie Feldman","So they'd just be expanding?","Joel Marcus","That's correct.","Jamie Feldman","Got it. Okay. All right. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","You're welcome. Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","The next question will be from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Michael Carroll","Yeah, Joel, how do you notice an uptick in competition, when acquiring and developing high-quality lab space, particularly from the other REITs, so just seeing that several REITs have recently highlighted the new focus on the lab space?","Joel Marcus","Yeah, I don't think, it's any different that we've seen over the last couple of years. Every market, there's a different set of competitors for different reasons, doing different things. I think, our view of the world is, we try to do, what we do and be the best in the world at it, and not be distracted by outside issues. And in underwriting, if we can't get to where we are, we don't buy it or build it. And so I think, that's how we continue to operate.","Michael Carroll","Okay. And you're not seeing any increased competition from outside the REIT pool has been pretty much the same over the past few years?","Joel Marcus","Yeah, I mean, I think it varies from time-to-time. I mean, I think, we still see there has been, although, maybe less this year than last year a large pool of private capital, particularly from overseas or the pension funds, I think, that's waned a little bit this year. But, if you have - if you're an institutional investor and you have - you need to put money to work, you're going to gravitate to the great markets. So there's not a surprise about that.","Michael Carroll","Okay, great. And then, Dean, off of Sheila's question earlier, I know, you have been highlighting over the past several years that tenants are electing to renew their leases early when they have an expiration in a few years out. I mean, has that started to wane? I mean, have you pooled a lot of those tenants forward already? Or is that still pretty strong?","Dean Shigenaga","Well, I think, if you look at the mix of early renewals going back several years, Michael, it's typically our leasing activity for renewals and re-leasing a space has been about equal or to maybe a 50% greater number of volume wise relative to the contractual expirations at the beginning of the year. So typically, we're anywhere from 7% to 10% with contractual expirations. The renewals are doubling that number.","So we're getting anywhere from 15% to 20% of the portfolio being attacked annually through leasing activity. So we historically have had this recurring volume in recent years. Hard to predict the future, but it's been pretty consistent.","Michael Carroll","Okay, great. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Yeah. Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Joseph Reagan","Hey, good afternoon, guys. In terms of the mark-to-market rent spreads, the increased guidance gets you to about 12% or so - for this year at the midpoint. Is that a fair estimate where you'd say the overall portfolio sits relative to market today?","Stephen Richardson","Jed, hey, it's Steve Richardson. Yeah, that's roughly in line the overall portfolio gap is a little north of 10% there, so that's pretty consistent.","Joseph Reagan","Okay. That's helpful. And I think, you guys mentioned that 399 Binney is almost spoken for. Have you gotten incremental leasing done beyond the 73% of LOIs that was talked about in the supplemental?","Joel Marcus","Well, I think almost all of the spaces under lease negotiation Tom can give you some further color.","Thomas Andrews","Yeah, the 73% reflects the three signed letters of intent that we have right now that we hope to convert into leases over the next few weeks.","Joseph Reagan","And then there are additional conversations beyond that?","Joel Marcus","Yeah, I mean, I'll just let Tom speak in a moment. But I think what we were excited about is we saw pretty large demand for 100 Binney. And so, as we kicked off 399, we felt that there was enough momentum in the market that we would see a pretty receptive audience. Tom, you could give other color.","Thomas Andrews","Yeah, and at the same time, I'll mention, the balance of the One Kendall Square development, where we have a number of opportunities to convert office space to lab space, also to take leases that are currently well under market and re-tenant them at market rates. We're making good progress on that right now. That is a very active corner of Kendall Square right now, between the 399 Binney new construction and which is just kicking off and the re-develop or the re-tenanting of portions of the balance of the One Kendall Square campus.","Joseph Reagan","Okay. I appreciate that. And then, just last one for me. Your capital plan has about $850 million of development spend this year. I know you're not offering specifics on 2018 at this point. But kind of ballpark; is the $850 million sort of a reasonable range of development spend to think about as we go out over the next few years?","Dean Shigenaga","No, I don't think it's fair to comment about each of the years going forward over the next few years, Joe. So maybe as it relates to 2018, stay tuned for Investor Day and every few quarters we give a little more color on what the pipeline is starting to look like, which will give you that visibility beyond. But it's a little early to talk about 2019 and 2020.","Joseph Reagan","Okay, fair enough, thanks.","Joel Marcus","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Dave Rodgers with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","David Rodgers","Hey, Joel, just wanted to ask about Seattle, you did some leasing at Dexter this quarter. I wasn't sure if that was lab tenant or not. But I realized you don't have a lot of space left there. Are you seeing just the lab tenants pushed out of that market by what's happened in the tech activity or are you seeing any interest in kind of moving further South either into San Francisco or San Diego from that market and do you have any longer term discussions with your tenants there that might be pushing out of the market and looking for somewhere else.","Joel Marcus","Well, we did sign a lease there with ClubCorp. I think we indicated that and we're down to a final about 31,000 feet which were in late stages of discussions, which we expect them to take that. They've had some good news based on the Kite acquisition. And the valuation of that company certainly puts in a pretty nice position. I think Seattle is a tough market. It's a super-low cap-rate market, as you know. It's a tight market. The behemoth Amazon obviously has lots of that their home base and lots of activities going on.","So I think companies are always looking at opportunities. But I think we see, we have some unique land resources and locations inside Seattle in the best of locations in South and East Lake Union. So I think we're looking forward to meeting the demand of our tenants and maybe even some that are not tenants over the coming few years. I would say people are probably more migrating from the Bay Area to Seattle, then vice versa, given cost of living and tightness in the San Francisco Bay Area.","Peter Moglia","Hey, Joel, it's Peter. If you wouldn't mind, I'd like to comment a little bit. One of the things that we have seen even though as Joe mentioned, it's been a slow growth market for lab, we have seen the entrance of Celgene and bluebird into the market and they have steadily increased their presence and they've brought basically the vacancy of Seattle lab to low single digits. There is also a number of large research institutions in Seattle. They've been fairly dormant growing over the past few years and that's been driven by a lack of NIH growth, funding growth.","But we are seeing now some potential demand coming from the institutions as well. So I think it's stacking up that Seattle may restart itself a little bit better on the lab side and the fact that the tech industry is in there gobbling up space is probably only good news for rental rates on the lab side. That's it.","David Rodgers","Thanks for that color. One more for Dean, Dean, looked like you used some ATM in the third quarter if I saw correctly. But you said, then you have the forward still to settle in the forwards, was that a function of pricing or just some form of execution. I just wanted to understand that better. And then with regard to maybe are you putting that timing around the remaining preferred that's outstanding?","Dean Shigenaga","So a couple of questions I think embedded there, the current ATM usage really had to do with an opportunity to fund our needs this year. And so at $120, we felt the cost was attractive. On the forward timing, I think for your model, probably best to think about December and that is more to do with spending anticipated in the quarter. All things equal, those transactions probably simply will be funded mid-quarter.","But then we also have earnings contributions from our project deliveries, which are on average about November - I'm sorry, mid to late November on average. So we're just trying to match the timing of the settlement with these other two considerations.","David Rodgers","Okay. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Yeah, thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks.","Joel Marcus","Thank you all very, very much and we look forward to talking to you about 2018 on Investor Day November 29. Thanks so much.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"1563":["Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.

And welcome to the Alexandria Real Estate Equities Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2019 Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Paula Schwartz","Thank you and good afternoon everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","And now I would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel.","Joel Marcus","Thank you, Paula. And welcome everybody to our fourth quarter and year-end 2019 conference call. And with me today are Dean Shigenaga, Steve Richardson and Peter Moglia. We'd like to thank, first of all, most importantly to each and every single member of the Alexandria family, from the bottom of our hearts for a stellar execution of our 2019 business plan. A real granular day-by-day execution with the highest level of operational excellence we're very, very proud.","As we celebrated our 25th Anniversary in 2019 from our founding, we also achieved and perhaps the $25 billion total market cap level for which we're also very proud. And we're proud to announce as you see today, the highest leasing activity in the history of the company with so many companies actually seeking Alexandria campuses, not just base anywhere. The highest rental rate increases in 10 years and the best are really driven by the best in locations and our assets, which have really driven that success. And our operating margins have really been outstanding, and they're really driven by judicious management of our unique business plan. So thank you, everybody for that.","When we look at the industry, there's continued bipartisan support for NIH funding, which has remain strong. Congress has provided an additional $2.6 billion for fiscal year '20 budget, totaling almost $42 billion and this marks the fifth consecutive year, Congress has provided the NIH with a multibillion dollar increase. In 2019, there were 48 new therapies approved by the FDA another historically strong year for bringing new novel therapies to patients. And most importantly, several new therapies approved in 2019 included innovative modalities against novel targets and for diseases which have long needed treatments, such as sickle cell disease and postpartum depression. And we're proud to say that in 2019, Alexandria received 52% its tenants of the FDA new approvals. And of all those approvals, about a quarter were cancer related and a quarter were central nervous system related.","Total life science venture investment continued strong at about $26 billion for 2019, the second highest record over the past decade. And despite market volatility in 2019, capital continued to flow to public markets. In 2019, 5.5 billion was raised across 48 biopharma IPOs on United States\u2019 exchanges and 84% of that amount raised was in Alexandria cluster markets.","Let me turn for a moment to the corona virus. On January 30th, the WHO declared China's novel corona virus, a global health emergency and some of Alexandria's most important tenants are already working with the NIH on vaccine, and hopes are that a vaccine will be ready for human trials by as early as April. In the interim, U. S. drug makers are donating large amounts of antiviral medicines in the interim that may help in the fighting of the virus. And as many of you know, some experts predict there may be as much as 2% decrease in China's GDP due to this virus.","Moving over to briefly to policy, there's been an increased focus on both drug pricing and FTC review of M&A that has caught the attention of both private and public market investors as they work to understand how this may impact valuations and interest in innovation by biopharma, and re-evaluate which types of companies are primed for success in both the current and\/or potential future environments. However, these issues have not led to a substantial change in the capital available to fund innovative life science companies and M&A continues to be active with multiple deals announced at the end of 2019 and in the first month of 2020. And it's likely that when you look at there are now four bills in Congress that are pretty much stuck relating to some focus, give or take the focus on drug pricing, but it's questionable given that we're in a major election yield whether these will ever receive a light of day. ","And then finally, the Trump administration in its own policy, is interested in potentially tying Medicare pays for physician administered drugs to a basket of economically similar products in other countries, a basket of countries and under such a proposal, Medicare would pay 126% of the average price paid in these countries. But I think it's fair to say it's a long way away, the White House is still reviewing a draft of the proposal and once its public, supporters and opponents have time to make their case before the administration long before it will be finalized and even then the idea will only likely be a temporary pilot program. Remember too that Medicare basically covers about a third of the U. S. population.","So with that, let me turn it over to Steve for some granular details on the quarter and the year.","Steve Richardson","Thank you, Joel. Alexandria is continuing clear leadership as a partner to the broad life science industry and a premier developer of world class science and technology campuses, is driving exceptional performance as evidenced by the highest annual leasing volume in its history of 5.1 million square feet and the highest leasing spreads during the past 10 years of 32.2% on a GAAP basis.","It's important to take a step back as we start a new decade and assess what is driving this outperformance; one, our talented people across the entire company and a strong culture of meritocracy; and two, the strategy that we emphasize at our recent Investor Day, the ongoing creation and curation of unique mega campuses in the country's strongest innovation clusters. We're very well positioned for robust future growth with compelling mega campuses in each of our clusters. Peter will cover in detail the recent acquisitions that have added to these campuses and following high level summary provide a clear framework for this high quality growth opportunity.","In Greater Boston, Arsenal on the Charles; in New York City, we are advancing the third tower negotiations with the city; in Maryland, the Shady Grove build two suits and the new large land parcel; in Research Triangle Park, the research drive in Davis drive campuses; in Seattle, the Mercer Mega Block anchoring our dominant position along the eastern portion of South Lake Union; and in San Diego, the San Diego Tech Center in Sorrento, Mesa.","And to present a particular highlight today, the very creative and compelling joint venture with Boston properties in South San Francisco. The campus totals 29.3 acres. Alexandria has contributed 313,000 square feet of operating properties comprised of a Class A lab facility and office building and the state of the art net zero mass timber amenity building with conferencing in a cafe, anchored with tenancy from the California Life Sciences Association. Boston Properties has contributed 775,000 square feet and three office buildings.","The existing facilities will eventually be on an approximate 50-50 basis and new development on a 51-49 basis. We jointly have the ability to unlock tremendous value on the site with the ability to develop three ground up Class A facilities totaling 637,000 square feet and redevelop one of the Boston Properties\u2019 office buildings, so that approximately 50% of the campus offers value creation opportunities over time and ultimate transformation to a high quality laboratory mega campus. The site is really destined to become the premier life science location in South San Francisco as it features walking distance to the caltrain, which is undergoing a substantial renovation and upgrade and reimagine master plan and a unique amenity building that will be a magnet for the life science industry.","Alexandria and Boston Properties share a high regard and mutual respect for one another's teams and accomplishments and collectively, we are very enthusiastic about the future of the campus as we co-develop with Alexandria as the lead developer, a highly amenitized mega campus, featuring a total of 1.7 million square feet at completion. On the separate note, the proposition E in San Francisco will be - -we expect to be pass through the upcoming March election. Prop E will essentially provide yet another barrier to entry for development, as it ties the allocation of Prop M office entitlements to the city's ability to deliver its State of California mandated requirements for affordable housing.","The Prop M allocation of 875,000 square feet or approximately 1% of the entire city's office inventory could thus become further constrained and reduced. We\u2019re monitoring this ballot measure closely and anticipate its passage will make existing and entitled campuses even more desirable and valuable. Broad companywide metrics include again 5.1 million square feet leased during 2019, the highest in the company's history, 2019 rental rate increases of 17.6% cash and 32.2% GAAP, the highest during the past 10 years. On a mark-to-market basis across all regions, we're at about 17.1% on a GAAP basis. And finally and importantly, a sense of urgency continues in the marketplace as nearly three quarters of our leases in 2019 were really renewals. Alexandria strategy the team and strong brand is positioning the company well for sustainable growth in each of our markets.","I'll hand it off to Peter.","Peter Moglia","Thank you, Steve. I'm going to spend the next few minutes updating you on our fourth quarter deliveries. 88 Bluxome, the Mercer Mega Block and 15 Necco progress, give an update on construction costs and then given recent activity, highlight a couple of major acquisitions that occurred in the fourth quarter and one that closed in January.","So as for developments, 2019 was a very busy year in many respects but especially on the development redevelopment front as we delivered over 2 million square feet at an average initial yield of 7.4% on a GAAP and 6.9% on a cash basis. The fourth quarter deliveries were light relative to the first three quarters at 131,000 square feet, but we closed out five projects during the quarter and ended the year with all 11 projects spanning nine sub markets at 95% occupancy or higher, illustrating the strong demand present in all of our markets.","Given the significant interest in 88 Bluxome in the SoMa submarket in San Francisco, the Mercer Mega Block in Seattle and 15 Necco on the Seaport area Boston, we wanted to provide a brief update on those three. As many of you know, the Bay Area team\u2019s significant community and municipal engagement resulted in our 88 Bluxome project receiving prop M allocation on the entire project, as opposed to approval on phases as other developers received. We are pleased to report that we are now fully entitled as all challenge periods have expired and the central summer plan litigation has been resolved.","We expect to receive a permit from demolition and our site work in May, and we expect to commence those activities in the summer when certain required off site work is completed. As you likely know, the million 70,000 square foot project is 46% leased to Pinterest and 58% leased overall. The status on the Mercer Mega Block is that we're negotiating a perspective purchaser consent decree with the Department of Ecology that essentially will cap our environmental liability and that should be resolved by year-end and we should close shortly thereafter.","Concurrently, we're preparing drawings for early design guidance in the middle of a master use permit shortly after closing which will perfect the entitlement to that project. Where as far as 15 Necco goes, we're redesigning the building to be elaborate shell and it is currently in for review with the Boston planning and development agency. We expect the entitlement to be complete and have a permit to break ground in the first quarter of next year. The location has been very well received by tenants in the market and we've had preliminary discussions with a few of them.","Moving on to construction costs. Given our proclivity for value-add activities, our underwriting process includes rigorous periodic updates of construction cost trends. The effective tariffs have been a constant theme in many of our investor meetings, and by enlarge we\u2019ve been able to manage through them by engaging our contractors early and leveraging our deep relationships with them to achieve the best pricing for steel and aluminum at buyout and cover any unexpected spikes with contingency.","Despite recent positive developments in the trade war, we remain cautious and conservative in our underwriting costs as manufacturers are quick to point out pricing is subject to change based on trade negotiations. Our latest analysis, which we get directly from our contractors, indicates that the national average for escalations remains in the 5% range, which is consistent with 2019 and recent years. Most of our major contracting partners across our markets anticipate slowing towards the end of 2020 and into \u201821 and \u201922, which could ease pressure on pricing. Most of the pressure on pricing is attributed to skilled labor shortages. Although, the construction industry continues to add jobs, most of the additions have been unskilled laborers increasing the productivity gap, which has led to above market pay scales for skilled workers and overtime to staff projects. The projected slow down would mitigate this.","Moving on to acquisitions. As you know, we executed a secondary offering in January and use of proceeds includes finding a number of strategic acquisitions approximately 956 million of these were completed in the fourth quarter of \u201819 and included the following. Arsenal on the Charles, which was disclosed at Investor Day located in Watertown and inner suburb with Cambridge and closed December 17th at a purchase price of 525.5 million. This acquisition is a terrific example of our focus on value add investments.","Upon full development, we contemplate 12 building campus, containing 1,000,035,000 square feet that will provide unprecedented scale in Cambridge is inner suburbs. 3825 and 3875 Fabian Way closed in December at a purchase price of 291 million and is located in the greater Stanford sub market at Palo Alto. This 478,000 square foot campus has been leased back to the seller and provides a similarly unique opportunity for Alexandria to achieve scale in a highly value cluster location.","The 598,000 square foot San Diego tech center will be rebranded as SD tech by Alexandria, and will ultimately be fully developed in phases into an approximately 1.3 million square foot life science and technology mega campus, which we own in a 50-50 joint venture. Although, it's known as the premier technology campus in Sorento Mesa, it has lost its luster in recent years and therefore offers us a great opportunity to leverage our redevelopment skills and long-term ownership horizon to create significant value through a thoughtful repositioning.","In addition to the 4Q \u201919 acquisition, we completed three transactions totalling little over $341 million in January and I'll briefly touch on one of those as well. 275 Grove street, also known as Riverside center, is a 510,000 square foot office project with terrific access to Cambridge and Boston via its adjacency to the Riverside Greenline station and location at the nexus of the Route 120A and Mass Pike Interchange. It is also located in the area of the Western suburbs where a considerable amount of executive talent resides. The project is in Newton, which is within five miles of our Walton cluster, and we see this acquisition as an extension of that. In addition to the trends and advantages and proximity to decision makers, Riverside center provides optionality to incrementally convert the building to lab overtime.","So with that, I'll pass the call over Dean.","Dean Shigenaga","Thanks Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon everyone. As a mission driven real estate company, we're very proud of our team's awesome execution of operating and financial results. Our team remains very focused on leadership and ESG, making a positive impact on society by executing in a thoughtful manner to minimize the impact that our business has on the environment and advancing human health, wellbeing and nutrition.","During 2019, our team earned a five star rating and an A disclosure score from GRESB. We issued $550 million in green bonds with proceeds allocated to green eligible projects consisting of gold or platinum led certified projects in addition to other bond issuances, continued the execution of our 2025 goals focused on how we manage carbon emissions, energy consumption, waste diversion and water usage and then continued leadership and health and wellness, November was a really exciting time period for employees as 59 of them finished the 26.2 mile New York City Marathon and supported raising important funds for mission critical research at the Mount Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. That is as pretty amazing since this was the first marathon for most of our runners.","Our solid results highlight continued growth and high quality cash flows with operational efficiency in several key industry leading statistics. Total revenues were $1.5 million, up 15.4% over 2018, cash NOI was $1 billion for the fourth quarter annualized and FFO per share as adjusted was right on track with our expectations at $1.77 and $6.96 for the fourth quarter in 2019, respectively. High quality cash flow growth was generated from one of the best tenant rosters in the REIT industry with 50% of our annual rental revenue from investment grade or large cap tenants. Same property NOI growth was strong for 2019 at 3.1% and 7.1% on a cash basis. And as Peter highlighted in 2019 we delivered 2.1 million rentable square feet of development and redevelopment projects, contributing significant growth in rental and net operating income.","Now occupancy came in very strong this quarter at 97.8% before consideration of vacancy in recently acquired properties. Now vacancy from these recently acquired properties reduced occupancy in the fourth quarter by 1%. And when combined with acquisitions we completed in January of 2020 will an aggregate reduced occupancy in the first quarter by 2.4%. Now this vacancy is primarily related to San Diego tech that was acquired in the fourth quarter and the consolidation of buildings Boston Properties contributed to our joint venture with 27% vacancy.","Now, the important takeaway is that our occupancy across our core asset base remains very strong and this vacancy represents opportunities to grow rental income and cash flows over the next six to eight quarters. So please refer to the tabular disclosures at the bottom of page 20 for supplemental package for additional information. Now, there has been recent attention on potential changes to property taxes for commercial real estate, currently under Prop 13 commercial real estate in California subject to property taxes that are assessed at 1% of the purchase price, subject to annual increases in fair market value capped at 2% and subject to assessment for new construction.","Now it's really too early to tell if there will be changes in property taxes for commercial real estate in California, but a few key points to keep in mind. Alexandria has a very favorable lease structure with over 97% of our leases providing for the recovery of operating and major capital expenditures. Therefore, there would be a very insignificant amount that we would not recover from our tenants if our properties were assessed at fair value.","Additionally, most of our properties are relatively new from ground up development and redevelopment and therefore, we believe we are in a better position than the average property in our core markets. Importantly, the life science industry is extremely focused on the benefit of proximity to other scientists and innovative entities in order to develop new and innovative therapies versus the nominal amount of rent they pay relative to their annual R&D budget.","Now a couple points on impairments, during the fourth quarter, we recognized impairments aggregating $10 million, primarily to reduce a portion of our cost basis into privately held investments. We still expect to recover a significant portion of our original investment. One company is focused on neurodegenerative diseases and the other is a clinical stage company focused on novel enzyme targets. Importantly, our overall venture investments continue to generate significant value, our disclosures this quarter highlighted recent value for aggregating almost $0.5 billion consisting of over 400 million of unrealized gains as of December 31st, and over 70 million of net realized gains over the last two years.","Now on the real estate side in the fourth quarter, we decided to commit to the sale of the only two legacy properties that we own in New Jersey and Florida, which resulted in impairment charges aggregating 12.3 million. We hope to sell these properties over the next four quarters. Now we remain on track with our disclosed goal of 5.2 times for net debt to adjusted EBITDA by December 31 2020. And we felt it was prudent to remain patient and execute or follow on equity offering in early 2020 to fund two key acquisitions that were awarded and completed in December of 2019.","Now as a result, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter 2019 was 0.4 times higher than the 5.3 times that we originally forecasted. It's really important though to highlight that our team deserves recognition for the achievement of our BAA1, BBB plus credit ratings, which ranks our credit profile at approximately the 90th percentile across 160 publicly traded REITs and this excludes mortgage REITs.","Now one brief comment regarding our ATM program. We do expect to file a new at the market offering program in the first quarter here. On guidance, we have reaffirmed our 2020 guidance for EPS and FFO per share as adjusted at a midpoint of $2.22 and $7.38 respectively. And please refer to page 7 of our supplemental package for details underlying assumptions included in our guidance.","Let me turn it back over to Joel.","Joel Marcus","Operator, we can open it up for question and answer please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Jamie Feldman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jamie Feldman","I guess I just wanted to start on, just thinking about the potential risk of excess supply in both South San Francisco and Boston Seaport. It seems like we've got several projects in the pipeline there. Can you just give us your latest thoughts on both those markets?","Steve Richardson","Jamie, hi, it's Steve. Thank you for the question. We've talked about this for quite a while in South San Francisco and I think we've been very pleased to see that the supply that's come on has been substantially absorbed. Kilroy with 650,000 square feet of Phase 1 is entirely leased. So that does not present a near-term opportunity. Blackstone now has resolved half of their 400,000 square foot building. So they just have 200,000 square feet available there. And then finally HCP just have 65,000 square feet available in their project a little further North and South San Francisco.","So on an overall basis, that's very limited supply of available inventory and we in turn feel like we're extremely well positioned with 201 Haskins. We've got 100,000 feet leased there and ongoing discussions for another big block of space. So as it may have been a concern and something we're watching closely a year ago, we're in very good shape. The future pipeline I think we'll take a look at that and continue to monitor that, but I think that will be metered over a number of years and not really present a big supply shock.","Moving out to Seaport, there are probably three other projects that could compete with our Necco site, if you're looking for large blocks of space, couple of them at about a couple of hundred thousand square feet and another one at about 500,000 square feet. So again, you may have a future supply that's a number of years down the road, but nothing in the near intermediate term that we're overly concerned about. But we're always monitoring this extremely closely.","Jamie Feldman","Can you talk about the demand pipeline for the Seaport? It does seem like there is several projects in the pipeline there beyond farther out as well.","Steve Richardson","I think as we look at the demand in the Cambridge market, it continues to stay healthy with 2.7 million square feet of lab demand. When you start looking at what 2% vacancy in that market, we have discussed all along the Seaport being a very strong natural outlet for that. So we are in early discussions with a very large tenant base that we have in our three mega campuses there in Cambridge. So we're very encouraged at a very early stage with the tenant interest in that site.","Peter Moglia","This is Peter, Jamie. I can just give you some color that -- obviously the Seaport is a major tech destination, a number of big tenants going in there. Amazon is making a huge move and will likely go a lot more space, when you talked about the concern over supply. But also it's starting to gain a lot of traction with life science companies. Vertex, which is already there is looking to expand in a fairly big way, and there is couple -- Foundation Medicine has moved over there and there's a couple of other tenants that we'll keep to ourselves that are interested in as well as Cambridge has very limited availability and people see Seaport as a great place to go in lieu of that.","Jamie Feldman","And then last for me. If you think about your acquisitions done to date and the pending, I think that it looks like you're pretty close to your full-year target. So how should we think about the potential that you go well above that target? And if so, how do you finance it?","Dean Shigenaga","Well, Jamie, it's Dean here. I think what we found really interesting about the market today versus looking back several years ago, is there is obviously a volume in the market, many deals of which we pass on. The other thing that's really interesting about the dynamics today is I would say that we're required to due diligence before we're even aware of being awarded as the winning bidder on a transaction. So, I think what I'm trying to highlight is there is deal flow in the marketplace.","We're very disciplined in what we choose to pursue and there is a short fuse when it does come up as a winning opportunity. So we'll keep the market informed as we go through the year. As far as funding goes, whether it's construction value creation projects, or future acquisitions, I think we'll remain as disciplined as we have been historically, Jamie. Today, we've got a bucket of equity to solve for. We solved a big chunk of it and we have an amount to resolve for the rest of the year, but I think you'll find us disciplined and preserving our optionality as we look forward to solving the rest of our capital needs for this year.","Jamie Feldman","How large is your non-core pipeline or non-core portfolio right now that you sell?","Dean Shigenaga","I think the way to simply describe it, Jamie, is we always prune the bottom of the portfolio. There is always a couple of assets we're selling every year that don't even resonate any meaningful capital. We did most of our heavy lifting back in 2012 and 2013 on the non-core side.","Operator","And our next question will come from Tom Catherwood of BTIG. Please go ahead.","Tom Catherwood","Steve, at the opening, you mentioned kind of the role of Alexandria as a partner to life science industry. And then later, you mentioned a sense of urgency for your tenants across your markets hence, the high leasing spreads and the early renewals. How do you balance this kind of dual mandate of the ability to push rents because vacancies are so low and tenant demand is so high with the fact that you have these long-term relationships with tenants? What's the kind of equation that goes into that? How do you make sure you're giving them the space that they need while also pushing rents as far as you can?","Steve Richardson","Tom, it's Steve. Thank you for the question. I think it's been and it has been for the time since the company was started, it's a balance of respect for the clients that we're working with and the work that they're doing. These are multi-market relationships, they're multi-company relationships. So they are critically important. And I think we balance that respect with the reality of the marketplace and share that in an open and pretty transparent way so that ultimately the companies and the decision-makers feel like they're gaining tremendous value in the facilities, tremendous value in the operations of the facilities, and really are working with somebody who is a partner for the long term. So I think it's a balance between those two.","Tom Catherwood","And I assume that there is kind of also helping them find space in other areas, which leads to my next question, Peter, it was really helpful when you provided more insight to the Riverside Center purchase in the Boston suburbs. Obviously the Boston suburbs has been an area where you've been more active with acquisitions and redevelopments over the past few quarters. What are you seeing as far as demand dynamics beyond just executives living in the area? What are you seeing as far as tenant demand there, and how does this differ from previous cycles when the suburbs experienced much more volatility than your urban markets?","Joel Marcus","Tom, this is Joel. Let me start off before Peter jumps in. I think one of the things you have to think about is there are a host of companies broadly in the life science area that actually don't want to be in the Cambridge location for a variety of reasons beyond where executives may live. And so we've seen certainly being the number one life science market in the United States, there are a continual flow of companies that either started in Cambridge and choose to move out, or have never moved there and are expanding","And I think those are ones we see pretty regularly, a number of which are pretty great credit and a number of which are not. But I think there is a pretty good core of tenants and then those tenants are pretty mindful of what Peter says is transit has become king. And I think working with owner\/operator that both understands their needs and is pretty sophisticated about what they do and how they do things, but Peter can give you any further...","Peter Moglia","I think, Joel answered it well. I guess, one thing I would remind everyone about is we've had over 1 million square feet in the suburbs for a number of years with high 90s occupancy. Never really run in any problems there, as Joel said, there is a number of companies that just would prefer to be there, but we feel confident in acquisitions like Arsenal on the Charles and the Riverside Center, because they do connect well to transportation, they have very close proximity to Cambridge and Boston.","And given just what is going on in Boston, in general, such as the tech cadre going to downtown, connecting to all the different Ts such as the Green Line, as well as Red Line is important. And so -- the demand is really coming from a lot of folks that want to be in the suburbs, as Joel said, but there is also a tremendous amount of company growth in Cambridge that can't find growth space. So we're figuring out where to go next, and I think we've made some pretty good decisions.","Tom Catherwood","So it sounds like it is a little bit different in the suburbs and than it used to be. So one last one for me.","Joel Marcus","And not all suburbs are created equal so remember that.","Tom Catherwood","Last one for me, probably for either Dean or maybe Steve. A lot of redevelopments as part of the acquisitions that you guys did in 2019, whether it's stuff in Campus Pointe or SD Tech or the Arsenal, is it possible that earnings could kind of take some chunky hits as leases expire and you go into reduce some of these, either outbuildings or parts of these buildings? Or are you planning to pull the projects out of service, so end up capitalizing interest and FFO remain stable? How should we think about how those kind of roll on over the next 12 to 18 months?","Dean Shigenaga","Tom, it's Dean here. I'm trying to think about the redevelopment projects that we have on the horizon. At least, if you look at our 2020 lease expirations, as an example, in fact '21 as well, we highlight that there is some redevelopment opportunities as an example. So I think over the next two years, what we do have going into redevelopment is very, very modest. There are 75,000, 76,000 targeted for '20 and then another 79,000 targeted for '21. And that is related to the Arsenal on the Charles. So I think that gives you some visibility over the next 24 months, but it's not really going to have any impact.","Peter Moglia","This is Peter. I think I'll chime in to remind everybody that some of these redevelopments are considered covered land plays. If you look at the 1260 Campus Point Drive, 4161 Campus Point Court, we have Leidos occupying those properties, as we do a build-to-suit for them just next door. So, we're able to kind of get the earnings while we build and then once we deliver, one of those buildings will be converted to lab. The other will be demolished in favor of a new building as part of the overall 1.9 million square foot Campus Point, maybe campus development. 10 Necco Street in the Seaport is very similar. It's a parking garage with good income coming off of it as we position it for redevelopment. So we have a number of things like that. And we're very aware when we buy something that could be redeveloped that to the extent it has.","Operator","And our next question will come from Rich Anderson of SMBC. Please go ahead.","Rich Anderson","On the Boston Properties joint venture, I'm curious if you can speak about that in dollar terms a little bit in terms do building get mark to market when they get contributed into the JV? What's the leverage on the JV? What's your equity investment and what kind of capital or are you kind of taking out of pocket and putting into this JV? I guess mainly I want to know 1.7 million square feet means in dollar terms.","Dean Shigenaga","Rich, it's Dean here. I think you asked a couple of points. First off, I think it's important to recognize this is a tremendous joint venture opportunity for Alexandria. The mark-to-market is actually fairly modest on the operating assets. So that really doesn't come into play here. As far as dollars going in, I'd say why not stay tuned for the first quarter disclosures. We'll get into a little more information that's required to be disclosed, but it was just a very recent transactions, so it's premature for us to get into the details right now.","Rich Anderson","This satisfies your two sort of objectives, which is mega campuses and buying vacancy. And I agree, it seems like a really great set up for two really high quality companies. So like all that. Wondering if there is a pipeline here? Boston Properties operates in a lot of your markets. Is there a chance that the two companies could work more together in other areas around the country and do something similar, or is this sort of a one-shot deal do you think?","Steve Richardson","Rich, hi, it's Steve. This was a very unique opportunity. We were literally adjacent neighbors to one another for a couple of decades. There is actually one parcel in the heart of the campus that Boston Properties owns and we had a long-term perpetual easement across it. There is additional parking with a parking facility that ends up unlocking another chunk of square footage. So you had -- it presented to both of us a very unusual and unique opportunity. So we're very focused on this and don't necessarily see this being a pipeline as you mentioned. Again just a very unique and exceptional opportunity to create something that really will be transformational for nearly 30 acres in South San Francisco. So quite the scale when you think about it.","Rich Anderson","And then on you're buying vacancy initiatives, what is like the path, the cadence to cap rates? If you're buying at X and how does that ramp? If you could speak in general terms when you look at these sort of half vacant type of opportunities for the company.","Joel Marcus","I wouldn't say that we have a strategy to buy vacancy, Rich. I think it is unique to each transaction. So the San Diego Tech Center, as we said presented itself in a unique way, very under-managed and really was not meeting up to what we think it's aspirational capabilities could be. I don't think we went in there specifically because it had significant vacancy, same thing with Boston Properties issues. I think they were motivated by vacancy. I'm not sure we were. But we were motivated for the things that Steve pointed out is the ability to over time create a very unique mega campus right at the gateway entry to South City. So I don't think I went into it that as like deliberative strategy.","Rich Anderson","I didn't mean to put words in your mouth there, sorry about that. But nonetheless, good deals. And then finally from me, what is the timing of that $55 million burn off of free rent on the delivered developments?","Dean Shigenaga","Rich, it's Dean here. The majority of that $55 million of free rent that is now related to properties are in service, generating revenue. So the free rent period will burn off substantially over the next four quarters.","Operator","And our next question will come from Sheila McGrath of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Sheila McGrath","I wanted to first clarify on that Mercer Mega Block. Peter, did you say you don't expect that to close until the end of this year? And if so, when do you expect to have buildings open at that project?","Peter Moglia","Well, I will confirm that closing will be at the end of the year. We are concurrently as I said processing drawings for our early design guidance and month. So that is a fairly long process. But I'd imagine our entitlements will be protected sometime in '21, and then decisions will be made then based on market conditions. Really hard to forecast where we'll go.","Sheila McGrath","And then just following up on your comments on the mega campus strategy, obviously the flexibility for growing tenants is a key part of it. Just wondering, if part of the economic benefit is spreading the cost of the amenity building across a larger campus, if that's part of your strategy? And on those dedicated amenity buildings, are you getting reimbursed for the amenity package from tenants?","Peter Moglia","Sheila, it's Peter. You're exactly right. The mega campus does allow spreading of the cost. Not only the costs of the amenities, but it actually gives us a lot of economies of scale in the operations of the buildings. So that's how we're able to get to that NOI premium. In addition to higher rental rates, we have lowered reimbursement. So, the tenants feel that they can go ahead and cover those things. The amenities themselves are almost always included in a load factor. So we do get full rent on them as well as the collection of operating expenses. So, the larger the campus, the easier it is to do because obviously you want to manage your load factor.","Sheila McGrath","And one last question, you mentioned the leasing spreads continue to be significant with 2019 at I think a record in the past 10 years. Just wondering if you have a rough estimate for us where in-place rents for the portfolio might compare to current market rents.","Steve Richardson","Sheila, it's Steve. We had talked about a mark to market of 17.1% on a GAAP basis and nearly that on a cash basis. And that's across all markets. And it is particularly strong, as you might expect in Boston, Cambridge.","Operator","Our next question will come from Manny Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead.","Michael Bilerman","Michael Bilerman here with Manny. So I just wanted to come back to potential other opportunities around the assets that you own. And it definitely sounded like from the BXP call that BXP approached you guys with this unique opportunity. And certainly there's a lot of unique circumstances from that ownership of assets beside each other. But I'm just wondering after you've now identified and been able to go through this process for what will be one-plus-one greater than two? Have you sort of done a deep dive into every single one of your other assets in campuses to see whether there is other landlords that may decide your assets, who you can work with to create similar value either by buying them out or entering into similar types of joint ventures like that?","Joel Marcus","Michael, this is Joel. We've actually been doing that for quite a while, thinking about our locations, the assemblages. Campus Point is maybe the best example of that where we grew a campus we acquired back in 2010. I can't remember exactly how big it was then. But in the hundreds of thousands of feet today, it's almost 2 million square feet. And that's probably the best example where we have very deliberately gone after adjacent parcels or buildings or things like that, other owners and so forth. And I think that's something we always think about. It's not so much easy to do oftentimes, especially if they're owner\/users that are adjacent. But that clearly is part of our long-term strategy.","Michael Bilerman","I guess is there anything else sort of underway that got uncovered where arguably this thing with BXP once you got into the negotiation and understanding what was there obviously on a lot of value to both parties? Is there nothing that sparked something of similar scope within the portfolio today?","Joel Marcus","Well, probably enough breaking news today. Stay tuned. But the answer is...","Michael Bilerman","It's a question of whether you've gone through a more deep dive into these opportunities and...","Joel Marcus","The answer is very much so, yes.","Michael Bilerman","Manny has a question too.","Manny Korchman","Dean, just thinking about the capital plan. I understand you want to keep your options open. But just could you help us dial-in, how much of that is equity and maybe as part of that, what the cadence is of taking down the tower that you just did?","Dean Shigenaga ","Manny, sure. It's Dean here. So two questions. Maybe I'll start with the latter, as far as the timing on the forward. Because a big component of the capital raise was related to two key acquisitions that not only closed in December but also were awarded around that time frame, so we had a short fuse to work with, we do need to bring down a big chunk of the capital in Q1. So you'll see some of the equity settle in the first quarter and then you'll see the rest kind of spread through the remaining three quarters. As far as our broad needs, Manny, our guidance on Page 7 touched on the broad equity component number that we need to solve for 2020, which was $1.95 billion at the midpoint. And the follow-on offering in January solved for little over $1 billion of that. And so we'll work through options to close out the remainder through the next several quarters.","Operator","And our next question will come from Dave Rodgers with Baird. Please go ahead.","David Rodgers","And maybe for Joel or Steve, I wanted to ask about just kind of the mega campuses versus the historical kind of clustering slightly smaller buildings. As you move to these major campuses, is it your expectation you would kind of move back towards maybe a smaller base of lab tenants? Would you prefer that versus maybe leasing a mega campus to a tech tenant? It just seems like maybe the tech tenants will be less likely to want to rent next door to competitive tenant versus the lab tenants, so just some thoughts maybe around what direction that takes you?","Steve Richardson","Dave, it's Steve. Thanks for the question. Yeah. Again, by and large, 90% or thereabouts of the NOI is from life science companies. And the industry as its growing and maturing, and I think one of the most important slides we put out in Investor Day was the new modalities that the life science companies are pursuing to really get at intractable diseases. So what we see as these companies, continuing to grow, the demand to be in these clusters and the footprints that they are looking to occupy and their colleagues are looking to occupy continue to grow. So, we see the mega campus as a natural response to the way the industry is growing and evolving in a very healthy productive and sustainable way.","David Rodgers","And then maybe just a second question. You have a little over 2 million square feet of remaining expirations between '20 and '21. As you talk to those tenants, what are their maybe hesitation to have renewed already? Does it has to do with rent? Are you getting pushed back on rent? It doesn't sound like maybe you're getting a lot of that. These new modalities, are they thinking, hey, I have to move to another cluster? How much of that is kind of weighing into these decision in these smaller tenants in particular?","Joel Marcus","It's very much case by case. I think it's very hard to make a general observation there. Some are quite small and some are somewhat larger, but I think it's super case by case. So I wouldn't read anything into it particularly.","Steve Richardson","And Dave, it's Steve. I would just emphasize Joel's point. We really don't have a number of large blocks rolling. It really is consisting of smaller tenants, and they would typically be looking at a different time frame than larger tenants.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from Jamie Feldman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jamie Feldman","I was just hoping you could talk more about the impairments. I think you had $10 million impairment in the fourth quarter and I think it was like $17 million for the year. Just what caused you to take the write down? And then also just going forward, is that kind of a reasonable run rate based on -- obviously not every investment is going to play out the way you think it will.","Joel Marcus","Jamie, so the $10 million impairments on the venture side was really related to two privately held investments. The impairment -- let me just touch on the accounting rules because it will give you a sense for how the impairments do come up. On the public side, publicly traded securities, they're mark-to-market through earnings now based on the closing stock price for each security. So it's pretty straightforward. There is no impairments on the public portfolio.","To the extent a privately-held company provides net asset value, the FASB said used net asset value is really effectively a practical expedient for fair value. And as a result, there is no impairments because you're just going to record those investments at net asset value. So, it's the other privately-held investments where there is no NAV and you do have to mark to market from time to time for up-rounds and down-rounds in those companies. But to the extent there is some hiccup in their business plan that impacts the value -- the valuation for the company, the accounting rules will require you to take a look at indicators of impairment and recognize a write-down.","I think, Jamie, when you have a portfolio of any assets, real estate or lease venture investments, you will have an impairment from time to time. I don't think the historical run rate gives any perspective for the -- perspective charges that could occur because they're very specific to the companies. And most importantly, Jamie, we've got tremendous value that we've generated from this portfolio. As I mentioned, over $400 million of unrealized gains on the books as of December 31. And that's in addition to roughly $70 million of realized gains that were recognized over the last two years. So I probably focus on the upside here than the occasional write-down, which is inherent in our portfolio of assets.","Peter Moglia","I'll add a footnote, Jamie. The one similarity between the two companies is there was management changes in each of the companies that played into that that impairment.","Jamie Feldman","So both of these are investments you still holding on that you think still have upside?","Joel Marcus","Well, we wrote down only a portion of it, Jamie, which means we still have a significant amount of our original investment we expect to recover. As far as the future goes, it's too hard to -- it's too difficult to speculate whether we will make more money downstream in the future on it than our current ownership cost base. So stay tuned on that.","Jamie Feldman","And then as I look at the development pipeline, it looks like there are several projects where your lease percentage declined but the square footage increased. Was there anything specific that you did this quarter in terms of changing building sizes or add some of these projects? I'm just trying to make sure I understand what's new.","Joel Marcus","There is only one that I can think of, Jamie, that might have been a little more noticeable than anything else. I think in our project, the Alexandria District, 56% -- 56% leased, 65% lease negotiating. I think it's pretty close to where it was. It might have moved a little bit. I know there's one lease we had that we're not as confident in completing it, but it's still in the works. I think that was the only meaningful change that may have been reflected, Jaime.","Jamie Feldman","I'll follow up offline. I think there was one or two like they're now larger projects, so it pulled back the occupancy percent. But I don't have it in front of me. So I'll follow up with you guys. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir.","Joel Marcus","Thank you everybody and we look forward to chatting with you on first quarter call. Take care.","Operator","The conference has now concluded.

Welcome to the Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc. Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Pauline, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Paula Schwartz, Rx Communications. Please go ahead.","Paula Schwartz","Thank you, and good afternoon. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus. Please go ahead.","Joel Marcus","Thanks Paula, and welcome everybody to the fourth quarter and year end 2015 call. With me today are Dean Shigenaga, Peter Moglia, Tom Andrews, Steve Richardson, and Dan Ryan. I wanted to first of all start off with really huge kudos to the entire ARE family for an excellent fourth quarter and year end 2015. I think the results and accomplishments are highlighted well in our press release and in the supp and they really speak for themselves.","But on the other hand, we actually mourn the loss of an Alexandria's family member, Jeff Newton who passed over the last week or so and will be sorely missed in the family.","Moving to the core and Dean will highlight some of this, we had strong fourth quarter and year end 2015 results and I think evidenced by the strong continuing guidance of our core for 2016. I think it's important to keep in mind we have a very high quality tenant base which provides stability in a volatile market which we're clearly in.","54% of our ABR is generated by investment grade tenants and 81% of our ABR is generated by our investment grade tenants, from our top 20 generating almost half the ABR. For the top 20, we have 8.3 years of average lease duration which gives us a nice long run-rate, almost half of our annual base rent.","We also have a strong and diversified tenant base with only 3% exposure to really pure office or tech office on our operating properties. And 20% of our ABR is from the San Francisco region which has got a lot of headline news these days, but we are happy to say in our three strong sub-markets we're 100% occupied and we have very limited rollover this year of about 120,000 feet and below market expiring rent. So I think we are well-positioned.","On the leasing side, on our operating assets, we have a very manageable 1.2 million square feet rolling this year which is about 7.6% of the operating asset base. 32% or almost 400,000 square feet is already been released. And our largest block is about 125,000 at Campus Point, when Lilly vacates San Diego on asset high quality space.","On the development side, regarding leasing of our 2016 deliveries, 89% is leased, 91% leased during negotiation. We expect New York to become fully leased in the not too distant future. Longwood which is our joint venture remains at about 63% but we expect with the $2 billion in the NIH funding, that should help increase academic demand in that sub-market. And we look for multi-tenant users to populate the rest of the science project in San Diego which is about 81%.","So of the 2016 deliveries, 1.5 million square feet add a average cash yield, initial cash yield of 7 plus. We feel that we are in very good position and we\u2019ve got approximately $75 million to $80 million, as you know, from the supplement of addition NOI to onboard.","With respect to the 2017 and 2018 deliveries, we're 67% leased and 87% leased or under negotiation. At 100 Binney, we did have 1 floor lease request by an important tenant that actually now has been terminated. So lease of with 5 floors, we have 2 floors under active negotiations and several parties are discussing the remaining 3 floors and we look forward to resolving that in this year for sure.","At 400 Dexter, the remaining 34% is expected to be picked up by Juno for hard options they have and if for some reasons they didn't lease it, we actually have demand today that would take that space.","Our two new projects 9625 Town Center, we have 7 potential tenants looking at space there. And 10151 Barnes Canyon, we have 3 potential tenants looking at space there.","On the tech side, our largest tech tenant is Alphabet which was up something like 5% today. They remain the anchor in our Mountain View project. Total ABR on tech today is less than 3%. I think it's important to note that really the financial model of the strong private tech company is really shifting from building platform to profitability and I think that's a good thing.","On the life science side, we see strong continuing R&D numbers $100 plus billion, generated by or to be invested this year by both pharma and biotech which are not generally capital market dependent other than at the venture level for the smaller tenants. The NIH is receiving an increase of 2 billion and I guess, the President announced the Cancer Moonshot which may generate another billion if you can get that through Congress this year.","With respect to the center for medicate services, the projections through 2024 show based on all we know today. And the predicted assumptions that the rate of increase in drug prices will roughly be in-line with the rate of increases in overall healthcare.","Medicines, after all, certainly help to prevent disease in many cases, treat disease and avoid much higher cost downstream. Some drugs are costly but treatment of disease is a lot more expensive.","Innovative treatments for diseases where there are few other options will still continue to command a solid pricing and innovative drugs that cure disease are clearly not the enemy as the political storm is out there. They really are the solution I expect that after the election this will essentially die down and it will become much more of an outcomes will bear more on pricing.","The longer and healthier life will command higher pricing. And where you can prove offset to future healthcare expenses, which is in many the cases, again strong pricing will be expected.","Part of the problem also is that you can't - drug manufacturers can't really discuss what payers information about our products before they're approved under current FDA guidelines and so there may need to be some further looking at that issue, because that would help I think start to - view this pricing discussion.","By our demand for our ARE core assets as you can see from the press release and supplement is strong. We expect to tap this market with land sale and non-core assets sales during 2016 as well.","On the balance sheet, we've guided to leverage between 65 and 69. So moving downward nicely for the end of 2016. For 2015 we maintained our strategic optionality with respect to the balance sheet and continue to manage our leverage down with our goal to get an investment grade rating upgrade overtime.","As I said at Investor Day, generally we don't want to issue common equity below net asset value, but as we are negotiating the partial interest sale of 499 Illinois, we were able to really run across a great opportunity to sell some common equity in the fourth quarter without lowering either 2015 or 2016 per share earnings and that was an awfully nice thing. And at the same time, we are able to decrease the proceeds needed from the partial interest sale from the buyer Illinois, so all good results.","Page 49 of the supplemental disclosure on investments evidenced continuing solid built-in- gains on our investment portfolio. And we executed some very good sales with good gains in December.","And with that let me turn it over to Dean.","Dean Shigenaga","Thanks Joel. Dean Shigenaga, here. Good afternoon, everybody. I've got three important topics. First is I want to highlight our strong results for 2015 and briefly comment on same property performance. Second, I want to highlight a few key points on the significant value realized through the sales of partial interest in three core Class A assets. And third, I want to cover our funding strategy and prudent management of our balance sheet. We've got about $2 billion of liquidity, very limited maturities and an improving credit profile.","First on our strong results for 2015. The fourth quarter and the full year of '15, we reported FFO per diluted share of a $1.33 and $5.25 respectively and in line with the latest consensus estimates. Importantly our FFO per share for 2015 of $5.25 represented 9.4% growth over 2014 and our second consecutive year of FFO per share growth of over 9%.","Same property NOI growth for 2015 was 1.3% and 4.7% on a GAAP and cash basis, respectively. And relatively in line with our solid 10-year average same property NOI growth of approximately 2% on a GAAP basis and 5% on a cash basis. Our same property NOI growth for the fourth quarter was 1.3% on a GAAP basis, 2% on a cash basis and was lower than our run rate due to a couple of non-recurring items.","On a recurring basis, same property NOI growth for the fourth quarter would have been about 1.8% on a GAAP basis and 3.9% on a cash basis. This growth is more consistent with our 10-year average of same property growth and relatively inline with our very solid same property growth projected for 2016 in a range from 2% to 4% on a GAAP basis and a range from 3.5% to 5.5% on a cash basis.","Occupancy was strong at 97.2% as of year-end and overall occupancy is expected to remain strong in 2016 due to the solid demand and lack of supply of Class A space in our core urban markets. While we do expect overall occupancy to remain solid, we also expect to temporary decline in occupancy in San Diego and Research Triangle Park, which are both expected to be offset by occupancy gains in other markets, primarily greater Boston.","In San Diego in the first quarter of '16, we have two spaces that will be temporarily vacant at ARE Nautilus and 3985 Sorrento Valley, which aggregate about 60,000 rentable square feet related to two tenants that expanded in the larger spaces.","Also in Research Triangle Park in the first quarter, we expect to receive back about 20,000 rentable square feet that is relatively lower-rent space generating about annual cash rents of about $225,000 per year. Again, overall occupancy is expected to remain strong and in line with 2015 year end occupancy of 97.2%.","Quickly on our JV transactions, the sales of partial interest in three core Class A assets really highlighted the significant value creation we were generating from our development of Class A facilities and key urban innovation clusters. The value we've created on a 100% of these assets was almost $250 million.","The margins on the sales ranged up to almost 60% on 225 Binney Street, which as you know is a grand up development project under the long-term lease to Biogen. Each of these sales involved unencumbered properties and therefore each sale generated more equity capital than a typical sale of real estate subject to the secured mortgage.","The aggregate sales price of these three transactions is approximately $453 million. The proceeds resulted initially in reduction of debt with about two thirds of the sales of price or approximately $300 million representing attractive cost of the efficient equity capital to fund our highly leased value creation growth pipeline.","Moving on to our discipline management of balance sheet and our funding strategy, we continue to execute on our strategy with the disciplined management of our balance sheet. Our ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter annualized was 6.6x, excluding $7.7 million of investment gains in the fourth quarter and leverage was 6.9x.","Timing of dispositions and deliveries of highly-leased development projects will also impact the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA and we typically do not adjust for these partial quarter events since they occur from time to time. We remain focused on continuing improvement in our ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA with normal variances quarter-to-quarter during the year.","Specifically for 2016, we expect the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA to increase in the first half of '16 then decrease in the second half as we complete and place in the service approximately $1.5 million square feet of highly-leased development and redevelopment projects.","Our range for the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter annualized -- fourth quarter '16 annualized is the range from 6.5x to 6.9x. Ultimately our leverage goal remains to be less than six times, which will also improve our overall credit rating and reduce our long-term cost of capital.","Our liquidity as of year-end was approximately $2 billion. This liquidity allows us to be patient and flexible in the timing of the issuance of senior unsecured notes. Additionally, we have very limited debt maturities in 2016, 2017 and 2018. Additional liquidity is anticipated as we finalize the construction loan for 100 Binney Street in the low $300 million range over the next few months.","During the first half of '16, we anticipate amending our $1.5 billion senior unsecured line of credit and our 2019 senior unsecured term loan. The amendment will focus primarily on extending the maturity date of each facility from 2019 to 2021, which will ultimately further extend our weighted average maturity of our outstanding debt.","During the fourth quarter, we raised approximately $75 million at about $90 per share under our ATM program leaving approximately $375 million available, while $90 per share is a below consensus NAV. We believe the blended cost or long-term capital we selected to fund our highly-leased development pipeline will generate significant value. Overall, our strategy is to remain disciplined and funding growth through our highly-leased development pipeline with various sources of long-term capital.","In November 2015, we completed our offering of senior unsecured notes. These notes bear interest at 4.3% and matures in 2026. Again balance sheet liquidity provided us the ability to be patient and flexible for the appropriate window to execute a solid issuance of unsecured notes. Briefly on sources and uses of capital, as detailed on Page 3 of our supplemental package, we have complete disclosures on sources and uses for 2016. ","We updated our construction spend for 2016 resulting in a decrease of $100 million at the mid-point of our guidance. The overall decrease was driven by approximately dozen projects as our team refine budgets, timing of spend and favorably reduce the scope of certain projects. We also updated our disclosures to provide more visibility into internally-generated sources of capital representing 44% of our projected uses for construction. The 44% or $375 million consist of cash flows from operating activities after dividends of about 125 million, plus 250 million of debt funding from growth in EBITDA.","As of December 31 2015, we had one small R&D building located in Maryland classified as held for sale. While we have dispositions targeted in our 2016 guidance, no additional assets met the criteria for classification as held for sale. We do expect to provide additional color on specific dispositions in the next quarter or so.","But keep in mind we just closed on dispositions aggregating almost 600 million in 2015 with about 84% of this completed in the fourth quarter. There is still significant capital looking to invest in high quality, core assets and gateway cities. These locations provide great long term value. These locations are also highly sought after since it's difficult for real estate investors to reach their desired investment allocation into key gateway cities.","Lastly on guidance and closing, the detailed assumptions underline our guidance for 2016 are included on Page 3 of our supplemental package. We believe we are well positioned with a high quality asset base of Class A assets in AAA locations that attract high quality and innovative entities.","54% of our total ABR is from investment grade rate attendants, again a REIT industry leading statistic. We have a favorable triple net lease structure with annual rent escalations which combined with our high quality tenancy drive solid and increasing cash flows.","We are one of the most visible multiyear highly leased development pipelines that will generate about 180 million to 190 million in incremental annual NOI and we will continue our disciplined approach to fund in our value creation pipeline with a combination f long term capital including significant internal sources of capital.","Growth in cash flows from the completion of our development pipeline and disciplined management of our balance sheet will drive further improvement in our credit profile including a reduction in net debt to adjusted EBITDA to less than 6 times ultimately improving our long term costs to capital.","We believe we have the right assets in the right locations that will inspire productivity, efficiency and creativity and success from our highly innovative client tenants. Our team remains focused on continuing to build the best-in-class franchise.","With that I will turn it back to Joel.","Joel Marcus","We'll open it up for Q&A please. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And first we'll go to Manny Korchman with Citi.","Manny Korchman","When you sat down and said, we think in ATM's and appropriate sort of \u2013 raise some equity right now, how did you come up with the $75 million sort of sum given that you had a significant amount of capital that you were going to have t raise this year. Was it a matter of whether the stock was trading or was there some other magic there $75 million number?","Joel Marcus ","Manny I would say, overall our capital plan is fairly fluid throughout the year and we remain flexible in our execution at any given point in time. I would say that facts and circumstances that we were looking at, at that point in time drew us through the conclusion with a variety of matters that we were considering.","I guess it\u2019s also fair to say if you look back with hindsight today it\u2019s easy to say that you would have raised more capital but that\u2019s hindsight 2020 vision so.","Manny Korchman","And then just in terms of disclosure just wondering why you guys sort of limited the amount of disclosure giving on future development projects. In the past year you'd given, at least a book value breakdown and sort of a list of deeper list of projects, now you have condensed that.","Joel Marcus ","Are you refereeing to future land opportunities?","Manny Korchman","Yes exactly.","Joel Marcus ","We didn\u2019t intend to delete any meaningful information. As you know Manny, one of the best disclosure packages in the industry if there\u2019s information you find useful we can definitely look at adding that disclosures that you find relevant, so we will take a look at that for next quarter.","Manny Korchman","That's it for me for today. Thanks guys.","Operator","Moving on we'll go to Sheila McGrath with Evercore ISI.","Sheila McGrath","Good afternoon. Joel, the construction spend in 2016 looks down by 100 million, I was wondering if you could give us some insight where those savings are coming from?","Joel Marcus","Sheila no real magic there then in fact when we have a pipeline as robust as we have, when we have the chance quarter-to-quarter we take a deep dive and as these projects - look at the deliveries for '17 and '18 were on the front end of those projects. So diving deep into the timing of spend over roughly a two year timeframe has allowed us to adjust downward some of the - initially projected spend that would have been incurred in 2016.","And then we also had a number of projects where the scope was refined based on the requirements that are looking at the project. And so we think the landlord dollars going into the project will be meaningfully less and the tenant will take the space with less dollars going in.","Sheila McGrath","Okay, great. And then on the sale of the investments in the fourth quarter either that was a good surprise in terms of using those funds for the development, how should we think about that other investment bucket as a source of proceeds to monetize for the development in 2016?","Joel Marcus","Well, I would say Sheila the thing to think about here with the equity securities that we have in primarily life science companies will continue to monetize our holdings because we have a tremendous amount of unrealized gains. And the number that will probably generate from a proceeds perspective, if I to guess today would probably be between north of $50 million in 2016 and ultimately what we monetize depends on future gains that might be realized from the private securities that we hold today as well.","Sheila McGrath","Okay. Last question Joel you mentioned at a 100 Binney at tenant changing - changing their mind on locating there. Could you just talk about what the driver was at today go to a competitor building or did they re-think expansion?","Joel Marcus","Yes, that\u2019s a sensitive question so let me ask Tom to answer it. It didn\u2019t go to a competitor building and I\u2019d say current plan but - ","Tom Andrews","Yes, there was a tenant that we negotiated - lot of intent to negotiate there - the anchor tenant of the building and they want to expand the exercised, give us a notice that they are going to expand and before the - lease on them was executed they changed their mind and withdrew. So it was an expansion of the existing anchor tenant building.","Q \u2013 Sheila McGrath","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jamie Feldman","Great, thank you. You\u2019ve talked about a target of leverage below six times, can you just walk us through the past to get there and how long you think it would take?","Joel Marcus","Well, it\u2019s not 2016, our \u201916 guidance was 6.5 to 6.9 so it's definitely beyond \u201816 and a lot will depend Jamie as we make our way through 2016 but suffice to say that it\u2019s a 2017, its post 2016 event.","Ultimately you got tremendous EBITDA growth being a primary factor, our ability to recycle capital from the proceeds of property sales will also contribute but keep in mind our goal is to drive that end result which ultimately will improve our long term cost to capital, so it's an important component of our strategy going forward.","Jamie Feldman","So in your capital plan you talk about adding leverage to your growing EBITDA and what's your appetite to just avoid doing that and push leverage even lower in a faster timeframe?","Joel Marcus","I don\u2019t know that - well just to clarify something Jamie I think I heard we don\u2019t expect to - our plan does not anticipate leverage going up other than normal quarter-to-quarter variations. We are looking at on average driving leverage downward and below 6 over time.","Jamie Feldman","So I meant just no adding more debt, may be not your leverage level but if you don\u2019t add incremental debt your leverage will go down and in your capital plan you talk about adding more debt against your growing EBITDA. Do you think about just not adding more debt and that will get to the faster, you are just very comfortable with this number by year end 2016?","Dean Shigenaga","Yes I would say Jamie let\u2019s focus on getting to the end of 2016. It's not a matter of driving our business with no incremental debt, I mean by definition with the EBITDA growth we have, we can support the incremental debt without impacting leverage.","So what you\u2019re talking about it taking the mix of overall capital sources and taking advantage of the factors that drive leverage down whether that\u2019s saving some of the EBITDA growth to reduce leverage, recycling a few more assets that will allow us to further reduce leverage.","We have a variety of leverage to actually pull the driver end result but it\u2019s not something that we\u2019re intending to execute on this year, it\u2019s something that over the next couple of years you\u2019ll see us migrate in that direction and ultimately get exchange.","Jamie Feldman","Okay, thanks. And then for Joel, you had talked about the $2 billion of incremental funding in the NIH and then maybe the President plan. When you talk to industry leaders and looking at that side of the coin and then you look at what\u2019s happening with down BC funding at least in tech, just can you maybe tell us on just the latest thought process among your largest tenants and clients and how they\u2019re thinking about the world and their decision making?","Joel Marcus","Well I think it\u2019s important to remember that when you get to pharma and big biotech, pretty good size publicly traded companies given our roster is heavy credit, those guys are not dependent on the capital markets and honestly haven't been for a long time. So the ups and downs in the capital markets don\u2019t really influence their decision making and I think we\u2019re still seeing a trend of moving from isolated silo locations to the core. In fact I think somebody just sent a supplier Bristol-Myers who is our anchor tenant in 100 Binney is now selling their amazingly gorgeous campus at Wallingford Connecticut.","So I think pharma and bio are continuing to invest strongly. You get 100 plus billion dollars this year in R&D spend to a great host of great opportunities in cancer, neuroscience and a range of other metabolic diseases et cetera.","So I don\u2019t see that people haven\u2019t looked at the market is interrupting that phase of R&D spend. And on the government side I think for the first time in a long time with the uptake of NIH we\u2019re actually seeing way more demand be in Maryland as just one benchmark than there is supply available, we haven\u2019t seen that in maybe a decade.","So I think in general the outlook is stable and I think when it comes to companies that are going public, we will know in the next day or so but there are four biotech IPOs right now ready to price one of which we\u2019re involved with and I would say that assuming pricing goes well, this could be the opening of the - selected opening of the biotech IPO market for 2016 because as you know there were no IPOs in January.","And I would also say that on the venture side, don\u2019t count out the phase of venture capital formation and investment. We know about handful of companies or entities that are raising a large, large funds this year, I know personally several are heavily oversubscribed by institutional investors and so I think the capital formation for venture capital and life science will be pretty good this year.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Moving on we\u2019ll go to Dave Rodgers with Robert W. Baird.","Dave Rodgers","Joel, just wanted to follow-up on that last comment a little bit. I think in your guidance for the year $125 million was available for sale securities. Maybe there was another attached to that too but how much of that comes out of either IPOs or some kind of capital transaction that you\u2019re dependent on to monetize those investments this year?","Dean Shigenaga","Hi, David, Dean here. The question came up little bit earlier, I think it\u2019s for 2016 it\u2019s probably fair to say, we\u2019ll probably have at least $50 million in proceeds from those securities.","Dave Rodgers","That was the dependency part of it, okay, got it. I guess with regard to 2016, Dean you made a comment earlier about where the stock is today or maybe Joel but at the Investor Day, I thought you talked about maybe using more ATM in equity capital in the coming year, but given where the stock is are you still feeling comfortable doing that in some of those other line items in your guidance sheet?","Joel Marcus","I think the way to think about the ATM program, and this is probably true not just for Alexandria, but all companies and I think you'll all agree is that the ATM programs really represent a great tool that every REIT have in place. And when appropriate, it's prudent to use it because it's really cost effective. The fees associated with it is fairly nominal. It's generally 1% to 1.5%. It needs to be used prudently. And I would say that applies to Alexandria as well.","We will be very disciplined in how we execute raising capital to fund our business, but keep in mind we've got a tremendous amount of growth in net asset value to generate in this high-leased development pipeline. ","So we'll remain disciplined in how we execute that.","Dave Rodgers","Okay. On the accounting side, how did you account for the asset sales in the fourth quarter? Were those all now taken off balance sheet? Just wanted to be clear on that.","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah. That's a good question. As some of you may know, the consolidation rules today are little more complicated than they were 10 years ago. The three joint ventures we executed on remain on balance sheet as consolidated JVs. So they were accounted as a more of an equity or financing transaction. So there is no GAAP gain associated with those transactions, but we did take the proceeds. The adjustment -- the amount is effectively the GAAP gain was booked through APEC, not through earnings.","Dave Rodgers","Okay. That's helpful. Saw that footnote. Last question I guess for me maybe to Joel. Construction is spending about $850 million at midpoint. Two questions. One, how much of that is related to additional starts in 2016 or getting ready for additional starts? And I guess the second question is that how good do you feel today relative to 60 or 90 days ago about putting new shovels in the ground for new project? Thanks","Joel Marcus","I think if you go back to Investor Day, I think, we said that we didn't have other than what we had in the pipeline at that point, which included both the Town Center and the Barnes Canyon. ","We didn't have any new projects in the pipeline to break ground on or to move forward, because our pipeline right now is a pretty stellar pipeline and our focus is full lease up on both the '16 and the '17, '18. So at the moment, we don't have anything new in planning.","Peter Moglia","The only other project that we've talked is for Vertex, down in San Diego.","Joel Marcus","Right. And that we disclosed at that time.","Operator","Anything further, Mr. Rodgers?","Dave Rodgers","No. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next we'll go to [Caron Ford] [ph] with Mitsubishi UFJ. Ms. Ford, if you will please check your mute button. We're unable to hear you. Ms. Ford, please proceed with your question.","Joel Marcus","Let's move on.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Jim Sullivan with Cowen Group","Jim Sullivan","Thank you. Joel, when you talked about what's happening in terms of the color on demand variable for life science. Generally, you painted a picture of an industry where demand is really not cyclical, not really impacted by what's happening in the economy overall to a great degree.","But I do have a question. We do seem to be seeing a higher level of M&A transactions among some of the larger life science companies. I'm just curious, as you think about that, number one, do you place your understanding and discussion with your tenants? Do you think we're going to see continued high level of M&A activity? And do you anticipate it would have a negative impact on demand at all?","Joel Marcus","Yes. It's a good question. I think that historically, well, maybe 2015 is the high-water mark for M&A broadly speaking. And a lot of the M&A, as you know, has been in the payer sector, it's been in the generic space. It hasn't necessarily been purely in the ethical, pharmaceutical or biotech area, although there have been clearly some opportunities in that world.","But I think when we've seen M&A in general, I mean it's not always the case, but in general, the target is usually looked at unless it's generally a single product purchase; in which case good example of that is when Onyx was bought by Amgen they were looking at - there were sweeter products, but primarily the main multiple myeloma product was the main target.","And so - and Amgen also had a lot of extra space in South San Francisco city looked to sublease that. You know we're on the percipience of that being fully sub leased, but we still have Amgen credit for 10 years.","I think that's more of the exception where we've seen M&A of companies that have a platform of opportunities with multiple shots on goal or they're looking to essentially get a cadre of very high-quality researchers, which often happens when a farmer buys M&A. Those locations are generally preserved and they're preserved, because they tend to be in the core locations where you've got the collaboration and the innovation at its bet. And I don't think that's going to change at all.","Jim Sullivan","So if we think about that collectively, in your core markets, you have had this very favorable tailwind now for five years or so where you had a very strong increase in demand relative to the ability of the market to supply product. Is it your view in spite of a slowdown in the economy that's very favorable supply-demand condition will be sustained over the next couple of years?","Joel Marcus","Yes. Pretty. I feel pretty good about it, because if you go to the best locations, you go to a New York City, you go to Cambridge, you go to a Mission Bay, you go to Lake Union in Seattle, there is virtually no new supply, there is highly constrained environment for new development - let alone things like Prop M or whatever.","And I think that's going to be a big check. And I think even if demand moderates, because no one knows where this market is going, the macro market in the sense of how severe or not severe it is, but most people feel that it's not a replay of '08-'09.","Well, I remember in one quarter, I think, it's kind of funny. I remember this quarter well. I think it was maybe first second quarter of '09, there was maybe a 40,000 square foot lease in all of New York side and actually we signed two leases in Cambridge during those first two quarters for well over 100,000 square feet.","So we feel good about being positioned in a very defensive posture in the best locations where you have real constrained supply and the demand we still see in virtually all the markets is still good.","Jim Sullivan","Okay and the final question from me. You obviously have some significant tech tenant signed up for space under development in San Francisco. And I wonder if you could give us an update on your views as to that source of demand in that market. What do you expect to unfold over the next year or two?","Joel Marcus","Well, I guess the good news and the bad news is we've got 100% occupancy so we can't feel much in a way of demand. But I think when it comes to our tenants, the three that we've underwritten and spent a lot of time with, I think, Uber continues to be a just a transformational change in the way we do a number of things including transportation.","But well beyond that and we certainly see that they're going to be a big force for many years to come. I mean look today, we started with Google back in 1998 in their first campus and they were at Series A and today they are now the largest company in the world, I guess by equity market cap.","We also feel very good about Pinterest. Pinterest was just highlighted by Fortune as one of the three so called unicorns that are most likely to succeed. We think their business both on the personal side, but extending to the commercial side has huge opportunities. And then on Stripe I think we continue to use stripe as a great company and it continues to be the back bone of the medium size B2b business community. So I think we feel good about our situation.","I think overall tech -- as I said, I think you're going to see some shakeup. Clearly there is evaluation transformation going on, but based on what I know and my conversations with venture guys up in the bay area, which we have all the time.","The model, as I mentioned earlier, Jim, moving from building platforms to building profitable businesses and that's something - and that moves them from being less dependent on either the private or the public capital markets and that's by intentional design.","So I think you'll see the really high-quality companies continue to do well and move away from the need to do private or public financings when the markets are not receptive and the ones that just simply can't do that will I'm sure go away.","Jim Sullivan","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And next we'll go to Mike Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.","Mike Carroll","Thanks. Joel, given the fall early in the capital markets, do you expect life savings companies will be more cautious making long-term real estate decisions or is this not really driving factor for these type of tenants?","Joel Marcus","Well, I think everybody is - no one is immune to the larger markets. And people pay attention obviously, when a radical transformation in the economic environment like 08\/09 happens, obviously, everybody pays attention to that, but I think in this market, people will make good decisions, good business decisions.","Yes, they may be a lot more careful, but I think essentially their evaluations are based on in the life science industry, the quality of their pipeline. And I think they're going to make good decisions on that. And again, they are not by enlarge dependent on capital markets.","Mike Carroll","Okay. And then can you give us some color on your plan to asset sales in 2016. Will these sales be similar to the ones completed in 2015 and are there any specific markets you're focused on?","Joel Marcus","As my comments earlier, Michael, were that we're going to be looking carefully and provide more color in the next quarter or two on our dispositions. But keep in mind, we just completed a tremendous amount in almost $600 million this year, most of it in the fourth quarter or in December for that matter. So we've been active in the market and we'll provide more color here soon.","Mike Carroll","And then you completed a lot of the non-core sales already right. So those would still be kind of like the core JV type fill?","Dean Shigenaga","No. I think the simplest way to think of it is that we look through the asset base from time to time and I think almost any category of assets we hold is their gain. There is a little bit in every bucket that can be executed on. So stay tune there.","Mike Carroll","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And next we'll go to Manny Korchman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman","Hi, it's Michael Bilerman from Citi. Dean, just a methodology sort of question as you think about your debt EBITDA, which you sort of just present sort of whatever your EBITDA is annualized and clearly this quarter with the amount of gains that you successfully liquidated some of your holdings that created a big bump in EBITDA, which is not really sort of recurring EBITDA creates a lot of capital, but it's not a recurring number.","And I\u2019m just curious, in your targets that you have does that include some level of gain that you're annualizing? Is that - I guess you're thinking about also from a GAAP perspective not cash. I'm curious when you put out these forecast what's in and what's out?","Dean Shigenaga","Well keep in mind Michael, for the fourth quarter of this year - at the beginning of the year I think we've stayed pretty close to target. We're anticipating to be sub 7% and we ended up at 6.9% as we reported without the 7.7%.","So I don't think that 6.6% came about just because we executed some sales or securities. We're not looking for anything lumpy in our guidance and that's consistent with how we presented the numbers for this year.","I think your question does provide a great opportunity to discuss one of the things that I think people should consider\u00b8 although we don't make this into our numbers is that we have a tremendous amount of contractual cash rents that have not commenced as a result of recent deliveries, development and redevelopment projects.","And the contractual rents are under leases, so they will kick-in. A simplest way of looking at it is that if the world, not the world really, but if things came to an end and we stopped building product, the cash flows would kick-in and significantly reduce our leverage metrics.","And so as much as we try to think about making pro rata adjustments for dispositions or deliveries is also that other component of contractual cash flows that aren't in place yet and that's really significant.","And so there is a variety of things that move back and forth, Michael. We just try to keep it simple and report the numbers the way they fall out and be clear on what the number consist of so investors can make adjustments as appropriate.","Michael Bilerman","And how should we think about that $75 million of equity, because it's basically 0.2 turns on debt-to-EBITDA and got here from 7.169 on a full-year basis. How should we think about when that was executed? Did it replace other cash that you\u2019re going to raise to get your debt-to-EBITDA down to that target below 7x level?","Dean Shigenaga","Yes. I think, Michael, in my opening comments I alluded to that that it allowed us given the timing and given we were working with the kind of the sale of 409-499 Illinois allowed us to take less equity from that or less proceeds from that transactions by doing the ATM and also we didn't have to either lower 2015 or 2016 guidance so it turned out to be kind of a good thing even though however maybe.","Michael Bilerman","And when was that equity raised during the fourth quarter just from a timing perspective relative to Investor Day?","Dean Shigenaga","December, Michael.","Michael Bilerman","So post Investor Day?","Dean Shigenaga","Yes. Our Investor Day was early, early December so.","Joel Marcus","After that and the transactions closed after that as well. So we were looking at all the interplay of those various things to get with the security sales.","Michael Bilerman","And just last one. Dean, your referenced the hindsight 20\/20. We wish you could have told more knowing what you know today in terms of where the stock market has gone and specifically your share price. I guess may be just walk us through the internal debate when you think about your company with obviously a very high released development platform, but it is development so it always carry risk even if its pre-leased; and certainly a tenant base that is high credit, but certainly a different segment on the market in terms of healthcare, biotech and technology; and then leverage.","When you think about those three risks, how much did you - which provides opportunity as well, I'm not trying to demean the opportunity set, but I guess collectively was their discussion just sort of say and you look at what ACC did last night in terms of their equity raise, very large equity raised. How do you discuss internally saying, you know what, let's just do a large equity raise, it will be a little bit earnings diluted, it's not going to be that NAV dilutive given where our stock price is. Was that debated at all in December?","Joel Marcus","Well, I'll tell you, the answer is we felt because one of the compelling factors, Michael, is with 2016 deliveries and a very large set of 2017 and that little bit ended 2018 deliveries as opposed to a lot of companies who don't have a development pipeline and on boarding NOI that would be literally may be 25% of what our current NOI is.","That wasn't such a compelling opportunity. We felt that we could take a small slice of equity, meet all of our goals, continue to deleverage. And there are bunch of companies that are much higher leverage than we are so we feel good about our path. And we have options, because of those - because of the big pipeline.","So sure you can always think about a big, rip the band aid off, but we didn't feel it was necessary or appropriate at that time. It's still in hindsight, don't feel that as well.","Michael Bilerman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And next we'll go to Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities","Rich Anderson","Thanks. I just want to clarify the ATM was announced the date after Investor Day, right? I think I remember that correctly.","Joel Marcus","I think that's correct.","Rich Anderson","Okay. I just wanted to make sure I understood that timing. My only question is to what extend, Dean, kind of alluded to stopping building if the world comes to an end or business comes to an end. Dramatic way to say, but I get the point. To what extend is delaying 2017, 2018 deliveries to further out years kind of on your mind right now. Given where the world is and your stock prices or is it just - that's just too far out to be considering at this point.","Dean Shigenaga","I don't think we have to think about that, because I think we have path to fund them. We have a path to get to a sub six leverage number and those become important deliveries. They're also contractually required when you sign a lease, you perform under the lease and we\u2019ve got the brand reputation in the area and why we've been able to attract the partners we have for the leases we\u2019ve under committed to and under \u2013 put under contract.","So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s part of our calculus and I think based on most economies view of the world, this is not a structural banking failure situation, there is tough times due to oil in China and may be the high yield market et cetera. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in the same position.","I mean when we \u2013 I remember Dean and I when we after Lehman collapsed in September of 2008 literally within six weeks we had cut CapEx 50%, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in that environment today.","Rich Anderson","And so in some ways the continuation of the longer out development business is a necessary part of your de-leveraging process?","Dean Shigenaga","I think it is especially given that it\u2019s a highly leased development pipeline. If it wasn\u2019t, I think we would be thinking very differently.","Rich Anderson","Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","And there are no further questions. I\u2019ll turn it back to our presenters for any closing comments.","Joel Marcus","Thank you all for your time and wishing everybody a Happy and Healthy New Year. Thank you again.

My name is Lauren, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Paula Schwartz. Please go ahead.","Paula Schwartz","Thank you, and good afternoon everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus. Please go ahead, Joel.","Joel Marcus","Thank you, and welcome everybody to the third quarter call. Today with me are Dean Shigenaga, Chief Financial Officer; Steve Richardson, Chief Operating Officer; Dan Ryan, Executive Vice President; and Tom Andrews, Executive Vice President. And firstly, I'd like to start by congratulating the entire Alexandria team on a truly excellent third quarter; operating and financial results, really in all respect.","Let me turn to the core to start the conversation. We had a very solid third quarter, 96.2% occupancy. We leased over 1 million square feet. And as you know, with the 4 million square feet year-to-date is for 2015 the highest in the company's history, with average lease term this quarter of about 8.7 years, very good.","I think that really goes to the heart that the team has successfully executed and taken advantage of this great high-demand environment. Also 8.8% cash leasing spreads, 4.8% cash same-store property NOI growth, coupled with strong annual escalations in virtually every lease and triple-net lease structure in virtually every lease also has really driven our high margins. We're very proud of the core.","Really proof positive, our client tenant user base wants to be on Alexandria campuses and in Alexandria owned and managed Class A buildings, because we are the brand. And we take the time and make it our business and solemn commitment to understand our tenants businesses, their space needs, growth as well as their challenges. And most of the facilities we deal with are really mission-critical facilities of our user base.","Moving to demand, to give you a sense of what we see at the operating ground level. It's certainly true, there is a very supply constraint space availability in Alexandria's urban campus markets, particularly Cambridge and the City of San Francisco. This tightness of availability has certainly impacted behavior of some tenants in the market.","Demand for Alexandria's urban campus and Class A buildings is the strongest in the company's 21-year history. And we're really blessed to be in the absolute best locations with the best assets at the intersection of the two most important successful industries, life science and technology.","Increasing macro volatility, things like China, et cetera, have clearly had an impact on decision making by some tenants in the market. We believe that Alexandria's best-in-class campuses and facilities though will continue to maintain high occupancy and strong rental rates during such volatility. The window is open for biotech, but has become more selective regarding quality and valuation, and undoubtedly we'll have some impact on certain tenants in the market.","Public sector, big tech at the forefront of mobile and cloud have had a banner year in 2015. Some and certainly not all of the private tech companies with $1 billion valuations and above, that are private, may have some challenges with sustaining recent peaks in private market valuations, which may have some impact again on decisions by some of tenants in the market.","Moving to tenant strength and selection, something that's really very important here at Alexandria. I think it's great to note that 53% of our annual base rent is from investment-grade tenants, one of the highest in the REIT industry. And our duration of our top-20 tenants, comprising almost half of our ABR is 8.6 years. So we have strong, solid, durable and secured cash flows.","Our very high-quality science and tech team coupled with our world-class advisors, provide us first-in-class research on our tenant industries and also our tenant underwriting, maybe two examples in point with leases signed this quarter. Let's go to Pinterest first.","We signed a 150,000 square foot lease for 100% of our 505 Brannan Street campus project in one of the absolute best locations in the City of San Francisco for our first phase of development. We had multiple users looking at this spectacular location, but we chose Pinterest because of our longer-term relationship with the management team.","Initial discussion started in kind of the spring of 2014, when Pinterest had raised $750 million with a valuation of $5 billion. Since then, Pinterest has raised an additional $1.3 billion on a valuation of $11 billion. So we try to be highly discriminating in our tenant selection.","One of our key advisors is deeply connected to Pinterest, which also helped as well. We understand and like their user base and growth prospects. We feel that the B2B business will be even more potent than their historical B2C.","On the multiple revenue stream aspect, we like the ad revenues, the approach they are using to buyable pins and partnerships with brands that can give them multiple stream of investment or multiple revenue streams.","We also like the management team and the investors of first class, including Andreessen Horowitz, Bessemer Trust, Fidelity, Goldman and Wellington. The financial metrics are also important. We looked at cash on hand and ability of them to survive in the downturn. We also looked at their cash burn and the ability to cut it, in case they need to. And also critically important, all these companies a reasonable and methodical pathway to profitability.","Moving on to bluebird bio. We signed a lease for 253,000 square feet at our 60 Binney Street property with bluebird bio. Overall demand in the Cambridge market at the time of selection of bluebird for the 60 Binney project was significant. There was a mix of demand both, credit and non-credit as well as life science and technology.","Space needs and timing vary considerably for each requirement. IBM Watson was in the market and we were fortunate to capture them as a subtenant on a 10 years lease at the 75\/125 Binney Street. That location and space matched their timing well, as 60 and 100 Binney developments would have been delivered too late for their requirement.","Similarly, Alexandria was also able to fill the requirement for Bristol-Myers at 100 Binney, since we had opportunistically begun the project. We also had secured Sanofi-Genzyme as our anchor at 50 Binney. So bluebird bio was ultimately selected based on a number of factors, including timing, space needs, relationship and we have high degree of respect for Nick Leschly, the CEO, whose father also was CEO of Smithkline Beecham.","The quality of the company, the profile, the quality of the technology and the prospects, their space need match well with the 60 Binney project, which will lead to significant construction cost savings, and given the ability to build both 50 and 60 Binney simultaneously. Alexandria has also had an important and strategic relationship both with the company and also its early investors and Board members. And we also see the overall mix within the ecosystem to be an important consideration for a long-term value.","Similar to Biogen, bluebird is a few years away from potential regulatory, as Biogen was a number of years ago from potential regulatory approval of its first product. It would then commence commercial sales soon thereafter and continue to build out their product offering and grow the company.","Both, the stage and growth potential of the company are critical to the overall ecosystem and fundamentally, while large pharma companies keep moving into Kendall Square today. At the end of the day, we have three publicly traded biotech companies looking at these Binney projects. And we ultimately chose bluebird for 60 Binney.","bluebird has almost $1 billion in cash and marketable securities as of the end of the second quarter. Its current market cap exceeds $3 billion. I won't get into the drugs, but it is clearly the leader in the gene therapy area. And we believe that their clinical and preclinical programs as well as their partnership will lead to a very successful company over the years. The current demand is still solid in Cambridge and new requirements of both early and later stage as well.","Remember too, we founded Alexandria 21 years ago on the basis that we could successfully underwrite a complex life science industry, because no one else up to that time had really been able to successfully do it on a national platform. And 21 years later, I'd say, we're doing a great job of it.","On our highly prelease development and redevelopment, this provides very strong protection for future cash flows, Dean will highlight. The 1.5 million square feet at 89% leased to be delivered by the fourth quarter of '16, Page 35 of the supplement. And on Page 36 of the supplement, the 1.8 million square feet of development and redevelopment to be delivered in 2017 and 2018.","We're building the budget with very solid yields and good margins to reasonable exit cap rates, as you can see. We're also very careful about any new starts and we'll look at each and every one of them very carefully.","Steve will answer any questions on the new disposition announced, the sale of the partial interest at 1500 Owens. So together with 225 Binney announced last quarter, we've secured a very high quality and sophisticated buyer and long-term partner. Excellent price discovery, I think, for net asset value and now two of our top submarkets, San Francisco and Cambridge, and strong price per square foot. I think this demonstrates Alexandria's ability to create value through careful and prudent asset recycling and high value and high rental rate development.","On final comments, couple of things, I'd say, the recent congressional budget deal, there will be about $1 billion to $2 billion additional for NIH per year in funding, which is a good thing and increasing the FDA budget, which is also good.","There has been a lot of noise around a pharma. I think it's fair to say today, the five majors J&J, Roche, Novartis, Pfizer and Merck, all have met or exceeded their expectations and have broad-based new product pipelines, which are very sustainable. They're got multibillion dollar products in the pipeline as well. And I think the noise around pricing is clearly misguided.","Specialty pharma, all of Valeant and Turing, where there is little R&D and very aggressive approach to the market built on M&A and other kinds of different approaches, I think is where the scrutiny should lie. Biotech continues to innovate, solving dreaded diseases, and that's really front and center.","So let me finish, before I turn it over to Dean, by a couple of comments about biotech in general. 734 IPOs have been launched over the past 36 years, raising about $35 billion. That investment more or less has roughly yielded $850 billion of current value for the sector.","The window is clearly open, but more selective on quality and valuation as I said. And I think something that's important, the sentiment, not fundamentals, have turned negative, as the noise factor is high in a political environment. Sentiment, not fundamentals.","Science and medical advances and innovation are accelerating. Cures will clearly save large amounts of money in the future and there is only sector that can really address that and that's the biopharma sector. Bottomline is, the biotech and pharma sector, biotech in particular, is well-financed. Regulators are supportive, innovation is present and valuations are lower, leading to an optimistic outlook.","Let me turn it over to Dean.","Dean Shigenaga","Thanks, Joel. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everybody. I've got three important topics to cover today. First, growth in NOI and net asset value through highly lease value creation projects; second, prudent management of our balance sheet and our funding strategy; and third, key capital matters for the fourth quarter, including important comments on our self registration filing this morning.","Jumping right in, growth in net operating income and net asset value through disciplined allocation of capital into highly-leased development and redevelopment projects really have highlighted nicely in our supplemental. And Joel referenced Page 35 and 36, I encourage you to take a look at those two pages.","But for the fourth quarter of '16, we're expecting to deliver about 1.5 million square feet by then. It's fairly backend weighted. This is highly leased at about 89%. And we're going to deliver about $75 million to $80 million of annual incremental NOI upon stabilization of the square footage.","Additionally, on Page 36 of our supplemental, we've highlighted another 1.8 million square feet, again highly leased at 71%. That is going to contribute another $105 million to $110 million of annual incremental NOI upon stabilization. And these are projects scheduled for completion really in 2017 and 2018. All this square footage, about 3.3 million square feet is targeted with average cash yield just north of 7%.","In comparison, we recently announced the partial sale of two Class A properties with one located in Mission Bay and the other located in Cambridge at an average cap rate of 4.6%, really highlighting the tremendous value we have generated through the ground up development of these two properties. This also highlights the value creation in process on approximately 3.3 million highly-leased rentable square feet, again to be placed in service in 2016, 2017 and 2018.","Moving on toward the prudent management of our balance sheet and our funding strategy. As we've highlighted, our balance sheet is solid with really well-laddered debt maturities and really limited maturities through 2018. Our debt maturities for 2016 were reduced subsequent to quarter end with the repayment of $76 million in October, leaving less than $235 million maturing in 2016\/","Our balance sheet liquidity as of September 30 is over $1.2 billion on a pro forma basis to reflect the $350 million, and commitments available under the construction loan for 50 and 60 Binney Street that we closed in October. Liquidity by the end of the year is expected to be approximately $1.8 billion, as we complete an unsecured bond offering very soon in several important sales of real estate.","We remain on track to meet our net debt to adjusted EBITDA goal of 6.9x by yearend. As you know, we focus on decisions that drive long-term versus short-term performance, including our leverage goal. We continue to execute on improvements in our credit metrics, including net debt to adjusted EBITDA in order to further enhance our balance sheet with flexibility.","In order to provide transparency in various metrics, our disclosures include short-term trends with quarter annualized metrics and longer-term trends with trailing 12-month metrics. The longer-term metrics eliminate quarter-to-quarter volatility that may appear in the quarterly metrics. We believe our approach provides the investment community better visibility in the trends and various metrics that we disclose.","Moving on to our funding strategy. You may have noticed in recent years, we have generated over $500 million to fund growth through development. The two drivers of this included roughly $125 million per year of cash flows from operating activities after dividends. And approximately $400 million, primarily from long-term fixed rate debt from the unsecured bond market through growth in EBITDA.","Growth in EBITDA allows us to fund a significant amount of construction without increasing leverage. And we expect to continue to fund approximately $0.5 billion of construction in 2016 and 2017 from these two sources of capital.","Demand for high-quality core real estate remain strong and has allowed us to sell on average of approximately $200 million per year over the past five years. We expect demand for high-quality real estate to continue into 2016. And accordingly, we anticipate real estate sales to remain an important component of our capital plan for 2016.","Over the past five years, I think, you've noted that our capital strategy execution has been proven to be very prudent on the management of common equity, including our projection for 2015, the proceeds of the issuance of common stock has represented really only approximately 20% to 25% of our total sources of capital.","As a reminder, there has been no significant common equity issuance in the past two years. Our capital plan on average for the last five years has utilized significantly less common equity than expected for leverage at 6.9x, primarily due to the benefit of retained operating cash flows, significant EBITDA growth and sales of real estate.","In summary, we will continue funding our growth with the most cost-efficient long-term capital. Most importantly, we will execute these objectives, while we also focus on generating growth and FFO per share and net asset value.","Turning to our capital plan for the remainder of 2015. Most importantly, sales of real estate, we have about $600 million in proceeds forecasted for the fourth quarter with approximately $300 million or 50% of this under contract to close in the fourth quarter.","The other $300 million or 50% is moving along quickly and is focused on the sale of a partial interest in a core property, while we also continue to pursue the sale or sales of other core-like properties. As a policy, we do not comment or speculate on potential sales beyond the current disclosures.","Next, on our shelf registration statement. You may have noticed our shelf registration was filed this morning. This filing is required, is effective upon filing and simply eliminates one additional filing in order for the company to issue unsecured bonds. The investment grade bond market has shown improvement in recent weeks, as you probably are well aware of, and we do expect to issue bonds very soon. We remain focused on tenure of 10 years, since it fits wells into our debt maturities.","Additionally, as mentioned last quarter, our ATM expired in early June and we do expect to file a new program. Just to be clear, we do not expect to use the ATM program this year, as we are on track to complete our projected real estate sales for 2015. Lastly, we completed one of the two construction loans anticipated this year and we are focused now on closing the second construction loan in the coming months.","Moving on briefly to guidance and some closing comments. The detailed assumptions underlying our updated guidance for 2015 are included on Page 3 and 4 of our supplemental package. We are in a great position today with the real estate strategy focused on unique campuses and AAA urban innovation cluster locations. We have one of the best teams in the REIT industry and a top brand that collectively drives demand from high quality and innovative companies.","Internal growth is solid and is expected to remain solid in 2016. We generate high-quality cash flows with 53% of our ABR from investment grade tenants. Our cash flows are stable with 96% triple net leases. Our cash flow has increased contractually with 95% of our leases containing annual rent escalations, averaging up almost 3%.","Demand remain solid for our high-quality buildings and AAA locations in very supply-constraint innovation submarkets, and is expected to continue to drive very solid cash and GAAP rental rate increases on leasing activity over the next year.","We continue to focus on disciplined allocation of capital into our visible and highly-leased multi-year value creation pipeline. We will continue to execute on prudent management of our balance sheet and funding of our growth with the most cost efficient long-term capital. Most importantly, we will execute these objectives, while we also focus on generating growth in FFO per share, net asset value and common stock dividends.","We believe we have the right assets in right location that will inspire productivity, efficiency, creativity and success for our highly innovative client tenants. Our team remains focused on continuing to build the best-in-class franchise.","Thank you. And I'll turn it back to Joel.","Joel Marcus","Operator, we're ready to go Q&A please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi.","Manny Korchman","Just thinking about marketable securities sales as a potential source of equity, how are the changes in the biotech stock markets change the way you think about selling or holding on to your marketable securities there?","Joel Marcus","I don't think they've had that much influence. As you know from this past quarter, we did have a number of sales and we'll continue that over the coming quarters. We still have significant built-in gains. So we're comfortable. And I think the quality of the holdings that we have is high. And so we feel very good about the position we're in. And we try not to be just pure market timers.","Manny Korchman","Joel, you guys disclosed the amount of those gains. What was the underlying balance that you sold to get to those gain numbers?","Joel Marcus","Bear with us, one second. I don't have the proceeds right in front of me, Manny. I think that's what you're getting to, right?","Manny Korchman","Yes, the actual sale amounts, exactly.","Joel Marcus","Again, I don't have the actual proceeds. I think the investment disposition this quarter probably netted out a slight positive in overall investing activity, meaning dispositions net of reinvestment. So it was a small net cash receipt at the end of the day for the quarter.","Manny Korchman","I mean, can we think about it in terms of multiples, so was it 2x gain? Was it sort of flat to what you held? Can you give us some idea of just the magnitude?","Joel Marcus","Well, to put it into perspective, Manny, what we are looking at is on the $104 million, $105 million of unrealized gains we have as of quarter end, I think we only have about a $30 million adjustment.","Manny Korchman","My other question was, so there has been some recent news on Biogen cutting its work force. Has that impacted yours or do you think it will impact [technical difficulty]?","Joel Marcus","Yes, so I'll ask Tom to speak on that.","Thomas Andrews","It was reported that Biogen might cut about 800 heads in Cambridge, in Eastern Massachusetts. Recall, they lease or own about 1 million square feet in Kendall Square and they lease about 350,000 square feet in Weston 128, which is 50% subleased to another company. But we see no evidence that that's relatively small layoff in terms of the total headcount and space occupancy is going to impact Kendall Square at all.","Joel Marcus","That may impact their future need for space here in the short-to-medium term, but certainly they're not abandoning space that they have. And we own their headquarters building together with TIA, so that were in great shape of that building.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jamie Feldman","So you had commented that when you chose bluebird, there were several biotech companies that opted for bluebird. Can you just talk about across your major market, how many types of conversations like that you're having, like when you have a space, the multiples of tenants that are interested in that space?","Joel Marcus","I think it's very common. I mean, both Steve and Tom can give you color on that, but I think in virtually every case these days there are multiple users for the same space, and obviously timing, rental rate, quality of tenant and a whole lot of things factor into that.","Stephen Richardson","We do, we have more demand than we have supplies certainly in the market. We're tracking 22 different tenants in excess of 100,000 square feet in San Francisco alone and then another 6 million square feet of demand in the Greater Stanford area. So we are being very selective. And we do have a number of options that we choose from when we're selecting these tenants.","Thomas Andrews","As Joel mentioned, we did have multiple parties pursuing the space that we ended up selecting bluebird for. We have multiple parties looking at the remaining space at 100 Binney where we're working to do some additional leasing on our remaining 180,000 or so square feet, which delivers in late calendar '17, so its not uncommon at all for us to have multiple prospects and we're managing carefully to try to optimize our tenanted growth.","Jamie Feldman","And so those three tenants, I assume that's who you're talking to for some of the other space?","Joel Marcus","One of them, yes. They're all three public. One is an existing tenant, while two were existing tenants, and one is not, but the answer is yes.","Jamie Feldman","And then can you talk about, I think in the supplemental, there's still no total cost projection for 400 Dexter or 100 Binney. Can you talk about what those final cost on those and why it's not in here?","Joel Marcus","Jamie, what we try to do is, as soon as we announce the new development to give as much information that's available at the time new projects commence. Occasionally, 400 Dexter, as an example is going through a few different iterations, but we do have a general sense of where we're going to fall out.","But until we feel comfortable that the disclosures will be final, we prefer to wait until some of the moving pieces are resolved. I can tell you that generally speaking I think in Cambridge, we're probably looking roughly high level $900 a foot all-in at completion on 50 and 60 as an example.","As a baseline, there is some different attributes in 100 Binney. And as we round out our budget, we'll disclose both the cost of completions and the returns, but I would say that you should keep in mind the returns are going to be very similar directionally with 50 and 60 Binney. And again, I gave you overall returns for all these projects that are delivering in '16, '17 and '18 and its just north of 7%. So I hope that gives you some comfort that we're building solid projects and we'll provide these disclosures in the near term.","Jamie Feldman","So you said $900 per square foot in Cambridge, what about in Seattle?","Joel Marcus","Let me not comment specifically, because it may not be applicable to that project right now, but suffice to say, Jamie, that our overall average yields on a cash basis are just north of 7%.","Jamie Feldman","But I'm saying cost per foot?","Joel Marcus","I know. Well, if we were prepared to disclose that, Jamie, we would have put it in the sub. So let us refine the budget and when we're prepared to provide that disclosure, we will. But it falls right down the fairway from a yield perspective.","Jamie Feldman","And then I guess just thinking about next year, do you think your same-store NOI would be higher or lower than what we've seen in '15, based on what you have coming up?","Joel Marcus","Well, Jamie, I think the way we'd like the community to think about same property performance, I think over a long term, cash same property performance is probably averaged about 5%. And I think the way you build up to that number is, keep in mind, you've got triple rent leases that would drive stable cash flows, but you've got annual escalations that are approaching 3% embedded in our leases.","So your cash NOI will grow close to 3%. You're marking-to-market roughly, and I'm going to use simple math for the next step, roughly 10% of the portfolio being mark-to-market. And we're marking that close to 10% right now. So you get 1% drop and down to NOI on top of the 3% of the annual escalations.","And then you've got the opportunity to early renew. And if you look at the leasing activity, the leasing activity is easily 2x, the expirations. And so we are getting ahead and capturing some rental growth, call it, somewhere between 1% to 3%. Dropping to NOI 3% would be just a home run year.","But if you pick up 1% to 2%, now you built up a 5% to 6% base cash same property NOI performance. I don't want to get into guidance for 2016, which we'll do in December, but I think overall core performance is going to be very solid for '16.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore.","Sheila McGrath","Joel, I was wondering if you could help us understand for newer companies like bluebird or Pinterest or Stripe, do you underwrite such that the development yields would be a little bit higher or higher rent for these newer tenants or do you charge the same as strong pharma, credit pharma, tenant?","Joel Marcus","Yes. I think that depends on the -- and I'll ask Tom and Steve to comment. I think it depends a lot on the particular building, the particular rental rate in the situation, their particular program, because every tenant and every lease is actually different. It isn't vanilla like there is three vanilla choices and they're all pretty similar. They're actually somewhat different in each respect, but I'll ask these guys to give you kind of an on the ground comment.","Thomas Andrews","I think, as Joel said, each of these transaction is different. So it's really hard, you really can't compare them, as if they're vanilla deals. There's always a nuance to them. And sometimes, for example, even a more creditworthy company, we maybe able to get them to pay more, because of the particular situation that they are in with respect to that particular deal.","So I wouldn't say that there is any -- that you could consistently assume that we get more money from a tenant who might be less creditworthy than another tenant that might have been a candidate for the space. I mean it really comes down to specifics of the negotiation and the transaction.","Joel Marcus","And certainly, security deposit is different. But Steve, you could?","Stephen Richardson","Yes, just to add to that, Sheila, it is just a very dynamic environment. The tenants are moving very quickly to lockdown space. So I think what's really important when you step back is really the tenant underwriting and how we go about valuing the companies and looking at their long-term tenancy and partnership in the building with them. So that's where we really focus our attention.","Sheila McGrath","Joel, also you have a well leased development pipeline for '16, '17, '18, should we assume that you're remaining patient on other land development opportunities, or because you have it enough on the plate right now, are or you in the market looking for additional development opportunities?","Joel Marcus","Yes, I think in my prepared comments, Sheila, I mentioned that any new developments we'd be looking at pretty carefully. We've got the 1.5 million square feet that Dean mentioned on Page 35 and the 1.8 million on Page 36. That's a pretty robust pipeline for '16, '17 and '18. I think there are opportunities that will come to us whether they come through current campuses, for example, in San Diego or other locations. And certainly in New York we're in discussions on the new building.","But I wouldn't say anything. We're not looking at kicking off anything imminently at all. And anything we do, we'd be mindful of the macro market environment, and then obviously the demand in the market and then just our overall cash usage for that particular year, so it's kind of a complex equation there that we look at.","Sheila McGrath","One last quick one, just on construction cost. Any worry that construction costs or labor moving higher -- labor cost?","Joel Marcus","Certainly, New York is a big worry. I think today, we're very fortunate when we kicked off the West Tower back at the kind of the end of '12 and early '13 we had a really great price point in the New York market. Today, I don't think that would be true. So that's certainly an important factor. And again, Dan and Tom, and Steve can comment on pricing. Up till now, I think rental rate increases have outstripped construction price increases, but it's something to pay attention to.","Daniel Ryan","Yes, we're seeing some pressure on some construction material, particularly glazing. That has kind of been offset by savings and structural steel due to Chinese sort of drop off in usage. So on balance, we're cautious. We're trying to really primarily focus on some of these long lead items to be able to lock that in today. But we don't think it's a super material impact, but I don't know how you guys feel in your markets.","Thomas Andrews","I'd say that we've got major projects underway, where we've done a vast majority of the buyout in prior months. So I think we feel very comfortable. As Joe was saying that the rental rate increases that we experienced in the market certainly outstripped the construction price increases that we were seeing when we were buying out these jobs. But we do watch it very carefully. Curtain wall, as Dan mentioned is a tough trade right now. There is so many projects going vertical in the eastern cities with curtain wall, so it's tough, but we've got that well managed on our projects in Cambridge.","Stephen Richardson","I think we're seeing pricing pressure from subcontractors. I think they're very busy in the Bay area, in particular, with both the residential and life science and technology construction under the way. What we do though for each of these projects, especially as we get into '17 and '18 deliveries is have a very clear annual escalation in construction pricing. So that is well baked into their pro formas and the anticipated yields, so we don't think we'll be surprised beyond what we've already got already baked in.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.","Rich Anderson","Dean, you mentioned that on a long term average on same-store, I know you don't want to get into 2016 guidance, but do you think that the 8% to 10% re-leasing spreads that you've been getting -- you're guiding to this year is a sustainable number for the next couple of years or you kind of see that, it kind of trailing down based on where the re-leasing is going to be happening in future years?","Joel Marcus","I think Rich, what's important to keep in mind on leasing performance, at least going out for the next 12 months is that, we are dealing with some of the best buildings in the best locations in very, very supply constraint markets. And so we're in a good environment, where the best most innovative companies are looking to be in the best facilities in the best markets. And I would think that leasing activity is going to remain very robust going out for the next 12 months. And I would not be surprised to find guidance following fairly close to our expectations for '15.","Rich Anderson","The reason I ask you is I'm looking at '16 expirations, and you have Research Triangle, Canada, Maryland whereas this year it was San Francisco, if I'm reading this right. So just wondering if the geographical footprint will play a role?","Joel Marcus","Well, it's a little bit of that, but you also have to keep in mind that the leasing activity in a given year also benefits from renewals that you can't identify from the supplemental, which is I'd believe Page 24, which shows our expirations down by category. And that's also an important driver, so getting ahead of some expirations that are beyond '16 will also contribute. I would say, the big picture, the market drivers are fairly obvious that the two top markets are big drivers of leasing activity, but I think the top five all contribute very nicely to '16.","Rich Anderson","You mentioned, and I understood the roadmap to funding development, and you kind of got it covered, so to speak, to $500 million, but are there any situations that you see where the funding of development would meaningfully exceed $500 million in any of the next couple of years?","Joel Marcus","Well, that's kind of been true this year and it's been true last year and possibly the year before, so I think it's safe to say that it will. And we do have a fairly robust pipeline. So yes, Rich, it will exceed that.","Rich Anderson","I mean, I'm looking at the guidance and it's in the $500 million to $600 million range, right, for development spending this year?","Joel Marcus","Yes. And it's important to keep in mind the strategy that we've used over the last, call it, five years. And our approach going forward is going to be very consistent with that. We want to minimize the consumption of common equity to the extent possible and focus on asset sales in an environment when private market valuations are attractive capital.","Rich Anderson","If you had a choice between the two, and you had to make a choice, would it be FFO growth or NAV growth as a guiding strategy?","Dean Shigenaga","I would say, first NAV, but we can't ignore the investors that do focus on FFO. I think their bottomline both important, but we're not wed to one or the other in particular. We're looking for a long term -- decisions for the long-term that will drive both of those metrics, but more importantly hopefully total return performance.","Rich Anderson","And then last question, maybe for, Joel. Do you have any comment about the BioMed deal?","Joel Marcus","I think it's a very good positive for them. The truth be known, analyst like you guys followed both of us, but in most of the submarkets that we're in, we actually virtually don't compete with them outside of some assets in Cambridge. Seattle, very little competition; in San Francisco very little competition; San Diego, even though they're based there, it hasn't been a lot of competition. And New York, not the same thing, so as a macro company, yes, but on a submarket basis. But I think it's a positive for them.","Rich Anderson","And do you think it could result in some activity coming your way vis-\u00e0-vis Blackstone or is it too early to say?","Joel Marcus","You mean assets that we might be interested in?","Rich Anderson","Yes.","Joel Marcus","Yes, I could say publicly, we have no interest in any other onsets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Sullivan with Cowen Group.","Jim Sullivan","Just kind of a similar question to one that Rich asked, but a little bit differently. Joel, if we have entered a period of significantly weaker capital formation, are there any geographic markets in which Alexandria has a presence, which are likely to be more affected than others?","Joel Marcus","That's a tough question to answer, because number one, we're as you know very highly leased both in our operating portfolio and then the development and redevelopment side. Each market is different. Seattle tends to be tech and institutional. San Francisco tends to be biotech pharma and tech. San Diego tends to be more biotech and pharma.","Maryland has been kind of a broad-base of different of companies, lot of service companies and things. Research Triangle is turning out to be an ag tech Mecca. New York, we just landed Nestle, their skincare group. And Lilly up for another building, but it seems broad-based in the life science area and then Cambridge is heavily biotech pharma and tech.","So each market really has its own dynamic, but at the moment, we haven't seen any dramatic change in any specific market that I could give you, but I try to characterize what we're seeing on the ground. There are some tenants that, because of lack of availability are sometimes giving up expansion or just looking maybe at different locations. But at the moment I'm not sure I could give you anything specific.","Jim Sullivan","And it would sound like, and I don't mean to put words into your mouth, but what's happened over the last 90 days does not appear to really have had an impact in terms of your disposition strategy?","Joel Marcus","No. not at all, but I do think that people are paying attention to the capital markets. Obviously, pharma doesn't need to, because they don't finance through the capital markets. Big tech also doesn't so much finance through the big capital markets, but obviously the private guys on the private side in tech, and obviously the biotech market are focused on the capital markets. So people are paying attention to the shift that's happened over the past couple of months. There is no question about, just board room talk.","Jim Sullivan","And then final one from me. Alexandria has been selective investors in private funding rounds for various companies at early stages and you've been through a few cycles. Can you characterize the slowdown in activity over the last 90 days? Has it stopped or slowed materially? And if you have a guesstimate on where it's going to go in the next 12 months?","Joel Marcus","So that's an interesting question, and the answer is, it has not slowed down appreciably at all. We tend to like big idea companies, big platforms, multiple shots on goal with products, great management teams, great syndicates. And I would say, we have not seen any slow down in the pace of new opportunities that have been presented to us at all believe it or not. What is slowing down is the exit of the pipeline not ours, but the biotech pipeline having gotten through that really high quality companies.","There are some companies that haven't been able to get out, but there is also a new crop of pretty high quality companies that I think you probably see a file either have done seven filings or will be filling ahead of JPMorgan Healthcare. So I think you'll see a pick up in that, but we've not seen a slow down on the private investment on the biotech side at all.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Tyler with Green Street Advisors.","Kevin Tyler","A high-level one for you, Joel, tying back to your opening comments. You talked about a sentiment shift and not really a fundamental shift towards the sector, biotech sector. But how does the fundamental shift, if there is one, affect the MITs, NYUs, data farmers, the more academic government-based tenants that are in your stable?","Joel Marcus","Well, I think the budget deal that appears worked out between the Republicans and the Democrats, and it looks like both houses will be on board and ultimately the President is on board, I believe. I think it will be a net positive for the institutional side of things a bit, providing incrementally about $1 billion to $2 billion more annually to the NIH.","Tom can comment on the ground, but I think one thing that surprised us, and I think we said it on past calls, is the slowdown in institutional activity like in Longwood, whereas Cambridge has been on fire. And a lot of Cambridge tenants won't go to Longwood. It kind of surprised us, there hasn't been more activity.","Thomas Andrews","Just to echo what Joel said, I mean we expected more growth and more demand out of the Harvard affiliated Longwood institutions, where we're at about 63% leased I think on that asset. And we've got some groups kicking around, but not really moving very swiftly on the remaining 150,000 square feet or so that we have to lease there. We're hopeful that this potential budget deal that Congress is talking about could result in some additional NIH funding and instigate some additional activity.","The other area where funding comes to these institutions commonly is through philanthropy. And there are some potential demand drivers from some foundation groups that are looking to invest over there, but we haven't seen any real estate activity out of that yet.","Kevin Tyler","And then your guidance, Dean, suggested you're not really planning much more in a way of acquisitions for the current year. I was wondering if that's based more on a change in cost to capital of both, more on development at the current time or perhaps just more color or insight into the state of deal pricing currently in the market?","Joel Marcus","So maybe let me just comment. I think, if you go back to our total acquisitions for the year, at the beginning of the year we probably couldn't have told you that this was the array of acquisitions we would be pursuing. The MIT acquisition, as we mentioned, came up really quite by circumstance.","The deal that Dan executed with Qualcomm and re-tenanting that building with Lilly, again, came to market kind of serendipitously and it presented a great opportunity to expand our campus. But months before that, we didn't have any idea of planning for it. So I think our primary external growth platform has been focused on development, so we haven't really been focused on some kind of benchmark for acquisition. And I think that's probably true of without getting into guidance for 2016. I think that's probably true of 2016 as well.","Kevin Tyler","The last one I had just, can you give us any insight into the inquiry that you may have received from other institutions interested in your properties. So I guess, hence, eventually your sales or dispositions. But has it increased at all since the BioMed news has surfaced?","Joel Marcus","Well, I'm not sure. We did a pretty methodical set of meetings back about a year-and-a-half ago, when originally looking potentially for a JV partner on some developments, which morphed into a different kind of an approach. And I would say, I personally did like 15 or 16 101s. And I think virtually every single group we met with, all brand names, expressed high-levels of interest for the quality of the location, quality of asset, quality of management and quality of tenancy.","And I think even today, we still do have a number of people that do approach us about getting involved in whether it's an asset sale or potentially partnering on development. So that's kind of ongoing. I don't know that the Blackstone deal either increased or somehow hastened it. I think it's been pretty consistent over the last two years, since we've been kind of moving in that direction.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Rodgers with Baird.","Dave Rodgers","Maybe for Tom or Steve, I wanted to follow-up on earlier question, particularly regarding any pushback you're seeing in Cambridge or San Francisco on rent levels. And I'm thinking particularly from biotech or pharma companies that are just getting priced out from some of the more tech office, heavy dense users of space. I mean are you seeing that in the market or is it just that many more tenants in the tech side taking space than on the lab side today?","Stephen Richardson","No, not necessarily. We are actually seeing that converse. The tenants really want to be in these locations. It's kind of an essential must have business imperative for the life science tenants in Mission Bay to be surrounding UCSF for the technology tenants, be in the Mission Bay\/SoMa cluster.","And so to the extent rents have risen to the price level they're at, they are sustainable, they are acceptable. And we've seen just the opposite that the tenants are really prioritizing location over some potential price sensitivity right now at this level.","Thomas Andrews","Yes, David, in Cambridge, as you know, much more of the demand that we've seen there has been on the life science side, but it's been both lab and office space, much more of the recent growth both lab and office space. And look, I think there certainly are some younger companies who are getting queasy at the rental rates and are looking elsewhere.","But as I said, we've got multiple parties looking at the remaining space that we have. We have multiple parties looking at that 60 Binney, when we transact with the bluebird deal. We have multiple parties looking at 100 Binney. So we're not seeing a great -- we're not seeing people withdraw from the location because of pricing.","Joel Marcus","Also in those locations, it's a fundamental question of recruitment and retention too that really underlies that. And that's almost like a cost of doing business as opposed to just a rent number.","Dave Rodgers","And maybe with regard to, Joel, or Dan's on the phone too, the redevelopment pipeline I think is about 525,000 square feet plus or minus. It looks like some of that is going to go from lab to more tech office. Can you talk about the returns on that? And then I guess the second part of that is do you see more assets kind of moving into the redevelopment bucket over the next year or so?","Joel Marcus","So I'll have Dean comment it for the moment.","Dean Shigenaga","So I guess the redevelopment, I mean the bulk of -- the biggest project you have disclosed are there. The other two aren't quite as large. But you have $240 million, roughly at completion on Campus Point, which is probably the largest project there.","Joel Marcus","Again, going from an office to a lab, and so all these are in a pretty good shape. We're working on lease up of 11 Hurley and 9625 just a bit -- I'm sorry 11 Hurley is under negotiation; 9625, we're working on. But it's just premature to talk about the status of those negotiations, but we do have ongoing negotiations. Again, I think the overall returns are going to fall on average here, 7%-plus on the initial cash yields.","As far as the future pipeline, we do have a little bit that's disclosed in the supplemental and the expiration schedules. That's potential, but it's pretty small. So I don't see anything in the portfolio today that represents a redevelopment over the next, call it, year or two.","Dean Shigenaga","So again, just to be clear, the Campus Point acquisition is going from office to lab. Hurley is going from whatever was before to a lab. It looks like we have a deal for that whole building. And then 9625, we're not certain it could go lab or it could go office, but that's remains to be same.","Operator","And we have a follow-up question from Manny Korchman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman","It's Michael Bilerman with Manny. Joel, I take it when the proxy comes out for BioMed, we will not see a REIT then in any of the disclosure, given your comments?","Dean Shigenaga","We won't see a what?","Michael Bilerman","A REIT, we won't see a company Alexandria mentioned in there?","Dean Shigenaga","I don't think so.","Michael Bilerman","Dean, and I'm sure you probably have this at your fingertips, just thinking about debt-to-EBITDA, as you're going to embark on this fixed income unsecured issuance, I'm sure the fixed-income investors are going to look at your 3Q numbers on an annualized basis. They'll back out the securities gains, they'll back out the FAS income, and they'll get to 7.9x debt-to-EBITDA and they're going to ask you if you have a target -- ","Dean Shigenaga","I'm not so sure about that.","Michael Bilerman","Well, they may.","Dean Shigenaga","I don't know.","Michael Bilerman","Because they tend to be -- in fact they tend to be -- ","Dean Shigenaga","That's fuzzy math, Mike.","Michael Bilerman","Well, it's not fuzzy math. I mean, they are going to -- see, they're not going to annualized securities gains, right?","Dean Shigenaga","I think they're going to look at what our target is at yearend and is it achievable.","Michael Bilerman","Correct.","Dean Shigenaga","Yes.","Michael Bilerman","And that's where I was going, right, because maybe you can in getting there, you got $600 million of sales, $300 million that are done, $300 million that are in the works. You also have $200 million of construction spend offset by $30 million of free cash flow. You get to 7x, but that doesn't take into account the lost EBITDA, right. The debt balance at the end of the year is going to be lower because you have $600 million of sales, but you'll still be earning income on most of the assets so there will be a slight tick back up.","So maybe you can just bucket getting into 2016 getting down to that 6.5 target, the EBITDA from all of the development and redevelopment, how much is coming online next year versus the incremental capital spend that you will have in furthering the development pipeline for the '17 and '18 starts. And then what is the plug effectively, if any, in terms of sales to get you to the right 6.5?","Joel Marcus","So Michael just to clarify, I mean part of my comments during the prepared section of the call was really focus on less quarter-to-quarter variations and metrics, which we all know are tend to be volatile versus more long-term metrics and we are going to hit 6.9% by the end of this year. And once we get beyond '15, we will start to migrate closer to 6.5. There is no expectation for us to hit it in 2016, just to be clear, but we will make the move towards that over the couple of years following 2015.","There is a lot of moving parts as you've highlighted in our business, because we have a tremendous pipeline of development opportunities that are highly leased, but we have a very disciplined approach in funding that, as I outlined in our prepared comments.","And so we'll provide as much color I think that makes sense at Investor Day to help investors navigate or at least follow our path on leverage, but beyond leverage our overall goal that we want to accomplish in 2016. So I don't think anybody will find it a mystery for us to maintain leverage sub-7, as we go into '16 and then continue that downward on average over the next two years.","Michael Bilerman","And how much NOI do you have lost in the fourth quarter from the $600 million of sales? So if that $600 million is, call it, about a 4.6 cap, so about $28 million of annualized NOI, how much are you suffering from a dilution standpoint in the fourth quarter in your guidance?","Joel Marcus","Well, Michael, why don't we wrap up the fourth quarter because we do have $600 million of dispositions; half is under contract, the other half is not yet, and so the timing of those transactions are still pending. But you're right, there will be EBITDA loss through the dispositions, but you're talking about very low cap rate transactions on average, which is attractive capital that's funding our business and because it's a low cap rate overall average disposition for the fourth quarter, it is attractive from a replacement to common equity.","And so I think we're making, as you probably can appreciate, the math works out from the ability for us to replace the need for common equity in a manner that is cheaper. And we had the need to raise the equivalent of whatever the equity proceeds of that $600 million was, Michel, in common equity. It probably would have resulted in even more dilution, because it would had a higher cost of capital apply to that.","Michael Bilerman","Just lastly, on the security sales. If I go back to last quarter, at least a lot of the conversation was of this $225 million of projected remaining asset sales. At least I was led to believe that a majority of that would have been the public securities that were sitting on your books.","It sounds like the sales in the third quarter perhaps were only about $30 million, if it had the same book-to-gain ratio and doesn't appear as though there's anything set for the fourth quarter. So had there been a change in the way that you're looking at liquidating the securities book at all?","Joel Marcus","No. Not at all, Michael. I think my commentary over the last two quarters, at least, the last quarter if not the prior to that, had indicated that it would probably take time for us to monetize the gains partly because some of its locked up for a period of time. So there wasn't any expectation of an immediate monetization of it.","I think you'll see us continue to monetize some of those gains as we look at over the next 12 to 24 months, but we feel really comfortable with -- these are very short list of companies that generate the $100 million-plus of unrealized gains and they are solid company. So we're not concerned about the gains vaporizing overnight, but we do plan to monetize some of them.","Michael Bilerman","And I guess you'll put that back in the sup next quarter in terms of the sales proceeds, so that we can track it a little bit, that would be helpful.","Joel Marcus","Yes, we can definitely help you guys with that disclosure.","Michael Bilerman","It will be in the Q, but at least for the supplemental it would be good to have?","Joel Marcus","It's been relatively small, so we haven't really highlighted it much, Michael, but we can think about that.","Operator","It appears there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back to management for any additional or closing remarks.","End of Q&A","Joel Marcus","Thank you, very much. We're five minutes over, but we appreciate that and we look forward to talking to everybody on the fourth quarter and yearend call. Thanks everybody.","Operator","This does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation."],"1560":["Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please also note today's event is being recorded.","At this time I'd like to turn the conference call over to Paula Schwartz with Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Paula Schwartz","Thank you and good afternoon everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. The company's actual results might differentially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.","Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the SEC.","And now I would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead Joel.","Joel Marcus","Thank you, Paula and welcome everybody to the first quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia, and Dean Shigenaga. First quarter of 2019 was probably as close to a picture-perfect quarter as Alexandria has had in quite a long time, although we had many great quarters.","But in addition to stellar earnings results, we had stellar leasing results which will be talked about in stellar's same-store results. And I want to thank the entire team and make sure we're focused on continuing our relentless passion to further our human health mission each and every day with operational excellence in an ego-less and high-integrity environment really important.","At the grand opening of one of our latest developments the home -- West Coast home of research for Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Jennifer Ferguson the mother of two children with cystic fibrosis noted about Alexandria's unique world-class design of this building and said, this building is going to be more than steel and concrete. It is a life-saving cure for my kids. It is amazing to think about what is going on or what is going happen in this building. And that's how we feel about everything that we do day to day and how we take our charge and our mission very seriously.","The first quarter was also the 25th anniversary since the start of the company when we did a Series A round closing I think on January 5th, 1994 of $19 million with family and friends. We have grown methodically and steadily and try to learn every day and every week and every month and every year along the way to become an investment grade S&P 500 company with a total market cap as of the end of the first quarter approaching $22 billion.","We've got one of the strongest client tenant bases in the entire REIT industry with a whopping 50% of annual rental revenue from investment grade or large cap publicly traded companies. Our weighted average remaining lease term is approximately eight and a half years. High quality tenants with long lease duration and strong annual steps is certainly good.","I also want to make a couple of comments about -- and we've -- I think in the press release we've highlighted this the opioid epidemic and the issue of overdosing. The health and fitness -- this is the health and safety crisis of our lifetime. We've teamed up 50-50 with Verily, the life science subsidiary of Alphabet and I'll talk about this in a moment. But 115 deaths per day in the United States more than have died each year or more die each year than did in the entire Vietnam War. And I think it's pretty clear that we could not as a mission-driven company focus on human health stand idly by and not here critically need a call to action.","With a heartfelt undertaking, we've pioneered a comprehensive care model with Verily in a safe campus environment which has rehabs, sober living, family reunification, and community transition. The goal is to help people recover from addiction and live healthier lives while revitalizing the community.","We hope the scale of the components of this model will drive superior outcomes and be a model for the rest of the country. And the restoration of the health and well-being of the community is good business for sure.","We chose Dayton Ohio which has the highest per capita overdose death rate of any U.S. city. Many of you may know and many of you may not know more patents per capita in the first half of the 20th century were developed in Dayton, home of the Wright Brothers among 35 leading industrial cities in America, and was the site for many new companies forming in the first half of the 20th century were developed in Dayton, home of the Wright Brothers among 35 leading industrial cities in America and was the site for many new companies forming in the first half of the 20th century. It turned out to be a very prosperous transportation hub between or among Indianapolis, Columbus and Cincinnati.","From the late 50s to present, Dayton lost their manufacturing, they closed, GM closed. NCR closed, the number of Fortune 500 companies were reduced down to two and the population declined about half. So we've tried to -- our purpose is to -- there is to create a tech-enabled recovery ecosystem focused on helping people recover from the opioid addiction and live healthier lives while revitalizing the community and the team is developing a tech-enabled system of care that will offer treatment center, rehabilitation, housing, wrapped around services all in a state-of-the-art campus.","I want to move on to the life science industry for a moment and talk about our five drivers of demand that we track for life science industry all continuing strongly positive. NIH funding at an all-time high. FDA regulatory continuing positive. The new interim commissioner Ned Sharpless, who comes from the National Cancer Institute and who has a strong background in cancer research should maintain the pro-innovation environment.","Charitable philanthropy is continuing to reach all-time highs. Venture capital flows very strong at over -- approximately $6 billion in the first quarter and 70% of that has been to ARE clusters and biopharma R&D investment has been strong in their pipelines. I want to mention one of the topics of the day which is the Medicare for All fallacy.","Interestingly enough if you look at Bernie Sanders, home state of Vermont, they actually attempted a single-payer system and failed miserably because it would have taken an additional 10% increase for all state income tax in Vermont plus an additional 12% tax on all payroll for businesses and turned out to be totally unacceptable. So today, we've got about one-third covered by Medicare, two-thirds covered by private insurance and there is about 8% to 10% uninsured group that we're struggling to figure out how to bring them into the system. And it makes no sense to throw away the baby and not the bathwater so to speak. ","So we can't have a government solution that excludes all other insurances and Medicare may not even be the right agency. And in fact conversations with the people at CMS they think it's an impossible task. And the veterans administration that's another very challenging government-run health care effort. What is really needed is expanded affordability, expanded access and portability. Even today, the challenge of having portable electronic medical records is a myth. It just doesn't exist in many cases.","Medical costs are actually much higher than pharmacy costs and these will be increasingly exposed. And often times pharmacy costs are embedded in hospital cost and recently there's been a whole rash of disclosures about drugs being marked up 10 times by hospitals and then embedded in overall bills to cover big losses in emergency rooms. So little bit of a view of what's going on out there.","When we talk about future growth of Alexandria, it's fair to say, that Alexandria does not see the slowing of its own earnings growth. We've given a five-year framework to double the rental revenues from 2018 through 2022. And you can see from the 2019 pipeline, we have a strong highly leased very robust pipeline. In the coming months, we'll unveil details about 2020 and talk about starts and leasing velocity. And the team has included on Pages 41 and 42 some of the pipeline opportunities for 2021 -- 2021 and 2022.","So with that as kind of a background and intro, let me turn it over to Steve for some details on the quarter.","Stephen Richardson ","Thank you, Joel. Good afternoon, everybody. I'd like to focus on Alexandria outperforming in all of its key clusters. The company is driven by its most important asset our best-in-class team used with our unique business model has and will continue to outperform in each of our key clusters. The life science industry we serve as Joel just highlighted and noted in our recently released annual report is undergoing a knowledge explosion.","And Alexandria is pioneering and now dominant position creating highly desirable world-class campuses and ecosystems in urban settings adjacent to the countries most productive life science research universities and institutions is providing excellent financial results.","I'll go ahead and run through the market and really highlight the outperformance with again significant contributions from each of the markets. In Cambridge, our franchise-leading campuses totaling 5 million square feet now are uniquely positioned to continue capturing growth in the immediate term.","Rents have grown to the upper 80s, with one in fact eclipsing $90 triple net. And market's 0.2 vacancy rate and three-point million square feet of demand, an increase over the 2.8 million square feet of demand last quarter provides ample opportunity for Alexandria to continue its strong renewal and re-leasing rent growth over the next several quarters, without having to wait several years or more to capitalize on this strong market.","The San Francisco region has an availability rate of 1.9%, down from 3% last quarter with demand up from 2.5 million square feet to 2.9 million square feet. The 480,000 square foot lease with Pinterest at 88 Bluxome highlights another superb example of the trusted partnerships we've created with our tenants, as we will embark together on the efforts to secure our Prop M allocation and create a world-class destination, a truly remarkable achievement and kudos to the entire San Francisco team.","In addition, two separate renewals totaling 83,000 square feet with rental rate increases ranging from 37% to 58% paired with modest tenant improvements contributed significantly to this quarter's record cash increase.","Moving down to San Diego, have a very healthy market with just 5% to 6% direct vacancy in the core UTC and Torrey Pines clusters and demand now of 1.6 million square feet has increased over the 900,000 square feet from last quarter. Another important renewal rate that was 20% higher for 54,000 square feet in this market also supported the cash increases.","Seattle's vacancy rate remains very low with 2.5% and demand ticked up to 611,000 square feet versus the 400,000 square feet from last quarter. And Peter will touch on the excellent leasing activity at our waterfront facility 188 East Blaine which positions the company well for future growth in this critical cluster.","And finally, Alexandria's unique product offerings are increasing in RTP as demand has grown from 277,000 square feet to 392,000 square feet. Maryland as well continues to be in a contributor with a 35,000 square foot suite released at 35% increase against the backdrop of a market vacancy of just 4.4% and demand now nearly 300,000 square feet.","So, in conclusion, as we look at these markets, our strong competitive advantage derived from our broad-based value proposition to the life science industry is clear from the financial results posted in each of our markets.","The future for our operating and near-term development pipeline is very robust and we are energetically reaching well into our intermediate pipeline with significant leasing activity, as evidenced by the large lease with Pinterest.","On this positive note, I'll hand it off to Peter.","Peter Moglia","Thank you, Steve. I'm going to spend the next few minutes updating you on our near-term pipeline, recent lab office comps and provide an update on construction costs.","As we noted on page two of the supplemental, we've delivered 1 million square feet over the past two quarters, including 481,000 square feet in the first quarter. After a delay noted on our last call due to work performed by the city of Cambridge that interfered with our glazing installation and delay caused by the power company who were months late in hooking up permanent power, we delivered 123,403 square feet at the 399 Binney Street building in January, only one month over our pro forma delivery date.","More good news is that we've increased our stabilized cash yield to a 7.2% yield which is a solid increase of 50 basis points over our original pro forma of 6.7%. At today's cap rates for lab office in Cambridge, we believe we've developed to a value accretion margin in the range of 60% plus when comparing our current stabilized yield with current market cap rates. ","Anchored by Alphabet's Life Science subsidiary Verily, we delivered 139,810 square feet or 66% of the 279 East Grand building in South San Francisco in the first quarter at a very healthy 8.1% yield. Green Street's current NAV model applies a 5.3% nominal cap rate to South San Francisco assets. So the 280 basis point spread over that benchmark makes 279 a significant new contributor to NAV.","188 East Blaine, our new flagship building on Lake Union in Seattle, delivered 90,615 square feet or 46% of the building at a 6.7% initial stabilized cash yield. Steady leasing progress continued as we move from 49% leased at the end of 2018 to 67% leased at the end of the first quarter. And the limited supply in the market has enabled us to push rents above $60 net for the first time in our history there.","As of the end of the first quarter, we've delivered 56,137 square feet or approximately half of Phase 1 of Alexandria Center for AgTech, also known as 5 Laboratory Drive in RTP. This project has been very well received by the market and has reached 97% lease within 15 months of the commencement of construction.","It is the latest of eight properties containing over 0.5 million square feet within our asset base that serves AgTech research and development and it will expand our leadership in the sector by providing a multi-tenant, multifunctional, amenitized research and development project that will serve as the center of gravity for the industry in RTP.","We delivered 66,000 square feet of the 142,400 square foot 681 Gateway building this past quarter and remain on target to meet our outsized yield of 8.5% for this redevelopment of office space allowed at our South San Francisco Gateway campus.","In Palo Alto we delivered 48,547 square feet at Alexandria Park completing the first phase of redevelopment there at a 6.2% yield, which was slightly higher than what was originally projected. Credit tenant Workday leased all of that space.","Rounding out the first quarter deliveries was 10,250 square feet at our multi-tenant 80,000 square-foot building at 704 Quince Orchard in Gaithersburg, Maryland where we are successfully targeting a growing cadre of early-stage company there.","As we typically do, I'll discuss a couple of lab office sales comps that occurred this quarter. Both are in Cambridge and were reported to have had significant interest from several institutional investors, which correlates well with the enthusiasm we're hearing from brokers and investors about the demand for life science and real estate investments.","I'll also note a sale in Mission Bay of a pure office building that illustrates investor enthusiasm for that market. 610 Main Street North, 610 Main Street South and 710 Main Street were sold by MIT in April. The purchase price was $1.1 billion or $1,625 per square foot, representing a 4.3% cap rate for the approximately 677,000 square-foot campus, which includes a 650-car parking garage. The properties are subject to a ground lease and are anchored by Pfizer and Novartis.","1030 Massachusetts Avenue was sold by Bain Capital representing Harvard's endowment for $128 million, or $1,640 per square foot and a 4.7% reported cap rate. The 78,049 square-foot property is in mid-Cambridge between Harvard and Central Square and it's fully leased to a mix of life science tenants including Astellas and private biotech Obsidian Therapeutics.","I'll wrap up this commentary with a notation that 550 Terry Francois a 289,408 square foot office building leased to the Gap in Mission Bay was sold by Hines in December for $342.5 million or $1,183 per square foot, representing a 4.1% cap rate. The property is adjacent to our 1455-1515 Third Street and 455 Mission Bay Boulevard south properties in Mission Bay.","So a quick update on construction cost. They've remained stable in our markets, except for Seattle where our GCs are projecting 2019 and 2020 to escalate 0.5% higher than our previous projections and we've adjusted our pro formas accordingly. This is being driven by demand for skilled labor.","For our consultant in New York City, escalations may be growing -- or may be slowing there, but we're keeping them at our current levels of 4.5% to 5% until we see further evidence in our pricing. As for the impact of tariffs, we've accounted for them in current project budgets that are under GMP and are included in our escalation assumptions for those that are not. In addition to monitoring escalations, we're also assessing and including the impacts of increased project costs due to anticipated energy efficiency and resiliency programs both our internal goal and those that will be required from various regulatory agencies.","I'll go ahead now, and pass it on to Dean.","Dean Shigenaga","Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll briefly cover four key topics today, including our first quarter results and our strong start to 2019; second, lease accounting matters; third, our venture investment portfolio; and fourth, and last our updated guidance for 2019.","Our financial and operating results across the board were truly outstanding for the first quarter and highlights that our team is off to a strong start for the year. The first quarter highlights included continued strong leasing velocity and rental rate growth. 680,000 rentable square feet of development and redevelopment leasing that was executed.","Well, side almost 510,000 rentable square feet of lease renewals and releasing the space at significant rental rate increases of 32.9% and 24.3% on a cash basis and approximately 50% of this leasing volume related to contractual explorations beyond 2019. So rate of renewals continue to drive leasing velocity.","Our unique and differentiated business strategy focuses on high-quality cash flows from our collaborative life sciences and technology campuses in key urban innovation clusters. Class A properties in AAA locations generated 77% of our annual rental revenue. Additionally we have an industry-leading high-quality tenant roster with 50% of our annual rental revenue from investment-grade rated or publicly traded large-cap entities.","We reported solid growth and same property net of operating income of 2.3% and 10.2% on a cash basis for the first quarter. The strength and consistency of our same-property NOI growth was driven by among other items continued positive real estate in life science industry fundamentals, high velocity of leasing, and solid rental rate growth and our favorable lease structure.","Our adjusted EBITDA margin was very strong at 70% and represented another top statistics within the REIT industry. As expected, we adopted new accounting rules for leases effective January 1 of 2019. Key points that I will highlight include; income from rentals on our consolidated income statement include both tenant recoveries together with base rent.","We also separately provided disclosure of tenant recoveries in our same property results and in footnote five to our Form 10-Q that expect to file later today or tomorrow. As of March 31, 2019, our balance sheet includes $240 million of right-of-use asset and related lease liability, primarily for our ground leases, in which we are lessee.","G&A expenses include approximately $1 million related to internal leasing costs that under the new accounting rules no longer qualify for capitalization.","Now briefly on G&A expenses. Just want to remind everybody we have a very unique and differentiated business strategy. Importantly with a very unique and highly experienced and tenured team, it is simply inappropriate to compare a team and business to the average REIT today.","Our company is well more than just a typical real estate company is. Our core vertical is real estate, but we importantly focus on three other strategic verticals including venture investments, thought leadership, and corporate responsibility and we are a leader in each of these four core verticals. These verticals align well with the strategic business imperative of our client tenants.","It's also important to recognize when -- that when you review all-in G&A cost regardless of classification since it does vary from REIT-to-REIT and search for the best measure for how to how efficient a REIT is operating you'll likely end up reviewing EBITDA margins. We have an industry leading adjusted EBITDA margin as I mentioned earlier at 70% today.","Turning to venture investments. What began in the early days in the company's history really has developed into a unique and important component of our real estate business. Our venture investment business verticals strategically aligned with our real estate vertical with both focused on working with some of the world's most innovative entities, developing new therapies and technologies to improve quality of life for people throughout the world.","I give kudos to our science and technology team, we have one of the highest quality tenant rosters in the REIT industry and our team has proven track record for underwriting high-quality innovative tenants. When thinking about a run rate for gains, I always like to look back at what we have done. Looking back over the past three years, realized gains included in FFO as adjusted from our venture investments have been approximately $15 million, $10 million and $28 million and have averaged $8.9 million per quarter over the last three quarters.","As a percentage of range, looking at net operating income, and realized venture gains in 2018 as an example, 97% was generated from our unique and differentiated real estate vertical and 3% of our overall earnings was generated from realized gains on our venture investment vertical.","Moving to our balance sheet. We kicked of 2019 as you know with the strongest balance sheet in the history of the company. Our team has been busy again on liability management matters and extended our weighted average remaining term of debt to seven years. In our release yesterday, we announced the following, $850 million issuance of unsecured senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 4.1 years, and a term of 14.6 years including the tranche consisting of 30-year notes, in support of our overall sustainability initiatives $550 million or 65% of this deal related to green bonds. We repaid two secure notes payable aggregating $300 million at a weighted average interest rate of 4.88% including one note with a rate of 7.75%. These repayments resulted in an increase in our unencumbered net operating income to 95% of total NOI.","Subsequent to quarter end, we entered into an agreement to extend the maturity date from 2024 to 2025 related to our unsecured term loan that should become effective later in June of 2019.","Briefly on guidance for 2019, we narrowed the range of guidance to $0.10 with EPS in the range from $2.65 to $2.75 and FFO per share as adjusted in the range from $6.90 to $7, with no change in the midpoint of our FFO per share guidance. We also increased our projected guidance for rental rate increases, up 1% and 2% on a cash basis at the midpoint of the ranges.","Page 6 of our supplemental package includes our detailed guidance assumptions for 2019 for your reference. I'll pause there and turn it back to Joel to open it up.","Joel Marcus","Okay. Operator, if we could go to Q&A please.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Manny Korchman from Citi. Please go ahead with your question.","Manny Korchman","Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Steve, the Pinterest lease that you guys signed at Bluxome what happens if you don't get the Prop M allocation or \u2013 I was making it more specific. What if you don't get that allocation this year or next year?","Steve Richardson","Yeah, Manny let me walk through the process again. The Central SoMa plan was approved by the Board of Supervisors in December of 2018. As we've talked about you had four challenges were filed at that time. Those parties continue to work with the city and work through a process and at the same time very consistent with what we've said all along. There are huge community benefits of value to all stakeholders here. So the city in fact has very affirmatively and proactively continued the approval process. We view this as another step in the process. We expect as we've said for a couple of quarters now to be in front of the Planning Commission in the late summer of this year.","We expect to secure our approvals and then would expect that the lawsuits will be resolved at the end of the year. So of course, there's a hypothetical out there, but it could take longer could be another quarter or two. But everything has pointed and we've seen this time and time again things do get delayed, but ultimately they would get resolved here. So Pinterest is working with us arm in arm and we expect to have a very successful outcome here.","Manny Korchman","Thanks. And maybe switching close to Boston, at NECO on the Seaport it looks like you've got it under development delivery schedule as an after -2022 event. When would you start construction there? And then, does that end up being a cluster or one-off or trial? Or how do we think about your concentration in Boston Seaport?","A \u2013 Dean Shigenaga","Yes. So I think Manny at the moment, we'd prefer not to make any comment on that. There are a lot of moving parts and I think in the future quarter or so we could give better color on kind of our view of the world. But at the moment, I think we're going to not make any comment.","Q \u2013 Manny Korchman","Okay Joel. Since I didn't get an answer on that one, can I ask another one?","A \u2013 Joel Marcus","Sure.","Q \u2013 Manny Korchman","The tech IPO market right now is pretty hot. Any impact on your tenants or markets or marketable securities balances from new IPOs?","A \u2013 Joel Marcus","Well, I think Pinterest, we did have an equity investment there and that will get marked up to market when we report I guess next quarter. And I guess it was this quarter, we do have a stake in Uber, so when that goes public that will get mark-to-market. And we have still Google stock, we bought in 1998. Although Google was down -- Alphabet down 8% or something today, but -- so we've done some highly selected investing in certain technology companies and I would continue to imagine that most money managers view the tech sector as one of the most positive sectors these days in the general market. So I think its best we're viewing it things are pretty solid and we stuck to really high quality either big cap public companies or selected unicorns we feel have really legitimate business models and highly disruptive impact to the economy.","Q \u2013 Manny Korchman","Thanks, Joel.","A \u2013 Joel Marcus","Yeah, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.","Q \u2013 Jamie Feldman","Great, thank you. Joel thanks for color on Dayton venture with Verily. Can you talk about -- I mean is this something you could see doing multiple ventures like this and expanding to more markets? Or is this more of a one-off? And then how do we think about the economics?","A \u2013 Joel Marcus","Yeah our goal was not to get into the business of being a provider of real estate to the users here which are the dispensers of health care services. This is very unique. But what we did feel is we could make a difference and we spent a lot of time over a number of years trying to find the best place where we could make the best and biggest impact and that's Dayton for the reasons I enunciated. And we're trying to do a unique campus and a unique set of data-driven services that have never been done before from intake, literally from The Street to job placement. Not just you come in, you detox and you're out on the street in 28 days. I think the -- literally all those efforts fail wherever we've seen them.","I don't think were going to be doing lots of sites or multiple sites because that's not our core business. But what we do feel is this is a model for every community in America which is hit hard and we'll make it -- we're going to make our secret sauce as available possible to the -- to other communities. Because we think this is something that private industry and the government should be partnering to really build throughout the country. So we're trying to be the tip of the spear, but not the spear.","Q \u2013 Jamie Feldman","Okay.","A \u2013 Joel Marcus","And our -- we own the real estate 50-50 with Verily. Our payback period's about a 25-year payback period. So it's not fast. Our returns aren't as great as Peter's enunciation of our other things. But I do believe, this was a critical call to action where we have unique skills and Verily has unique skills. And I -- we could not have done it with something we really compelled to do.","Q \u2013 Jamie Feldman","Okay that's helpful and I appreciate it. As we think about shifting gears, I guess to Dean on page 6. Your capital sources plan. So it looks like you've got the $438 million of sales done. But can you talk about some of these other buckets and the timing to get them done the debt the other and the common equity?","A \u2013 Dean Shigenaga","Sure Jamie. It's Dean here. That's basically done if you look at the bottom of the table on the right side on page 6. We did complete the issuance of our unsecured notes. In fact, upsized it opportunistically, which allowed us to retire some additional secured notes on our balance sheet. So that's been taken care of.","What we are laser-focused on and that's pretty true every year. We've always had a component of dispositions going through. So on top of the 75\/125 partial interest sale, we have another at the midpoint roughly $300 million of dispositions predominantly spread over two transactions that are in process, so stay tuned there. And then I assume you're also asking about common equity. We never really disclosed when that happens, but it's an open item for us to focus in on through the remainder of the year.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. I mean, do you think asset sales could take the place of that or they have anything else in the pipeline?","Dean Shigenaga","No, I don't -- not necessarily. It's possible that a little of it, but Jamie we already have $750 million at the midpoint of our asset disposition program for 2019. So it's a pretty healthy volume. As we make our way through the two key transactions that are in process, we can give you more color once we get through those too.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then just finally, I guess, back to Joel or anyone on the team. Appreciate your thoughts on Medicare for All, but any thoughts on just the drug pricing legislation particularly maybe the international comparison pricing? How that might impact the business and tenants, if you have any latest thoughts?","Joel Marcus","Yes. So that's actually a good question. I happen to see that in your note. We actually a group of us have actually been at Center for Medicare Services not just for pharma industry, but a wider group and we have been working pretty intensively with CMS on this issue. This issue would only cover the third of people covered by Medicare.","The international pricing mechanism is probably not the best, because the U.S. is supporting pricing to some extent overseas, which is kind of unfair. So not only the drug -- or the biopharma industry, but I think payers providers and a group of people all feel like there are some alternatives that are better and those are under intense discussion with CMS as we speak.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sheila McGrath from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.","Sheila McGrath","Yes. On the other investment bucket, I'm just wondering if we should expect this year to be a little bit more elevated because so many of the companies that you mentioned are coming public and you would look to possibly sell just to get rid of some volatility in that line item.","Joel Marcus","Yes. So I'll let Dean answer that. But I think as you probably know Sheila, on the IPO, there is a standard six months lockup for all IPOs so that despite whether we wanted to or not selling after the IPO was limited to all participants. But Dean, can give you his view on.","Dean Shigenaga","Yes. Yes Sheila, so let me comment in two areas. First, as I mentioned in my prepared commentary, our run rate for last three quarters has been actually interestingly consistent averaging $8.9 million per quarter over the last three quarters. That might give you some sense of recent activity.","To the extent that this type of environment with the types of investments we do hold, it's not unusual as to see something with a really great multiple come out. And to the extent there is one individual transaction like that, we'll exclude it from our run rate as we have historically. But hopefully, the commentary and you just look back over the last few quarters though as far as what they expect may be a better barometer, since we actually haven't provided specific guidance on that line item in our results for 2019.","Sheila McGrath","Okay. And then on the Verily announcement in Dayton. I'm sorry, if I missed this, but how much capital do you estimate that project will require? And do you envision hiring an outside operator? And then just when you say tech enabled, just curious a little more detail what that means?","Joel Marcus","Yeah. Sheila, so the total investment is $20 million, split 50-50 between Verily and Alexandria. The operator is actually a consortium. We have put together a non-profit consortium. I don't want to get to details, because there is a kind of a big grand opening in public announcement kind of mid-June where the Governor of Ohio and the Mayor of Dayton will participate with us and the Verily folks.","But it is a -- when you think about tech or information driven, think about if you were able to understand the all of the data, human data from or as much as you can from everyone you intake, who has been impacted by opioid addiction or overdosing, and you build a database, the treatment mechanisms can be much more individually tailored if you have a set of data that is valuable versus just giving everybody the same detox schedule. It's like cancer.","And everybody knows, everybody has a cancer patient in their family, and literally virtually there are no two cancers that are identical. It's one of the most heterogeneous sets of diseases that you can possibly imagine. And so treatment has to be really tailored for each patient, and that's what we're trying to get to. So people are treated almost like cattle. They're just brought in detoxed and thrown back on the street. That's just a recipe for disaster, and that's why we have 115 people every day dying.","Sheila McGrath","Okay. And one last quick question. Just on Launch Labs, you press released activity in Cambridge, and then another AgTech kind of Launch Labs in RTP. I was just wondering if you could update us on that product for Alexandria.","Joel Marcus","Yeah. We think -- I mean think about what we have said on the call, half of our revenue is generated by investment-grade tenants, and\/or big cap companies. And so we also believe in the Life Science industry that you have to really be a part of the entire ecosystem, which means from seed stage to grown-up stage. A good company example that I always like to use, we were involved in the Series A start-up of Alnylam up in Cambridge with our Science Hotel product.","I think they took 4,000 or 7,000 feet. Today, they occupy hundreds of thousands of feet, and are multiple billions of dollars in market cap. So it's good to be there at the beginning, so we can pick the winners of the future, especially given the amazing progress and disruptive technologies today. So that's our goal in dealing with that product.","Sheila McGrath","Great. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Catherwood from BTIG. Please go ahead with your question.","Tom Catherwood","Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Sticking with the question on RTP, and the AgTech Center down there, how does -- how do the companies and the lease structures in the AgTech world differ from what you would be doing in Cambridge or San Francisco? Is there any material difference?","Joel Marcus","No, they don't. Tom, this is Joel. There are three products. One is lab -- lab office, and then the other is greenhouse, and they're all triple net leases and the lease structure is exactly the same. We just felt that -- and I think I may have mentioned. If I didn't, venture capital certainly is one indicator went from something like $8 billion over $16 billion over the last two years in the AgTech, and it didn't fall on deaf ears when we tracked those statistics to understand that more and more this world is about not only fighting disease, but it's about gaining good nutrition.","And this is an industry \u2013 especially, given the huge consolidation among the big guys. Now there's only three, and the Chinese own one of them. That's really important for what we think is a huge launch of innovation in this area. So that's why we've kind of gone after that particular niche.","Tom Catherwood","Got you. And then when we think about the -- Steve I think you mentioned the 392,000 square feet of demand in RTP. Is that primarily private industry backed by those venture funds that you were talking about Joel? Or is this university-related tech transfer? Kind of how does that ecosystem round out?","Stephen Richardson","Hi. It's Steve. That's a wide breadth of companies there. So as you annunciated it, it's all of the above.","Tom Catherwood","Okay. And then...","Joel Marcus","In fact -- I mean, it's much like New York. We've got I don't know 50-plus tenants in our campus in New York. Not a single one of them other than one that I can remember did research in New York before we had the campus. So the -- some of the AgTech stuff in north -- in the Research Triangle region as we call it -- really these are new companies being seeded by venture people, sometimes institutional investors and sometimes the big majors to do things outside of the big corporations. And so a lot of these are very new companies. Some are big, big existing companies, but there's a broad range of demand that gives us comfort down there.","Tom Catherwood","Got you. Got you. Then one last one Steve. Demand in San Francisco, you mentioned that picking up at 2.9 million square feet. Is that demand concentrated in any specific submarkets? And how is it trending in your Greater Stanford cluster?","Stephen Richardson","I think we're seeing it very well distributed. You have continued demand in Mission Bay. The challenge of course is the supply constraint there. Equally strong in South San Francisco and we are seeing very positive demand down in the Greater Stanford cluster just as we anticipated. So it is broad-based in each of these core clusters, Tom.","Tom Catherwood","Excellent. Thanks everyone.","Stephen Richardson","Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Anderson from SMBC Nikko. Please go ahead with your question.","Rich Anderson","Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. So Joel, you mentioned the 50% number that is rental revenue from IG or large cap. What makes that the right number? I'm curious, if you see that going up, because 77% of your portfolio is defined as Class A. I don't know why, but I would think that the 15 to 77 should perhaps be closer together. Is that the wrong way to think about it?","Joel Marcus","Yes, because I mean if you look at Cambridge as an example and we are working day and night with tenants to try to direct them sometimes out of Cambridge most people want to be in Cambridge and our product is new Class A campus-like or rehab -- Class A rehab and that's where they want to be. They want to be in the best locations. And you have to remember that rental expenses aren't generally the biggest part of their budget. So I think that's why you see that that split.","They're a lot of NewCos, same thing in San Francisco where they want to be in the best locations for interaction with UCSF et cetera. Going out to the burbs or to concrete tilt up buildings in lesser locations just aren't of great interest. So I think that's why you see -- I don't know that there's any right answer for what our credit amount should be, but I think 50%-plus is where we've been for a long time and fairly comfortable given lease durations of what we have.","Rich Anderson","But in the extreme -- and it may be for anyone in the room, the extreme case of Cambridge where you have five million square feet or more of demand and basically no availability. I mean at what point do people just acquiesce and say, okay, I got to be in Boston or some place somewhat close. And if that were to happen to increasing degree would you be willing to follow that demand?","Stephen Richardson","Well I think that relates to the question that was asked earlier about Seaport and some of the other locations. I think naturally you have to look at other locations, because doesn't matter how much capital you have there's a limited amount of land and limited amount of buildings in Cambridge. And so clearly people have to look at other locations in some fashion.","Rich Anderson","Yes. Okay. And last for me. You're putting off these huge mark-to-markets whether you look at cash or GAAP. I'm not asking for 2020 guidance or 2021 guidance, but when you think about the sort of the geographically where assets are going to be having lease expirations. To what degree can we maintain levels in these huge ranges?","Considering the fact that where leases expire is perhaps an important component to why you're getting the type of growth that you're getting?","A \u2013 Joel Marcus","Well, I think if you just -- I'll ask Steve and Peter to comment as well because they're very granular with this. But if you look at the 2020 expirations, I think 24 we've got what 1.7 million square feet of -- which is about what 5.9% of the annual rental revenue.","But if you look at the rental rates on the right-hand side in the markets, many of these are well below market.","Rich Anderson","Yeah.","A \u2013 Stephen Richardson","Yeah. Rich this is Steve. I mean when you start looking at the mark-to-market in Cambridge right about 21%, San Francisco you got Mission Bay at 18%, South San Francisco as much as 27%, San Diego and UTC 11%, Seattle about 10%. So, in each of those markets, the mark-to-market opportunity is pretty significant.","When you get into the individual sweeps that might be rolling, there may be a mix there. So that's not necessarily guidance for how it's all going to shakeout, when you roll it up. But I think across the board in those markets in particular, you can see it's pretty healthy.","Rich Anderson","Yeah.","A \u2013 Peter Moglia","Yeah. This is Peter. I just want to add, that we're roughly a third Greater Boston, a third Bay area, and a third everywhere else. Of course there's been a great run in Greater Boston and San Francisco everybody knows about.","But I think what is going to help power -- it's an extended run like we're having is that these other regions like Maryland, Research Triangle region, New York City, San Diego are also doing very well, just given what Joel, set the stage for early on with the indicators of the industry.","There are positive. They've been positive. And as we roll or re-lease in all the regions, they're just all contributing which we can't say has happened throughout our history but we're just happened in a great time where everything is clicking on truly also owners.","Rich Anderson","Okay great. Thanks and kudos on the Dayton project.","A \u2013 Peter Moglia","Thank you very much Rich.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Rodgers from Baird. Please go ahead with your question.","Q \u2013 Dave Rodgers","Yeah, maybe for Steve or Joel just on the 88 Bluxome and the Pinterest lease. Do you anticipate or is there any discussion about the recapturing the existing Pinterest space? Or would this be purely expansion?","A \u2013 Stephen Richardson","Dave, hi it's Steve. No, it is purely expansion. That was the clear intent. And that's the way this is a new expansions stand-alone lease. So they're very excited about that. And they are thoroughly enjoying their existing billing at 505 Brannan which has actually won a number of design awards. So that's an important facility for them.","Q \u2013 Dave Rodgers","Great and then on the 2020 delivery, I guess you haven't laid out in the supplement. You've got about $1.9 million square feet plus or minus, may be planned for delivery as you've got about 350,000 started under construction.","Do you anticipate delivering a larger number of maybe shells to tenants next year? Do you have the ability to kind of deliver some of these bigger buildings of 530,000 or 208,000 square foot buildings, in that kind of year to 15 or 16 month time frame? Any color on that?","A \u2013 Joel Marcus","Yeah. So I said in the beginning we would give over the next couple of quarters more granular visibility into 2020, but maybe just keep it high level. I think it's pretty clear we'll be able to deliver way more than shells in 2020.","I think we've got a very robust pipeline. I think we have a lot of great activity. And will save it for another quarter but we have a lot of confidence in the 2020 pipeline. I think if you look at this year's pipeline, just think about that as continuing on into 2020.","A \u2013 Peter Moglia","And this is Peter I'll just comment a bit about, how we're able to deliver in a timely fashion. We're pretty proactive when we put these assets into our land bank. And start entitlement work almost right away if not right away. So we'll be able to come out of the ground if we're not already out of ground pretty much at any time we need to this year.","Dave Rodgers","That's helpful. Thank you. And then maybe last one just for Dean. Given the equity forward that you've done, I think last year maybe how do you view your experience of that? And whether that's on the table again this year as well?","Dean Shigenaga","Dave, its Dean here. Every year we look at our capital line carefully. Each year is slightly different and the needs. And it's interesting it's only April. Well, it's almost May. It's a day from May and we've knocked down a good chunk of our capital needs which we're very pleased with.","The bond deal is very successful the JV sale 75\/125 Binney Street was an outstanding transaction. And so over -- as we go through and look forward Dave we'll provide more color. We never really get into the weeds on timing and structure.","I think it's safe to say that we'll remain disciplined in our approach and we want to be prudent and disciplined in how we go about raising capital. Eventually we'll be able to lock-in great returns on the cost to capital here whenever we get to the race.","And then it will allow us to move on to whatever else remains open on sources and uses of that point probably. We talked about our dispositions but we're working on that as well. So, surely in the year but we're firing up on all cylinders right now.","Joel Marcus","Yes. The big focus at the moment is on the two additional dispositions that Dean spoke about so that's kind of where our focus is.","Dave Rodgers","All right. Great. Thank you all.","Joel Marcus","Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen at this time we'll conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference call back over to Mr. Marcus for any closing remarks.","Joel Marcus","Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciated and look forward to talking to on the second quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines."],"1410":["Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.

Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company\u2019s Form 10-K Annual Report and other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Joel Marcus. Please go ahead.","Joel Marcus","Thanks, Rhonda, and welcome, everybody, to the Fourth Quarter and Year End Earnings Call, and Happy New Year to everybody. Sorry for the late notice, we were going to release next week, but I\u2019ve got to fly to Basel to meet with Roche\u2019s CEO and so we needed to kind of accelerate our earnings release, so apologize for the inconvenience.","ARE\u2019s solid progress in both the fourth quarter and in 2012, I think positions us well for 2013. It reminds me of Lou Holtz\u2019s quote, of football fame: Ability is what you\u2019re capable of doing; Motivation determines what you do; But attitude determines how well you do it.","And I think it\u2019s fair to say in each and every one of our key CBD cluster markets, we are the landlord of the choice and most admired life science real estate company because of our unparalleled knowledge, expertise and experience and really a can-do attitude for our clients and world-class network.","And, really, it\u2019s a great credit to this first-in-class team and want to thank them for all they do during this past year. We\u2019re also very proud of our accounting and financial groups, best-in-class disclosure supplement introduced about a year ago and continually enhanced and we hope that you appreciate the work that\u2019s gone into that.","What I want to do is really look forward to 2013. I think 2013 will be a breakout year for Alexandria. We certainly intend to increase per share value demonstrably and as a leader of life science, both on a branding and quality leadership standpoint, we expect to continue to get wider access to lower cost capital, growing that per share earnings, solid recycling of assets, positive internal growth and increasing dividend.","We expect that solid revenue growth from development and redevelopment will continue we think for NOI. Dean will talk in depth about same-store, but we expect that growth to be driven increasingly or by increasing occupancy and strong leasing, and believe for 2013 we\u2019re already nicely outpacing our internal model for leasing projections.","We expect to achieve our debt to adjusted EBITDA target of about 6.5x by fourth quarter, and we expect to continue to successfully recycle assets to reinvest in high-quality CBD best-in-class assets, as well as achieve our targeted 15% to 17% non-income producing real estate as a percentage of gross asset value.","In January 2013, we began the monetization of our 75\/125 Binney Street, Cambridge parcel, the second out of four key parcels in that development; the first one to Biogen Idec, which will be delivered in the fourth quarter, and they\u2019ve had a sterling year and that, by the way, a very solid yield.","ARIAD Pharmaceutical is signed to take almost a quarter million square feet. We think it\u2019s about 63% of the project and we think there is a very high and strong likelihood they\u2019ll take the balance. It\u2019s a first-in-class oncology company, which received early FDA approval for their first-in-class rationally designed small molecule unique cancer drug, ponatinib. I had the privilege of serving on ARIAD\u2019s board for many years and it is truly a first-in-class, second cohort commercial stage biotech company.","As was noted in the Boston Properties Call, Cambridge \u2013 Boston Cambridge is undergoing really an astounding boom in lab space development and we\u2019re a significant beneficiary thereof with two out of the seven projects.","Moving on to our project in New York, beyond Roche, we\u2019re in LOI negotiations for seven additional floors of about 30,000 square foot \u2013 square feet each or approximately 210,000 square feet with eight different entities, we feel all lab space users. We feel that the pace of lease-up will beat our internal projections, and most of these are 10-year plus leases with strong rental rates with escalators. I\u2019ll come back in the moment and talk about yields and costs.","Moving on to the recycling, really our sales and asset recycling program, really headed by Peter Moglia. In January, you\u2019ll note from the Supplement we did close the 1124 Columbia Street project, a project we actually bought pre-public, together with two land parcels for about $42.6 million carry-backs on paper. This is being converted to medical office and almost all the tenants are rolling out.","The strategy was to exit the First Hill submarket; it\u2019s no longer a lab market. It really is a hospital and medical office market, to rid vacancy coming in a non-lab market and also to recycle to core CBD assets, so that met all of our goals there.","So this month in February we closed on 25, 35 and 45 West Watkins. This was, again, a pre-IPO asset, together with 1201 Clopper, which was a build-to-suit we did a number of years ago for Digene, which has been acquired by QIAGEN. That lease rolls in a couple of years and that property will have to be multi-tenanted. And there\u2019s quite a bit of office vacancy in the West Watkins property, together with a land parcel that\u2019s adjacent thereto, $41.4 million.","So, again, the strategy was to lighten our exposure to the Gaithersburg submarket, as we\u2019ve spoken about on a number of occasions, rid coming vacancy in a suburban market and recycle to core CBD, and we\u2019re very proud of that Peter\u2019s team for executing in a really excellent fashion.","I want to address and Steve will speak a little bit about this when it comes to San Francisco, the important issue of yields. And I think it\u2019s \u2013 investors should really take great comfort that Alexandria is really besting most others on the yield front. And let me walk you through examples. I think if you look at others build-to-suit yields, assuming you can find them, and acquisition cap rates in this low cap rate market, it\u2019s pretty clear that tech, either developments or acquisitions, are not beating our yields and neither our New York City or Cambridge Boston CBD office development or acquisitions, so we feel very comfortable about what we\u2019ve been doing. In fact, our patented lab space niche, which we invented, is in fact a mainstream product now and should be viewed as such.","If you go to Page 3 of the Supplement at front end of the press release, I should say, and you look at the development and redevelopment of the 75\/125 Binney street project, north of 8% yields. We feel very comfortable with those yields. And I think it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re proud to say that those probably beat most other yields in the Boston or Cambridge market that we\u2019re aware of. We know of some assets that may be coming to market at either 6% or sub-6% cap rates. And so we feel we\u2019re doing much better than that. I\u2019ll come back to New York in a moment.","On the Longwood asset, again, a north of 8% yield, we know that there\u2019s another commercial building in that market that was over $1,000 a foot with probably a 5% or 6% yield on it, and other developments in the Greater Boston area that certainly don\u2019t come close to a plus 8% yield.","And then if you look at our San Diego, Seattle and a number of the other developments and redevelopments we\u2019ve delivered, outside of one or two that have struggled along like East Jamie Court, again, we feel like we have a very strong yield production; so we feel a lot good about that. And I think few if any others are going to beat us either on an acquisition or a development with these yields.","When you look at New York, there\u2019s some, I know, thinking about while why can\u2019t Alexandria build to a 7% or 8% in New York. While given the cost of building in New York, certainly the carry costs during the Lehman downturn, we feel very good about a north 6.5% yield. High-quality tenants, long-term leases, good escalators. And I think it\u2019s fair to say that those who are acquiring first-in-class CPD assets in New York don\u2019t come close to that kind of a yield. We know buildings like the GM and other buildings, which have very little lease rollups, were acquired at substantially less than those rates, even though they\u2019re a little bit different product type.","When it comes to cost in New York, it\u2019s pretty clear New York is just an expensive place to do business, but if you compare it say to Boston, Longwood areas and others, I think it \u2013 it\u2019s not unusually high, when you look at the carry through the Lehman downturn, which was longer than we expected. That certainly adds to bases quality of finishes and, obviously, building a podium platform infrastructure is very expensive in New York, but we had no systems damage during the storm, so I think our design and our enhancements made a big difference.","Moving on to the life science industry, many real estate analysts and investors still fundamentally, I think, don\u2019t understand this industry. And I think it\u2019s fair to say that by all accounts 2012 was, in fact, a very positive year for both the bio and pharma sectors of the industry.","According to Patel and R&D Magazine, U.S. life science real estate, and that\u2019s just in the U.S., is expected to increase this year by 1.5% to a very healthy $82.7 billion of R&D spend. Bio and pharma had excellent 2012 capital markets performances. Pharma is continuing to be very profitable, stock prices are doing by and large reasonably well, and they\u2019re sitting on $197 billion in cash to fund R&D, M&A and partnering to fill pipeline.","Clearly, open innovation and external research is the key to today\u2019s focus and key CBD life science clusters, and this is really where ARE\u2019s sweet spot is. So, the Venn diagram is substantially overlapping with where we have class A assets in Cambridge, New York City, San Francisco, and San Diego. We have the locations they want. We have the knowledge and expertise they want, and we have the innovative and collaborative environments they desperately seek.","Robust set of second cohort commercial stage biotech companies are driving demand and space needs in a number of these markets, including ones like ARIAD and Onyx that we\u2019ve landed.","Demand for clinical development in later stage space is not a negative; it\u2019s also a big positive, and we\u2019ve captured key requirements from Roche in New York City and Biogen Idec in Cambridge for this type of space. This is a plus, as I said, not a negative as some have opined.","Headlines from December 10, 2012 Barron\u2019s, their feature article on the drug industry, Looking Beyond the Patent Cliff, really, the key byline was after a decade of running a large patent cliff, Big Pharma is reaching the other side, with rich dividend yields and opportunities for growth.","In 2013 six of the top 20 selling drugs will be biologics or are biologics and that\u2019s going to boost exclusive marketing windows for drugmakers because biologics can\u2019t be easily copied.","Biosimilars are generic biologics. In other words, clearly, we\u2019ll not see meaningful sales growth until 2018 to 2020 and I think that gives us great comfort.","And then, finally, on the heels of an approximately 12% dividend increase in 2012, the board\u2019s likely to seek to continue support an increasing dividend in 2013 to share our increasing cash flows with shareholders.","So with that said, let me turn it over to Steve for some details on the lease end of things.","Steve Richardson","Thank you, Joel. I\u2019ll go ahead and focus my comments on two key areas, the first being the Q4 and 2012 leasing results, and then we\u2019ll look forward a little bit at the status of the 2013 roles for each region.","So the company delivered strong operating results during 2012, leasing a total of 3,281,000 square feet in 187 leases and finished with a solid Q4 2012, leasing a total of 678,000 square feet in 47 leases. I\u2019ll provide more color on this consistent performance in each region, but will note that these statistics really highlight the company\u2019s ability to engage its client\/tenants in a way that is unique and differentiated in the real estate industry. We\u2019re bringing to bear our entire operating platform, including our proprietary life sciences underwriting teams, to fully engage with these clients, not only on an operational level to provide class A service for mission critical facilities and enhance amenities to support an intrinsically collaborative culture, but also on a business development level to partner and leverage a best-in-class network of industry leaders.","So, as we look at Cambridge, we leased a total of 924,000 square feet during 2012, including 92,000 square feet of that executed during Q4. We had a nice occupancy increase this past year of 70 basis points from 93.9% to 94.6% and rents for Class-A product have solid support in the mid-to-high $50 triple net range and significantly higher for new build-to-suit product.","The last quarter featured a 47,000 square foot lease renewal with Novartis in Tech Square. No downtime, no tenant improvements, with a nice 3% increase. The balance of the suites leased last quarter range from 2,500 to 9,200 feet and so we\u2019re encouraged with the early stage segment, as well as an important complement to the second cohort of homegrown companies that Joel mentioned, that are commercializing critical lifesaving products, continuing with the announcement in early 2013 of the long-term lease of 244,000 square feet to ARIAD.","The overall Cambridge market is healthy. As the vacancy rate decreased a full 670 basis points from 17% to 10.3% during this past year, as a result of the highest absorption rate since 2000. It is also important to note the expansion of really some of the key pillars of the life science industry, with significant construction activity underway. Biogen is building half a million square feet, Novartis another 570,000 square feet, The Broad Institute\u2019s 250,000 square feet, Pfizer\u2019s 231,000 square feet, and Mass General\u2019s Reagan Institute 75,000 square feet are a clear indicator of the dynamic market in and around Alexandria\u2019s core Kendall Square and Binney Street Holdings.","Moving down Maryland. Given our significant attention to this cluster with the regional team during 2012, we\u2019re very pleased to see the market stabilize and believe the hard work is paying off with pretty significant performance during that year. We leased 547,000 square feet throughout the year and including 171,000 square feet during Q4. We did experience a bottoming out of our occupancy rate of 89.4% at the end of the third quarter and we\u2019ve seen an improvement of 150 basis points to 90.9% at the end of the fourth quarter.","The key leases completed during Q4 include an important mission-critical facility for a local government agency, Montgomery County, leasing 73,000 square feet for nine years at a slight increase on a cash basis, no downtime, and a modest refresh improvement allowance averaging $15 per square foot. This cluster\u2019s trending at a vacancy rate of 7% and if we experience reasonable demand again during 2013, we believe we can continue to incrementally improve our occupancy and rental metrics.","Also, it\u2019s important to note the details of the 70,000 foot lease in this market that negatively impacted our cash results overall this quarter. This facility is ultimately a core holding and we now have a long-term lease through the end of 2021, and although it did have a cash rent roll down, it only required a very modest investment of $5 per square foot in tenant improvements. So all things considered a worthwhile trade-off as this helps stabilize the portfolio going forward.","Moving over to San Diego, the regional team leased a total of 354,933 square feet during 2012, including the lease of a little more than 76,000 square feet during Q4. When you step back and realize the operating asset base has grown significantly year-over-year from a little over 2 million square feet to 2.7 million square feet, this represents a remarkable 34% increase, nearly all of which is represented by new class A facilities with creditworthy tenants.","Occupancy is a solid 95.1% in this past quarter. We were pleased to partner with Genomatica, one of the rising stars in the industrial biotechnology industry on long-term lease of 10 years for 68,000 square feet during Q4. The majority of the tenant prospect activity continues to be in the Torrey Pines and UTC submarkets, as the flight to quality continues in this strong market.","The overall market vacancy has increased slightly by 80 basis points, from 9.3% to 10.1% compared with the prior year, largely as a result of one project that has been placed on the market by a non-life science developer. So it remains to be seen if it will represent significant competition.","Moving north to the Bay Area, we leased a total of 592,000 square feet during 2012 and 78,000 square feet of this total during Q4. Occupancy increased 110 basis points, from 96.7% to 96% \u2013 97.8% during the year.","The Q4 leases were highlighted by a broad set of renewals in each of the three key submarkets. The Stanford cluster remains very healthy with a vacancy rate of sub 5% and lease rates in the $30 to $36 triple net range.","Alexandria also congratulates one of its key Stanford cluster anchor tenants, Map Pharmaceuticals and its recent acquisition by Allergan, a $32 billion New York Stock Exchange traded company. Map will continue operating in our facility in the Stanford cluster and Allergan presence will surely bolster the overall strength of the cluster as well.","The South San Francisco cluster is a tale of two cities, ultimately. The overall vacancy rate is certainly high at 11.9%, but as you drill down and segment the market, the vacancy rate for the moderate to small-size suites is just 2.4% and this is exactly where we focused our efforts and have been successful.","Lease rates in the South San Francisco for these suites range from the low to mid-$30s triple net. The Mission Bay cluster has no laboratory suite vacancy and has ongoing activity from the three market areas we anticipated over time: life science companies and institutions, translational and clinical operations and information technology companies.","UCSF has an RFQ\/RFP on the street for a 300,000 square foot consolidation of its Laurel Heights campus and Meraki\u2019s recent establishment of a 110,000 square foot headquarters in Mission Bay and subsequent acquisition by Cisco, clearly, validates this location as desirable for the tech sector, which continues its boom, as we\u2019re tracking 2 million to 3 million square feet of demand.","Rental rates have risen to the mid-to-high $50s industrial gross in SoMa and Market Street corridor and higher for new build-to-suit projects. The 499 Illinois project is directly benefiting from these positive market dynamics. We are pleased that discussions are progressing in a serious manner with potential anchor tenants, ranging from 80,000 to 120,000 square feet in each of these market segments.","Specifically, we\u2019ve had a number of tours and meetings with senior teams of a few key tenant prospects and are now progressing to test fits of interior improvements with engineering and facility teams. The response to both the testimonials from key leaders and the Mission Bay cluster in these meetings and the detailed set of cutting-edge amenities we\u2019ve designed and plan to build featuring enhanced collaborations spaces has been very positive as well.","As Joel mentioned, let me go ahead and touch on yields in this market and others for a moment. As investors really should take comfort in the solid yields we delivered recently in Cambridge and San Diego, and the South San Francisco market, as well, notably, the East Grand facility in the 8.5% range and the anticipation of delivering within our yield range of mid-6% at the 499 facility. This is a contrast for a number of the tech sector projects in SoMa, reported to be in the 6% range as indicated by other leading REITs. So important to note, these projects are being delivered at attractive yields in today\u2019s market and often times with longer leases and higher credit quality than the tech factor.","At North Carolina and Seattle, we leased 237,000 square feet during 2012 in North Carolina, including 19,000 feet in Q4 and 124,000 square feet during 2012 in Seattle. North Carolina\u2019s occupancy increased 120 basis points from 94.3% to 95.5% this past year and we anticipate fresh demand in early 2013 will continue to improve those metrics. Seattle\u2019s occupancy dipped from 96.7% to 93.9% year-over-year, substantially impacted by new vacancy in one facility where we\u2019ve had encouraging momentum and anticipate a positive outcome over the next couple of quarters.","So, let me look forward for a bit and the status of the 2013 roles. We have approximately 1.1 million square feet or 7.9% of our operating properties slated for rollover during 2013 and consider it very manageable. 8% of that or 89,000 square feet are leased; 21% or 235,000 square feet are in active negotiations; 16% or 176,000 square feet is targeted for redevelopment. And that\u2019s comprised entirely of a non-lab acquisition that we closed during 2012 in our San Diego market located at a AAA Torrey Pines location. And then, finally, we have 55% or 620,000 square feet in early discussions in marketing.","Let\u2019s go ahead and review that 620,000 square feet in greater detail by each region. 105,000 square feet in the Greater Boston market has 60% of the space located in Cambridge and the adjacent urban markets. Nearly half of this square footage is rolling in November and December of 2013. The lab suites are in a very nice size range of 4,000 to 12,000 square feet, which are very desirable in today\u2019s market. So, we\u2019re encouraged with our prospects there for the year.","205,000 square feet is located in the San Francisco, Bay Area market. We\u2019ve got a set of two buildings comprising 21,000 square feet in the Stanford Research Park. It\u2019s well-positioned for a variety of life science or clean tech tenants, and another 14,000 square foot suite in the Stanford cluster is in the marketing phase.","We\u2019re also in early discussions with the existing tenants for nearly 85% of the 100,000 square feet distributed across a set of small to moderate-sized suites located in the greater South San Francisco market. And, finally, about 60,000 square feet located in the Mission Bay cluster in a number of high-quality moderate-sized lab suites and early discussions are going well with existing tenants.","Moving south. We have 135,000 square feet in the San Diego market, primarily in the Sorrento Valley and Sorrento Mesa markets. The two largest blocks, comprising a little less than half, are about a 50,000 square foot chunk, should provide a favorable outcome with an existing tenant discussion and the remainder we\u2019re evaluating the potential for placing about 62,000 square feet on the market for sale as leases roll during 2013.","We have 101,000 square feet in the Maryland market, distributed across each of their submarkets. We\u2019ve ultimately sold and exited the properties that we discussed earlier that contained 47,000 square feet of these roles as part of our asset recycling plan. And we\u2019re working with an existing tenant in the early stages for 38,000 feet, and actively we\u2019re marketing the remainder of those suites.","Finally, 52,000 square feet in the Southeast market. We\u2019re in early discussions with tenants to resolve all 30,000 square feet we have in North Carolina and we\u2019re actively marketing the remaining 20,000 square feet to new prospects. And just 7,000 square feet in Seattle, with the largest suite rolling in December; so we\u2019re in very good shape there.","So, in conclusion, the company really delivered on solid leasing results during 2012 and, although the second half of the year did not have the same volume as leasing as the first half, the overall trend is certainly positive as the operating portfolio occupancy has improved this past quarter by 40 basis points from 94.2% to 94.6%, and improved 160 basis points from 90% to 91.6% when you include the redevelopment assets.","We have a manageable set of rollovers during 2013 and are poised for meaningful progress and lease-up of properties in the redevelopment and development pipeline.","And, finally, we have continued momentum on the build to-suit front in our key markets as we\u2019re engaged in ongoing discussions with existing tenant\/clients and a new tenant product \u2013 prospect for establishing new Class-A facilities in our triple net locations.","I\u2019ll hand it off to Dean for further commentary.","Dean Shigenaga","Okay. Thanks, Steve. We reported FFO of $1.16 per share diluted as adjusted for the fourth quarter. Our FFO per share results are in line with our range for guidance provided on Investor Day in December of 2011.","Moving on to our core operating metrics, we had significant success with the execution of the significant growth NOI from development and redevelopment deliveries. Fourth quarter, NOI from continuing operations of $107.5 million was up 6.6% over the third quarter and up 10.1% over the fourth quarter of 2011. In 2012, we completed approximately $1.1 million rentable square feet of value-added development and redevelopment projects, aggregating almost $700 million at an average GAAP yield around 8%. Approximately 60% of this was completed and delivered at the very beginning of the fourth quarter of 2012.","Same-property performance for the fourth quarter, it really was the third consecutive quarter of an upward trend in cash same-property performance. The fourth quarter of 2012 cash same-property NOI growth of 6.3%, up over the solid third quarter 2012 cash same-property NOI growth of 4.3%.","We projected the strength of our cash same-property performance continues into 2013. Our projection for 2013 cash same-property performance is up from 4% to 7% over 2012. 2012 cash same-property performance of being up 3.5%, was driven primarily by the following items: a significant increase in cash rents from the burn-off of free rent at a couple projects, in particular, the East Tower in New York City, drove about $10 million increase in cash rents, and our build-to-suit-it for Onyx at 259 East Grand in South San Francisco drove about $1 million increase.","There were some offsetting increases resulting in a decrease in some cash rents. Primarily in greater Boston, we took some temporary downtime to transition space at 300 Technology Square and 790 Memorial Drive during 2012.","These spaces were delivered a few months after rollover in the year, and will contribute to increases in cash same-property performance in 2013. Suburban, Washington D.C., we had about 100,000 square foot amount of space that rolled in the second quarter at Virginia Manor, with a drop in occupancy to about 42% as of June 30.","We have leased a portion of this space in the second half of the year and increased occupancy to approximately 56%. Same-property operating expenses for the fourth quarter were up 8% over the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily related to an aggregate increase of approximately $2.6 million in recoverable taxes and repairs and maintenance expenses. The increases in property taxes were related to recently completed construction projects.","The same-property operating expenses for the year were up about 3.9% over 2011. The increases in same-property operating expense were primarily related to an increase in recoverable repairs and maintenance by approximately $2.6 million. Excluding this $2.6 million increase in repairs and maintenance, same-property operating expenses would have been up about 1.7%, when compared to 2011.","Before we move onto balance sheet milestones and strategy, let me briefly comment on certain important preconstruction activities. During the quarter, we commenced preconstruction activities for certain land parcels in order to reduce the time to deliver product to prospective tenants. For example, we are advancing entitlement efforts at Campus Pointe for expansion capacity on the site. Additionally, at Illumina Way, we are advancing efforts to increase entitlements and adjusting the designs for both building six and building seven for the additional entitlements.","Moving onto balance sheet matters. During the year, we executed our capital strategy and proved that we have access to diverse sources of capital that we believe is strategically important to our long-term capital structure. These sources of capital included real estate asset sales, secured construction project financing, an unsecured line of credit, unsecured notes payable, joint venture capital, preferred stock, and common stock issued through our at-the-market common stock offering program.","It is also important to note that we completed approximately $577 million of construction in 2012, limited our issuance of equity capital to $98 million and ended the year relatively leverage neutral at 7.3 times on a debt to EBITDA basis.","In 2013, our balance sheet goals include execution of our capital recycling program for investment into high-value Class-A urban assets, continue to minimize the use of common equity capital and lower our debt-to-EBITDA to approximately 6.5 times.","At a very high level, let me provide an overview of our strategy for key components of our sources and uses of capital. Keep in mind that this is high-level and capital is fungible between the two buckets, I\u2019m going to describe, but this should provide a better understanding of our capital strategy for 2013.","Let\u2019s split the capital needs for 2013 into two buckets. One bucket will fund construction and the other bucket will focus on our goal to reduce leverage. The certain amounts I\u2019m going to describe may represent midpoint amounts from our 2013 guidance. The first bucket represents funding for construction spending of $570 million for 2013. Sources of capital aggregating about $667 million or $97 million in excess of our construction forecast is projected to come from the following: $140 million from cash flows from operating activities after dividends; $377 million from asset sales, and this includes the $84 million of sales that we completed to-date in 2013; and, lastly, $150 million of common equity proceeds under our ATM program.","The other key bucket will focus on our goal to reduce leverage from approximately 7.3 times as of 12\/31\/12 to about 6.5 times by the end of 2013. The key sources that will allow us to achieve our leverage goal includes a combination of EBITDA growth and a portion of the excess capital from the first bucket, I just mentioned. The key value-added project deliveries scheduled for 2013 as shown on Page 28 of our supplemental package include the following: the ground-up development at 225 Binney Street in Cambridge, which is 100% leased to Biogen Idec; a portion of the space at 430 East 29th Street in New York City, which is the West Tower related to our lease with Roche, and keep in mind that this delivery, in particular, is very close to the end of the year; and then, lastly, almost all of our redevelopment projects and, again, these projects have significant pre-releasing.","Moving on to asset sales. A very big picture here, I think we hit our target for 2012. I think the challenge here from time-to-time is making an estimate of the timing of closing transactions is always a bit tricky to predict, but we completed $84 million of the sales in 2013, bringing our total sales since January 1, 2012 to $159 million. Our original 2013 asset sales target was $300 million and we had about $77 million rollover from December of 2012 and deferred into 2013 for an aggregate of $377 million, now targeted for 2013.","We have made progress since Investor Day in December as follows: $84 million in sales completed to-date in 2013; we have about $55 million under contract; we have about another $140 million at various stages, including letters of intent, early negotiations; and, lastly, preparation of marketing packages.","Included in this $140 million is our targeted partial sale of an interest in a land parcel related to the 50%\/50% joint venture for 75\/125 Binney. And, lastly, $98 million that remains, which we\u2019ll identify in the next quarter or two.","Moving briefly on to unsecured bonds. I just want to point out that we\u2019re unable to comment on the timing of our bond offering, since it will subject to market conditions, but let me provide some color. Given the continuing positive environment and low interest rate outlook we expect to issue unsecured notes in 2013. Our strategy remains focused on 10-year bonds, given attractive pricing for longer tenured paper and our desire to both expand and ladder our maturities. Tenured treasuries are hovering around 2% and spreads have tightened. So, 10-year bonds today for Alexandria should be inside of 4%. Again, specific pricing for Alexandria will be at market when we execute our transaction.","Lastly, on guidance. Our guidance for 2013 was increased by a couple of cents for both EPS and FFO per share diluted. Our updated guidance is as follows: EPS diluted in a range from a $1.41 to a $1.61; FFO per share diluted in a range from $4.44 to $4.64. Our guidance for 2013 was increased to reflect an improvement in our occupancy forecast for the year, as well an increased pace of leasing.","Additionally, the increase reflects important preconstruction activities related to entitlement are designed for expansion opportunities related to a few campus locations. As a reminder, our goal with these preconstruction efforts is to reduce the time to deliver ground-up development projects to prospective tenants.","Our guidance for 2013, also includes our current assumptions related to the funding for our ground-up development at 75\/125 Binney as follows: construction financing, somewhere in the 60% loan-to-cost range; the transfer of a 50% interest to a JV Partner; and our capital investment in the range of $40 million to $50 million, all of which we expect to be funded in 2013.","Lastly, disclosure of detail assumptions included in our overall guidance was disclosed beginning on Page 7 of our press release.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Joel.","Joel Marcus","Okay, operator, we \u2013 we\u2019ll take questions now, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.","Jamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America","Great. Thank you. So, I know you guys spent a good deal of time talking about yields and comparing yields to office on the call. I guess, where \u2013 what investors might be trying to get their head around is the portion of your total investment that goes to the lab space build-out. How to underwrite that or how you guys think about underwriting that and the return on that versus kind of your core and shell office building? Maybe if you give us a sense of how you guys \u2013 when you look at acquisitions or even development, how you think about the relative investment and those two pieces of your cost structure.","Joel Marcus","Well, if the question \u2013 Jamie, is the question presume that somehow the above-standard improvement from office somehow is not valuable for the long-term? Could you expand upon your question? Because, obviously, the return is the overall return of the project, it\u2019s not segmented core and shell versus improvements. But if we have a build-to-suit, generally, they tend to be 10-year, 15, 20-year leases. These are yields that \u2013 and the yields that \u2013 I think it\u2019s important to note these are initial stabilized deals, so these don\u2019t include all the increases over time, which I think investors and analysts often overlook as well, but these are yields on the full package.","Peter Moglia","Yeah, I guess one way I could answer it, Jamie \u2013 it\u2019s Peter Moglia \u2013 is that when we do look at pricing build-to-suits, we do have a lower expectation for return on the core and shell and the TIs that are infrastructure 40-year type of duration. And then we price the TIs that we think may not recycle as well or for as long at a higher rate to blend into a total that we believe is above what exit cap rates would be at the time.","Jamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America","So, the parts of the piece that doesn\u2019t recycle as long \u2013 how do you think about the duration? Or how long those last? Or do you assume that those only last as long as the lease?","Peter Moglia","Well, I would say that we would \u2013 we amortize that, the majority of that into the term of the lease. So, if it\u2019s a 10-year lease, we\u2019re getting that back in 10 years.","Steve Richardson","Right, and Jamie, I think it\u2019s constructive. I mean, a couple anecdotes we mentioned Novartis renewing the lease there in Tech Square. There were no TI dollars; the one down in Maryland were $5 a foot. We had a large one in South San Francisco a year or so ago, it had been leased for 10 years. We had a 10-year renewal and I think we had a $15 to $20 a foot tenant improvement allowance there. So \u2013 in the overall cost per square foot of these facilities, it\u2019s fairly nominal.","Jamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America","And then can you just give us a sense of where market rents are across your major markets? And whether you\u2019re seeing any material growth at this point?","Steve Richardson","Yeah, I think in the Cambridge market, we\u2019ve got very solid support as we talked about in the mid-$50s, triple net for existing product. So, I think we\u2019re doing well there.","Joel Marcus","Non-build to suit.","Steve Richardson","Right, non-build to suit, absolutely, that\u2019s existing product and, again, as we talked about build-to-suit\u2019s significantly higher. So there is certainly is a step function as these companies \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about this a lot and we\u2019ve seen improve out now, with Onyx, with ARIAD, as they\u2019re looking to aggregate around a campus to build a company for the next 10 or 15 years, they\u2019re really driven to this build-to-suit type of product and they\u2019re absolutely willing to pay for that step-up in rent from the existing product that\u2019s out there.","Moving across the markets, we think Torrey-Pines has certainly stabilized in that mid-$30s, triple net range, South San Francisco, again, segmenting the large blocks of space from the small space, similarly low to mid-$30s, triple net.","Peter Moglia","Yeah, I could just comment on Seattle. Seattle has remained a very high-rental environment, even though the activity hasn\u2019t been strong as it was maybe two or three years ago, but their rents are between $45 and $52 for the Class-A space.","Maryland has \u2013 it experienced a drop over the last couple of years, but we\u2019re encouraged by the fact that we\u2019re now quoting things in the mid-to-high $20s and getting a lot of traction with that. And then in Research Triangle Park things for the first class space is also similar to Maryland in the $25 to $30 range. And then in New York, which obviously Joel commented on, is very high-cost environment, we\u2019re able to translate that to very high rents. And without giving too much away, I would say that we are in the mid-to-high-$70s to low $80s for our projections for the West Tower.","Jamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America","Okay. And then, finally, just any thoughts on sequestration and what do you think it might be in to your leasing? Any expected slowdown?","Joel Marcus","Yeah, I think \u2013 I mean, my own personal view is that it\u2019s likely to happen, it may not last for a prolonged period of time. We know just through my work at the NIH and others that there\u2019s no one on either side of the aisle, as well as the Executive branch that wants the NIH budget cut, so we think a deal will be made post-sequestration as part of another budget package.","I think the only area that we see it impacting is really the institutional side, because the institutions are the ones that get direct grants from the NIH. The pharma and bio side, zero impact to those guys, by and large. But I think a project like Longwood or projects where you\u2019d be looking primarily at an institutional base, a 501(c)(3) through university or research, those are the ones that would be on pause until that sequestration is resolved. But my guess is, it will be resolved by June 30, if not sooner, in a positive fashion.","Jamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America","So, when you think about your expiration schedule, is there anything there that might be slow to renew based on...","Joel Marcus","We have one roll of about 60,000 with a GSA lease in one of our markets, and we expect to renew that, and \u2013 because it\u2019s mission critical \u2013 we\u2019ve been told that. And as far as bigger leases, I think we\u2019ve said before, the only lease we have that really is heavily dependent on NIH is a lease in \u2013 rolling in 2016 with the Scripps Research Institute, which is the largest non-profit in the U.S., but there\u2019s no near-term lease exposure to that, that\u2019s 2016. Other than that we have nothing coming up in 2013.","Jamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America","Okay. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Yeah. Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","Our next question is from Quentin Velleley with Citi. Please go ahead with your question.","Quentin Velleley \u2013 Citi","Hey, there. Just in terms of the income producing assets that you\u2019ve sold recently, where your GAAP yields are sort of above 15% and I assume the cash yields are actually higher than that as well, I guess my question is how many of these properties are there in the portfolio that are in the suburban (inaudible) markets? Lab space might not be viable long-term and the rent\u2019s very high, can you just give us sort of a sense of how many more of these assets there are?","Joel Marcus","Well, first of all, let me may be correct your view. When you sell an asset \u2013 and Peter\u2019s the one that\u2019s handled that and can give you chapter in verse \u2013 it\u2019s really a mischaracterization and a misnomer to characterize this as being sold at some GAAP yields. Those were ramps that were produced in the past and in the Columbia \u2013 1124 Columbia we had already removed one of the key anchors and move them down to South Lake Union. Another tenant, we didn\u2019t choose to underwrite, moved to another landlord. And then another tenant chose to elect an early termination.","So, if you talk about a GAAP yield on that project of 15% or 17%, it makes no sense. It\u2019s really on a per square foot basis and it really is on a \u2013 on the buyer looking out what you can pay for repurposing that. So that\u2019s how you have to look at it. And Peter will talk more about \u2013 we don\u2019t have too many of those in the portfolio on a value basis, but it is pretty different.","Same thing on West Watkins; we had almost 60,000 square feet that\u2019s rolling this year. We have another building that the tenant is likely to exit, which is the main anchor there in a couple of years. So, again, you can\u2019t look at it as we\u2019re investing in it on a yield or you are selling on a yield basis. But, Peter.","Peter Moglia","Yeah, thanks, Joel, I guess, Quentin to give you an example of that 1124 Columbia building may show as a \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 15% GAAP yield or something like that right now. But after these tenants exit, I think that would go down to a 3% and you\u2019d be holding an asset in a market that is just not in favor with lab tenants anymore and its highest and best use is really medical office. So I think there was a really good marriage between us and the buyer where we were able to cash out of an asset. They did really well for us for a long period of time, but no longer was needed. We could take that cash and put it into higher earning investments.","Joel Marcus","Yeah, let me just say this about that asset. We bought that in 1996 with zero down, the yield on the original sale leaseback to the Fred Hutch was something in the range of 10% to 11% and that asset has cash flowed and had been very, very accretive to this portfolio. And now we\u2019re at a position where that market, as Peter said, has gone totally MOB and hospital. So, again, look at it for what it is, not for maybe some theoretical cash flow. But do you want to talk about other exposures?","Peter Moglia","Yeah, and a little more color on the 1201 Clopper asset, as Joel alluded to, we have a tenant in a couple of years that has told us that they\u2019re \u2013 they\u2019ve told us that they\u2019re moving out. They have their own campus already in another other part of the I-270 corridor there and their plan was to move. So, that building is quite big. I think it\u2019s somewhere in the neighborhood of about 140,000 square feet and it\u2019s also a mix of office, warehouse, and lab.","And we took a look at that strategically and said: this is Gaithersburg, it\u2019s not Rockville, which is really the place where people want to be these days; do we really want to sink a large amount of capital into re-tenanting that building? And the answer was: no, it didn\u2019t make sense. So, we found a buyer who was really willing to put in the work and the capital to reposition it. And, again, I think that was a good marriage between us and them, and we got a fair price for the income that\u2019s left on it.","So, to talk about what\u2019s remaining and we do have a few assets across the portfolio, some in San Diego that we\u2019ve identified that have very similar attributes there. They were great performers for a while, but the market has really moved into more high-quality areas.","So, I don\u2019t know if I want to disclose too much more than that, but suburban Pennsylvania\u2019s another area where maybe some of the assets have longer-term leases than maybe rolling in the next two years. But down the road, we don\u2019t really want to own those assets anymore. It\u2019s just not a market that we want to be invested. So, we\u2019re looking at potentially disposing of those as well.","Joel Marcus","Yeah, but as a percentage of GAV, it\u2019s pretty minor.","Quentin Velleley \u2013 Citi","Okay. But for the non-income producing assets \u2013 sorry, for the income-producing assets that you\u2019re looking at selling this year, should we expect to see similar yields to what you\u2019ve done? Or a little bit lower?","Joel Marcus","Well, again....","Peter Moglia","Yeah, I mean, I guess it depends on what yield you\u2019re looking at. I mean, we haven\u2019t announced \u2013 we have disclosed held-for-sale in Worcester, a portfolio we have there.","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah, there\u2019s only \u2013 the two assets we sold in 2013, one was actually the asset that was held-for-sale as of year-end. One of the assets did not meet the qualifications for held-for-sale as of year-end, so it was actually not in the discontinued operations numbers. The asset that Peter\u2019s referring to, there is a third asset that\u2019s in the Q to be sold in the first quarter. That asset\u2019s also a component of the fourth quarter discontinued operation information. So whether it\u2019s the revenue or the NOI that you see in the supplemental package you kind of could get a sense for the income estimates off of that project.","Quentin Velleley \u2013 Citi","Okay. And then just in terms of the proposed joint venture on Binney Street, if I\u2019m reading it correctly, it looks like you\u2019re selling it and, effectively, where your partner would get an 8% development yield. Obviously, they\u2019re going to take some leasing risk with that, given you\u2019re not fully leased, but is there some \u2013 can you maybe just talk about the fees? I\u2019m not sure if there is some kind of promote or something in there?","Peter Moglia","Yeah. Quentin, this is Peter Moglia. We\u2019re still in early discussions with a number of parties. I \u2013 it\u2019s just not smart for us to disclose any specific details with those negotiations at this time.","Quentin Velleley \u2013 Citi","Okay. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Yep. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next question is from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Sheila McGrath \u2013 Evercore","Yes, Joel, I was wondering on the joint venture is that something we can extrapolate the pricing there to land value in Cambridge? Was it negotiated based on a certain land value?","Joel Marcus","Well, again, we haven\u2019t \u2013 we haven\u2019t had a handshake or concluded any joint venture. We\u2019re actually aggressively pursuing the construction financing first, because that provides valuable piece of the puzzle. So I think it wouldn\u2019t be useful for us to comment on any of the broad terms we\u2019ve had broad discussions with. We just haven\u2019t been that \u2013 we aren\u2019t that far along. We\u2019re really focused on \u2013 we\u2019ve had discussions with a number of partners and structures and things like that, but we\u2019re really waiting to get the construction financing in place ASAP.","Sheila McGrath \u2013 Evercore","Okay and then....","Joel Marcus","So, bear with us for a quarter or so.","Sheila McGrath \u2013 Evercore","Sure. And then, on East Jamie Court and East Grand Avenue, the yields moved higher. I was just wondering if you could walkthrough what was \u2013 what were the drivers of the revisions there?","Peter Moglia","Yeah, I think, Sheila, on East Grand, ultimately the team on the ground did a great job of buying out the project, and that combined with Onyx really wanting to occupy as soon as they possibly could, so we accelerated they\u2019re delivery; so that helped. And then at East Jamie Court, we were just more successful than we had been projecting. Again, we talked about that smaller segment having a lower vacancy rate in the market, so we were fortunate to capture a few tenants and really beat what were conservative projections.","Sheila McGrath \u2013 Evercore","Okay. And then, Joel, you did mention in your remarks earlier that there were some assets coming for sale. I\u2019m just wondering if you \u2013 if there\u2019s something of interest to you? Or how you\u2019re viewing acquisition opportunities at this point?","Joel Marcus","Yeah, we\u2019ve modeled none, but there are in one market or another, assets we know that are being positioned for sale. We\u2019re certainly looking at a few, as we speak. We don\u2019t have any huge motivation one way or another, but, obviously, if something was superbly fascinating to us and one where we thought we could create value and deliver a product that fit into that submarket in a smart way, we would potentially pursue it. But I would say we\u2019re looking more than we\u2019re aggressively pursuing.","Sheila McGrath \u2013 Evercore","Okay. And then just on New York Tower LOIs, do you \u2013 are they like \u2013 do you consider them highly probable? Or the ones that get you to 54%?","Joel Marcus","Yeah. About half are from existing tenants and I would say those are highly probable. So out of the seven floors, let\u2019s say more than half \u2013 four floors or more are from existing tenants. So we think those are highly probable and the others are new tenants, but we have strong relationships. And I think it\u2019s hard to always characterize and you say something and the Street assumes you have it. So I would say 50%-50%, but my personal view is it\u2019s higher than that.","Sheila McGrath \u2013 Evercore","Okay. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Yeah. Thanks, Sheila.","Operator","Next question is from George Auerbach with ISI Group. Please go ahead with your question.","George Auerbach \u2013 ISI Group","Great. Thank you. Joel or Dean, have you guys touched yet on the seller financing of the assets sales, the $39 million.","Dean Shigenaga","Have we touched on it?","Joel Marcus","We just briefly mentioned it. Peter, can talk to you about it; he negotiated it.","Peter Moglia","I think $29 million of that was associated with the 1124 Columbia sale. Remember, that the \u2013 well, maybe \u2013 you may not know but the buyer is repositioning that. So, in order to maximize the value, they were looking for a loan that could bridge them through the entitlement process in the beginning of construction. So that\u2019s a short duration loan; I think it\u2019s a couple years where they\u2019ll be paying us, I think they have an option to extend it for one year after that. And then there was another $9 million loan associated with the $40-something million West Watkins\/Clopper deal, which was part of the negotiation to maximize our proceeds.","George Auerbach \u2013 ISI Group","I guess can you just touch on the rate on those loans? And then I guess just kind of stepping back, what is the FFO contribution of those loans? Just trying to figure \u2013 I know guidance ticked up by $0.04 \u2013 just wondering what impact the seller financing had on FFO this year?","Dean Shigenaga","Actually, the seller financing had no impact. What really drove the change in our guidance was driven twofold: one, our improved outlook on occupancy and leasing in 2013, which was driving improved NOI; and then a little bit of the entitlement efforts, which I described, to really advance opportunities for prospective tenants in certain campus locations. But going back to your rate question, George, we haven\u2019t disclosed that publicly, but just keep in mind the low-rate environment; it\u2019s fairly consistent with what you would expect.","George Auerbach \u2013 ISI Group","Okay. And, I guess, Dean, can you maybe talk about same-store NOI growth in the fourth quarter in 2012. It seems like the New York lease kind of, especially in the fourth quarter had a disproportionate impact? Do you have those numbers excluding New York?","Dean Shigenaga","I don\u2019t. That was actually same-store performance for the entire year. I don\u2019t have that breakdown, George, but I can come back to you.","George Auerbach \u2013 ISI Group","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Dave Rodgers with Robert Baird. Please go ahead with your question.","Dave Rodgers \u2013 Robert Baird","Joel, during your comments and Steve\u2019s as well, I think you both talked about negotiations, leasing backlog, RFPs, RFQs that you\u2019re seeing out in the market. Have you \u2013 I didn\u2019t hear you present the information \u2013 but have you aggregated that total of kind of what the backlog is that you\u2019re looking at today? If not, can you? And I guess maybe to componentize that a little bit, how much of that is related to existing assets that you think you\u2019d have a shot at filling? Versus how much of that would be related to redevelopment or ground-up development where you\u2019d have to spend money on?","Joel Marcus","That\u2019s a \u2013 maybe try to restate your question in a more compartmentalized fashion, so we can try to, take it in bite size pieces, that\u2019s a pretty broad question.","Dave Rodgers \u2013 Robert Baird","What\u2019s the total leasing backlog that you\u2019re looking at today?","Joel Marcus","I\u2019m not sure what you mean by leasing backlog, but let\u2019s put it this way, we\u2019re seeing stronger leasing in \u2013 strangely enough \u2013 in some of the suburban markets than we\u2019ve imagined or seen over the past year or two, which has been I\u2019d say significantly more than we assumed.","I think we\u2019ve got pretty conservative assumptions on some of our existing space when those things would be speculatively filled. And we\u2019re seeing the \u2013 a more rapid conversion of requirements in the leases than we planned in our internal model. But I don\u2019t know that \u2013 we track by market and submarket, not overall. We don\u2019t really roll it up because it doesn\u2019t mean anything rolled up because rents in North Carolina could be $15 a foot and rents in Boston could be $65, so it\u2019s a little hard to say, but if you want to be market specific, we could be responsive.","Dave Rodgers \u2013 Robert Baird","Excuse me, maybe not now, but, again, the thought was just kind of getting to \u2013 it seems like a lot of your activity has been in the last couple of quarters development related, are you continuing to see that? You kind of commented on that during the commentary...","Joel Marcus","Well, I think it\u2019s \u2013 yeah, I think it\u2019s broader \u2013 much broader than development related...","Dave Rodgers \u2013 Robert Baird","(Inaudible).","Joel Marcus","Yeah, I think it\u2019s much broader than development related. I mean, I can think of spaces that we\u2019ve had \u2013 we have kind of what we call chronic leasing or chronic vacancy spaces that we\u2019ve just seen stay vacant for periods of time. We have one space that\u2019s been vacant for quite a while in the Greater Boston market, that\u2019s now just been \u2013 just been leased, I think this quarter to an institutional tenant that we haven\u2019t had activity for three or four years on it. It\u2019s not part of Cambridge, but we\u2019re starting to see that happen in quite a number of locations with spaces that have been hard to lease and we\u2019re getting really good \u2013 good results. So that\u2019s been surprising to us.","Dave Rodgers \u2013 Robert Baird","And then a second question I guess related to the joint venture you talked about with ARIAD and I realize it\u2019s not done, you\u2019re still negotiating it. Maybe just step back and say why did you elect to go \u2013 or why are you electing to at least pursue that type of a funding for that asset versus maybe what you might do with the Biogen development that you have ongoing as well?","Joel Marcus","Well, our preference would be do it all ourselves, but we\u2019re mindful of \u2013 and we haven\u2019t made final determinations \u2013 but we\u2019re certainly moving down a road here. But our goal to meet our debt to adjusted EBITDA target of 6.5x this year. So that\u2019s part of the overall plan and that\u2019s been driving our thinking now.","Dave Rodgers \u2013 Robert Baird","Thank you.","Peter Moglia","Yeah, I \u2013 this is Peter. I\u2019d just comment, too, I mean, versus the Biogen Idec campus. I mean, this is a development that still had some leasing risk associated with it, so it just makes a little bit more sense to do a JV structure where you have some more risk involved than the Biogen Idec deal.","Dean Shigenaga","Hey, Dave, before you jump into your next question, let me just get back to George\u2019s question about fourth quarter same-property performance on a cash basis as reported was 6.3%. If we were to back out the benefit from cash rent improvements at New York City, cash same-property performance for the fourth quarter would have been 3.7%. So, it\u2019s roughly a couple million dollar cash improvement in New York for the fourth quarter.","Joel Marcus","Dave, did we \u2013 were we responsive to your questions?","Dave Rodgers \u2013 Robert Baird","Yeah, I\u2019m all set. Thanks, guys.","Joel Marcus","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next question is from Jeff Theiler with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Jeff Theiler \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Good afternoon. Just a quick one regarding 499 Illinois, it sounded from your commentary that \u2013 at least it sounded like interest has really turned a corner. You\u2019re getting a lot more inquiries. Is that, in your opinion, just a function of we\u2019re getting closer to UCSF opening? Or is there something else going on there that\u2019s driving traffic?","Steve Richardson","I think it\u2019s really a combination of things. I think the overall market dynamics as we\u2019ve outlined in the second-half of 2012 have really pointed in our direction. There\u2019s a lessening existing supply of space in SoMa for tech companies. With Meraki and Cisco coming down to Mission Bay, I think that\u2019s clearly validated Mission Bay as a technology sector location. So, that\u2019s certainly been positive. And then, ultimately, we had a bit of a bit of a pause in the life science activity during 2012 and historically it\u2019s been relatively consistent.","So I think we\u2019re just seeing that consistent demand re-emerge and it\u2019s really from both sectors: it\u2019s life science companies, it\u2019s institution, it\u2019s the translational research and clinical elements as well. So that \u2013 and that\u2019s not only UCSF for sure, but as they continue to advance on that medical center and really the campus has nearly built out there, which is why they\u2019ve got this RFP on the street, it\u2019s just very clear that there is a diminishing supply of product available.","Jeff Theiler \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Yeah. And so would you expect just in regards to UCSF, would you expect that peak demand coming concurrently with the completion and the opening? Or is there a time lag that happens after that? Or do you get demand coming ahead of it? Where would you kind of put the peak?","Steve Richardson","I think it\u2019ll be starting this year and it\u2019ll continue through the time period that the medical center opens. There\u2019s a clear effort to consolidate in and around Mission Bay. The Chancellor\u2019s building is now broken ground, so that is clearly the power center for UCSF, right there at the corner of 16th Street and 3rd Street.","Jeff Theiler \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay. Great. Thanks very much.","Joel Marcus","Thank you.","Operator","And we have a follow up from Quentin Velleley with Citi. Please go ahead with your follow up.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","Hey, good afternoon. It\u2019s Michael Bilerman speaking. I just wanted to come back to sort of the asset sales that are planned in July. We completely understand and appreciate that under-leased and underutilized assets and assets that go through changes in dynamics, can\u2019t really look at them on a cap rate basis. But I think the other side of it is that income is being lost from the company, right? You take the two sales that happened the beginning of the year, the $84 million, you are losing $15 million of GAAP NOI; that\u2019s coming out of the P&L.","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah. But some of it was coming out anyway because of either lease rolling out or termination of leases. So a chunk of it I don\u2019t have it in front of me, but...","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","No, no, no, right. We know whether it\u2019s going to come out or not, but I think you have to appreciate from an investor and analyst perspective that we have to understand that on your NOI stream how much of that would be at risk from potential assets that, if someone was capping your NOI and capping this NOI at a cap rate, okay \u2013 so they would be putting a cap rate on that $15 million \u2013 they would have come out with a much different value than what ultimately you sold on the assets.","So maybe I can ask it in a different way. If we look at the sales of income-producing assets that are scheduled for the rest of the year, which is about just under $100 million, what is the current NOI stream for those assets? I.e., how much NOI needs to come out once we sell those assets for $100 million?","Dean Shigenaga","Give us one second.","Joel Marcus","Yeah.","Dean Shigenaga","So I\u2019m going to see how much; I\u2019m looking for the breakdown.","Joel Marcus","Well, about more than half of that, Michael, I think Dean had in his remarks about $50 million or $60 million are targeted for three assets in San Diego, all of which go dark and are in our lease rolls today. So that\u2019s going away no matter what, but we can try to...","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","But I assume that\u2019s not in your same store guidance that we need to figure out some way to take that out from an NOI stream to be able to get to the numbers. So, arguably, I understand that selling these assets, they serve a different purpose and they\u2019re great to do and it\u2019s cleaning up the portfolio and all the other benefits that we think are good, but at the same time we have to make sure that we\u2019re stripping out the right amount of NOI for the sales.","Joel Marcus","Yep.","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah, so, Michael, I\u2019m sorry, I just got the schedules, as you can imagine $377 million projected, I wanted to be sure I looked carefully at the breakdown to answer your question.","Joel Marcus","But only the income-producing...","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah, so on the income-producing, the only other sale that\u2019s been identified is the one we referenced on the call. So \u2013 so, we completed $84 million, there is roughly something in the $40 million range that\u2019s closing here shortly in the quarter. And outside of that I think there\u2019s another $18 million to meet our bogey. So, it\u2019s a small number. That asset has not been identified, so I can\u2019t give you a yield today, in the sense. So, it\u2019s small and I don\u2019t expect -all this information\u2019s included in our guidance, included in same store. I don\u2019t have that particular yield assumption in front of me at the moment, but on $18 million it\u2019s not a big assumption.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","Right. Well, and I guess maybe the other way to look at it is there a way to sort of parcel out, if you were to sort of look at the NOI stream today, sort of calling it on an annualized basis, the $430 million, what percentage of that income do you view within this bucket of \u2013 is it $10 million, is it $20 million, where we should be really treating that on a price per pound basis, rather than a cap rate basis? Understanding that $15 million, right, was \u2013 that represented almost 3.5% of NOI, but a much, much lower percentage of NAV.","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah, and I hate to ask you to do this, Michael, I missed the first part of your question.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","Like I say, if your annualized NOI stream is $430 million, how much of that NOI stream is tied up in assets where you see this risk is there? Is it effectively done? I mean, the two assets you sold, again, produced $15 million of GAAP NOI, that\u2019s 3.5% of the NOI stream, where the value would\u2019ve been very different if you put a cap rate on it versus valuing it on a price per pound basis?","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah, I don\u2019t \u2013 Michael, you\u2019re talking about our overall asset base, and if I think through, we don\u2019t have anything specifically identified that falls into this category that we\u2019re looking to monetize at the moment. We have one asset in the Worcester market, out in suburbs of Boston that we\u2019ve identified and those are in our disclosures. I think that was disclosed in the fourth quarter as a component of one of the targeted sales in December.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","Okay. All right...","Dean Shigenaga","So beyond that...","Joel Marcus","So, maybe to put book ends around that, we think that in the broad \u2013 if we looked at all the assets that we would want to dispose of today \u2013 that we could dispose of today, that we haven\u2019t identified, but that we kind of have an idea about, that number would be somewhere in the $5 million to $7 million range of NOI...","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","Great. And then just coming back to New York for the construction cost of $1,100 a foot for the second Tower...","Joel Marcus","Yep. Yep.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","Can you break that out of how much was \u2013 and understanding that I know we went through the Great Recession, you have to carry the land \u2013 well, not the land because there\u2019s the ground lease. But you have to carry I guess the materials for a little while longer, how much of that represented \u2013 how much of the $1,100 is capitalized costs? And maybe you can break out the components because it does seem like a high number, especially, the fact that there\u2019s no land basis?","Joel Marcus","Well, we can maybe do that off line. I don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019d have to look at it. Clearly, you\u2019ve got the superstructure, the infrastructure, which is expensive, you\u2019ve got all the steel and curtain wall that we bought back in I think 2007 when we kicked off that building. You\u2019ve got, obviously, the carry issue described. We\u2019ve got, obviously, a budget for finishes, et cetera. But I think it\u2019s wise not to get too obsessively and compulsively focused on the costs, but look at the number on the rent that Peter gave.","If you\u2019re getting $70 or $80 triple net, 10-year, 15, 20-year leases with 3% escalations and you\u2019re getting a yield we think will be ultimately north of 6.5% in a triple A, class-A asset in New York, I don\u2019t know of any deal we could do in New York City today, by way of acquisition or development, that could equal those yields, Michael. So, I think put that into perspective. We\u2019ll try offline to get you somewhat of a segmented breakdown on costs; we don\u2019t have it with us...","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","Right. I\u2019m also just trying to reconcile a little bit. I mean, you\u2019ve been in this project for a long time, I would think that the yields that most people and that you\u2019ve talked about on the prior calls \u2013 we can dig up the transcripts \u2013 I\u2019m not trying to say that 6.5%, close to 7% is not good today, it is, but the yields that have been talked about previously about this project, especially about the second phase of the project, which was supposed to benefit from a lot of the infrastructure costs being layered to the first tower, were much higher. And so, I\u2019m just trying to understand what changed? Because the rental market\u2019s certainly come back and the rents are there.","So, it has to have been on the cost side and I\u2019m just trying to understand what part of the cost? Was it the capitalization piece? Because you obviously are capitalizing a lot on other projects, so I\u2019m trying to think about whether we need to be mindful of that. And just what sort of change in the dynamics from when you first sort of thought about this project and it was going to be a high single-digit yield to where it\u2019s ending up today?","Joel Marcus","Well, I think when we started this project in 2005, 2006 and 2007, our view of the market pre-Lehman was quite different. And, obviously, we had never built in New York. And I don\u2019t think we ever gave \u2013 you could go check the transcripts \u2013 I don\u2019t remember giving specific yields because we had no rental rates at that time. But I know over the last couple of quarters, I think I personally said, both in meetings and publicly, I\u2019ve said we think it\u2019s probably in the mid-6%s. That\u2019s a number I\u2019ve been using publicly for quite a number of quarters.","And, I think the numbers as they finally come out through our finance group are pretty consistent with that. So \u2013 but if you go back five or more years and our hopes on the project, I\u2019m sure hopes were in 2006 and 2007 in the mid to high-single digits, but those were only hopes, certainly, no details behind that. So, I think that\u2019s how we thought about it over post-Lehman.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","Okay, great. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Yep, thank you.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn it back to Joel Marcus for closing remarks.","Joel Marcus","Again, thank you very much for your time and we\u2019ll look forward to talking to you on the first quarter call and, again, Happy New Year to you all.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference.

Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company\u2019s Form 10-K, Annual Report and other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Joel Marcus. Please go ahead.","Joel S. Marcus","Thanks, Paula, and welcome everybody. We\u2019ll try to be somewhat shortened format hopefully we leave more time for Q&A and efficiency on a busy earnings day. Starting on the macro, we\u2019re obviously fortunate that ARE have the very good business with the highest quality team, Class A assets, cluster hub locations, really world class tenants and I hope that continuing really great disclosure. We\u2019re blessed to have significant opportunities to grow in our core CBD cluster markets and luckily don\u2019t need to stray away from world-class locations.","I think it\u2019s fair to say that we have finally achieved the renaissance for life science R&D in the best cluster sub markets where ARE dominates, if you read April 29, addition, there was a great quote in there, let me share it with you, we could be witnessing a substantial re-rating where instead of a discount on R&D premium could ultimately be awarded for the potential option value of curing disease and therefore really our focus is and has been bio and pharma in core cluster markets.","Important to note, two of that area has only 7% about, 7% of ABR exposure to those specific universities and non-profits in the tenants sector which are much more heavily dependant on government financing and we seek to be doing business with those that have large endowments in the center of the clusters.","On internal growth for a moment, let me just transition there, we had a very solid leasing quarter of almost over 700,000 square feet, we\u2019ve only got about 568,000 square feet left to lease in the balance of 2013 on lease rolls and about 309,000 unresolved.","So this is actually pretty minor compared to the usual strong effort is being made to lease up purely vacant space by our first-in-class regional teams and that should positively impact occupancy across all regions, both starting in the second quarter and beyond.","On occupancy, the trend for the balance of 2013 will clearly be positive. San Francisco as expected experienced a temporary decline due to some moves, but we expect to recover nicely starting in the third, into the fourth quarter and primarily attributable to the Onyx move.","San Diego decreased a bit due to some vacancy and newly operating properties but once again our strong domination of the San Diego lab leasing market will move that very positively through the balance of 2013 and we feel very comfortable with our year-end forecast, occupancy forecast of 93.9% to 94.3% and certainly hope to beat that.","On the external growth side, we have very solid leasing quarter for redevelopments and developments of almost over 450,000 square feet heavily attributable to the area than Onyx leasing. And we hope that we would like to know an improved disclosure on developments and redevelopment that should make it very clear to follow these projects and visualize the high quality and the details of what we\u2019re doing in those value add programs.","On the development leasing, we have signed a 131,000 square foot for fourth floor LOI with the credit tenant at the Alexandria Center for Life Science, New York City and several other LOIs are in process. We actually have quite a number of active prospects probably more than a half dozen, who are actively engaged with and heavily interestingly enough coming from both Japan and Europe from Pharma. We expect to be hopefully close to 50% leased as we head into the summer months. We expect in the June and July timeframe to have 499, substantially fully leased and resolved, so stay tuned.","On the balance sheet and Dean will speak about this a bit. We\u2019re on target to hit our leverage target by the end of year and we refer you to the details on \u2013 are in the press release. On the expected sales, we got $45 million of non-income producing assets under negotiation right now. $65 million projected from the partial sale into the joint venture from 75\/125 Binney, which is ongoing and the remainder would be about $125 million coming from additional domestic and potentially favor to internationally of non-income producing assets. So we think it\u2019s imminently achievable and being highlight the EBITDA on boarding through the end of the year.","On the sales of income producing assets and a recycling program we\u2019re mostly done for 2013, for income producing assets very modest amount for 2014, total NOI loss at a maximum for 2013, 2014 the balance would be probably less than $2 million and then we hope we would refer you to land undergoing pre-construction, we\u2019ve got some new land and hopefully very helpful disclosure, so that over time, we can restore the valuation for those great projects that are well deserved and then finally on the dividend side, I would expect that the Board would continue to look at sharing increasing cash flow with our shareholders.","So stay tuned on that. So let me turn it over to Dean.","Dean A. Shigenaga","Okay. Thank you, Joel. Let me just start with our balance sheet, we made good progress in the first quarter and I\u2019d like to provide an update on important initiatives through the remainder of the year. Cash flows from operating activities after dividends are on track at $130 million to $150 million.","We are basically done with the sale of income producing assets; we completed $124 million in sales in the first quarter. We have three properties held for sale as of quarter with the net book value of approximately $7 million, including about $4 million that was sold in April.","Briefly on our unhedged variable rate debt, over the near term, we expect our unhedged variable rate debt to range up to approximately 30%. Our strategy includes having an amount outstanding of unhedged variable rate debt to allow us to opportunistically issue unsecured bonds and repay outstanding unhedged variable rate bank debt.","Moving on briefly to our guidance on our unsecured bond offering, clearly our first priority is our 10 year bonds as far as ten year goes to extend our maturity profile and transition variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. Our pricing for a ten year paper for Alexandria is approximately in the mid 3% range. And to just give you some other data points, seven year paper is a roughly 2.75% for the company. We expect to prudently manage our maturity profile ten years from now. So a midpoint target for our ten year unsecured bond offering this year is in the $400 million range.","We will look opportunistically to issue additional unsecured bonds to reduce our unhedged variable rate debt to less than 18%. As Joe highlighted, we remain focused on reducing our leverage to approximately 6.5 times targeted by the end of the year. The majority of the improvement in leverage will occur in the second half of the year and we expect our EBITDA growth from the first quarter to the fourth quarter to range from $10 million to $13 million.","Moving on to our construction forecast for 2013, you probably noticed it\u2019s up about $25 million at the midpoint. Our current range is $570 million to $620 million, $13 million of the increase related to the commencement of our build-to-suite for Onyx Pharmaceuticals at 269 East Grand. And we also add about $10 million increase attributed to the timing of construction and the completion of our joint venture transaction for the project for ARIAD Pharmaceuticals at 75\/125 Binney Street.","Briefly to update on two construction loans we have in process, the first is for 269 East Grand, the project for Onyx Pharmaceutical. We expect the closing to occur in the second quarter to about $36 million loan at about 70% loan to cost and pricing is probably about 140 over 1 month LIBOR. The other loan that\u2019s in process is for 75\/125 Binney, again its construction financing in the low $200 million range, the loan to cost in the 60% to 70% range and pricing is somewhere in the upper 2% range over one month LIBOR.","Moving onto same property performance, we really delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of upward trend in cash NOI growth, 2%, 4% 6% and now 8.8% for each quarter from the second, third and fourth quarter of 2012 through the first quarter of 2013 respectively. Probably notice that we provided two other calculations for same property performance in comparison to our historical same property performance as shown on Page 16 of our supplemental package.","From 2008 through 2012, including first quarter, our same property performance was generally consistent over this period with the other calculations. For the first quarter of 2013, our same property performance including our redevelopment properties would have been meaningfully higher as shown in the chart at approximately 11% on both the GAAP and cash basis in comparison to 0.4% on a GAAP basis and 8.8% on a cash basis. Same property performance including redevelopment properties will from time to time have significant growth in net operating income as a result of completion of the conversion of non-laboratory space generally with lower net operating income to laboratory space generally with higher net operating income through our redevelopment process.","We believe our traditional method of reporting same property performance is a more useful presentation since it excludes the potential significant increases in performance as a result of completion of significant redevelopment projects. Same property expenses for the quarter were up about 6% driven by an increase in recoverable property taxes and colder weather this year in 2013 versus 2012, and as a result we had higher snow removal cost and steam utility expenses.","Lastly on our guidance, our guidance for 2013 was updated to reflect the tightening of our range by $0.02 for both the upper and lower end of the range, EPS diluted was given at a range from $1.43 to $1.59, FFO per share diluted was given at a range from $446 to $462. And lastly, our assumptions detailed out in our forward guidance for 2013 are included on pages three through six of our earnings release and supplemental package. With that, I will turn it over to Joel.","Joel S. Marcus","Well operator, we are ready to open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take our first question from Emmanuel Korchman with Citigroup.","Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup","Hi guys good afternoon.","Joel S. Marcus","","Hi.","Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup","I was just wondering with so much capital activity included in your new guidance for this year? Could you give us a better idea of timing of perhaps the ATM and unsecured bond issuance and kind of why not the bond issuance now given try to break some of the market?","Joel S. Marcus","","Well I guess that\u2019s a question, you could ask of almost any offer in one does. I think we\u2019ve been heavily focused on a number of other things in the first quarter completing our asset sales certainly in the second quarter, we\u2019re in pretty heavily focused on the financing, the bank financing of the construction loan financing of the two projects that Dean referred to. We\u2019ll probably look to tap the ATM a little bit over the coming 2Q, 3Q into 4Q, and we\u2019ll look probably as we start to get into early summer at the bond market.","We\u2019re pretty comfortable with the \u2013 the state of the overall bond market. We don\u2019t think the Fed is moving in any different direction, but we\u2019ll clearly tepid it and as Dean outlined, our goal is to reach the targeted numbers that we said likely of $400 million bond offering and obviously turn that out. So I think I\u2019d stay tuned. We no longer necessarily commit any particular time but as we get closer to the summer months and finish up some of the other critical priority transaction especially non-income producing sales we\u2019ll clearly turn to the bond there.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets","","Joel, its Michael Bilerman. You just ever know what external forces could have an impact on the bond market or the equity markets for that matter and \u2013 moving out. So even if you have a desire to wait till all the summer. I guess would you at least do a rate lock so that you can lock in where you stand and rather than take any risk or just issue it. You can wakeup tomorrow morning and issue bonds, it\u2019s not like you need to do a lot of work to do that construction, financing or mortgage won\u2019t take a lot more time but doing at unsecured issuance seems to be pretty simple.","Joel S. Marcus","","Yeah well everything takes time and its allocation of resources. I think on the rate lock I mean my own view is I think the economy is actually going to get worse not better. So I think you actually may see rates come down even more than they are today. So I think I would watch the rate lock pretty carefully and I\u2019m not so sure that we are going to see rates move against us but clearly we\u2019re paying close attention to that for sure.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets","Thanks for that guys.","Joel S. Marcus","","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thank you. Can you talk a little bit more about your increased confidence on leasing at 499 Illinois and also at West Tower?","Dean A. Shigenaga","","I can\u2019t on 499 Illinois other than to say what I said, we\u2019re, I think relatively comfortable after a long period of waiting almost two years here that we will substantially sell the building and I would say just stay tuned for an announcement, I don\u2019t want to say more than that and that is to relatively sell the building. On the New York project, I think I gave color on that, I\u2019m not sure what else you want to know, but feel free to ask it specifically.","Jamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And you talked about European and Japanese former tenants, what\u2019s the average size of some of these leases and then where do you think rents are in both that versus your underwriting for that project in 499?","Dean A. Shigenaga","","Yeah, on 499 I don\u2019t want to make any comments at the moment on New York, as I said, we\u2019ve signed a 1 LOI with rental rates very much along the lines as we expected and they would not negatively impact our yields, impact there might be some bump coming up over time that fourth floor is 131,000 square feet, we\u2019ve got another half of floor under active LOI negotiations, another half floor got put back a few months due to a financing, so we\u2019re waiting on that, and we have a number of LOIs that are out waiting for sponsors.","I would say on Japanese interest and European interest there seems to be substantial from something like half of floor and as much as a floor, but again it\u2019s early on and I can\u2019t say too much, but we\u2019ve got a number of European firms and a number of Japanese firms one who is already a sizable tenant of ours and another market actively looking. So we feel pretty good about things. And I don\u2019t know, Peter you want to make any comment overall on yield?","Peter M. Moglia","I guess the only thing, I would say is that the rental rates are holding very well that what we\u2019ve underwritten and put into the disclosures. I would say that we\u2019re doing better is in absorption. We had a much more conservative absorption period in our numbers. So we\u2019re looking to improve on that and if everything goes as plan, we should.","Jamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That\u2019s helpful.","Peter M. Moglia","","Sorry, I can\u2019t say more on 499, but I\u2019d say stay tuned.","Jamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then can you just talk about any change in appetite for the asset class, the life science office asset class, we\u2019ve seen with CMBS improving, you\u2019ve just seen more capital flowing into either secondary markets or just different property types in core Class A office. Is anything changed in the last three months in terms of appetite?","Joel S. Marcus","","As far as for acquisition or financing, James?","Jamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Its sales of your \u2013 people are more interested in your asset.","Joel S. Marcus","","Sure.","Dean A. Shigenaga","Well, we\u2019re kind of done with the income producing asset sales. But we did have a cadre of folks that we\u2019re kind of in each and every deal that we were looking at that we\u2019re interested in the repositioning of the assets and maybe taking on some of the capital that was going to be needed to reposition more to potentially be a lab owner in Suburban.","And so I can\u2019t really tell you if anything is changed recently, because we haven\u2019t really marketed much of anything outside of the one property that we closed this last quarter in Pennsylvania and that was sold to a company that was actually purchasing the main tenant of that property.","So that was more of a user sale. So I\u2019m not sure, I can give you any more color.","Jamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you.","Dean A. Shigenaga","","Yeah, thanks Jamie.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Matt Rand with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Rand \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi. Thanks for having the detail this quarter on the land bank. It looks like two-third of your pre-construction and future development land is in four parcels in Cambridge and the San Francisco bay. Can you talk through those four parcels to make up that value and kind of what your timeline is for starting developments there?","Joel S. Marcus","Yes, (inaudible) for a second, yeah, so I guess 33 and 34 you may be referring to. So on 33, the two important parcels and they are pretty well highlighted as to geography square footage etcetera, 100 Binney and 50 Binney. We\u2019ve talked about each of those a little bit on past calls and then in conferences. Our timeline, I think would be to try to monetize those in the one to three year period. We think that demand in Cambridge would allow us probably to move forward with a 100 Binney, probably sooner and then potentially 500 Binney. We are also looking at doing two buildings at 50 Binney potentially we\u2019re looking at some other opportunities there. But I would say monetizable, our goal is within a one to three year range and hopefully even sooner.","On the right hand side, you see the Illumina campus. There are two additional buildings totaling almost 400,000 square feet. We are moving forward with certain San Diego permitting as requested by Illumina there. In fact their stock and their earnings have been pretty strong. So, as they decide if and when they need to expand we\u2019ll be ready, we\u2019ve just delivered a number of buildings to them. So, we think over the short- to medium-term, those are eminently monetizable by building for them but we\u2019ll wait to hear further from them.","On the next page, Campus Point which is virtually full at the moment, we\u2019ve got one existing tenants and potentially two kind of clambering for space, so we\u2019re working on getting the San Diego entitlement to build something up to close to 150,000 square feet.","We think this is eminently monetizable in the more near term and actually the construction path that we mentioned down below there is one type of 452 to 505 yeah 450 to 505 not 550 to 605. So we think that is a near-term opportunity with the one to two existing high quality tenants there.","And then on the Salt Lake Union land, we\u2019ve got a number of opportunities both from potentially institutions and potentially even tech tenants which are assuming to take over that market and we\u2019re doing some entitlement work and working hard to see if we can monetize which we expect on at least one or two of these parcels probably in the relatively near-term as well.","So we feel pretty good about that, if you flip over to page 36, once we put 499 to bed, our attention will turn to 1600 because we think there is some pent-up demand down in Mission Bay certainly institutionally, we think with coming on of half the three hospitals and the demand for a variety of users that then becomes center stage.","We\u2019ve had a number of employees, one in particular from a major hospital system working at that, so that could, we think that\u2019s maybe a little bit more out beyond the year but hopefully maybe sooner than we think. Again once we finish with 499 and then on Page 37, we\u2019ve highlighted the Phoenix campus and what else we can do, we can build another building there north of a 100,000 square feet, we feel that they will probably fast-growing companies, their stocks been on fire, their cancer products have really been well received in the markets, so we fully expect to build that project.","And then finally in 9800 Medical Centre, we really have two great buildings there, but I think given the market in Maryland at the moment, and until that market further strengthens, we likely wouldn\u2019t be building that. So I think that is more out beyond the near to medium-term. So hopefully that\u2019s helpful.","Matthew Rand \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. Yes. Thank you. Just one more parcel on South San Francisco to $73 million had I guess roughly echo, can you give us any color on that?","Joel S. Marcus","","Those are, we originally aggregated a serious of parcels right after the time when Genentech business, pre-Roche acquisition filed there overlaid to the South San Francisco planning direct and in which day then I can\u2019t remember the year, but it probably was right around \u201807, \u201808 they expected to double the size of their campus in South San Francisco, so what we try to do and working closely with them was to align a series of properties, it\u2019s pretty clear that that\u2019s not going to happen. And so I think we would probably look to either find users for those where we could build or potentially exit those assets?","Matthew Rand \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay thank you. And then one last quick one, there\u2019s been some talk in the industry about the opportunities that do you kind of on-campus university deals, how do you look at that model generally and that is an opportunities that for you guys?","Joel S. Marcus","","Yeah, we had looked at it, we were involved with some, I think it\u2019s practically very hard because of 501(c) rules, so I don\u2019t think the opportunity is as great as one would imagine. I think also one have to look today again with the challenges of federal funding and lesser dealing with credit strength of universities like MIT or others, Harvard. Going to outline universities could prove to be very challenging because their financial situation certainly under government budget pressure is going to be tough. So that\u2019s not something we are particularly pursuing.","Matthew Rand \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Sheila McGrath with Evercore Partners.","Sheila McGrath \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","Yes, good afternoon. Joel, I was wondering if you could talk about acquisition opportunities in your markets. Is there anything noteworthy that you\u2019re looking at or that you attempted to bid on and weren\u2019t the winning bidder?","Joel S. Marcus","Yeah. So far this year, we really haven\u2019t been active in bidding. We do have a pipeline in each and every one of our core cluster markets. We\u2019ve been really stringent not going outside of those. So we are focused on the best markets in downtown Seattle, clearly the West Bay of San Francisco to refines. We did buy one great set of assets up there last year in the spring which we will redevelop here hopefully over the coming year, down into refines.","Clearly Massachusetts in the more CBD area, we are looking at opportunities and probably may be in and around New York in the city potentially if we have a large firm that comes from overseas that we couldn\u2019t accommodate at the Alexandria center. We might look for another Manhattan site, but we vigorous or really carefully stayed out of the suburbs because we are certainly trying to avoid as many of these suburban assets as possible because we think the best growth, the highest quality cash flow is going to be in the CBD cluster market. Peter, you could comment broadly too.","Peter M. Moglia","","I just \u2013 Sheila that I think, we\u2019ve been out of the acquisition game for a little bit, but in looking around at all the different regions as Joel said, there are probably as many opportunities today as there were the last time we were in the market. So that\u2019s encouraging. And there is some really interesting high quality assets that could be immediately accretive if we were able to get them at the right price. So we\u2019re keeping our eye out and but focused on all the other goals we have right now.","Sheila McGrath \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","Okay. And then Joel, I noticed in your annual report you mentioned that NYU Neuroscience is a tower too and I was just wondering if you could give us a little more detail on that and where...","Joel S. Marcus","","Yeah they are in Tower One.","","Sheila McGrath \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","Okay, I thought it\u2019s\u2026","Joel S. Marcus","Yeah that\u2019s in Tower one and they are funded by the Druck and Miller Family. So actually its a specific funding from an outside funding source and they hired a world-class actually he is pictured in the annual report, Richard Jen, his brother is a Nobel price winner who is having, really searching for answers and ultimately halfway some products to unlock some critical diseases including dementia which is probably the biggest market opportunities that exist. So there are in couple of floors in the East Tower.","Sheila McGrath \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","","Got it. And then Dean on Tower 2 it is stated to come online in fourth quarter. Is that really lay the fourth quarter or?","Dean A. Shigenaga","","Yeah. As you can imagine, we had a pretty short timeline in order to deliver Roach, the space to Roach. So we are really looking for a December, early to mid December delivery of the first phase in the second tower.","Joel S. Marcus","","Yeah, we get or we\u2019re on track to do a TCO by December 15 Sheila, and actually tomorrow while be in New York for the topping out ceremony at the West Tower. It\u2019s moving as fast as I think any vertical construction is literally ever moved to New York and we expect to have Roche, starting to move in there hopefully in December.","Sheila McGrath \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","That\u2019s great. One last question on leasing spreads in the quarter on a GAAP and a cash basis were \u2013 ahead of your guidance and pretty strong whether one or two stands out leases or markets that we should know about it that move the number as fair?","Dean A. Shigenaga","Yeah, I think San Francisco was importantly \u2013 important in that number and I think San Diego was as well. So it\u2019s varies, but those were \u2013 I\u2019d say it is standup markets this quarter.","Sheila McGrath \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","Okay, all right thank you.","Dean A. Shigenaga","Yeah, thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Jeff Theiler with Green Street Advisors.","Jeff Theiler \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Just a question about the long-term potential of the Mission Bay area, you\u2019ve obviously got some good near term traction with 499 Illinois or at least starting to get some good traction there. What\u2019s the timeframe for that market fully developed and does that \u2013 does the hospital once that and that gives the market critical maths or you assuming some additional tenants to move in there to really build a long-term sustainable cluster? And how do you expect to be working with sales force going forward to I guess maintain your presence in that market?","Joel S. Marcus","Well, I would say that is a viable ongoing on vital cluster today. I mean think if \u2013 have you been down there Jeff?","Jeff Theiler \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Yes I have.","Joel S. Marcus","Yeah, I mean if you go down there, you\u2019ll see the UCSF\u2019s research campus is relatively fully developed, housing is amazing, we\u2019re seeing increased retail, obviously we\u2019ve got a number of commercial centres there, the hospital when it comes on in late 2014, early 2015 three of them will really kind of create an explosion of people down there, The Third Street Light Rail is in.","So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything left to do, except continue to build it out. I think this clusters has moved, if I think about Cambridge in the early days and University Park for the city really pioneered that took about a 10 year effort. This has really taken a lot less in a sense. Susan Desmond-Hellmann who is new chancellor of UCSF, she used to run Genentech\u2019s product division very heralded person. She is building her headquarters building if you will down there.","So it\u2019s great. I think the only thing that is really missing is, probably and even more robust tech presence, but I think with Cisco down there, I think you\u2019ll see some other great entities and again you\u2019ll hear about some of those coming down there. I think it\u2019s a thriving fully integrated cluster and we\u2019re very appreciative to have the really the ground floor opportunity there. I think we\u2019ll continue to monitor sales force, I mean if they continue to grow who knows, they may end up building some stuff down there, and if not, may be we\u2019ll have a chance to do some things further down there as well. But luckily it\u2019s off our balance sheet for the moment.","Jeff Theiler \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay that\u2019s great color. Thank you.","Joel S. Marcus","Yeah.","Operator","We will take our next question from George Auerbach with the ISI Group.","George Auerbach \u2013 ISI Group","Great thanks guys. Joel thanks for the color on the land sales and the asset sales this year. I guess if you could focus on the $125 million of non-income producing sales that have yet to be identified?","Joel S. Marcus","Yeah.","George Auerbach \u2013 ISI Group","I guess, can you breakdown for us as you\u2019re sort of think through that bucket. How much is land and how much is I guess under leased or at the buildings?","Joel S. Marcus","There might be a little bit of the latter, but mostly I mean if you could imagine if we joint venture, one of the Binney projects 50 or 100 that would more than enough to take care of that amount and we have active discussions on that right now. We have some active tenant discussions going on. So if we do what we did or what we\u2019re planning on doing and Peter is really heading up this project with Tom Andrews if we, JV the 100 or 50 Binney were done.","George Auerbach \u2013 ISI Group","Okay, so we shouldn\u2019t be surprised if part of that in source of capital is JVs of developments?","Joel S. Marcus","","That\u2019s correct.","George Auerbach \u2013 ISI Group","Okay. And I guess maybe to tie back to Jamie\u2019s question, I guess any thoughts about increasing the income producing asset sales target for the year. Just given where\u2026?","Joel S. Marcus","I don\u2019t think we have to, because the thing what we\u2019ve try to do is we\u2019ve tried to exit some of the submarkets as Peter had talked about last time, First Hill in Seattle, we wanted to exit or still we\u2019ve got two other assets out there but we will probably exit next year that are under option. So that will move us out of that market, totally, we\u2019ve wanted to lighten up but not access the Maryland (inaudible) market.","So we\u2019ve kind of done what we\u2019ve wanted to do. I don\u2019t see us doing anything more there. We\u2019re comfortable with our position. We\u2019re getting more fully lease there and rental rates are finally taking hold and we\u2019re not having design roll down leases, so that\u2019s a good sign.","We like our asset base in North Carolina by and large in the triangle. We like to exit New Jersey and you\u2019ll probably see us do that. But those are kind of minor assets. We\u2019re trying to exit Pennsylvania. You\u2019ll see more in this quarter and maybe another, I think we maybe have one asset left. And we might lighten up a little bit in San Diego, as you see in the discontinued ops in Sorrento Mesa on a couple of assets where we think we\u2019d like to put that money more in University Town Center in 20 times where we have a lot of activity and our leasing has been pretty much superlative. So I think we don\u2019t have anything more we have to go, we\u2019re pretty much done by and large.","George Auerbach \u2013 ISI Group","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And I guess just one last question. Some of that has were yet to be identified, it sounds like some of that might just be potential JV\u2019s, but other assets that you might identify for sale, I guess at what point of year do you have to identify those assets by just given the timing to just sell assets?","Joel S. Marcus","","Yeah, my guess is over the next several months George, because it does take time to execute on the transaction, so if we\u2019re not there in the next three months to five months, I think we would have a challenging time to complete it by the end of the year.","George Auerbach \u2013 ISI Group","Great, thank you.","Joel S. Marcus","","Yeah. Thanks very much.","Operator","We will take a follow-up from Emmanuel Korchman of Citigroup.","Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup","","Hey guys. There is a couple of follow-ups from me. If we looking at your leasing schedule, it looks like the renewal leases were done sort of shorter terms than typical and also at higher TIs, can you help us kind of compare those two numbers and previously on there?","Joel S. Marcus","","Yeah, I would say don\u2019t read anything into any particular quarter, shorter term leases, sometimes we\u2019ve hadn\u2019t bounce around two, three, four years whereas development, redevelopment tend to be five, 10, 15 plus, so I don\u2019t think there is anything you could read as a big trend. And then I think on TIs and so forth. Again, I think I wouldn\u2019t read anything special. They\u2019re kind of one of the mill, I don\u2019t think anything and I ask in Dean, I can\u2019t remember anything this quarter that was particularly unusual. So it\u2019s a pretty average quarter.","Dean A. Shigenaga","And I think on Page 17, we\u2019ve added trailing 12 months disclosures on leasing activity. To give you a sense that a quarter can be anomaly because it\u2019s relatively small amount of activity, but on a trailing 12, you can see the statistics are pretty similar over the last several years.","Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup","Sure, thanks. And then Joe, in your opening remarks, you mentioned that some of the non-income producing sales could be international, which actually means India\u2026?","Joel S. Marcus","Yeah, we have a non-income producing land parcel or an unoccupied building. We might choose to monetize that, because we\u2019ve got some great location. So those would be I think relatively easily achievable. But I think the bulk of what we\u2019re talking about is domestic. So I wouldn\u2019t, don\u2019t hold your breadth on that.","Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup","Great, thanks for the clarification.","Joel S. Marcus","Yeah, sure.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We will take our next question from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Carroll \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Yeah. Thanks. And Joe, I guess from of that last question, I know you indicated previously that you might be want to find a partner for China and India asset, is that simplifying?","Joel S. Marcus","Yeah, we think that it\u2019s important, because capital allocation as you clearly see from our schedules is heavily weighted to large scale development and to the extent that we see opportunistic acquisitions that makes sense. We want to look at those from time-to-time in our core cluster markets. And so we clearly would like to have a partner who been help us finance, those operations and we think there is a strong group of international folks who would like to have high-quality assets with good quality tenants, much like you\u2019re in the U.S. So that\u2019s kind of our game plan.","Michael Carroll \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Have you started those discussions yet?","Joel S. Marcus","Yes.","Michael Carroll \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Can you give us any timing as if whether \u201813, \u201814 event?","Joel S. Marcus","Not yet.","Michael Carroll \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay great. And then my last question on 499 Illinois maybe you can talk about it like could you kind of tell us where you\u2019ve seen more of the activities from for the last tenant or from the traditional office tenants?","Joel S. Marcus","Yeah, we\u2019re not currently engaged with what we have requirements from office tenants, but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re moving with.","Michael Carroll \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, great thanks guys.","Joel S. Marcus","Yep.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan.","Anthony Paolone \u2013 JPMorgan","Thanks. So where our cap rates for \u2013 say roughly a life science asset and your key cluster markets?","Peter M. Moglia","Hey Tony its Peter. It\u2019s going to vary, but I would say that in Cambridge right now you\u2019re probably sub six if you got good credit behind the tenant. New York would probably be around five to maybe less than that considering what I\u2019ve been looking at through some of the market reports from brokers. Then you go down to San Diego it\u2019s a very strong market too, but cap rates don\u2019t tend to go that low.","So you probably be something with the six and all, but low there as long as you had high-quality building, something like the Kansas point though or the Illumina, Kansas. I wouldn\u2019t want to sell, because it\u2019s so valuable, but if I did, I would definitely look for something sub six. Maryland and RTP in the suburban markets, it goes up quite a bit. You\u2019re probably talking about a couple of 100 basis points above the clusters.","Nothing that we\u2019ve sold that you\u2019ve seen recently can really be a good comp, because of things we saw that really been coming off leases, so income wasn\u2019t behind those values. But I would imagine that if we sold something like a West Watkins or Clopper that was sold last quarter and those \u2013 the income was perpetual, we would have been able to sell those something around mid 7s to 8.","Anthony Paolone \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay, thank you. And just on the idea of joint venturing 75\/125 Binney and just perhaps some other stuff, just curious how you landed on that asset versus say some others that might be either development or redevelopment or even an existing asset that might be a bit more stabilized at this point?","Joel S. Marcus","","Well, it\u2019s a good opportunity for balance sheet purposes to do that. There is a huge amount of interest in Cambridge Class A assets with strong tenant. So, and the numbers are sizable and we\u2019ve got a sizable construction pipeline. So it made sense to look at that. I mean if we did an Onyx, which is much smaller, lot of brain damage for not a lot of [pub]. So that\u2019s the one that makes eminent sense and there is some risk of future lease up that we can take advantage of I think as well.","Anthony Paolone \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay, thank you.","Joel S.

Please note that today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I would now turn the call over to Paula Schwartz. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Paula Schwartz","Thank you and good afternoon everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","I now would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus. Please go ahead Joel.","Joel Marcus","Thank you, Paula and welcome everybody to our third quarter call. And with me today is Dean Shigenaga, Tom Andrews, Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia, Dan Ryan and Monica. Thank you, and congratulations to the entire Alexandria family for a truly strong operating and financial performance in the third quarter.","A couple of key the things that we like to stress, one would be our continuing strong core, Dean, will speak to that. Secondly, our continuing strong leasing, bolstered by strong demand and a constrain supply in our urban cluster markets, and solid rent growth and we\u2019re pleased to say that in the third quarter our rent growth was heavily driven by our Greater Boston region; maintaining strong occupancy; strong tenant credit, also a strong pipeline with deliveries with increase in yields as you saw; and number five, superb execution of our capital plan.","Let me give a couple of macro thoughts as I like to do each quarter. Alexandria\u2019s business is on two of the most important global issues facing humanity, disease and hunger. Life science fundamentals remain strong and as I stated in the last quarter, 10,000 diseases were identified to date and only about 500 of those have been medically addressed.","We\u2019re seeing more patients to date, especially with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, about 36 million more here and we\u2019re likely to see quite a lot large growth worldwide over the coming couple of decades and the emerging markets growth have been double digits over the couple of years.","We see more drugs, 19 approvals to date in 2016, 68% are Alexandria tenants, more revenue opportunities, multiple disease areas with large market potentials including immune-oncology, the hepatitis world, liver disease and eye diseases and clearly more innovation including cures and therapies that really address a better quality of life.","Demand is driven really by three key factors, in our world we focus on the RND, which is research, 154 billion by biomedical RND worldwide which is very substantial, 34 billion NIH funding basic research and surprisingly $30 billion of medical philanthropy funding basic research as well.","There\u2019s a lot of rhetoric these days regarding drug pricing and drug spending and it\u2019s pretty clear the rhetoric is much verse than the realty. Retail drug spending is not meaningfully exceeded 10% of total healthcare cost of the last 50 years. Real drug prices increases other than some abusive cases are much smaller than perception if you look at the rebates. Brand drugs that go off patent, they can get genericized typically see their sales drop 95%.","Nine out of ten prescriptions filled in the United States are generic and the hysteria over un-stainability of drug spending is not new, there was uproar in HIV treatment cost back in 1989. President Obama has been quoted in his State Union Address last year, healthcare inflation has had its lowest rates in 50 years and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, better known CMS state in the Wall Street Journal recently that U.S. expenditures for most RX drugs grew by an average of 2.7% from 2007 to 2013.","The three poster children for a bad behavior, valium, touring and mylan [ph] really none of those are driven biopharma companies. So what what\u2019s the reality and how does that play into the election. Well, two big reforms at the federal levels as we\u2019re talking about, one would be both supported by Trump and Clinton allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices directly. Basically it won\u2019t work because Medicare is legally prohibited from negotiating drug pricing and it would be wildly unpopular not to give the beneficiaries access to certain drugs due to price.","On constraining price increases there is in the Clinton plan a request to try to justify price hikes for long available drugs, why that\u2019s possible but unlikely, it really applies to older drugs, but still would be a difficult pathway. Reforms at the state level, some of you have seen both in California and Ohio, there\u2019s an attempt for state drugs or drugs in states to be subject to caps and unfortunately it doesn\u2019t distinguish between and older impactful or marginally impactful drugs and it\u2019s not likely to work because they\u2019re tied at the prices that the Veterans Administration charges and those are public and VA has more leverage than Medicare or other state payers and even if states mandate more transparency it would be hard for them to regulate and implement the initiatives.","And then secondly under state law, there\u2019s a move to get transparency which is kind of the naming and shaming and that certainly could happen and is happening. I think if you look beyond the rhetoric, I think there\u2019s some great near-term news for this sector, the 21st Century Cures Act. On September 28, bipartisan leadership from both the house and senate played support to move the 21st Century Cures Act to a bill during the lame duck session of congress and it would be the first long-term and sweeping biomedical research funding before the end of this year. And Mitch McConnell has been quoted as saying, it\u2019s the most significant piece of legislation that we passed in the whole congress in the last year.","It provides for substantial increase in funding to the National Institute of Health and to the FDA and also a number of key initiatives, including Vice President Cancer Moonshot. The key to success in biopharma will be true cures and unique treatments which greatly increase the quality of life and even more recent to date to be in key urban innovation cluster markets to access the talent pool and the innovative technology and products.","So moving beyond that to the number of concerns that are raised about the health of life science tenants, we\u2019re very pleased to say, you can see from the press release and the supplemental, 54% of our annual base rent are from investment grade tenants, 78% of our annual base rent from our top 20 tenants, which is a very high about almost half of our annual base rent and also coupled with an almost nine year lease duration which gives the company great long-term high quality secured cash flows and 77% of our annual base rent these days is from Class A properties and our AAA urban cluster locations.","There\u2019ve been strong recent inflows in the life science insured capital firms, a number of firms, several - maybe up to about five or six are in the process of rising between $0.5 billion and $1 billion in funds. There\u2019s been a decent IPO window. It\u2019s been more selective this year and I think a good climate for M&A and if you notice that 65% of new drugs from 2011 to 2016 were really developed by the biotech industry, clear that Big Pharma will continue to be on a shopping spree.","Before I turn it over to Dean, just a comment on external growth, we have three Cambridge deliveries substantially pre-leased in the third quarter including 50 Binney, 60 Binney and 11 Hurley were strong yields and we were able to save substantially on project costs which increase the yields. We have a number of fourth quarter deliveries including University Town Center in San Diego to a great company focused on the year and our 290 Campus Point lease redevelopment to Eli Lilly. Longwood, we\u2019ve got two floors left to lease or 27.5% interest and our progress for the 2017 and 2018 pipeline 100 Binney, we\u2019re negotiating a number of floors and we hope to conclude those negotiations in the not too distant future and as well on additional floors on Dexter.","So with that let me turn it over to Dean for more color.","Dean Shigenaga","Thanks, Joel. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. Alexandria is in a very solid operating and growth position with our unique business strategy and strength across three important areas. First, we have solid market fundamentals in our key urban centers of innovation including Greater Boston, San Francisco, New York City, San Diego and Seattle.","Second, we have solid internal growth including same property net operating income growth and rental rate growth on lease renewals and releasing the space. Third, we have solid external growth as we build new Class A that meet the demand from some of the most innovative entities producing new and transformative therapies and solutions to improve quality of life.","We\u2019re unique in the REIT sector today, with positive attributes in these key areas that allows our best in class team to deliver growth in earnings, cash flows, common stock dividends. Market fundamentals in our dynamic urban centers of innovation today generally consist of very limited suppliers available Class A space and limited capacity for developers to build new properties adjacent to key drivers of innovation.","Solid internal growth, also known as our same property net operating income growth is on track to hit the upper half of our guidance range for 2016. 90% of our third quarter \u201816, net operating income is generated from a consistent pool of quality properties operating for the entirety of comparative periods, otherwise known as our pool of same properties.","We pioneered our favorable lease structure that consists of, one, annual contractual rent escalations that average about 3% today and drive solid contractual growth in net cash, net operating income. Two, triple net leases that has allowed Alexandria to recover operating and expenses from our tenants and three, a unique ability to recover from our tenants major CapEx like roof replacements and major heating and cooling system upgrades.","Solid market fundamentals consisting of limited supply of available Class A space and solid demand has driven continued improvement in our outlook for rental rate growth on leasing activity projected up 21% to 24% on a GAAP basis and up 8% to 11% on a cash basis and same property net operating income growth projected up 3% to 5% on a GAAP basis and up 4.5% to 6.5% on a cash basis.","We continue to execute on our strategy to deliver new high quality Class A properties to ground up development and redevelopment. As landlord of choice, our team is working diligently to build inspiring real estate solutions to drive collaboration and innovation for the some of the top biopharma entities focused on making life better for people throughout the world.","We\u2019ve made excellent progress on completion of our current pipeline consisting of new Class A buildings aggregating 3.5 million square feet, 81% highly leased and we are on track to generate approximately $200 million of incremental annual net operating income, representing a significant 35% increase in net operating income over 2015.","Returns on our investment are solid and average approximately 7% on this 3.5 million square foot pipeline. We are very pleased to report strong improvement in cash returns on our investments by 40 basis points to 7.7% at 50 and 60 Binney Street in Cambridge due to 5% savings in total project cost. We also improved our cash returns by 90 basis points to 8.8% at 11 Hurley, also located in Cambridge and due to cost savings of approximately $4 million.","We are aligning solid market fundamentals, solid internal growth and solid external growth with our balance sheet management goals. Our non-income producing real estate consist of current projects under construction and a great pipeline of well-located land for future ground up development of Class A properties was approximately 12% of gross real estate as of September 30, 2016 and expected to be in the 10% range by December 31, 2016.","Our development sites have and will continue to serve the future innovation requirements of high quality biopharma entities focused on discovery of important and transformative new therapies. Our leverage goal; net debt to adjusted EBITDA remains firm and on track for the fourth quarter of \u201816 and also on track to be sub six times by the fourth quarter of \u201817. Additionally our debt plus preferred stock to adjusted EBITDA is also on track for significant improvement as we continue to repurchase our 7% Series D convertible preferred stock.","In October 2016, we match funded open market repurchases of 1.5 million shares of 7% Series D convertible preferred stock with 53 million of proceeds from the issuances of common stock under our at the market common stock offering program. As of October 31, we had 125 million par value Series D preferred stock outstanding and hope to repurchase additional shares in the fourth quarter.","In the 10 months to date, we\u2019re pleased to report that we have raised approximately $324 million from real estate dispositions that have closed or that are under contract today. This includes good progress on our disposition of real estate investments located in India including the sale of a portfolio of operating properties in October of 2016. We expect to complete the exit of the remaining investments in India consisting of two land parcels over the next couple of quarters.","In connection with the progress on dispositions of these investments in India in the third quarter, we recognized additional real estate impairments. Briefly a quick update on our acquisition of One Kendall Square, we expect to obtain approval from the lender for the assumption of the $203 million secured loan and expect to close the acquisition and the forward sale equity offering agreements in the next few weeks. Even though we do not currently own One Kendall Square, our team has already advanced the efforts to significantly increase revenue and cash flows with early renewals and expansion negotiations.","We\u2019ve also quickly advanced the design insight work for a fully entitled land part [ph] on this campus in order to capture demand for a new Class A 173,000 square foot property. I should point out that the weighted average shares outstanding for the third quarter included 751,000 additional shares to the obligation of the treasury method of accounting for the outstanding forward equity sale agreements.","Lastly on our guidance update, we provided updated guidance for 2016 as detailed on page 7 of our supplemental package, our updated guidance for 2016 net loss per diluted share attributable to Alexandria common stock holders at a range of loss of a $1.13 to $1.19. This net loss reflects real estate impairments, a loss on early extinguishment of debt and preferred stock redemption charge.","We narrowed our range of guidance for funds from operations as adjusted on a diluted per share basis for 2016 to a range of $0.03 from $5.50 to $5.52 with no change in the midpoint of the range of $5.51. As mentioned earlier we increased our 2016 outlook for same property NOI growth and rental rate growth from leasing activity as a result of continued solid fundamentals in our key sub markets.","Key credit metrics remains solid in our forecasted as follows for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA very solid in the range of 5.9 times to 6.3 times, our fixed rate coverage ratio also very solid at 3.5 times to 4 times. Our value creation pipeline consisting of new Class A properties currently under construction through our development and redevelopment programs and LAN providing a future pipeline of new Class A properties aggregating 10% to 12% of gross real estate and we expect to be closer to the 10% range by year end.","Few key remaining items for sources and uses for November and December of 2016 include the following, $142 million of real estate dispositions as highlighted on page 4 of our supplemental package, $140 million of acquisitions also as highlighted on page 5 of our supplemental package and this amount is related to purchase of 88 Bluxome located in south of market in San Francisco. We anticipate the selling differing closing of this acquisition into 2017 and $168 million of capital from our aftermarket common stock offering program or from additional asset sale.","In closing we look forward to meeting many of you at our Annual Investor Day on November 30, when we will cover our business strategy, our outlook and provide detailed guidance assumptions for 2017.","With that, let me turn it back over to Joel Marcus.","Joel Marcus","Operator, we'll open it up for Q&A please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Sheila McGrath with Evercore.","Sheila McGrath","Yes, good afternoon. Joel I was wondering if you could talk about the San Diego acquisition, how that opportunity came about if there\u2019s lot of competition on the acquisition?","Joel Marcus","Yeah, let me turn it over to Dan and he might give you a little bit of highlight.","Dan Ryan","Yeah, good afternoon Sheila. Yes, this was a three buildings that Pfizer had vacated approximately 4.5 years ago, it had been acquired by a private equity group that had substantially repositioned the asset with new leasing kind of I'd say, sort of got to sort of 75% completion level and as these things go the time ran out and they went to market to sell it, as you can imagine, Campus is a three [indiscernible] Torrey Pines highly desirable asset. All the expected players were heavily participating in the process. I think ultimately we prevailed probably, most notably because of our ability to close, I think there is great confidence, certainly if you look at the universe of other life science REITs and other private equity, Alexandria certainly has a reputation for being able to close and there is some disruption with these other REITS give us the opportunity if there been.","Peter Moglia","Sheila, this is Peter Moglia. I just wanted to add a couple of things, currently the availability in Torrey Pines is only 3.5%. And rents have grown since 2011 by 32%, so with the low availability and the opportunity to get inventory with the trend that we saw it in rent it look like a really good opportunity and we are really excited about it.","Dan Ryan","Yeah, I\u2019m coupled with the fact that there is leasing yet to do, there is mark-to-market on rents, they roll and conversion opportunities from offers for Lab, all those things were factored into our decision to go after this asset.","Sheila McGrath","Okay, great, one last question on the South San Francisco market. Was just wondering if we could get a update, we see HCP is starting another project there, just want to get your view on demand there at this point.","Steve Richardson","Sheila, hi, it is Steve Richardson. Yeah, I think as we reported for the past couple of quarters, we do see demand, very strong in south San Francisco, vacancy rates have dropped below 5%. The increases in rental rates have been very substantial, second generation space is probably increased 25% over the past 12 to 18 months. So we consider that a very health y market. We recently completed the big campus with [indiscernible] the Google subsidy area, so we are very bullish on South San Francisco. ","Sheila McGrath","Okay. Great thank you.","Operator","We will go to Manny Korchman with Citi.","Manny Korchman","Hey good afternoon, John appreciate the comments on drug pricing but it seems like headlines are becoming more prevalent just in general, is there any impact in just a way that both maybe all type of drug companies and even newer companies are thinking about their growth plans or how they approach the space given all the scrutiny and given all the negative price.","Joel Marcus","Yeah, so we haven\u2019t really seen that on the ground. In actual practice, at this point I think yeah, as I said in my prepared remarks I think increasingly if older drugs are going to command less pricing power, there is going to be a much stronger need to bring new molecular entries where they be chemical and these are biological and these to the market, that really have cured facts of really positively impact , therapy or treatment and it seems to me that's going to even dry people more strongly in to the urban cores to access the talent and the innovation. So I think you are going to see continually more of that and people - if companies growth rates, if you look at Illumina, Illumina\u2019s growth rate is moving probably from a 30% growth rate to a 10% growth rate. I think you will see companies reach out and look at greater opportunities to bring, to widen their product portfolio and their technology platform and where can you do that, you can't do that and isolated campus and suburban locations, you really got to do it in the heart of innovation. So we are still pretty good about that but haven\u2019t seen any actual changes on the ground and in the markets. I mean you just look at our staff and the demand we haven\u2019t seen it roll back at all.","Manny Korchman","May be that\u2019s a good segue. If we look at that demand and the limited amount of supply, are you at all changing the way that negotiations are growing and trying to get tenants to put in maybe only the people that are best facilitative of the cluster market and telling tenants don\u2019t take as much space as you want, take smaller space, don\u2019t put in the people there. The need to be in the cluster market or is that no something we are interested in doing.","Joel Marcus","Well I think it is very company specific and I think it is very hard to generalize and I don\u2019t think we would be telling management teams or board of directors do this or don\u2019t do that. They can determine that factor based on their own analysis of their own G&A, their own requirements, their needs access innovated platforms or technologies but I think we just haven\u2019t seen on the ground yet. Some people want large groups of employees on the ground who might have opus uses or development side and other people are putting kind of key research facilities on these cluster but I think as a percentage of overall spend remember that rent is not a significant part of the spend in our world and our sectors compose as compared to say financial services, law firms, accounting firms and so forth. And remember two, if whoever wins the president and CEO, over the house and the Senate go, there is one thing that they could do that could absolutely generate growth in the economy and that would be to do a onetime tax on repatriation of overseas cash which I think if you look at corporate America, that something between two and three trillion dollars so if you could imagine, 15% or 20% one-time tax on that and use that tax for infrastructure that would really move this country in a pretty dramatic way and it can't be too controversial but we have seen positive impact on the ground and clusters not anything negative and I think we are giving advice to these teams.","Manny Korchman","And Dean a quick one for you, it look like you had a non-real estate impairment this quarter, what was that related to?","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah Manny, in the quarter we recorded an impairment of $3.1 million. It really was to recognize reduction in the net book value of an investment of a privately held bio tech company. The charge was classified in other income in the income statement and in this case Manny it is clearly a valuation matter, we expect this company to continue to execute on their solid business model. This bio tech companies widely recognized as a leader in the chemical industry and providing solutions to produce chemicals from alternative feed stock. Not a traditional bio pharma tenant. So good company and still but we had to reduce the value of our investments and so that it was recognized in the third quarter.","Manny Korchman","Thanks guys.","Dean Shigenaga","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, our next question comes from Tom Catherwood with BTIG.","Tom Catherwood","Yes, thank you good afternoon guys. Question for Tom and Steve, can you guys talk a little bit about demand pipeline that you are tracking in Cambridge and San Francisco, are there any changes that you have seen versus last quarter?","Tom Andrews","This is Tom Andrews, in Cambridge, we have, we are tracking right now about 3 million square feet of tenants in the market on the lab side and another million and half square feet on the office sides, these are tenants who are looking for space in Cambridge or in the market looking for space in Cambridge, some of them are in the market already but others didn\u2019t have explorations but other are growth requirements and that some, that\u2019s been pretty steady and stable. We have got new actors coming in who weren\u2019t there a few quarters ago both outside the market companies who are looking to enter into the market and we have got new company formation going on, Joel mentioned the fund raising that is going on in venture. We announced this week was a $600 million new fund for third rocks ventures which has been one of the most prolific companies forming new almost prolific firms forming new companies and very Cambridge and San Francisco focused so we benefited from new company formation there and again still a relatively reasonable IPO markets which has enabled companies to raise capital, continue their clinical progress, commercialize new therapy. So we feel very good about the level of demand that we continue using.","Steve Richardson","Tom, hi, it is Steve Richardson. Similarly there are probably three different dimensions to the demand here. One is continued very healthy and robust demand, we have been experiencing about 2 million square feet of demand and not for just the past quarter but two or three years now we don\u2019t see any drop off about half of that is credit tenants out in the market looking for additional facilities. The second piece is that we are also seeing continued sense of urgency so the early renewable discussion continue, we have had good success with that past 12 months and we see that happening in the foreseeable future and finally we have very high profile entities coming into the clusters, most recently the chance [indiscernible] initiative which is pooling together the resources that UCSF, Stanford and UC, Berkley, so actually very continued exciting developments in our clusters in San Francisco.","Tom Catherwood","That\u2019s great and one follow up on that, just given the fact that there is such limited availability and new supply in both of those markets. Have you seen any trends towards tenants looking beyond the kind of the core East Cambridge area over the core mission based lost my area, in order to find the space that they need or they really just staying in those core market?","Tom Andrews","This is Tom, yes. We have certainly seen some of the companies who are in the ecosystem saying all right if we are really are going to take down space and there is none here and these Cambridge right now and we need the space right now, we are going to have to look in nearby sub markets and there has been a very limited number of companies who at this point committed to that. I expect that we will see some more because there are just not at the moment and out space in these Cambridge to accommodate all the who want to be there, but as we mentioned earlier but as we mentioned earlier we have got around 170,000 square foot development in the pipeline for One Kendall Square that we hope to start construction on next year and we actually have some real perspective activity on that space right now, we get some RMPS with corresponding to. So I think we will significant level of pre-leasing there, so that\u2019s a piece of supply that is not yet in the market but is expected to be created.","Peter Moglia","Hey this is Peter, I just wanted to underscore demand in this Cambridge JLL just came out with the lab space report that said that the ratio of demand to supply right now is 9 to 1. So we have never seen anything quite like that in our history and that explains the very high increases that we are seeing in rents.","Steve Richardson","Tom, it is Steve again, I would say 10 stores to the latter, these companies really do want to be in these clusters. So we are seeing continued demand which is leading us to be able to push rent, we registered a 9.6% increase in the mark to market for the rental rates that we have in San Francisco.","Tom Catherwood","Great, I appreciate. One more for me, just in a kind of market where we were seeing construction costs increasing substantially in some areas how was the development cost came down this quarter in the two Cambridge deliveries and is there any read through therefore your remaining active pipeline.","Dean Shigenaga","No, not really I think Tom, Dean Shigenaga here. I think you just got keep in mind on a very large project for 50 and 60 an example, you have to appropriately budget your cost of completion and ended up with conservative underwriting that realize the 5% cost savings and those opportunities do exist in the portfolio and in this case on a project of that size it has a meaningful impact.","Tom Catherwood","Got it, thank you.","Dean Shigenaga","Thank you, Tom.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions], we will go to Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Carroll","Yeah, thanks. Can you guys discuss how the company is picking about breaking ground on new development and redevelopment project? What you need to see in those projects and what you want to deliver some of your in process, I guess deal before you start one is that coming to play?","Joel Marcus","I think we have said Mike on past calls and in our commentary if you go to page 41 that the future project page and we are very pleased it is really high quality locations that I think will attract a lot of interest but I think given the size of our pipeline and we delivering this year, next year in particular and then into early 2018 at the moment, we don\u2019t need to really to match about the future we've got, I think great sides and shovel ready access to respond to really compelling opportunities and will do that as appropriate but at the moment we are not prepared to announce anything.","Michael Carroll","Okay and then can you discuss your acquisition strategy going forward? What types of deals are you looking for that are more value add opportunities that you are currently pursuing?","Joel Marcus","Well as w said in the beginning of the year, we didn\u2019t know that One Kendall Square would come to market; we certainly didn\u2019t know that Torrey Ridge campus would come to market. So we underwrite, Peter and his team underwrite everything that is out there, but we typically aren\u2019t aggressive acquirers unless we see something we think is just so compelling where we saw One Kendall and we talked about that last time. I think those are situations that we kind of pull together, our analysis and our view of the market and take a stock of that but those are really kind of at hawk situations got all over and developer rather than acquirer in most cases.","Peter Moglia","Hi this is Peter and I just wanted to underscore that we are still pursuing value add even when we are doing acquisitions of existing properties I mean the property at One Kendall has 30% of the space rolling over the next few years with similar mark to market. Same thing with the San Diego property, but the thing that these two acquisitions have in common as that they are very height barrier market. If you look at Torrey Pines, you look at Cambridge, there are very few owners, so when something comes up, if we don\u2019t get it, somebody else that competes with us will and so it is so we do our best to find a value and we have done it so far.","Joel Marcus","But if something there was I think it is 245 First that came to market which sits right next to our [indiscernible] project at 215 at first, we looked at that and decided there was really no immediate opportunity that add value to that project and offers power and lab building. And so we didn\u2019t enter the bidding so we try to be very disciplined and how we think about deploying capital and we think we would rather equate value as peter always says rather than pay somebody else for their value.","Peter Moglia","And this is Peter, misspoke it is 55% of the at least start rolling [ph] in the next couple of years at One Kendall and 30% mark to market opportunity, thank you.","Michael Carroll","Great thanks.","Peter Moglia","Yeah, thank you.","Operator","Thank you, we will now hear from David Rodgers with Baird.","David Rodgers","Yeah, Dean I don\u2019t if you want to take this or maybe Tom and others can address it, but I guess on 100 Binney and 400 Dexter, you said you are negotiating number of floors just going to the kind of type of tenants that you are talking to, there is not that but they are smaller going to be multi-core users, but as these tech tenants, lab tenants expansions are kind of flags for the portfolio.","Dean Shigenaga","Well I think in 400 Dexter we have discussions with the current occupant Juno Therapeutics, they represent probably the best of breed in the cancer immunotherapy area and at 100 Binney we have several companies including big pharma and bio tech. We don\u2019t have any offers or any tech requirements looking I think either of those buildings that I know at the moment.","David Rodgers","Okay great that\u2019s helpful and then maybe I don\u2019t know if this is for Steve or for Dean, it sounds like $140 million acquisition included or was it inside the entirety of the 88 Bluxome site, is that going to be pulled on as land, as a building as redevelopment, I guess how do you categorize that if it is land that go in the land number that you quoted earlier Dean and if not then I guess it doesn\u2019t matter.","Dean Shigenaga","It is in our future pipeline of project that we can build on page 41 of supplemental page. Here maybe a short lease back by the club on that sight, maybe up to a year but anyways it really represents important product for the future.","David Rodgers","Okay, do you maybe think of maybe [ph] your plan for the secured maturities in 2017 and one those that are up.","Dean Shigenaga","Sure that\u2019s scheduled on page 49 of our supplement package; we have about 290 million in total maturities in 2017. The bulk of it is in two loans one is $76 million secured loan that is actually scheduled for repayment in December of this year and that\u2019s included in our sources and uses on our guidance disclosures and then we also have another construction loan of $210 million, that we have an opportunity to extend it but we haven\u2019t yet committed to the extension or repayment. We hope to have more color for you on Investor Day.","David Rodgers","Okay, great thank you.","Dean Shigenaga","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with Mizuho.","Rich Anderson","Hey thanks and good afternoon. First question Joel is there any sort of opportunity beyond these sides of Manhattan that you guys are looking into so clustered there, I just wonder if there is anything where we could see more expanded platform someday just in future.","Joel Marcus","Well I think we look at New York city as a great market, each of these clusters takes about a generation, 25 years to mature, San Francisco, certainly after Genome Tech [ph] was founded and certainly the Cambridge cluster really hastened by some of the early companies and then highlighted by well obviously anchored by MIT and highlighted by Novartis\u2019 move of their R&D headquarters to Cambridge. Remember we are still kind of at the end of the first decade in New York so we think there is I think great opportunities for expansion. We view that market is a great market but to some extend it is going to be driven by a lot of early company formation out of the universities, I don\u2019t think you are going to see big companies move 1000 of people into Manhattan but we have been very successful in recruiting unique units, we did a Roche, we have done at Nestle, we recruited the key oncology group at Lilly, Pfizer's Centre of Therapeutic Innovation. So we think we can bring a number of unique research boutiques to New York city and we think that these type of medical coders at best location but we clearly would look at other, I don\u2019t think we go to the west side because the cross town traffic to the east side, to the medical corridors pretty tough, I don\u2019t know but that\u2019s how we look at it, but overtime I am sure will have a number of sites there.","Rich Anderson","All right, great and then speaking to Cambridge and understanding this humongous demand opportunity as mentioned 9 to 1 ratio sound s great and likely we will continue to be a fantastic market for you but 40% of your portfolio now at what point does even grey grows like that become a concentration risk for the company longer term.","Joel Marcus","Yeah that\u2019s the questions that certainly come up in a number of discussion and we pay close attention to that. We think that again Cambridge is the center of the universe on the life science industry and gives us good feeling when you are adjacent within a stone throw of MIT, we feel it is really long term great real estate. We do think that you will see continued growth in the bay area, Dean has done a fabulous job of expanding San Diego I think overtime we will see more activity in Seattle and in New York City so I think you will see those five clusters continue to grow. We hope that Maryland will with new injection of funds into the NIG and FDA we hope some of our key campuses are anchored by NIH and Maryland and then overtime we hope that Ag-Tech world will grow dramatically down in North Carolina, so we feel that we will manage that risk and we do pay attention to it for sure.","Rich Anderson","In case 40% your ceiling or could you go higher? What do you think as a company at this stage?","Joel Marcus","Well I don\u2019t know that we have any necessary target but I think as we look at capital allocation each year will pay close attention to that to make sure we don\u2019t have an undue risk in anything or market but we feel good about where we are and what is in the pipeline and I mean if you look at page 41 for example which I just alluded to we have got significant development opportunities in San Francisco obviously New York, San Diego and Seattle to name a few so I think we are pretty well balance in that regard.","Rich Anderson","Okay, fair enough and then maybe final question for Dean, and more of a modeling thing, you raised same store by 50 basis points but FFO sort of reiterated. Was there an offset there or just not enough too much little bit of rounding or didn\u2019t move the needle at the FFO line.","Dean Shigenaga","Two things to consider there Rich, one, as I mentioned the forward equity sale agreements actually brought in some additional shares into third quarter weighted average share count of about 751,000 shares, that\u2019s the equivalent of about $0.01 dilution to the quarter but importantly lot of leasing activity that we have executed on this year is capturing early renewals. As an example, the top six or so leases executed in the third quarter, none of the explorations related to 2016, most of it was 2017 or later, in fact two of the six went out to \u201821 and \u201822, so most of the upside in that quarter activity will be captures by mid \u201817. So it doesn\u2019t drop to a direct FFO impact for the third and fourth quarter. But again I think, keep in my mind the fundamentals remains solid, limited supply of Class A space and really strong demand and we\u2019re in a pretty sweet spot as we look forward.","Rich Anderson","Okay, fair enough. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And Mr. Marcus with no additional questions, I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to you for additional or closing remarks.","Okay. Well, thank you very much for your time. We appreciate that. We\u2019ll look forward to talking to you in the early February timeframe for fourth quarter and year-end results. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference, thank you all, again for your participation."],"1415":["Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","And at this time I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rhonda Chiger. Please go ahead.","Rhonda Chiger","Thank you and good afternoon. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company\u2019s Form 10-K, Annual Report and other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","And now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Joel Marcus. Please go ahead.","Joel Marcus","Thanks, Rhonda, and welcome everybody to the first quarter \u201814 conference call. With me today are Dean Shigenaga, Peter Moglia, Steve Richardson, Marc Binda, Andres Gavinet and Amanda Cashin.","So my take on the first quarter really echoes our theme that was presented in Investor Day December \u201813 on our return to stable growth with increasing FFO per share growth NAV per share growth really a very clean quarter, strong [core], solid operating metrics and very positive external growth. As many of you have read Michael Porter of Harvard has spoken off I mean written off on about kind of the urban clusters. And it\u2019s useful to reflect that ARE has really chosen to focus the bulk of its efforts and the bulk of its precious capital in the leading urban innovation clusters with the focus on quality buildings locations and tenants in each of those submarkets, ultimately reaping higher value stronger and more durable rental streams in up and down cycles, deeper and more creditworthy tenant base, tenant rollovers more protective again on releasing stronger rental rates, more pricing power, lower cap rates and lesser CapEx.","We also noted in our press release that we celebrated our 20th anniversary as a company and proud of our exceptional track record starting with the mere $19 million back in 1994 and addition them today a total market cap of $39 billion and we\u2019re probably been able to generate a return of about 579% from IPO through the end of the first quarter.","On macro comments on the FDA, they have been actually 12 FDA new drug approvals through April 24 of this year and 50% were ARE plant tenants, very proud of that. There is part of the 2012 Drug Act, the new breakthrough designation court order if you will was introduced and there have been 48 breakthrough designations through May 05, \u201814 and Alexandria client tenants have 56% of those of breakthrough designations.","And as you may know, those are promising drug candidates with clinical which remarkable -- in clinical development with remarkable clinical activity and this has really been unveil since the breakthrough designation was part of the prescription drug and user (inaudible) past in 2012 July which Alexandria actually helped grab the breakthrough designation provision, we are very proud of that.","The Affordable Care Act which has been much in the news is forecast to have $25 million new insured lives by 2023 and we feel strong demand for innovative medical products. Large pharma now has 56% of its Phase 3 pipeline from external sources up from 38% of decade ago. So I think it\u2019s fair to say the attempt of the interaction with biotech in the heart of the urban clusters really continues unabated.","And as many of you know much in the news these day pharma M&A has been front and center. I think it's fair to also say that the most successful based on past history of those who are driving biotech are acquired in the research units continue as independent competitive unit. This was really the formula Roche used with Genentech many, many years ago. Big pharma are increasingly focused on activities which benefit from scale and subcontract out so to speak a scientific work that doesn't primarily the biotech.","If we move to operations and internal growth, Greater Boston and San Francisco primarily contributed the strong cash and GAAP rental rate increases and Steve will talk more about the detail there. First quarter leasing are 563,000 square feet, Greater Boston had 42%, San Francisco 19% and Maryland 14%. And a lot of smaller spaces were involved in these leases, so somewhat shorter duration lease terms could be or were evident.","We feel very confident by the increasing GAAP leasing spread on Dean\u2019s adjusted guidance in that regard and occupancy across the regions continue to trend out best all time highs.","Moving to external growth quickly, acquisition activity has been fairly substantial, year-to-date approaching $150 million primarily because of the strong sector demand from our growing and expanding tenants is really driving our need to find additional facilities to retrofit for their use, as their occupancy drives to all time high in existing assets. So, we're actually running at a space for some of our tenants, so we've had to look at opportunities to acquire and this is good for them and certainly good for us.","And this is partly a consequence of accelerated FDA approvals and a heavily cash plus biotech sector. Steve will also detail the very strong large tenant demand which we're seeing in both Greater Boston and San Francisco.","On the development front, we\u2019ve had good steady lease up progress ahead of our pro forma in New York City now approaching 70%, on 75\/125 Binney. We're on target there, we have frequent dialogues and meetings with Ariad. We're making solid progress on the development of another Class A facility and this is science and technology close to market at 75\/125. As all of you know Ariad has a contractual lease commitment for 99% of the project with contractual rent payments. Target rent commencement date is contractual and the [refinement] of the lease is March 22, 2015.","We have some good news in Longwood, we expect to have another fourth floor leased by around the end of this quarter and activity is picking up in that regard. And on our 50\/60 Binney corridor two 250,000 square foot untitled shovel ready buildings. We will shortly commence marketing with one of the buildings of 250,000 square feet given the very large market tenant demand and we are proceeding on our joint venture as well.","In San Diego, we have very strong demand there Spectrum 1 is 40% preleased and 40% in negotiation. We are getting close singing the LOI with Alumina on their 150,000 square foot build-to-suit; same thing at campus point, a 120,000 square feet build-to-suit out of the 140 we\u2019ll build and we're also in build-to-suit negotiations with Spectrum 2 in San Diego.","Dean will talk about the balance sheet in detail, but -- and confirm our land sales of about 145 to 245, we feel comfortable with that number. Our forward active pipeline is about 35 million and right behind that is another 95 million plus, maybe 50 on the horizon. So we\u2019ll keep you posted as our negotiations move forward.","And we feel good about kind of where we\u2019ve guided the street. And then finally on the dividend, the company intends to continue with policy to share increasing cash flows with shareholders as we maintain a continuing low payout ratio of about 60%. So Peter?","Peter Moglia","Thanks Joel. I'd like to run you guys through or highlight two notable life science trades that offer further proof that life science real estate in the core market is achieving cap rates at or near those of Class A office products. And in addition, I'd like to present some office trades that occurred in and around our submarket to offer additional context for your valuation of our operating portfolio.","So first, I'd like to discuss the depending sale of Vertex headquarter research building in the Seaport Fan Pier submarket of Boston. Outside of HCP\u2019s purchase of this portfolio in 2007, this is the largest life science real estate transaction we have seen with the purchase price of $1.125 billion or a $1,022 per square foot.","Vertex occupies a 100% of the 1.08 million square feet of lab and office based. The project also contains 50,000 square feet of retail phase and 740 parking spaces. Based upon publicly disclosed information and our own estimates, we believe the cap rate of this trade was in the low sixes, likely near 6.2 upon lease up the retail space.","If the property had been located in Cambridge, we believe that cap rate would have been much lower. We know that there was at least one other bidder at that price point, but senior housing properties trust was the buyer. We had a very early look at this transaction through our relationship with the developer and the brokerage for marketing the property.","And although the real estate is Class A and Vertex is a solid tenant, we are unsure if Fan Pier will be able to compete with Cambridge for life science Tennessee over the long-term as it is lacks the ecosystem Kendall Square. That ultimately led to our exit from the bidding process of that transaction.","Outside of the cap rate compensation, we believe that this trade offers further evidence that life science real estate has become acceptable to a wider range of investors. This is [S&H's] first life science real estate investment and we know that a number of other bidders included pension fund advisors and a sovereign well fund.","This trade also illustrates that lower cap rates are driving our price per square foot statistics as we also see in Kilroy\u2019s purchase of 401 Terry in Seattle for $106.1 million or $755 per square foot. 401 Terry is a laboratory office building located in the South Lake Union sub market that garnered considerable national attention with over 30 initial bidders. The building is relatively new and 100% leased to the institute for systems biology with moderate churn left on the lease.","The cap rate on this transaction was 6.0% in considering that the tenant is not credit and a small research non-profit we believe it could have been lower. Like [to see in fewer] transaction this trade also offers further evidence to the widing audience for life science real estate.","So before I hand it over to Steve, I wanted to briefly mention that 221 Main Street, a 379,000 square foot office building located in San Francisco South Financial District just north of Mission Bay traded at a 4.0% cap rate in April with a price per square foot of $725. Posting about the trade on the website [the registry] mentioned that many in the brokerage industry saw that cap rate is a little high for a large institutional quality building.","We believe that as Mission Bay continues to be developed into an infield location it will become more and more integrated into SoMa and the financial district. The northern edge of Mission Bay is only mile away from 333 Brand Street where Drop Box recently signed a lease with a new high end rental rates for the area. The recently announced Warrior event center which will be located on 12 acres of land adjacent to our 401 499 Illinois property and in close proximity to 455 Mission Bay Boulevard will accelerate this integration by further enhancing Mission Bay as a 24X7 live, work, play environment and an unparalleled destination to recruit the [10 top talent]. So even if you apply the discount to our Mission Bay assets that are long-term leased to credit tenants such as Baird, Pfizer, Celgene, ECSS and The VA a cap rate in the high 4s to low 5s is justified.","Lastly I\u2019d like to note that [SO Green] is selling 673 First Avenue in New York at a 4.7% cap rate. This was actually passed on to us by one of our coverage analysts who thought it would be applicable to our New York City assets given its location of half mile the north of the Alexandria Center for Life Science, it\u2019s [NOIE] score and medicine tenancy and that it is a leasehold interest. With our assets being long-term leased to credit tenants newly constructed fully amenitized and lacking in competitive product we\u2019ve argued for a rate lower than this.","So with that I\u2019ll pass it over to Steve.","Steve Richardson","Thank you Peter and good afternoon everyone. I\u2019d like to highlight two key points we may for Marc\u2019s truly underlying the theme of stable growth that Joel referred to earlier as it\u2019s well underway in our Gateway cities where we\u2019ve concentrated our significant capital allocation in Class A urban science and technology campuses.","First we\u2019ll discuss the truly stellar performance of our core doing great part to our best in the business fully integrated regional teams. Second the ability of our teams to capture additional growth opportunities in the best locations such as the recent 500 Townsend Street acquisition in the SoMa district in San Francisco. First the quarter is performing very well as we reported cash and GAAP increases of 10.4% and 18.2% respectively this past quarter for renewals in releasing space. The business imperative for our investment grade tenants to commit the space is clearly evidenced by the truly stellar 96.6 occupancy rate for North American operating properties, up 240 bps from Q1, 2013 and just 292,000 square feet of rollovers remained to be resolved in 2014 or just 1.9% of our operating asset base.","We are seeing tenants with 2015 rollovers also pursuing early renewals to ensure they secure a high quality space in these key clusters. Drilling down a little further in Alexandria\u2019s key innovation clusters, we can see the broad and strong business patterns outlined by Joel manifesting themselves in these healthy real estate indicators.","In Cambridge, we are tracking demand of more than 2 million square feet in the market from both life science and tech users. We expect our mark-to-market on rollovers for the balance of the year to be in the 9% range on GAAP basis as [the switch are] concentrated in Cambridge where we think continue to drive rents in the high 50s to low 60s triple net for existing product.","As we discussed earlier The Binney Street marketing and prospect discussions are continuing and we continue to see rents in the low 70s triple net for ground up project. Direct vacancy rates remained very healthy at 10.2% contributing to the overall sense of urgency in the market.","Moving out to the West Coast, The San Francisco Bay area continues to experience exceptional demand as we have hit an all time high of 99.8% occupancy in the operating and development portfolio. We are tracking approximately 1 million square feet of life science demand and another 6.5 million square feet of tech demand and know two recent very substantial leases, hind in San Francisco with salesforce taking down 700,000 square feet and linked in another 400,000 square feet driving lease rates for new products in the mid 50s triple net.","Mark-to-market for our Bay area 2014 rollovers is anticipated to be in the high teen with lease rates in the high 40s in Mission Bay to mid 30s in South San Francisco and low to mid 40s in the Stanford cluster. And market continues to tighten as vacancy rates drop to 100 basis points in Mission Bay and SoMa to a tenth of a percent of 6.4% respectively and 40 bps to 6.4% in South San Francisco.","Moving to South, San Diego is also in a strong demand cycle with 800,000 square feet of requirements in the market and rents on Torrey Pines pushing through the $40 triple net mark for high-quality product an increase of nearly 10% from last year. UTC submarket has a direct vacancy rate of 6.4% and Torrey Pines vacancy rates of 10% will be dropping into the single-digit during the next quarter. We expect the mark-to-market on the modest rollover remaining in 2014 to also contribute to core growth.","Seattle, Maryland and RTP will also provide mark-to-market gains in the range of 5.9% to flat to 20% respectively for 2014. Vacancy rates are tight in these markets as well with Seattle, South Lake Union at 4.9%, Rockville at 10%, excluding the HTS big block, Gaithersburg at 5.6% and RTP at 10%. Demand is very healthy again with almost 900,000 square feet in the Seattle science and tech sector; 220,000 square feet in Maryland; and another 125,000 square feet in RTP.","Second is the 500 pounds industry parcel acquisition and strategic plan to perfect entitlement design and construct nearly 300,000 square feet of Class A science and tech space, is really a testament to each of the regional team\u2019s ability to execute on meaningful and compelling new growth opportunities. This location at the geographic intersection of Mission Bay and SOMA mirrors the deep industry intersection and really trend of collaboration and overlap in the science and technology innovation grounds. SoMa's extraordinarily demand cycle of 4.5 million square feet of absorption during the past three years is continuing as it added another 1.1 million square feet with the leases noted above.","500 Townsend with its best-in-class development team, this is a team that has decades of experience in wide ranging expertise delivering Class A high-quality projects in the city of San Francisco including driving the occupancy rate to 99.8% for its 1 million square foot Mission Bay cluster, is on track to create an iconic and state-of-the-art facility that captures the architecturally historic term that SoMa District at the absolute Gateway entry to San Francisco.","With that, I'll turn it over to Dean.","Dean Shigenaga","","Thanks Steve, Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everybody. I\u2019ve got three important topics to cover. First, I want to provide an update on our balance sheet which has positioned us to support stable per share earnings growth. Second, I want to provide key updates on important strategic capital related events for 2014. And lastly, I'll provide a summary of key drivers of our $0.05 growth and guidance for 2014 FFO per share and continued confidence in our ability to deliver solid growth and cash flows, net asset value and per share earnings in 2014 and beyond.","Starting with the balance sheet update, we continue to focus on a strong and flexible balance sheet which will allow us to execute on our business strategy. We have almost $9 billion in gross assets, up 32% since we received our initial investment grade rating in 2011. We have over $1.3 billion in liquidity. We have only $20 million and $61 million of debt maturing in the remainder of 2014 and in 2015 respectively. We anticipate continued improvement overtime in net debt to adjusted EBITDA on a trailing 12 month basis driven by growth in EBITDA and near-term projected land sales.","Our fixed charge coverage ratio continues to improve as our business benefits from the continued migration of high quality tenants into Class A collaborative science and technology campuses in urban innovation clusters. Our fixed charge coverage ratio has improved significantly to 3.3 times or up about 50% since our initial credit rating assessment.","Our unhedged variable rate debt of 26% is currently at a level to support an opportunistic bond offering in 2014 without having to terminate swap contract as we use the proceeds from the offering to reduce outstanding variable rate bank debt. We expect unhedged variable rate debt to be approximately 11% as at year-end.","Moving onto an important capital update for events for 2014; first with our bond offering, we remain focused on our strategy to maintain strong a flexible balance sheet, specifically our bond offering will focus on extending our maturity profile appropriately lettering maturities and refinancing outstanding bank debt. We have increased our targeted size of our bond offering by $150 million to a midpoint of $550 million and anticipate executing this offering in the near-term. The proceeds of this bond offering will be used to reduce $100 million our 2016 term loan with the remaining proceeds to reduce outstanding borrowings under our line of credit.","We will continue to focus on execution of our strategy including further reductions in our 2016 term loan in 2015 and \u201816 issuing long-term bonds for growth capital and driving steady growth and FFO per share quarter-to-quarter and solid growth year-over-year.","Briefly on land sales, our guidance for land sales in 2014 will focus on generating important capital from non-income producing assets for investment into high value development projects. Our land sales will also include the first part of important capital from a pragmatic JV partner with the sale of an interest in our near-term development opportunity in 50, 60 and 100 Binney located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.","We are comfortable with the range of guidance for land sales of $145 million to $245 million or midpoint of $195 million for 2014 and anticipate providing more details over the next quarter or so.","Lastly on guidance I want to touch on two important topics, leasing activity expectations for the remainder of the year and key drivers of the solid $0.05 increase in FFO per share guidance for 2014.","We reported strong rental rate growth on lease renewals and releasing space for the first quarter of 18.2% and 10.4% on a cash basis. These stats were solid with 53% of the renewals and releasing of space related to leasing in Cambridge, Massachusetts with rental rate increases of over 18% and 12% on a cash basis.","We remain on track to achieve solid rental rate growth on leasing activity for 2014 and remain optimistic that we\u2019ll hit the upper-end of the ranges for guidance for rental rate growth. We are pleased to announce a solid $0.05 increase at the midpoint of our FFO per share guidance for 2014 to a range of $4.70 to $4.80, the new midpoint of our guidance of $4.75 represents solid growth of approximately 8% over 2013.","The increase in guidance reflects the continued execution of our business strategy to deliver solid and stable earnings growth and consisted of the following key drivers. The $0.02 increase from core operations driven by solid early renewals including a 130 square foot lease in Cambridge, a $0.01 increase from a value creation projects including lease up of an additional 25,000 square feet at 499 Illinois and Mission Bay now 98% leased and the renewal of the lease in the potential area of the San Francisco Bay market. A $0.01 increase from acquisitions and a $0.01 increase from various other items including updated assumptions for our bond offering in 2014.","The delivery of certain pre-leased value creation projects in 2014 is anticipated to be primarily in mid to late 3Q. Our expectation for FFO per share through 2014 is in line with our goal and is expected to show steady growth of a penny per share each quarter going forward.","In closing of my comments, we\u2019re pleased to be in a solid position with our balance sheet with continuing solid core operations and demand from high quality science and technology companies to drive stable growth in FFO per share and net asset value in 2014 and beyond.","With that I\u2019ll turn it back to Joel Marcus.","Joel Marcus","So operator if we could open it up for Q&A please.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Yes. Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And we will take our first quarter today from Emmanuel Korchman with Citi. Please go ahead.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citi","Hey guys, thanks for taking questions. Dean I will start with you, looking in your sub, you have a comment on the marketable securities balance underlying gains going up pretty significantly but it didn\u2019t look like the biotech index sort of went up same amount. Could you talk about what might be happening there is just sort of a single need and that\u2019s really outperforming or something else?","Dean Shigenaga","Well, I think in the follow on to our comment Manny, last quarter we had touch briefly on the upside and the value of our investments been easily two times cost and most of those investments are healthy cost. So you did have couple of securities that driven primarily by one that have a significant increasing value during the quarter and that\u2019s reflected through equity, so just for everybody\u2019s note here that is not part of our P&L or income statement.","But I think they\u2019re going to find us from time-to-time. You will see some pretty meaningful growth in the value that will reflect in our investment holdings on the balance sheet, primarily as privately held or private investments and private companies transferred into a public security and that really occurs into. One as the company is for public or two the required by a public filtrated company and we end up with a unrealized increased in valuation and that will allow us to have liquidity events overtime as we been fit providing a little bit of weather income from time-to-time.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citi","Thanks guys for the explanation. Your exposure [India] went up in the quarter, previously had spoken about decreasing our exposure (inaudible) sort of idea? ","Joel Marcus","That\u2019s all FX.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citi","But it looks like your number of assets went up unless I\u2019m mistaken?","Joel Marcus","We brought one asset from redevelopment into operating that was fully vacant.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citi","Got it. And then my final question, you guys have increased your debt issuance guidance within the notes, but you haven't increase any of your sort of sales guidance. And given the environment that Peter spoke about what assets trading at, pretty low cap rate. Have you thought about selling more stabilized properties and kind of rolling those into other lands and so other sort of the nominal properties, rather than selling out to the bonds markets?","Joel Marcus","As you know, we did that in a couple of submarket during later part of 12 and early part of 13. And so that program is done and we're really focused more on the land sale opportunities we have to use together obviously with bonds to invest in both redevelopment and development projects.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citi","Thanks Joel.","Joel Marcus","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll now go to Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thank you. I know you guys touched on, in a couple of different ways on your JV prospects, I think you mentioned something like contributing land. Can you just clearly say, actually how we should be thinking about the JV going forward? And when we might see some activity and how?","Joel Marcus","Well, I think if I said a quarter or two ago, we would hope to have a JV in place, where we would be a majority partner, hopefully sometime late second or early third quarter and it would be focused on 50, 60 Binney properties on potentially on a 100 Binney.","And because the opportunity is there on leasing or pretty sizable the dollar amount of building that project out approach $750 million so it's ideal for a JV opportunity where we can also earn fees and promote et cetera. So, that's haven't changed from the discussion we have maybe at Investor Day or thereafter.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay. And then reading the press release, if I read it correctly, so you talked about it potentially taking about Executive Chairman role in several years, can you talk more about what that means and if that means maintaining the CEO spot or not?","Joel Marcus","","Well, I think it\u2019s -- probably the easiest way to think about it is that under the new contract, I\u2019ll continue to as CEO of the company through December 31, 2016, beyond that the contract will be what it is, or it may change, I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m focused on this quarter.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. I mean I guess, if you are Executive Chairman, would you stay as CEO, those are distinct roles, you can\u2019t keep both?","Joel Marcus","","I think they\u2019d two distinct roles.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay.","Joel Marcus","","Yes.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","And then finally, when you guys were quoting rents you talked a lot about tech rents and life science rents, so you -- as you think about your major markets; are you tempted to go more down the tech route at this point than life science and how are you thinking about that decision?","Joel Marcus","Well, I think if you focus on kind of what we\u2019ve said and how the supplement is presented and the press release, we haven\u2019t changed our focus from these critical core urban science and technology clusters. I mean, if you walk into Mission Bay in our lobby, you\u2019ve been there many times, you will see I think the moniker is Alexandria Science and Technology Mission Bay Campus. And so we have focused primarily on the life science industry, but as Steve said, it\u2019s clear that the integration of information technology, engineering and other disciplines with life science continues unabated especially as we get into the digital healthcare age. And so these markets tend to melt together.","So I think our focus won\u2019t change, we\u2019ll continue to focus on class A buildings, AAA locations urban campuses, innovation clusters.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But as you think about the rent growth, you're seeing in the market, is it rising faster for a traditional tech space or should I say tradition for modern tech space than it is for life science space?","Peter Moglia","","Yes, I think the rate of increase is probably a bit higher in the technology sector than it is the life science sector. Having said that as we've seen healthy rental rate increases in Mission Bay and Cambridge and Seattle and San Diego as well, so they\u2019re all very healthy.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay, alright. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","","Yes, thanks Jamie.","Operator","And we'll now go to Sheila McGrath with Evercore.","Sheila McGrath - Evercore","Yes, good afternoon. Joel, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the land acquisition in SoMa, how long you think it will take to entitle the pricing? And also you mentioned in your prepared comments that your recent acquisitions were tenant driven. I was just wondering if you're already in discussions with tenants at that site.","Joel Marcus","Yes, I\u2019ll let Steve comment on that and then I\u2019ll come back to some other items on the acquisitions.","Steve Richardson","Yes. Hi Sheila, it's Steve. On 500 towns and the entitlement process, we\u2019ve actually submitted to the city as of last Friday. So the development team is very experienced team. We were able to go ahead and execute on that quickly. We expect that to take anywhere from 12 to 18 months. And we are on that full time. And as far as the pricing, I think, as you think about the pricing and they were two other bidders as well who were essentially at that price point. Relative to the rental rate increases, it's very consistent with the pricing that we've seen in the past for other high profile parcels like this one.","Joel Marcus","","And our internal team and our external team have ongoing discussions with potential tenants. So that actually even to some extent began in a shadow fashion before we closed on the transaction. I think if you look at the acquisitions, both in San Diego and in Greater Boston, those have primarily been driven by either existing tenants or new tenants who have come to us needing real estate solutions where we couldn\u2019t accommodate them with existing assets. So that as I said in my prepared remarks has driven some of the acquisition activity. And again it\u2019s driven a lot by FDA approvals and the biotech sector being among many of the companies being pretty plush with cash and ready to do expansion, undertake expansion.","Sheila McGrath - Evercore","Okay. And Dean, a couple of quick questions, if you were in the bond market today 10 year debt, where do you think you could execute roughly?","Joel Marcus","","Yes. Let me say while Dean is giving some thought to that. If you look at our last two bond deals, both were 10 year. If entire likely we wouldn\u2019t do a 10 year bond deal; we would look to latter maturities and we might have them maybe somewhat shorter and somewhat longer duration bonds as we are thinking about this.","Sheila McGrath - Evercore","Okay.","Dean Shigenaga","","Yes, I\u2019d have to say probably somewhere depending on treasuries and treasuries have been moving around quite a bit but call it somewhere in the low 4% range on 10 year line.","Sheila McGrath - Evercore","Okay. And then Dean any comments on other income? It was a little bit higher than we had forecasted in the quarter. What was that? And if the quarter if you think you had any weather impact in the quarter?","Dean Shigenaga","Two questions, Sheila; the first one regarding other income. I\u2019d say nothing really unusual in other income in the first quarter. I would say if you\u2019re thinking about a run rate, you should think about roughly $3 million a quarter or $12 million of other income for the year. And then as far as weather because it\u2019s been a key topic for earnings for REIT this quarter, we\u2019re no different in the sense that our portfolio was exposed to the weather conditions in the quarter across the country. But the benefit we have is we do have a tripe-net lease portfolio, so the tenants to bear across cold weather or heavy snow, as well as heating and cooling costs depending on hot or cold weather. So the true difference here is we had limited P&L exposure as a result of our tripe net portfolio.","Sheila McGrath - Evercore","Okay, great. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Yes, thanks Sheila.","Operator","Next is Steve Sakwa with ISI Group.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group","Thanks, good afternoon. I just wanted to I guess go back to the JV and just make sure Dean in the supplemental where you\u2019ve got the guidance staged, and you talked about the land and sales (inaudible) strategically venture your capital, just kind of roughly 150 to 250. Are basically all the sales actually tied up in this Binney project and if not, are there other assets that you\u2019ve got currently on the market today for sale?","Joel Marcus","Yes, let me say before Dean takes you through that. No, they aren\u2019t all Binney. We\u2019ve got about $35 million having nothing to do with Binney that\u2019s in the forward part of the pipeline. And then Dean can give you some of the Binney stats.","Dean Shigenaga","Yes, I think the way Steve to think about Binney is if you turn to the supplemental near the very back in our feature and near term projects, on page 31 of the supplemental, our book value on 50\/60 and 100 Binney is roughly $286 million. So, our goal would be to bring in and still maintain a majority position, but sell an interest in the land for development there. And you can apply a factor, if you want to assume something just sort of something in the 45% range for a partner for the sake of doing some math. And we expect to be north of book as we sell an interest in that opportunity there.","So Binney is an important component but nowhere near. We still have a number of transactions that Joel mentioned that are smaller that are moving through and we think we are going to close the gap here on the remaining that has not been discussed somewhere in the $60 million to $65 million range. And we will provide more details probably over the next quarter.","Joel Marcus","Yes, so that means about 35 near term, you got another chunk for Binney and then a chunk that Dan just described that could in the [$50] million to $65 million range that\u2019s kind of behind Binney. So we hope to accomplish those during 2014.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group","And Joel, I can appreciate you\u2019re not giving too many details on the joint ventures negotiated, but are there -- I mean do you have kind of one partner that you are kind of actively going through right now or are you still kind of reporting partners or are there kind of issues that have come up in the discussions?","Joel Marcus","No, we are negotiating with one partner.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group","Okay. And then I guess just on the bond deals, what -- I guess is there anything that kind of triggered sort of pushing this off? I know back at the Analyst Day you talked about setting conservative guidance having to deal effectively beginning of the year. And I can appreciate this deal might happen in the second quarter, but basically, it got pushed off six months. Is there anything specific that kind of pushed that back obviously with your benefit to weighted -- I'm sure you wouldn't have forecasted the [rates] going down per se. So, is there something that kind of drove that decision?","Joel Marcus","Yes, I noted in your note that you had indicated that we said it would be early in the year. I don't know that we said that precisely, I think what we said is we had modeled that as if it would be earlier in the year, which would be the most conservative approach to it. But we have always thought about opportunistically taking advantage of that. We wanted to see -- we wanted to get through the tax square payoff, we've looked at the secured debt market, because we now have a huge amount of unencumbered NOI over 80%. So, we've been busy looking at that market as well. And I think we still see an opportunistic chance to do what we want to do that maybe outside the 10 -- within the 10 and outside the 10.","So, I think that comment was we modeled it early, but we never committed to do it day 1 of 2014. I don't think that was ever on our mind.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group","Okay. And then I guess just lastly, Dean in terms of land sale gains, maybe I missed this in your comments. But would the land sale gains I guess to be related to the Binney sale or would they be separate sale. ","Dean Shigenaga","Well, we haven't given guidance on gains for land sales and any gains would be excluded from our core FFO numbers. But we do expect the assets that are currently under advanced negotiations would be sold at a modest gain or a small gain.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group","Okay, thanks. That's it.","Joel Marcus","Yes, thanks Steve.","Operator","","And we\u2019ll now go to Jeff Theiler with Green Street Advisors","Kevin Tyler- Green Street Advisors","","Hi, it's Kevin Tyler here with Jeff. I had a question. There was an article about a potential Alexandria partnership with Rice University's BioScience Research Collaborative. I know you guys have had success with deals like this and recently with the NYU deal in New York at the Alexandria Center for Life Science but do you feel it's in a bit on your current appetite for University related transactions and more broadly for a larger footprint in Houston?","Joel Marcus","Yes. I don\u2019t want to comment on future market but I would say that our focus is not so much on University related transaction. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s where we want to keep our focus, I think, one, because the NIH budget is muted. That our experience along clearly would indicate that those budgets are more difficult to take operating monies for rental payments and we've never historically tried to tie our business to that factor. I think our focus has always been on the science and technology, urban cluster, innovation, locations and we want those to be near major urban centers, multiple centers, with [spawn] technology, which provides clinical trial opportunities, etcetera. I mean, New York is the paradigm example; Longwood is another great example; obviously UCSF. But we wouldn't just go to some random city and do a one-off deal with the University. That's not what we do. It would be an integrated campus made up of quite a number of participants in the ecosystem and that\u2019s how we think about it. So if we do something in another location, it would be according to our strategic plan, not like a one-off deal.","Kevin Tyler- Green Street Advisors","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much. I think the rest of our questions have been answered.","Joel Marcus","","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll now go to Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets","Yes, thanks. I'm not sure if you guys talked about this yet or not. But can you give us an update on the Ariad situation? I know the tenant has had some positive announcements, have there been any update about the amount of sub-lease space they want to do at 75, 125 if any?","Joel Marcus","","Yes. I think I specifically indicated in my comments Mike that we have frequent dialogues and meetings with Ariad obviously because they are the tenant in our development project at 75, 125. I don't have any news or update on their sub-leasing activities, as they say it\u2019s the last [offer] they were interested in sub-leasing all over a portion of the smaller building and that\u2019s as far as we know that they have had discussions with a number of parties on that. But there is no update that I have specifically.","Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then the increase at the bottom end of your guidance, was that largely due to the, I guess pushing back the bond offering in your model or pushing back in the year?","Joel Marcus","","No, I think Dean went through the couple of items. He will just recap it for you quickly.","Dean Shigenaga","","Yes, Mike not at all. The $0.05 growth as I stated earlier, I will rattle through quickly or $0.02 of that came from core related to early renewals. Primarily a large lease in Cambridge for 130,000 square feet $0.01 from value creation projects from lease up of additional space but we plan to deliver this year at 499 Illinois, $0.01 from acquisitions. And then $0.01 from various items included in that were updated assumptions for bond offering in 2014.","Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, great. Thank you, guys.","Joel Marcus","","Yes. Thank you.","","Operator","","And next is Tom Catherwood with Cowen and Company.","Tom Catherwood - Cowen and Company","","Yes thank you. Dean we look at this quarter pretty strong internal growth obviously, from a GAAP standpoint you are up 3.8% and your leasing spreads were strong as well. As we think about it though given the guidance raise and the strong performance we were somewhat surprised that you didn\u2019t raised the same store guidance for the full year. And we are wondering as we think through the rest of the year is growth going to moderate somewhat internally or is there something else kind of driving leaving the guide where it is?","Dean Shigenaga","","No I think we are doing very well relative to our guidance on same store, both the traditional GAAP view as well as the cash view. I think our cash tax as an example of 43 for the quarter if you just compare it the midpoint, the midpoint of 46 for cash basis NOI growth still puts us tracking for a 5%. So I think that you are going to see collectively as we proceed through the year, same store performance move closer to the midpoint and I think there is room to be on the upper end relative to those midpoints both on GAAP and cash.","Tom Catherwood - Cowen and Company","","Got you. And then Peter appreciate the outlook on some other recent sales. It looks like cap rates are coming down on some transactions, but when I look at you guys I mean you are trading at roughly at 6.4% implied cap rate and there seems to be some sort of a split between how public markets are viewing these and what they are going for in private transactions. I want to know your sense of kind of what\u2019s driving that split and if you still see cap rates compression to the rest of this year.","Peter Moglia","","Well, I guess Tom what I could tell you is that any time that we enter into a transaction the core markets we\u2019re just seeing more and more people involved and that\u2019s just driving the pricing further and further. And then after something trades I get an email or a call from somebody looking to find out why did it trade so well and we talk it through and then it turns out to be a good on transaction and a good comp and we talked about here on the earnings call. I think this is the third quarter in a row I\u2019ve gone through some pretty good comps that would give people an idea of what makes you trade for it doesn\u2019t seem to translate when we look at our implied cap rate.","So I can\u2019t be answer why there is a gap, I don\u2019t quite understand it. But I will, I certainly think that we\u2019re going to continue to see more and more investment in this sector and pricing will continue to be strong.","Tom Catherwood - Cowen and Company","Got you. And then kind of building off of that, obviously a lot of interests in the sector not only assets, but in the kind of business itself; we\u2019ve seen the entrance of senior housing obviously with the Vertex deal into the now life science real-estate sector which Kilroy has purchased in Seattle as they\u2019re entering the sector as well. And obviously given the growth that you guys are seeing the value creation potential you\u2019re seeing it\u2019s kind of obvious that you would see more competition. But do you see some potential for that competition to even to some of your main areas or no someway affects your business strategy?","Joel Marcus","Well, I think it\u2019s -- you have to distinguish between somebody owning a building or two or three or whatever even a big building like the Vertex building at Seaport Center versus somebody who has fully integrated teams in the ground who\u2019ve operated for 15 to 20 years and who have a kind of base second to none.","So, I don\u2019t think we get much worried about the competition. As Peter said, we think it is absolutely fine the cap rates are being driven lower because that gives us a chance to create value whether I think say Peter likes to say rather than buying somebody else\u2019s value and that just happened, impacted us. We have great opportunities for growth, I mean we can literally double the size of the company on a square footage basis on the land we own we hope to monetize a lot of that in the near-term has been said and on board EBITDA, but it haven\u2019t stopped our growth in the core urban innovation centers. So I think just a acquisition or purchase doesn\u2019t make a life science real estate company that really can expand multiple markets.","Tom Catherwood - Cowen and Company","Got you. Thanks. I appreciate it.","Joel Marcus","Yes, my pleasure. Thank you.","Operator","And we will go to Gabe Hilmoe with UBS.","Gabe Hilmoe - UBS","Thanks. Joel, just on the redevelopment property as 225 second, I am just trying to get a sense of what the opportunity is there, is that a version play from office (inaudible) and I guess what type of use it can be?","Joel Marcus","Yes, it\u2019s an existing tenant that house outgrown their space and asked us to find a specific solution for them. And so yes, it\u2019s a retrofit.","Gabe Hilmoe - UBS","Okay. And then I guess on the move out, I mean I guess for you, I think (inaudible) to support is that a asset that something we can get put into, I guess for sell bucket or is that plan to redevelop that as well?","Joel Marcus","Yes. We\u2019re actually already are in discussions with potential tenant to take that building, so we are advancing that more than likely going to be a retrofit into a lot building from currently a specialized use.","Gabe Hilmoe - UBS","Okay. And then, I guess last from me, just going back to 500 pounds, any interest there or opportunity you bring in a capital partner or will that be all Alexandria 100%?","Joel Marcus","Yes, it would be Alexandria 100%.","Gabe Hilmoe - UBS","Okay, great. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Yes, thank you.","Operator","And at this time, there is one name remaining on the roster. (Operator Instructions) And we'll now take a follow-up question from Emmanuel Korchman from Citi. Please go ahead.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","Yes, it's Michael Bilerman with Manny. Good afternoon.","Joel Marcus","Hi there.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","Dean this 130,000 square foot large renewal, when did that become effective?","Dean Shigenaga","All right, effective in the first week.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","Right\u2026","Dean Shigenaga","Right. It was an original lease; there was a lease with an original lease end day in 2016. So, we have an opportunity to do an early renewal that started in the first quarter.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","And just doing the math $0.02 is a $1.4 million. So, that's $11 a foot greater than what you would have expected, or what that's currently paying today In terms of a mark-up?","Dean Shigenaga","There was a very healthy mark-up on this space on a cash basis. And because it's, it's got a good term on it, as we get a GAAP benefit increases well with the annual steps.","Joel Marcus","So yes Michael, very solid step on rents.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","Yes, it's a big building and it's a triple A location in the heart of Cambridge.","Dean Shigenaga","Hopefully it doesn't surprise you because BHP had massive steps in their Bakken holdings as well this quarter. So,","Michael Bilerman - Citi","No, I just, I thought it was relative to renewal that was schedule to expire not forgetting that was 16 that you brought forward because I was just thinking about the delta from what was already in guidance, but this is effectively a new lease that you have brought forward or renewal that you brought forward, we are able capture a significant amount of markup, but I was just trying to make sure that I understood the dynamics of what was in guidance versus now. Now I understood it.","Joel Marcus","Yes. And the reason that happened actually is this was a tenant that\u2019s had some pretty great success recently. And they are nervous about the opportunities to expand in Cambridge or even maintain themselves and so they emerged and came to us to try to put this field together. So that\u2019s the market dynamic there Michael but as you know from the tour you guys took in January.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","","Yes, is there other opportunities like that where you can bring and I know you are always aggressively leasing space, but is there other role that you can pull forward from future years that can help growth in the near term?","Joel Marcus","","The answer is yes.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","","And do you a number, I mean is there a certain size that you are working with right now in terms of transactions and leasing? I know the leasing volume at least in the quarter was lighter than what the history has been.","Joel Marcus","","Yes, Jeff, because we have, so this is one of the smallest yearly rollovers I think in the history of company. The answer is yes, but I don\u2019t think we want to re-revise guidance here on this call, so we just stay tuned.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","And then just last question, just as you think about sources and uses this year, you\u2019ve made the decision to fund the extra $100 million of your effective -- use of capital through acquisitions and development spend all with debt. And so I\u2019m just curious in your mind, you worked so hard to get the balance sheet in the position, at what point do we start thinking leverage neutral? Because as it stands right now and you think about sources and uses in the guidance, the extra 100 million completely get funded. So what point did you trigger?","Joel Marcus","","Yes, I think that's not an accurate for trail. So maybe Dean, you want to comment on that.","Dean Shigenaga","Michael, it\u2019s Dean here. I would say in my comments, what I would like everybody to remember is that we have tremendous EBITDA growth occurring in \u201814 and continuing into '15. And if you recall my prepared comments touching on the fact that trailing 12 net debt to adjusted EBITDA will continue over time to migrate lower at a lower leverage point over time. And this is going to be driven primarily by EBITDA growth. But in this year, we do have some projected land sales, which we feel very comfortable with and that will help as well. But the EBITDA growth continues beyond \u201814 and that's your primary driver of balance in it. And on a trailing 12 basis, you're going to see continued improvement in debt-to-EBITDA. So, we did have a spike on a current quarter annualize, but that has more to do with funding and relative timing.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","Right. No, I -- and I understand that. But all that is to create EBITDA growth that you're pushing in selling the land and not [introducing] assets, all of that was known, right? What I'm just trying to think about is this quarter you've added a $100 million to your uses of capital. You're finding that 100 million irrespective of the EBITDA growth, irrespective of the land sales all of which was fully discussed at the Investor Day. Your funding the extra $100 million of capital spend with debt and all I was trying to think about is knowing the future uses of capital that will be on the [common], think about the San Francisco land use just bought, you\u2019ll have a development. At what point in your mind has it triggered the need for either to sell more assets given how robust the market is; Peter has talked a lot about that on the call or the need to raise common equity which I know you have talked about not wanting to do? And so that\u2019s and I am just trying to balance out a little bit.","Joel Marcus","","Yes, I think you will see Michael and it\u2019s a really good question and we have to think about this everyday obviously because our target debt to EBITDA as we said, we want to migrate not only from broadly the [6.5] but hopefully over coming years lower. We clearly we will see we hope a larger amount of land sales this year than even the guidance has provided and we clearly would look at low yielding assets as a possibility for asset sales. And so, we have said we aren\u2019t going to raise common equity this year. So, I think that we expect the land sales to make up the majority of what we need to make sure we are in the target debt to EBITDA ranges.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","Okay. So I guess any incremental potential new use you would have need to actually raise the asset sale guidance if next quarter we come around and you have another $15 million of opportunity at that point, we would actually see an increase?","Joel Marcus","","Yes. And I don\u2019t want to -- I want to be really careful because this is a public call but I think you will see over the coming quarter, the $15 million that we spent on the tons of acquisitions will be fully covered as an example by a sale of an asset that we haven\u2019t commented about we are still negotiating but we believe we\u2019ve got a good probability of success. So I think in a sense it\u2019s a little bit of match funding.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","Okay, thank you.","Joel Marcus","","Yes. Thank you for the great question.","Operator","And there are no other questions. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Joel Marcus for any additional or closing remarks.","Joel Marcus","Thank you very much. We managed to keep it within the hour. And I appreciate and look forward to talking to you on the second quarter call. Thanks everybody.","Operator","And thank you very much. That does conclude our conference for today. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for your participation. And have a great day."],"1420":["Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc.

Please note this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Paula Schwartz. Please go ahead.","Paula Schwartz","Thank you and good afternoon. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Federal securities laws. The company's actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements; additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","With that, I'll turn it over to Joel Marcus. Please go ahead, Joel.","Joel Marcus","Thank you very much. With me today are Dean Shigenaga, CFO; Steve Richardson, Chief Operating Officer; Peter Moglia, Chief Investment Officer; Tom Andrews, Executive Vice President, and Dan Ryan, Executive Vice President, so welcome to our second quarter call. I think the second quarter has really two key storylines for our best in class office REIT, the first one is price discovery for ARE and its assets and I believe deserving of cap rate compression and multiple expansion and secondly would be the sheer historic leasing volume in the second quarter, testament really to the locations quality of assets and really the leasing team. Dean will go through the balance sheet and guidance in detail but we did increase guidance to 524 so when you take our projected FFO for the year plus the dividend we're looking at a low double digit total return. ","On the science and technology front the industries themselves remain at the forefront of growth and leadership in our innovation economy seeking to attract the best talent and really the best urban submarkets where now as you can from the supplement ARE now derives 75% of our annual base ramp from class A assets and AAA locations and we're very proud of this really crowning achievement and coupling that with investment grade client tenants of about 53% of our ABR we feel that we really accomplished something pretty special. ","The demand for our urban campuses have really never been stronger. On the FDA front again increases in the FDA approvals as I've said before have been driven by better understanding of the disease biology and very much improved regulatory process year to date for 2015 there've been 20 approvals and ARE client tenants have garnered 60% of those, again we\u2019re very proud of that. I think one big note on the policy side is that it has some representatives past the 21st Century Cures Act on July 10th now moving to the senate for discussion more likely in September.","A couple of key provisions during that need for increased funding to the NIH and the FBA, which if the bill passes will be very welcomed; improved investment in certain areas of critical science the bill aims at removing barriers to increased research collaboration; it has certain guidance incorporating patient perspective into the drug development process; it also has guidance to ensure the patients can be treated based on their unique characteristics of their disease, so called personalized precision medicine. There is a section on modernized and clinical trials which will be very important, greater use of patient generated registries and biomarkers, the development of certain new medical apps and potential orphan drug exclusivity for rare diseases.","On the technology side machine learning and Big Data have contributed greatly to the intersection of tech and life science. We see continued strong growth in the sharing economy and we\u2019re also pleased to mention that our new client tenants strike, our tenant at 510 Townsend raised the new round of financing value in the Company at approximately $5 billion led by Visa, American Express and Sequoia. And they also announced a new partnership with Visa.","Moving on to the sale of the 70% interest in our 225 Binney. We\u2019re very pleased with a highly respectable cash cap rate. We believe that this was very attractive to a group of high quality institutional investors, it also monetize the core asset. And really evidence significant value creation. We hope it\u2019s meaningful on an NAV data point and it\u2019s certainly importantly raises significant equity type capital to help fund our development pipeline. The yield is reflective of what long term investors are willing to accept. And we won\u2019t speculate about the upside in 13 years, but we believe it\u2019s significant.","The building, as many of you know, is 305,000 square feet in the heart of Kendall Square developed by our Greater Boston team in the Alexandria Center Kendall Square base quarter development and really the strongest life science submarket in the country, a lead goal building, 100% triple net leased Biogen through September 30, 2028 with two five year renewal options at 95% of our market ground. There was a significant pool of interest at buyers, and likely we will continue to look at monetizing select assets and Dean will talk to you about sources and uses in a bit.","We\u2019re very pleased that a sophisticated investor like TIAA paid a low cap rate reflecting the high value they placed on the real estate and the residual value. Notwithstanding there is no chance to increase rents for the next 13 years. I think that recognize the value in Cambridge are more a function of extreme supply constraints, high barriers to entry and limited availability for space for the universe of life science, pharma-biotech and technology from separately want to and need to be Kendall Square versus simply a snapshot at current rent. I think our partner recognized there is minimal releasing risk in a submarket with low single digit vacancy rates and the demand that is currently substantially in excess inventory.","Ironically there is obviously significant upside if Biogen were to vacate early and rents were to go to market. I am sure they took comfort in the dramatic leasing velocity in the Binney Street corridor and our transactions with Sanofi Genzyme, Bristol-Myers Squibb and the long term value of the Binney Street assets and the greater Kendall Square project that we\u2019ve done. Also think that capital values in Kendall Square clearly continued increase. I think our partner\u2019s confidence and the long term value of 225 Binney validates our laser focus on developing and knowing irreplaceable mission critical assets in the top innovation clusters.","The end users are attracted to these markets are really highly discriminating in their location decisions. As you know, their need to hire and retain top talent who want to work in these dynamic submarkets, their need to collaborate on product development, scientific research, drives their real estate decisions unlike financial and professional service firms. For example, who view real estate more as a commodity, the life science and tech companies view their real estate location decisions integral to their operations that makes them somewhat more rent insensitive although they\u2019re clearly very focused and very diligent and willing to pay to be in AAA buildings in top locations with superb owner operators. And we\u2019re in the enviable position of owning that real estate that will experience this exceptional and sustained capital appreciation and rent growth.","Moving on to the internal growth. We hit an all time high for any quarter over 1.9 million square feet of lease; really historic and a great achievement for the Company; 29% came from our Greater Boston, primarily Cambridge operations; 26% from San Diego and 22% from the San Francisco Bay region. Occupancy was down slightly due to two roles Dean talked about; again, same solid same property NOI growth for the quarter and strong margins. On the external growth side, we have an opportunity Dan and his team to acquire 10290 Campus Point Drive immediately adjacent to our current Campus Point project which added 304,000 square feet at a $105 million about $356 per square foot. Qualcomm is in for a short time than it's been entirely released Eli Lilly and want go some redevelopment and Dean can take you through the machinations.","But essentially Lilly ends up netting leasing about 72,000 more square feet from us. Notable leasing achievements in the sub for the quarter 300,000 square feet of 510 Townsend Street as we just mentioned, our 208,000 square foot lease to Bristol-Myers Squibb at 100 Binney and 90,000 square feet to Juno at 400 Dexter. We expect to announce in the not too distant future the completion of a lease to a full building user at 60 Binney and we continue to be well leased, well preleased in a highly visible pipeline that now has visibility into 2016, 2017 and then 2018.","As we mentioned in the sub capital allocation for this year, 45% to Cambridge, 22% to San Diego, 13% to Mission Bay, some 4% to New York and 16% to others. Dean will comment on the balance sheet but we expect to be at 6.9x net debt-to-EBITDA at year end. And on the dividend side with continuing low payout ratio and growing cash flows, we expect the Board to continue dividend increases sharing our increasing cash flows with investors. ","So with that said, let me turn it over to Dean.","Dean Shigenaga","Alright. Thanks Joel. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon everybody. I have got three important topics but really wanted to take a brief moment to express our appreciation for our team for recognition as the 2015 recipient of the NAREIT Gold investor, communication and reporting excellence award. It truly is an honor for the company to receive this award and our team will continue to focus on transparency, quality and efficiency of reporting and communication to the investment community.","I have three topics today. First, I want to cover the continued strong performance from our Class A buildings in AAA locations. Second, provide an update on our solid balance sheet, access to diverse sources of capital and brief comments on key items for the second half of '15. And third, briefly on our disciplined allocation of capital and management of our value creation pipeline.","So kicking it off with our continued strong performance, our strategic focus on unique, collaborative campuses and urban innovation, cluster sub markets continue to drive very strong operating and financial results. We reported FFO per share of $1.31, up 10.1% over the second quarter of 2014. Demand for our Class A assets in AAA locations also continues to drive strong leasing activity. We updated our guidance and increased the midpoint of our range of FFO per share from $5.22 to $5.24. FFO per share growth for 2015 is now greater than 9% representing our second consecutive year of very strong growth above 9%.","We remain on track to reach our occupancy guidance range of 96.9% to 97.4% by year end. However as disclosed over the past couple of quarters, two lease expirations in the second quarter drove a temporary decline in occupancy. One lease was for a 128,000 rentable square feet at 19 Presidential located in the suburbs of Boston and that lease expired at a rate of about $25. And another lease for about 82,000 rentable square feet at 2525 State Highway 54 in Research Triangle Park expired at a rate of about $20. Both of these were single tenant buildings and we are marketing each building for multi tenancy at rental rates equal to or above the expiring rates.","We remain well positioned with high quality buildings and tenancy. Cash same property NOI growth has averaged about 5% over the last 10 years and the midpoint of our guidance is above this average at 6%. This performance is driven primarily from a favorable restructure with 94% of our leases containing annual rent escalations, additionally strong demand for our Class A buildings in AAA locations has driven high leasing volume and pricing power in our key urban cluster sub markets. And for the second consecutive quarter has been the primary driver of the increases in our strong FFO per share guidance for 2015.","Next turning to an update on our solid balance sheet, access to capital and some brief comments for the second half of the year. And first, our balance sheet is very solid with well laddered debt maturities and really limited maturities through 2018. Additionally our balance sheet liquidity is very strong at approximately 1.1 billion.","Turning to sources of capital for 2015. Our guidance has decreased about 90 million at the midpoint to 1.05 billion and really consisted the following. ","12% of our 125 million from net cash provided by operating activities after dividends. 15% or roughly 155 million from a net incremental increase in debt. And 73% or 770 million from asset sales and other sources of capital which I will touch on in a moment.","Included in our net incremental debt for the year is the issuance of 50 million of unsecured notes offsetting this increase and there's a reduction in some projected proceeds from asset dispositions which results in a modest net increase in incremental debt for 2015. I should take a moment to highlight the recent volatility in the debt capital markets. In the month of July over 100 billion of unsecured bonds were issued driven primarily by M&A activity and it seems like the M&A activity will likely to continue and drive new issuance volume in the near term. All in pricing including new issue concessions is higher today versus 90 to maybe 120 days ago.","Given the recent volatility in the debt capital markets we prefer not to speculate on pricing for our future transaction but suffice it to say that guidance can absorb the range of interest rates reflected at recent volatility. More importantly we have significant liquidity on balance sheet and have flexibility to be patient on the timing of the issuance of our unsecured notes. We are also working on two secured construction loans one of which will fund the construction in 2015 for 50 and 60 Binney Street in Cambridge, the other construction loan will provide funding beginning in 2016 for the construction of our unconsolidated JV development for Uber at 1455 and 1515 Third Street in Mission Bay. Both loans are expected to close this year will significantly increase our balance sheet liquidity to over 1.7 billion by year end. And we will disclose the key terms of each loan in the future.","Asset sales are an important component of our sources of capital and we will continue to focus on growth in FFO per share and net asset value while we fund our highly leased value creation projects while also improving our net debt to adjusted EBITDA to less than seven times by year end. Our midpoint of guidance for dispositions and other sources of capital is 770 million and consist of the following. About 550 million or 71% has been identified and is working through various stages. This includes 94 million completed to date, a 190 million under contract related to the sale of a 70% interest at 225, Denny Street, roughly a 4.5% cap rate and about 266 million working through the process. The remainder is about 220 million, as a policy we do not speculate on potential sales that have not been identified but we'll continue to focus on sales of both operating properties and land.","More importantly we will continue to provide disclosure of specific sales when they are identified and classified as held for sale. Additionally as mentioned last quarter our ATM expired in early June and we expect to file a new program. Turning to our allocation of capital and management of our value creation pipeline. Our investment strategy focuses on the allocation of capital and the class A buildings and AAA locations that really should translate into higher long term value for our shareholders. 84% of our capital for 2015 will be allocated primarily to four higher value clusters of markets including Cambridge, Mission Bay, plus SoMa, Manhattan and Tori Pines\/University town center.","We've been very disciplined with our value creation activities, we have a modest size pipeline undergoing construction today. Our value creation pipeline has declined to about 12% with about one half of our pipeline under active construction and the other one half representing near term and future projects. We tend to focus on minimizing our leasing risk over the past five years we have commenced about 4.1 million rentable square feet of ground up developmental projects with about one half of that representing 100 preleased single tenancy projects and the other one half representing multitenancy projects that on average were 36% preleased.","Our value creation projects under active construction today aggregating about 2 million rentable square feet were 71% leased and 17% under negotiation. I think the other key attribute of our discipline is we really are on budget. Of the 4.1 million rentable square feet that commenced over the last five years these projects have been completed or the projects completed today are about 1.9 million of that rentable and have on average been completed under budget with initial cash yield slightly above our estimates at the commencement of these projects. Lastly on guidance and closing comment here, the detailed assumptions underlying our updated guidance for 2015 are included on page three and four of our supplemental package. ","We are really in a unique position with strong demand for a class A assets in urban inundation cluster submarket. Internal growth remains very strong. We have a visible and highly leased multiyear value creation pipeline. We continue to focus our strategy of generating cash growth and cash flows from operating activities, FFO per share and net asset value. We are also focused on increasing our common stock dividends while retaining significant cash flows for investment into highly leased value creation projects. We believe we have the right assets, the right locations and the best roster of client tenants and we remain focused on continuing to build our best in class franchise. With that I'll turn it back to Joel.","Joel Marcus","Thank you very much, so that's our formal comment. Operator, do you want to open it up for Q&A please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll take our first question from Smedes Rose with Citi.","Smedes Rose","I wanted to ask a little more about the San Diego purchase for $105 million. What do you expect to spend to upgrade the facility thinking about Lilly\u2019s new? And how do you think about the stabilized returns there? And then just want to make sure you were far along on the entitlement process for construction at adjacent building, that about to be put on hold now?","Joel Marcus","So let me -- I am going to ask Dan to comment. But we haven\u2019t projected fully construction cost, so Dan is just going to give you rough estimate. Same thing with yields when we develop our full budget, we\u2019ll take them into the supplement but we hope it to be north of 7 broadly, but Dan can comment on the deal.","Dan Ryan","So we expect that we\u2019ll be north of 7 in terms of cash and GAAP on that opportunity. You\u2019re mostly right about the -- so two, there are two components To Lilly; one is we have their existing space in 10300 Campus Point Drive plus we have executed a -- it's actually a built to suit building for them, which would have been adjacent to that 10300 building. So we terminated the built to suit in favor of this new acquisition. And we are reworking, basically reworking the site plan now to consolidate the entitlements into a new building which will be on the 10290 site.","Joel Marcus","And Steve maybe construction of\u2026","Steve Richardson","I guess we\u2019re estimating maybe 300 plus or minus.","Joel Marcus","Yes, exactly.","Steve Richardson","Yes, so it\u2019s about 300 plus or minus on the redevelopment.","Smedes Rose","And then I just want to ask you on 225 Binney, obviously is very attractive cap rate and you mentioned the number of potential buyers there. So could you talk about a little more kind of the range of buyers? I mean were they mostly institutional like TIAA or were they family office as well or foreign sovereign funds or anything on that?","Joel Marcus","Well, we talked to quite a number of people. And I would say there was a large group of very interested buyers including a number of sovereign wealth funds. But because of certain investment restrictions for sovereign funds, as you know, if they were to hold over a majority of an interest creates tax issues for those and it is we finally ended up focusing on domestic high quality institutions that could own greater than 49%. So, it was a great mix and it was mostly high quality institutions and foreign sovereign funds.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Sheila McGrath with Evercore.","Sheila McGrath","On the San Diego acquisition, I was just wondering if you could help us understand how that all slow through. Will it be like an acquisition of 105 million with the Qualcomm lease and then start capitalizing? Or how will that hit the P&L, or just teens?","Dean Shigenaga","You\u2019re correct Sheila, there is a short lease back for about 90 days and then the project I think effective October will enter our redevelopment program and we\u2019ll commence the process of converting that to its assets lab use. So there is a very short lease back period.","Sheila McGrath","And then on 505 Brannan Street, in supplementary you talk about -- it was pretty significant up zoning. And I am just wondering, how long that will take and your confidence level with achieving that zoning, up zoning?","Steve Richardson","Sure, as you saw, phase one is fully entitled that first 135,000 square feet and then the phase two will be part of the adoption of the Central SoMa plan. So we have a number of thought about strategies to lock that down. But ultimately I think it will be a couple of years out before we do lockdown the propM allocation for that property as well.","Sheila McGrath","So, you\u2019ll go forward with just phase one initially?","Steve Richardson","Yes, we will.","Sheila McGrath","And do you think that will be tech or life science?","Steve Richardson","It could be either, and we have strong demand from both sectors.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jamie Feldman","I guess starting out on 225 Binney, are you going to receive a management fee on that 70%? And if so, what\u2019s the percentage rate?","Peter Moglia","Yes, we are going to receive standard property management fees, but we have been asked by our partners not to disclose that percentage, so I am sorry I can\u2019t give that to you.","Jamie Feldman","And then I think you guys had about an $80 million change in investments on the balance sheet to getting flow through earnings. Can you talk about what\u2019s in there?","Joel Marcus","Not Company specific, but you\u2019re correct our unrealized gains are up to almost 140 million. It\u2019s handful companies that more initial invested in when they were private and they\u2019re not publicly traded companies with a significant after market. I think somebody asked the question maybe a year or year and a half ago about what the mark-to-market potential and I conservatively mentioned it was 2x. And so I think you get some sense for the upside in that investment goal. And I think from a P&L perspective we have been realizing some gains but they've been fairly modest time-to-time and that gives us a steady flow of other income. I think what we might consider overtime is selectively monetizing some of that portfolio and reinvesting that capital into our business.","Jamie Feldman","And is any of that in your guidance in terms of source of capital or income or anything?","Joel Marcus","Only from the standpoint of the normal run rate Jamie we typically have 1 million to 2 million of investment gains a quarter typically more like $1 million. So that run rate is in there but anything large we would try to carve out and identify for you. So the answer is no, there is nothing lumpy included in our guidance.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then I guess bigger picture, we've seen a lot of health insurer consolidation over the last month or so. Can you guys talk about what impact do you think that may have on the broader healthcare space and your business potentially?","Joel Marcus","Well I think that chapter is yet to be written. I guess you could draw some analogy as to the airline industry that it's going to be bumpy and you can't always get deeps when you want. So I think that now with the Affordable Care Act having been reconfirmed in a number of specific areas by the Supreme Court I think what will shake out is you will have three or four, it looks like three, but you will have others dominant providers and they will be important in influencing how they insure under the law and under the ACA and obviously important in negotiating with the industry. So but that's yet to play out.","Jamie Feldman","What impact you think it might have on just capital flows to pharmaceuticals, is there a talk of that CapEx?","Joel Marcus","I don\u2019t think so. I think it certainly is as strong as we've ever seen it. If you just look at the M&A activity almost everyday, although a lot of that's in the generic space, certainly you look at the venture side and what's big in the venture side is not only venture but institutional crossover, investors putting large, large sums of capital into companies that are private and that ultimately go public and you see that both in life science and tech and then obviously the IPO market I think remains pretty strong. Remember something else that I think is going to be a huge benefit to this industry and nobody has really talked about it, is there is a bill working its way through Congress and I have a high degree of feeling that it is going to pass and that is a one-time tax Obama is in favor of it on companies that have large foreign cash overseas, a lot of in the tech sector, pharma itself has over $200 billion of cash, significant amount of that is overseas. So if there's a one-time tax or something they are projecting between 14% and 16% that will fund infrastructure in the U.S., that's going to mean that there could be 100 billion plus money flowing back to the U.S. for reinvestment. I think that's going to be a huge boom to this industry.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then just my final question. Good execution on 225 Binney, are you getting more assets you want to put in the market for sale?","Joel Marcus","I think you will see us look at another core asset, there certainly we've been contacted by quite a few people, I wouldn\u2019t say there is alignment or door but there is quite a few people looking and so we're looking at a couple of core assets and then clearly we have a number of non-core assets and land parcels that we're working on. So the answer is yes.","Operator","We will go next to Kevin Tyler with Green Street Advisors.","Kevin Tyler","Hi guys. Policy on the tenant at 225, they've been in the news , stocks selling off 20% plus as drug sales slowed down. Can you comment a bit on the broader state of the market, the biotech market and then some of the read through on such a large company loses that much of its market value overnight?","Joel Marcus","Yes, remember too that, that company has increased its valuation dramatically. I actually did an interview of George Scangos about a year ago at a I think it was an event in San Francisco and I remember asking him what the market cap of Biogen Idec was the name previously when he started and it was $14 billion and asked him what his worry was and he said he thought that market capital is going to go down in negotiating his contract. So you saw it go to north of a 100 billion and they did have a sell off. ","Let me speak to Biogen itself, I think the management team is a great team. George is a highly seasoned professional. Obviously they lowered estimates for their multiple sclerosis franchise and that was not welcoming to the street and obviously significantly cut value and this is by analysts and others the value attributed to their pipeline. One of the really big potential value from that pipeline was their Alzheimer's drug and obviously the drug missed hitting a significant response on key measurements and it also demonstrated I guess some evidence of brain swelling among some limited number of patients but one believes that they still have a good chance of having good phase three results, it's difficult, expensive and risky but that's where they're headed. Anybody who can crack Alzheimer's really will be the beneficiary of just an unending number of patients unfortunately. I think you know you have to look at a lot of the tech and lot of the biotech companies and obviously their price based on their revenues and on their pipeline of products or opportunities and I think when somebody has to bring a little more reality to guidance than they had I think you see a pretty large sell off but I think some of that bounce back and I think the company over time will recover much of that valuation so it still is a very-very well valued company so we aren't worried. ","But I think you know in any industry that has, mean look what happened to Google on the Plus side, their CFO came in and announced some really disciplined approach to cost cutting and the stock just popped dramatically. So that's the marketplace.","Kevin Tyler","Okay, I appreciate that. In terms of, Dean this one might be for you, in terms of the acquisition guidance for the year I think you brought it down 50 million this quarter versus last quarter. Just wondering what might have driven that move, was it a capital allocation decision or was there something else driving it.","Dean Shigenaga","There's some details on page three of our supplemental package for reference but in short we had one transaction including our guidance last quarter, was about a $135 million transaction and really at the seller's request timing has been moved back to the first quarter of '16, so that transaction's still there, it's just not part of 2015 anymore. Offsetting that reduction of a 135 was the purchase of the Campus Point building.","Operator","We'll go next to Mike Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.","Mike Carroll","Can you guys describe what you've planned for 10300 Campus Point, when Eli Lilly decides to vacate, well, when they vacate to go to 10290.","Joel Marcus","I'll ask Dan to comment.","Dan Ryan","Hi, this is Dan again. We feel really good about the prospects of backfilling that. It's a barely, it's a very highly built out lab office space that really was in, they spent a significant amount of their own capital that we will be the net beneficiaries for . We are currently in paperwork with four plus tenants already. This is going to be some of our best phase in the portfolio. So we generally expect a significant you know 15% plus or minus increase in current rent at the release. We feel the downtime will be very short given where we are with current discussion and fairly modest amount of capital to get there.","Joel Marcus","I should clarify that lease is about a 125,000 square feet and the contractual expiration is in the fourth quarter of '16.","Mike Carroll","Okay then how your discussions I guess progressing with the city on the north tower land site option are those just a formality and that site is going to be yours.","Joel Marcus","Well, I don't know that anything's ever a formality but we do have a legal option that lasts for 17 years so I feel good about that but we are in deep discussions we had several meetings with the city this week, we have a discussion going-on on increasing the FAR and how that might work and so that's where we are but we expect you know a resolution to that and some decision this year maybe within the next quarter or so. So that's moving along pretty intensively.","Operator","We'll go next to Ross Nussbaum with UBS.","Ross Nussbaum","Can we talk a little bit more about page four in your supplemental, I just want a little more clarity on the asset sales that you're targeting through the end of the year. I guess the first question is, where are you processalized with 500 Forbes in South San Francisco, I know that was listed last quarter in the south as well, is that, where are you in terms of getting that thing professionally.","Joel Marcus","So, let me comment briefly and then Steve can add some comments. The, everything in the category of pending and targeted, the only transaction that is under contract today is 225 Binney which you're well aware of, everything else is not at that stage yet but moving through various areas I don't know if Steve wants to comment anything further.","Steve Richardson","Hi Ross, it\u2019s Steve Richardson. Yes we've fully engaged the marketing team now. We've got packages out, we've been touring prospective buyers through the property so we're in the early innings of the overall marketing process. We'll keep you updated as time moves along.","Joel Marcus","And then somebody asked before Ross about would with our success at 225 Binney would we look at another core asset sale and the answer is yes, we're in active, we're active on another core asset potentially so that, stay tuned on that. The 240,000 square feet with $8.2 million of NOI that get identified as other, what exactly is that?","Dan Ryan","We\u2019re not prepared to provide more color on what we have. But let me just say that we have a number of assets that we\u2019ve targeted that could allow us to achieve our targeted dispositions. So we have flexibility in what we execute there, and we have a number of projects where our operating assets were looking at.","Ross Nussbaum","And how does that other category defer from what you been laid out is projected remainder\/asset sales, that additional $195 million $245 million, that stuff that\u2019s not on the market yet. I am trying to understand the new launch there.","Dan Ryan","Yes, the stuff that\u2019s not quite as advanced as what totals up to roughly the midpoint of $550 million which includes the pending and targeted. So we have a little bit of work her to quickly resolve over the next few months. And we expect to be in a position to give you better color on this entire targeted disposition here for \u201915.","Joel Marcus","And one asset in that other for example is a important project that we have gone to the tenants who has expressed interest in potentially acquiring it, so we have a discussion there. But we also are working on a sale package, so these are all not just imaging that we\u2019re going to sell something, but these are actually pretty active and trying to move them to an active sale position.","Ross Nussbaum","And then my last question is really around the last footnote on that page, and you guys have made a pretty hefty profit being biotech investors over the past few years. What\u2019s preventing you from, just from a risk standpoint given the massive run up in biotech stocks in the last four-five years? Why not take pretty hefty profits sell down a lot of those positions rather than, I don\u2019t want to guess that we\u2019re gamble. But gamble those on biotech continuing to run up.","Joel Marcus","I am going to let Dean answer that he did addressed it in a previous question to some extent. But I think to some extent we have taken some. There are a number of companies there that have achieved pretty nice valuation. So you have to remember too, these are -- a number of them are development stage companies. And to the extent they turn out to be future Amgen\u2019s, Biogen\u2019s, Celgene\u2019s and so forth, the upside is even far greater than one can imagine with the realization of that pipeline. But we get your question, so Dean can answer it.","Dean Shigenaga","It\u2019s a balance there at the end of the day part of our focus over the next four quarters will be looking to monetize components of that so we can reinvest the capital. So we are looking at that. Couple of them recently had their Initial Public Offerings, so it\u2019s a bit of lock up period as well they can see.","Joel Marcus","But we do see that as the source for our development pipeline as we needed.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Dave Rodgers with Baird.","Dave Rodgers","Maybe just a broader question on the development pipeline, I think Dean mentioned that the value creation pipeline has come down and the size of the Company overall. But how do you envision that going forward? As you move into \u201916, are there sufficient projects and span that you\u2019ll be able to kind of keep that pipeline at a fairly large level, or do you see it coming down before you can kind of get entitlements and everything ready for another round?","Dean Shigenaga","Well, I think....Yes, go ahead.","Joel Marcus","I was going to say Mike there is two things to consider, our active projects under construction today are highly leased and are going to be delivered over the next number of quarters. Page two of our press release highlighted as well as page 30 or so in our supplemental 32, highlights the rough time line of near term projects. But the stuff that we\u2019re going to commence in the second half of \u201915 that fits in the near term pipeline today, 1.1 million square feet is 80% leased and 20% under negotiation.","So we do have very good visibility into really high quality developments that will generate EBITDA and cash flows going out into basically \u201916, \u201917 and \u201918, in that time frame. So you got this visibility from a siding perspective. The overall value creation pipeline might grow and dollar value temporarily but it will sell back down as we deliver a number of projects call it over the next six quarters.","Dave Rodgers","And then I guess with regard to and maybe more acquisition of redevelopment assets to get product to market little bit faster. Should we expect as you move late into this year, or maybe even early in the next year, that you start looking at a greater number of acquisitions to bring that product in line faster, or are you pretty happy just going ground up development and those discussions that you\u2019re having?","Joel Marcus","Well, I don\u2019t think we have to, I think you get great value. If you just look at the pipeline that\u2019s being articulated and you look at the page 22 spreadsheet, it\u2019s pretty robust. There are too many people out there that have control on their balance sheet of future value creation and future cash flowing assets out 2016, 2017, 2018, and then overtime maybe beyond. And we only look at the acquisition market really opportunistically, we underwrite everything but look at it pretty carefully. And a lot of times you don\u2019t even see things coming up like the Qualcomm deal, if you were to look at that a year ago or six months ago, you don\u2019t even know some of these things happen. So we're not so focused on acquisitions. I don\u2019t think we need to do that as a elevated for this, the company as a mainstay. But we clearly look at it as a way to build our franchise where it makes sense and where we have great in-sale sites or projects.","Dave Rodgers","Obviously a lot of asset sales in the pipeline and that's the primary source of funding for new development. The equity is still off the table and not something that you are considering for this year and early next year?","Joel Marcus","Well as I think we've said before, it's our lowest priority as far as funding. And so we think that free cash flow obviously that, that we can generate by bringing on additional cash flow and then obviously asset sales, land sales are our primary focus.","Operator","We will go next to Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.","Rich Anderson","Thanks. Good afternoon. Is it correct that the original discussion with 225 Binney was 80% not 70% of the value of the asset?","Joel Marcus","Yes, I don\u2019t know that we had, we talked to a pretty broad range of people running from 49% to 100% depending upon what people we're thinking and then we came upon what we felt was appropriate for our continuing interest and the partner's long-term interest. So that's how we felt about it.","Rich Anderson","Okay. So definitely.","Dean Shigenaga","Richard it's Dean here. I would only add one other comment. I think our guidance last quarter gave a range from 70% to 90% \u2026","Rich Anderson","Okay.","Dean Shigenaga","\u2026 when we were airing down the terms of the deal.","Rich Anderson","That's fair. Very, very thank you. And as far as TIAA's perspective, what it is for them in your mind besides obviously high valuable asset until 2028 there is nothing going to happen on their 4.5% return. So is that purely just, they are just a believer in Cambridge for the long-term, is that where their mind is do you think?","Joel Marcus","Well, I think in my introductory comments I spend actually quite a bit of time going through how I think they look at it and institutional investors looked at I won't go and repeat that at the moment but I think the investors we have talked to and they are quite a few certainly well more than a dozen, had a very, very positive and strong view of that market and wanted to have a strong foothold in a AAA location in a Class A building with a great tenant. I think that's where institutional money is certainly part of it is focused today.","Rich Anderson","My, I apologize I missed the beginning of your call. So pardon.","Joel Marcus","It's okay, okay.","Rich Anderson","Okay. And.","Peter Moglia","It's Peter Moglia, I just wanted to add one other very important factor that drove TIAA do this transaction which was they wanted to do something with Alexandria, I mean they work with the best operators in the best locations and they identified us as that and that was a very important aspect of this transaction for them. So we are very proud of that and we think that their brand and their acumen in examining our real estate and us is a great testament to our quality.","Rich Anderson","I guess the question I was having was is this is going to be reoccurring relationship going forward with them?","Peter Moglia","Very well could be.","Rich Anderson","Okay. Regarding the investments in companies and Dean you spoke about. Is there any situation where you are both an investor and a landlord?","Dean Shigenaga","There are I would say the investments probably 80% are non-tenant investments and probably 20% or so are that are fair number.","Joel Marcus","That's correct, in that range.","Rich Anderson","Is there any kind of restrictions about selling or buying stock if you are also, have business as a landlord tenant, I don\u2019t know if you would be?","Joel Marcus","Not regulatory but I can tell you internally we ensure that we look at these transactions separately. In other words the lease is a separate transaction and if we decide to invest we handle that separately from that decision to lease space.","Rich Anderson","Okay. And then last question. Joel you I think you referenced 20 FDA approval so far in 2015 I got that much detail at the beginning of the call. But is it true also that not many in the way blockbusters in terms of profitability of those drugs, is that, would you say that that's a fair statement relative to previous years? And maybe just some color around the profitability as opposed to just the straight on approvals of the drugs?","Joel Marcus","No I don\u2019t think that's true, I think you're also seeing a new class of cholesterol lowering drugs which are likely to be kind of new era blockbusters, clearly some of the cancer drugs will be I think it remains to be seen if any of the CNS drugs get approval and become, they likely would become but that's something that remains to be seen. But now I think that the drugs that are being approved today, you have to remember too we're also in an era of as I said precision medicine, so a lot of drugs that are being approved are for various targeted rare and often diseased patient population, patients that you know haven't been able, haven't been responsive to mainline therapy so you see some of that so don't assume they're not profitable but you can assume that they're more niche drugs and that's a matter of just better biology and better science and better regulatory science as I was saying earlier. You know you do have some pretty big blockbusters like you know the Hep C curance of all the and others so this is the new generation of drugs I think is a very great set of promising opportunities so we view it as pretty highly positive.","Operator","We'll go next to Jim Sullivan with Cowen Group.","Jim Sullivan","Thank you, good afternoon. Joel I'm curious with the benchmark pricing here 225 Binney and continuing discussions in some other assets and some other markets. I wonder if you could give us kind of a handle if you will on how we should think about cap rates in Cambridge versus cap rates for the rest of the portfolio and particularly I'm thinking about New York City and San Francisco, San Francisco generally and to what extent we should expect differential cap rates, higher lower in either of those markets and then also if you could touch on to what extent kind of the ratio of general office space to lab space might impact the cap rates.","Joel Marcus","So maybe take it one by one, so I think in, and Tom hearing can come in on that Cambridge cap rate beyond 225, but I think it's fair to say that we see continuing cap rate compression in that market, I think it's true. We may end up selling one or more assets in the San Francisco Bay Area that I think will bring I think good cap rate data to the table as well and so I think you're going to see again some cap rate compression in that market certainly vis a vis your assets. New York City we don't plan to sell the New York Center but I think Peter reported back a quarter or two ago I think FL Green sold an asset or bought an asset I can't remember not too far from our estate and it was on a long term ground lease I think at a\u2026","There was a seven cap rate, actually we talked about that at Investor Day. It seems like New York is probably the only major market that from first quarter to second quarter had a small uptick in their cap rate according to Corpax but all our other markets actually they stayed stable or even dropped. One thing that I really noted to Joel before this call when I was doing some researches that since the suburban Maryland market actually had a 22 basis point decrease in cap rate so found that to be very encouraging considering we do have holdings there but overall I think cap rate Jim are going to remain stable. You know the tenure has gone up about 25 basis points from the last quarter, there's still about a, close to a 400 basis point slack between the historical cap rate and the margin it usually has with the tenure, so if it goes up if interest rates go up even more I don't think it's really going to affect cap rates until maybe it starts to go up by a 100 basis points or so, I think we're going to have a long run of continued stabilization maybe even some more compression as the sovereign funds continue to pour money into these markets that we're in and as Joel alluded to we had a quite a number of investors looking at 225 Binney, I think we'll have quite a number of investors looking at the next project we have, so overall I think to answer your question I think the Cambridge cap rate that you saw was very healthy I would expect that assets of that quality will continue to trade at that level and I think we're probably looking at least another 12 months of stable cap rates and then we'll see how external factors affect that.","Dean Shigenaga","I would say also Jim in thinking about our asset base as I mentioned actually in the second page of the supplement before the press release we start to try to highlight what we think are the important best in class office REIT attributes that we have and then highlighting 75% of our ABR now comes from these class A assets and AAA locations with the 53% of ABR from investment rate tenants so I got to believe that as people look at NEB and look at cap rates with respect to our asset base they'll take note and I think adjust them appropriately down. I think on the office lab side, not sure I can comment. Tom can maybe give you some color in Cambridge or in cap rate office versus lab.","Peter Moglia","I think there's not been comparable prices covering Cambridge and I think that maybe the -- versus one of the ACP trade, but that -- for city interest that University part. But that had a lot of leases of their durations, building that were certainly older. I think the average age is 19 years old or something like that, and not quite the Class A new assets that are prevalent to Kendall Square.","Tom Andrews","It was also a minority non-controlling interest as well, so that certainly could have discounted the price. So I think\u2026","Jim Sullivan","Okay, and then finally from me. Can you give us an update in terms of the demand for space in Cambridge, and what impact that\u2019s having on market rents? And maybe if you kind of relate that to your Cambridge portfolio, your 100 owned portfolio. How you feel about where those rents are versus the market?","Tom Andrews","Yes, Jim. So we\u2019re observing obviously the very tight market conditions that are Cambridge right now. We have active negotiations underway and proposals going out for the balance of our space at -- and let me clarify, we have proposals going after the balance of our space. The 100 Binney as you know we committed about half of that building to -- leased about half of that building to Bristol-Myers Squibb.","We are seeing significant upward movement and we\u2019re including our sales pretty aggressively increasing rent close to perspective tenants due to the scarcity of available space in the market and the number -- I think quantity, quantity of perspective tenants there in the market.","Peter Moglia","And Jim this is Peter Moglia, one other thing I wanted to ground out is as Tom mentioned rents have been continuing to increase in Boston, rents are continuing to increase in San Francisco they\u2019re continuing to increase in San Diego. We\u2019re even seeing it in Seattle as well for life science space, and that\u2019s just going to continue to put pressure on cap rates, so I guess kind of round up your original question.","Joel Marcus","So on Cambridge just to get back to one number, I think you could see something between 12% and 15% mark to market there this year.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Smedes Rose with Citi.","Smedes Rose","Dean just want to come back to the investment side, can you basically tell us the largest, not by name on who it is but by dollars, the largest public holding that you have of that $173 million. What does the single largest position amount to? And the on the private side, about $190 million or so, what would be the concentration in the largest investment there?","Dean Shigenaga","There is probably -- we don\u2019t have that information instantly handy. But I would say there is probably about half of dozen companies that make up the majority of that, a good portion of that mark to market Michael.","Smedes Rose","For the 140 million of mark to market that\u2019s about six companies you\u2019re saying?","Dean Shigenaga","Yes, about half of dozen that make up a good majority of that.","Smedes Rose","And how widespread is the $190 million of that, like 30 investments or 10 investments?","Dean Shigenaga","Well, it\u2019s pretty widespread.","Smedes Rose","So it\u2019s a lot?","Dean Shigenaga","Yes.","Smedes Rose","And then the increasing in terms of -- it looks like I guess some companies done public in the first quarter where effectively your available for sale cost downs have moved up from $22 million to $34 million, which stayed flat in the second quarter. So the big move in unrealized gains sequentially was just from the companies that have done public in the first quarter seeing in their stocks move up 50%-60%?","Dean Shigenaga","Yes, the big increase had a lot to do with IPOs in the current quarter.","Smedes Rose","But your cost base has stayed at $34 million. So I would have thought you would have had seen more transfer out of five bucket into the public, if they\u2019ve done public in the second quarter?","Dean Shigenaga","Michael, our cost bases on these investments are really-really small.","Smedes Rose","Really on the public securities?","Dean Shigenaga","Yes, on the public securities. Yes, we probably had I think page four footnote five gives you a sense I think we\u2019re -- of the $172 million or $173 million, $140 of it roughly was unrealized gains in the public securities.","Smedes Rose","And last quarter that was $83 million. And so I was just trying to figure out if you moved up sequentially $55 million, how much of that was stock just going up from the first quarter versus companies that went public is the cost base of the investments stayed flat?","Dean Shigenaga","The majority of it relates to two investments that went public during the second quarter, that drove the majority of the increase in unrealized gains.","Smedes Rose","And then as we think about this disposition of $195 million to $245 million, the projected asset sales have securities effectively versus hard assets versus land, because all of them have different sort of embedded cost to Alexandria?","Dean Shigenaga","Yes. We are not prepared to get into that specific number right now, Michael. It is a component that you will see us reinvest over, call it the next four quarters or so. Just to give you an example, in July alone I think we monetized a little bit of our balance but it's relatively small in scale of the unrealized gains. So we are focused on it and you will see us get to it overtime.","Smedes Rose","But most of the stuff is in progress, so it is 200 million to 245 million of other asset, remainder of asset sale? ","Dean Shigenaga","No, we commented earlier Michael that the stuff that's more advanced is included in the category right above that. I am turning to the page right now. So the category that's pending in targeted asset sales 225 Binney is under P&S as you know, the rest of the transactions in that balance in the disclosure is at various stages not at the P&S level yet but actively moving through the transaction process. And we have a number, so for, it's 220 at the midpoint that we're working on at much earlier stages. But we feel pretty comfortable with what we have to execute here. Again there is good interest in our core assets along with Joel mentioned we have a tenant interest in a specific asset. So we've got good activity going on right now.","Operator","It appears there are no further questions at this time. So I'd turn the call back over to Joel Marcus for any additional or closing remarks.","Joel Marcus","I just want to thank everybody for joining our second quarter call and we will talk to you on the third quarter. Thanks again very much for your time.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation."],"1413":["Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.

My name is Cathy, and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now like to turn the conference over to Rhonda Chiger. Ms. Chiger, you may begin.","Rhonda Chiger","Thank you and good afternoon. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.","Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company\u2019s Form 10-K, annual report and other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Joel Marcus. Please go ahead.","Joel Marcus","Thanks, Rhonda. And welcome everybody to Alexandria\u2019s third quarter \u201813 conference call. With me today are Dean; Peter; Steve; Marc and Andres. We\u2019ll continue we hope a somewhat shortened format to leave adequate time for Q&A. I think management\u2019s quick take of the quarter is that we are very pleased with an all around solid third quarter by our entire Alexandria team.","Let me comment a little bit about the biopharmaceutical industry. As you know one of the nation\u2019s most dynamic innovation and business ecosystem built upon robust foundation of company, academia and clinical that performance supported then by medical and technological R&D and really act as a funnel and distribution engine for getting life saving and quality of life improving therapeutics to the marketplace.","The sector provide significant R&D north of about $65 billion, yielding new treatments and potential cures and things that actually may prevent the onset of disease and ultimately reduce the socioeconomic cost and burden of society as whole.","And accomplishing the mission of bringing these treatments to patients, the sector has really sustained a large scale supply chain ecosystem both in R&D and support, production, distribution, et cetera.","The value chain continues to evolve, shaped by technological advances that open up opportunities to really new goods and services, including the areas of molecular diagnostics and medical informatics we talked about that before.","The sector contributes supports about 3 -- directly and indirectly about 3.4 million U.S. jobs and generates about almost $90 billion of take home income and it has compensation twice the private sector average in the U.S., which is pretty amazing.","The industry accounts for almost $800 billion in economic output, almost 3% of total U.S. output. And the economic impact comprises about $375 billion in direct business and over $400 billion in indirect, and also about $40 billion government taxes. So it\u2019s a pretty sizable industry and one that has incredibly important impact given the advent of Obamacare, we may talk about that in the future calls.","Moving to operations and internal growth, our number one tenant, we\u2019re pleased. Novartis has continued its global expansion by taking full building in Research Triangle Park and Steve will have more to say on the leasing side.","And I am pleased to say that the first in the 16-year history of ARE as a public company now over half our ABR is generated from investment grade tenants, that\u2019s significant milestone.","We had a very strong leasing quarter with 830,000 square feet and solid cash and GAAP increases and we\u2019ve only get about 297,000 square feet of rolls left in the fourth quarter, very manageable.","We continue same solid, same property performance, Dean will comment on, as we continue to enjoy increases in both rental rates and occupancy across most of our cluster submarkets, margins are holding steady and solid about 70%, and we are comfortable reiterating our internal growth guidance as Dean will highlight in a couple of minutes.","Moving to external growth, solid set of deliveries out of redevelopment in the third quarter, including San Francisco, Massachusetts, Maryland and Seattle averaging about 83% occupied. This leaves our Genomatica project in San Diego was the only domestic active redevelopment, but we are teeing up some for value creation addition into the pipeline.","I think the big news for the quarter on the delivery side was our first Binney Street quarter flagship facility delivered to Biogen Idec 305,000 squarer feet on time and on budget with very solid yields and as Dean will highlight our non-income producing assets as percentage of GAV dropped below 20% as we have predicted.","A couple of quick updates on development project, Steve, will talk 499 Illinois and the 269 East Grand. On the -- our New York project, the Alexandria Center for Life Science were 48% leased to date with two credit tenant and we are negotiating final agreements for about 20% more with the variety of users for approximately 84,000 square feet and we believe these are highly probably to close in the fourth quarter, bringing our total expected leasing to about 68% by the end of December, when we delivered row space again a very solid yield for New York City.","Our Longwood joint venture, we are negotiating additional space requirements approximating about 90 additional, 90% or 79,000 square feet, which would bring occupancy to about 68%. We are seeing nice resurgence in the integrated clinical sector over there.","Moving to 75\/125 Binney, a lot of attention has been given to that. To remind people, lease does not give Ariad any termination right or downsizing rights. Ariad has stated that they intend to occupy the premises but we are comfortable that we can satisfactorily address all of eventualities and we will be aggressive in managing this matter.","Over the next two to three months, Ariad will modify their space plan and program needs to reflect the revise business and financial strategy, which they intent to announce on November 6th and they are also updating their New England Journal of Medicine, details about the trial on November 7th.","If Ariad does sublease portion of their premises, the project can easily accommodate multi-tenant lab or office configurations, base building construction is full speed ahead, steel will be topped off next week and base building is schedule be weather tight in April.","The design of the tenant improvement is pause pending completion of Ariad\u2019s revised program. IT construction has not commenced at this time, we continue to project that the base building completion and rent commencement will be achieved in the first quarter of \u201915. Steve will have more to say about demand in Cambridge.","On the balance sheet side, land sells, we\u2019ve revised down about $75 million to $100 million from our original estimate at the beginning of 2013, but we hope to capture much of this in 2014. On the dividend the Board policy is to continue to share increasing cash flows with investors as we still have a low dividend payout ratio of about 65%.","Let me move to Peter Moglia, a couple of highlights on transactional side.","Peter Moglia","Sure. Thanks, Joel. There were two notable trades from other investors in the third quarter I\u2019d like to highlight. The Heights at Del Mar, a 219,000 square foot office, lab building, two building campus which is located in the Del Mar Height submarket of San Diego was sold by Prudential for $126,350,000.","The property anchored by Neurocrine Biosciences is also included an 89,000 square foot developed pad. So we estimate the cap rate to be 6.3% and the price per square foot of the improvements to be about $547.","So, although, we were admires of this real estate and intimately knowledgeable of the project that it was Veralliance redevelopment, we chose not to pursue this investment based on the pricing and the nature of the tenant.","Also 320 Charles Street in Cambridge traded for $52 million or $523 per square foot. The property is currently occupied by the Broad Institute, but will become vacant when Broad moves to their new 250,000 square foot building at Cambridge Center in the middle of next. We decline to pursue this opportunity based on the pricing expectations for this 1940s vintage building.","So, with that, I\u2019ll pass it over to Steve.","Steve Richardson","Thank you, Peter. And I\u2019ll start with a quick overview and then touch on specific leasing items and finish up with couple of key trends of interest. So, overall, the Alexandria's life science cluster markets are very healthy. As we\u2019ve been discussing, the Biotech Index has hit all time highs, liquidity is very strong with 42 IPOs to date raising nearly $3 billion, as well as large and small M&A activity, all driven by genuine clinical results.","Alexandria is fully integrated regional teams lease to total of 829,533 square feet and 57 leases during this past quarter at our outstanding assets, driving occupancy gains of our North American operating portfolio did 95%, up 40 bps from last quarter.","Also noteworthy is the occupancy rate of 94.5% when including the company\u2019s redevelopment set of facilities, a clear indication of our ability to attract and retain the highest quality client tenants.","Cash and GAAP quarterly leasing spreads increased by 4.1% and 16.5%, respectively with the major drivers not only including activity in Cambridge, Torrey Pines in New York but also the Greater DC market in South San Francisco.","Finally, as Joel touched on the redevelopment and development pipeline, continues to make steady progress with 228,000 plus square feet leased this quarter and specifically increasing the lease and negotiating percentages to 68% at our New York facility, up from 56% last quarter and now 82% at 499 Illinois, up from 73% last quarter.","To touch on the markets, specifically demand in Cambridge in the inner suburbs was very strong with 11 different life science tenants leasing space in the 5 to 15,000 square feet range in the mid to high 50s triple net. We are tracking approximately 1.6 million square feet of demand in this market, split roughly in half between life science and tech users, so obviously a very, very dynamic and robust market.","The Greater DC market appears to have hits its trough and is rebounding, as we lease 203,000 square feet, highlighted by a 42,000 square feet lease to an important institute at a 3% in cash increase in a $32 triple net range and the market outlook has been further improved by our recently announced extension of an existing lease and a new long-term lease, totaling 135,000 square feet in the aggregate with the NIH at 9800 Medical Center Drive.","Also, the Mission Bay market has tightened significantly, as UCSF leased 30,000 square feet on the sixth floor at 499 Illinois, while a high-quality public biotech company recently signed a lease for the entire fifth floor, comprising 43,680 square feet at the start of the fourth quarter. We have only 8,000 square feet on the first floor and 28,000 square feet on the second floor at 499 and are in active discussions for all of the remaining space with a number of tenants.","Also, the South San Francisco submarket, the Bay area that continues to improve as we are nearly fully leased in the submarket after executing a lease for approximately 19,000 square feet with one of our second cohort companies in the mid 30s triple net range.","Rounding out the clusters, RTP highlights include the 40,000 square foot lease with Novartis that Joel had mentioned, San Diego with a 25,000 square feet lease with a very promising public life science company in the mid 30s triple net and the Seattle market consummated lease with a 17,000 square feet tech tenant given the AAA location at 1551 Eastlake in the South Lake Union tech and life science corridor.","Couple of key trends to really highlight here are the emerging company expansion formation is in full swing in Cambridge, San Francisco and San Diego. A recent Barron's article detailing the success of Third Rock Ventures portfolio companies, as well as a recent liquidity event for venture firms, venBio and Novo, of an acquisition of a San Diego biotech company, all are contributing to the creation of another platform for demand coming from the life science sector during the next one, two and three years.","And also notable to consider the imperative for these life science companies to remain committed to and expand their mission-critical facilities was clearly evident as noted and the lease is consummated in the DC and RTP area. It\u2019s both a strategic and operational necessity and this positively impacts our franchise.","Finally with the Seattle market\u2019s ability to capture demand from the tech sector, this is continuing the trend that was started earlier in the year in the San Francisco Bay Area and positively highlights the desirability of our AAA locations in these key brain trust location clusters and supports rental growth, along with our dominant life science client tenant base.","With that, I'll hand it over to Dean.","Dean Shigenaga","Thanks, Steve. Same property performance for the year of 2013 is solidly on track for our target of about 5% to 7% on a cash basis and up 1% to 3% on a GAAP basis. Cash-same property performance of 6.5% for year to date \u201813 was driven primarily by contractual annual increases in rent, lease up of temporary vacancy in the first half of \u201912, specifically in Cambridge at 790 Memorial and 300 Technology Square and rent commencement for Illumina in San Diego in October of 2012.","We completed 461,000 rentable square feet of development and redevelopment projects. These are detailed on Page 26 of our supplemental package, including disclosure of NOI contribution for the second quarter, third quarter and fourth-quarter for your models. On average, our initial stabilized yields on a cash and GAAP basis are up 20 basis points and 10 basis points respectively and our average cash yields are up 10 basis points over our prior disclosures.","Debt to adjusted EBITDA was 6.8 times and fixed charge coverage ratio was about 2.8 times and by year-end we're projecting improvement in leverage of approximately 6.5 times and our fixed charge coverage ratio of about 3 times.","Non-income-producing assets drop to 19% of gross real estate, down from 23% at the beginning of the year. Outstanding debt under our bank facilities were reduced by over $800 million, or approximately 42% since the beginning of the year.","In addition to the $55 million of land under contract for sale, it started to close in December of \u201913. We also have $30 million of additional land sales under negotiations that are targeted to close in 2014. The largest sale was approximately $20 million to residential developer in Seattle. As Joel mentioned, we expect to continue to identify additional land parcels for sale in 2014.","Our unhedged variable rate debt was 10% as of 9\/30 and we anticipate executing additional interest rate swaps or caps in the fourth quarter to mitigate a portion of our future unhedged borrowings.","We updated our EPS guidance on a diluted basis to a range of $0.54 to a $0.58. We also narrowed our range of guidance for FFO per share as adjusted for 2013 to a range from $4.38 to $4.42, with no change in the midpoint of our guidance.","Detailed guidance assumptions for 2013 are included on Page 4 of our earnings release. Our guidance this year includes our FFO per share target of a $1.16 for the fourth quarter of 13, representing a $0.10 per share growth over the third quarter of \u201813, driven primarily by the following.","The third quarter of \u201813 development and redevelopment deliveries, net of the impact of capped interest is highlighted on Page 26 and that shows the NOI ramp quarter-to-quarter on an FFO basis that\u2019s driving about $0.05 of the growth going from the third quarter to the fourth quarter.","We also have some fourth quarter deliveries that are scheduled late mid-December on the West Tower spaces and 4757 Nexus, that\u2019s going to drive about $0.01 of FFO per share, the acquisition is about $0.01. We had some early leased extensions at 455 Mission Bay Boulevard South, driving about $0.05, some other items of about a penny and then lastly the repayment of about $100 million of our term loan in the quarter with outstanding cash or cash we had on the balance sheet.","Percentage rent at tax recorded in the fourth quarter, primarily from parking and the lease up and delivery of space ahead of plan at 951 Gateway drove about a $0.015, so that\u2019s about a $0.10 aggregate growth as we go into the fourth quarter.","With that, I will turn it over to Joel.","Joel Marcus","So, operator, we are ready for questions if we could, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instruction) And our first question will come from Gabe Hilmoe of UBS.","Gabe Hilmoe - UBS","Hi. Joel, just on 75\/125 Binney and the potential increase to the cost basis in relation to Ariad\u2019s expansion against the TI\u2019s, just so I understand none of the proposed cost for TI\u2019s associated with that expansion. That would bring up the basis, the projects had been spent or planned to be spent at this time. Is that correct?","Dean Shigenaga","That\u2019s correct, Gabe. It\u2019s Dean here. We\u2019re still working on the core and sell and none of the interior improvements have started yet.","Gabe Hilmoe - UBS","Okay. And I guess, following up on that, is there anything within the base design that is specific or unique to Ariad using the space. I guess, at this point in time why even consider a design change with an increased cost. The ultimate tenant is somewhat of an unknown at this point?","Joel Marcus","Yes. The answer is no.","Gabe Hilmoe - UBS","Okay. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jamie Feldman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. I guess, just sticking with Ariad and 75\/125 Binney. Can you just talk a little bit more about what happened with Ariad and how we should be thinking about the similar risk and risk to your portfolio or lack of risk?","Joel Marcus","Well, I think if you think about what we just said or what I said in the opening remarks, 50% of our annual base rent is from investment grade tenants. I\u2019m not sure how many REITs out there have that kind of credit in their portfolio especially in our world, in the biotech and pharma industry but just broadly across even the office -- the office guys. It\u2019s such a -- over tech guys. I think it\u2019s pretty extraordinary.","I don\u2019t see any big credit risk at all. Certainly, the -- if you take what Steve said, this has been over the past year and half, the best of times in the biotech and pharma industry. There are some exceptions by companies but industry wise, this has been the best time since really the hay day of the Internet when biotech also reached to peak back in \u201899, 2000, 2001.","I think if you look at Ariad, biotech is a tough business in general of producing, inventing and then going through the development stage and then ultimately producing medicines for the commercial application. And I would say if you look at almost any number of the top-tier biotechs, virtually all of them have been on the brink at one time or another.","I think Tom Andrews reminded me the other day that Ariad\u2019s situation with safety post marketing reminded us of Biogen in the mid 2000s with Tysabri when they were approved in \u201804, pulled from the market in \u201805, put back on the market in \u201806 and had sales approaching $1 billion in 2012.","My own view on Ariad is that the jury is still out. The story is still to be written. I think if you look at the deep science behind it, it's pretty clear that this product has an impressive scientific feet because it is not only able to hit the CML and the so-called gatekeeper mutations but it could be effective in a range of other potentially even more important cancers including things like GI Cancer, thyroid cancer, lung cancers, which actually have a much, much larger potential.","So I think the drop of 75%, 80% in their stock that\u2019s happened on a number of occasions to a number of the big guys today. I think it determine -- it will be determined over the coming weeks, months and over a period of time, over the next year or two to see what the ultimate story is. But we are ready for all eventualities.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then, can you also talk about your uncovered expirations, you give a lot of color on what renewal we do next year but just talk about some of the largest leases that may move out or you just haven\u2019t settled yet?","Joel Marcus","Are we talking about 2014?","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. 2014.","Peter Moglia","Yes. Fortunately, Jamie, 2014 only has a handful of leases on, I think there is two leases that are north of 60,000 square feet and their range are 60,000 to 70,000 square feet. One space, currently have subtenancy unit that will likely extend in that property. On the other space, we clearly expect a renewal on it. So again, the two largest roles for \u201814 are in the 60,000 square foot range.","Joel Marcus","And the total rolling about a million square feet is 7.4% of the portfolio. It\u2019s actually well below the average we had. So we feel pretty good about that.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then finally, what do you think your mark-to-market is on 2014 roll?","Joel Marcus","I think we\u2019ll talk more specifically on our Investor Day in December but very broad strokes, Jamie, I\u2019d say directionally, relatively in line with our overall performance on leasing or at least our goals for leasing this year.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","You mean leasing the spread similar to 2014?","Joel Marcus","Yes. The mark-to-market, yes, on our leasing.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Anthony Paolone of J.P. Morgan.","Anthony Paolone - J.P. Morgan","Thank you. Can you just step back and give us a little bit of context around Ariad in terms of the space? They're supposed to come out of how much of it, where it is and also what this may or may not do to just your plans for further projects in Cambridge over the short run?","Joel Marcus","Yes, that's a good question. I don't know the exact amount of square footage they're coming out of space in Forest City. It's about what, 120,000?","Steve Richardson","It's about 120,000 in total and two spaces and I believe their lease is currently go out to roughly 2019 on this space.","Joel Marcus","Right. I think there are 26 lands down which is in the Forest City, University Park area. Those buildings -- at least their main building which has been their headquarters building for a long time is a pretty older-like building. I don't know that it's functionally fit for the company, assuming the company continues to make and recover -- make progress and recover from this hit.","So clearly that's a factor. I think the properties are well over 20 years old. So when you talk about where they're coming from, that's where they're coming from and obviously the expansion was going on one metric and given the safety issues, even though it's cancer and then the change in direction on the clinical trial obviously, they've announced they are going to do an earnings call on November 6 when they will give kind of an update.","I think the larger question is, in both buildings that we have we feel very good about the ability. We had those today let's say Ariad didn't exist and we have those buildings available for lease in Cambridge, both as single-tenant, two single tenant buildings or two multi-tenant buildings. We feel very good about excellent location and they're very functional. The floor plates are really ideal for kind of lab office.","I think the only impact that we see as we move along on the Binney Street project is clearly we want to see this resolved before we announce any further start which we were thinking about doing in 2014 of 50 Binney. So we will clearly wait to see how Ariad gets resolved before we do anything there. So I think that's the practical outcome.","And Steve talked about we're tracking about 600,000 to 800,000 square feet of demand in the Cambridge area, some that\u2019s even not known to brokers while we know from CEOs of companies who are looking but haven't engaged brokers. We know of a shadow pipeline that's even larger than that.","Anthony Paolone - J.P. Morgan","How would net rents have to stack up if you went multi-tenant with those buildings in order to get to the same economics that are penciled in for Ariad now?","Joel Marcus","Well, now construction multi-tenant probably is in the low-to-mid 60s. That\u2019s just where they are today. Ariad\u2019s rent is north of that. So there would be a difference but I\u2019m presuming Ariad is not folding up its tent and going away. Very few companies do that. Beyond this drug, the company does have a pipeline but I believe and I think others believe that this drug has some greater use than the CML use. And if they are successful in treating other types of cancer, this could be a Tysabri story again. And I think again we\u2019ll have to see.","Anthony Paolone - J.P. Morgan","Okay. Thanks. On acquisitions and dispositions on the land sales, what was the reason for just less of those occurring? And did that tie in at all to the acquisition pipeline? Did those come down? Did one drive the other or are they for separate reasons?","Joel Marcus","No. I think you know just in this business and in any business of selling a land, it is extraordinarily like pulling teeth. We\u2019ve had a number of sales through the year. I think we\u2019ve done pretty well. We\u2019ve got a number teed up and others that were looking to move forward. It\u2019s just one of our timing and diligence and also where you have to repurpose the use. It just takes time. Buyers aren\u2019t willing necessarily especially if you\u2019ve got a resi situation to take the property without contingency. So we just have to be patient and I am sure we\u2019ll be able to do a good job of hitting some important targets as we get through the fourth quarter and well into 2014.","Anthony Paolone - J.P. Morgan","","And, on the acquisition side?","Peter Moglia","Hey, Tony, this is Peter. There are just two good opportunities. One in our TP was a credit tenant, a tenant that we have a great relationship with, and want to build an even better one. At long term, lease and pricing was very good.","Joel Marcus","And they were actually very instrumental in getting us involved in this property which is sometimes unusual when it comes from a tenant.","Peter Moglia","Right. So we really like that one and then the Barnes Canyon one in San Diego was something that Dan Ryan had looked at decade ago. It\u2019s near the San Diego Tech Center. It\u2019s a very vibrant area. There are lot of tenants in and around there because of the amenities and the access to the highway. And he really came in and said look we could get this for a very reasonable price.","And I\u2019ve got plans to redevelop it. And I think we could really hit a homerun. And so far that seems to be playing out. We have two tenants in that projects right now, one of them will be expiring by the end of the year but we\u2019re already talking to tenant to backfill that space and a nice incremental yield. So both projects were very good opportunities and we wanted to capitalize on that. So we did.","Joel Marcus","And we looked at -- I mean if you look at, there is a large volume of projects in the market today. And we have said on other calls, we kind of think strategic optionality is the best way to think about it. We look at everything and we should be aware of everything and it\u2019s been a pretty active market issuance. Peter also highlighted two deals we looked at but didn\u2019t pursue that ultimately closed.","Anthony Paolone - J.P. Morgan","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Jeff Theiler of Green Street Advisors.","Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors","Hi. Just quickly to follow up on that acquisition line of questioning. So it wasn\u2019t necessarily that there weren\u2019t opportunities out there? Was it just that the pricing was out of whack or are there things that are still in negotiations that might end up closing early next year? Just trying to figure out the reduction in guidance and that kind of thing?","Joel Marcus","","Well I think -- I think it\u2019s a combination of a number of things. Sometimes there are -- there may be acquisitions. Peter could tell you we\u2019re tracking well -- well over a billion dollars and then in quite a numbers of markets, we turned down a deal in San Francisco that was almost $250 million.","So we\u2019re looking at the bunch of things but I think again what our view is at the beginning of the year obviously is tempered by what plays out during the year. Some things were put on the market, pulled off the market. So I think again we\u2019re just looking. Our key driver is obviously to deploy capital to the highest accretive use. And Peter, you could comment further if you want?","Peter Moglia","Yes. Just to comment on the -- the reason that we haven\u2019t met the original guidance on acquisition does not have anything to do with the amount of opportunities available. It has really been our selectivity on when where we wanted to place the capital. What we do next year, we\u2019ll see at this point in time. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll give better guidance at our Investor Day but there are plenty of thing available and not just in one or two markets but really broadly across all of our clusters.","Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors","And did you gave any updates on your progress in China and contributing your assets to the health care platform?","Joel Marcus","I would say we have no updates since last quarter. We are still working on that but Steve, you could talk about the one lease we\u2019re about to sign in South China.","Steve Richardson ","In South China, we have a lease out for signature that will be finalizing shortly here that will lease the balance of the projects there. So that one particular facility will be fully stabilized and again that should be done very shortly here with a credit tenant.","Peter Moglia","","Yes. And our game plan is to attach these two sets of assets to a bigger platform in China because we see that as the better way to manage that market from our standpoint since our capital allocation over there is obviously not -- not significant at this point.","","Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors","All right. Okay. Thank you very much.","Peter Moglia","Thanks Jeff.","Operator","And next we have Sheila McGrath of Evercore.","Sheila McGrath - Evercore","Yes. Joel, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about 29th Street coming online in fourth quarter. That's just part of the building. So is there going to be any impact in fourth quarter and then also just on the shadow pipeline of leasing at that property, how you think demand is shaping up?","Joel Marcus","Yes. Dean can give you a little bit more details on the onboarding of income but we do -- we will deliver to Roche in December. We also have find, as you know, a lease with a credit tenant for 12000 additional fee. And as I highlighted in my commentary, we\u2019ve got a number of tenants, both credit and non-credit that we\u2019re actually not training people or not just -- at a lot of intent stage, we\u2019re actually at a more robust lease negotiation stage for an additional approaching 84,000 square feet, could be three or four users.","So that would bring us up and I think there\u2019s a high probability of virtually all that happening. So that would bring us up to about 68%, almost 70% by year end. Which I think would be pretty -- pretty amazingly dramatic. We feel very good. There is a good demand in the market place. We have interest from Europe, from Japan, obviously domestically. So we see it as -- as we said and as we told the city of New York we view this as a destination. Dean, I don\u2019t know if you want to comment on it.","Dean Shigenaga","Yes. Sheila, the answer to your question as far as contribution, it\u2019s roughly call it 700,000 of NOI coming in, that\u2019s fairly small because its being delivered, call it mid December and so -- when you roll it into the first quarter, you get a nice (inaudible) adjustment.","Joel Marcus","Yes. So if were at 68% or almost 70%, we aren\u2019t including in there additional -- we're hoping Roche expense in the project. None of the 84,000 square feet under lease negotiation right now includes Roche expansion but we just had Franz Humer in the building. And he basically told the packed audience including the deputy mayor and quite a number of other dignitaries that he was certain that Roche would want to expanded its footprints. So we hope that it is a 2014 event as well.","Dean Shigenaga","Sheila, let me just add. I think as you keep in mind this project which commenced about 12 months ago. So we\u2019re fortunate to be able to actually deliver space as quickly as we can later this year. And we\u2019re going to continue to work on the fed up and lease up with the remainder of the space. So I think I have taken some questions over time where the capitalization would see in \u201814. I don\u2019t expect it on the project as we had quite a bit of construction to continue to lease up.","Sheila McGrath - Evercore","Okay. And also Steve Richardson, I think in the prepared remarks mentioned another platform of demand. I'm not sure if I really understood that if you could just go into a little bit more detail on that?","Steve Richardson","Sheila, just to add or to clarify that. We\u2019ve just seen a real resurgence in the emerging companies, both at the formation stage and the expansion stage. So as I referenced, the Cambridge market there had 11 different leases, all between 5,000 and 15,000 square feet. And we\u2019ve just seen historically that those will mature and a number of them will advance.","So we\u2019ve seen quite a bit of growth. The same thing is happening in the south San Francisco market. Now historically we\u2019ve talked about the large overhang there from the Amgen blocks of space but when you segment the market for smaller box of space say 10,000 to 50,000 square feet, you\u2019ve only got 2.9% vacancy. So, again, field by venture capital firms that have a lot of liquidity through M&A activity, through IPOs and so you are really setting the stage for another cycle of demand as we did number of years ago.","Sheila McGrath - Evercore","Okay. And last question. 499 Illinois, you've made a lot of progress there, if you could give us a little bit more detail on how you think leasing shapes up in the next couple of quarters there?","Joel Marcus","Specifically, we\u2019ve just got the 8,000 square feet left on the first floor, 28,000 square feet on the second floor. We have roughly a million square feet portfolio in Mission Bay, so this represents the last remaining space. We are in active discussions with people for all of that space and I would expect probably be two or three tenants. And if we are not completed by the end of the year, it would be very shortly after what maybe just one small piece remaining. But our hope would be we would have that completed close to year end.","Sheila McGrath - Evercore","Okay. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Thanks, Sheila.","Operator","And next from Citi, we have Emmanuel Korchman.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citi","Hey guys. If we think about the Ariad project just for one more second. Have you guys -- ","Joel Marcus","Hello. Are we still on?","Emmanuel Korchman - Citi","Hello, can you hear me?","Joel Marcus","Nope, you blanked out, so repeat the questions.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citi","Just thinking about Ariad for another second or the Binney project, have you been in any discussions with them, maybe before the November 6 plans release to get some comfort on the timing of when they might come to you and perhaps take back some of that space now while you do see other demand in the market?","Joel Marcus","We\u2019ve had some ongoing discussions but I think it\u2019s fair to say the November 6 is important date because they\u2019ll publicly unveil their reorganization plan to address the issues that have been kind of trust upon them. So any substantive progress has got to wait for that public unveiling. But yes, we\u2019ve had ongoing discussions so, but I\u2019m not at the moment able to tell you anything more.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citi","Thanks for that Joel and then one other one for me.","Joel Marcus","Sure.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citi","Maybe, we all know that biotech at times can be a volatile space and we've seen Ariad news, we saw Tysabri a few years ago. Has any of that changed sort of the way you approach deals or have Amanda and her team changed the way they underwrite deals or is there anything else that you as a landlord to sort of the biotech space, can you change anything that you're doing or have been doing to get more comfort or security?","Joel Marcus","Yeah. That\u2019s a super great question and as soon as we found out about this, we asked our self that exact same question. And so one thing that\u2019s pretty shocking that happens rarely, Tysabri is maybe a good example. Obviously, Ariad\u2019s drug is one of the latest example. But it\u2019s pretty unusual when you have a product that\u2019s been allowed on the market by the FDA and cancer is different than some of the chronic diseases because cancers are generally terminable by and large in many cases.","How a safety profile arose the way it arose, I think that was pretty surprising and pretty unusual. I don\u2019t really want to comment more beyond that but I would say that was pretty unusual. And I think there will be a lot discussed in the New England Journal commentary on November 7th about dosing and that\u2019s obviously a critical issue. But let me just say this, this was pretty unusual. What you normally find is a company that\u2019s working on development and then the product just doesn\u2019t work.","In other words, the clinical trial was a bust and everybody goes home and the company goes on, either with another pipeline product or if they are one-trick pony then that\u2019s it and that\u2019s few and far between. Most have multiple pipelines but I think the safety profile issue coming up the way it does, I think it\u2019s unknown at the moment at least to those of us who have seen just the base data.","How many people had cardio problems going into the trial who had preexisting issues? I think that\u2019s an issue that has to be explored. There is a whole range of things, so I think the answer is you really have a couple of choices. If you do a, I mean we didn\u2019t go forward with Ariad until the product was approved and that gave us a high level of confidence, obviously one doesn\u2019t anticipate very often the safety issue coming back.","But yeah, we will be very thoughtful and careful about how we think about development projects even the companies that have a single product on the market as we go forward in the past, I think that wasn\u2019t of greater concern, but obviously this shows that it needs to be, even if it\u2019s once in a every few years, it still is a big question.","But I do believe as I said, I think the nature of this product I think, Ariad\u2019s got a good shot if they can respond to the FDA properly. And if they are able to use this in a broader set of indications, this could be an interesting product, assuming it\u2019s not CML limited. But anyway the answer in short is yes, we are clearly looking carefully.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citi","And then maybe a quick one for either, Dean or Peter. On your acquisition commentary in the sort of lower guidance there, am I fair to assume that those projects have sort of fallen out since you raised equity and gave the higher guidance? Or better said, is the pipeline of acquisitions now just smaller as valuations have gone up?","Joel Marcus","Well, I think the set that we are looking at has stayed pretty large throughout the entire year. I think as Peter said it\u2019s the selectivity that\u2019s been unusual and also I think again if something doesn\u2019t really line up, we generally pass on it. But also there is a cycle of bringing things through the acquisition pipeline in some but not ours but sellers and it takes a whole lot of time. I don\u2019t know Peter you could comment.","Peter Moglia","Yeah. I mean, there certainly could have been a couple of things that, had they just gone another way, we could have easily sold it. But the negotiation cycle takes a while and because our product is actually a very invoked product, people -- in fact there is more and more investors that really like it. You get into some competitive situations then you feel like hey, go ahead, let this other guy pay that price forward, we will get the next one. So, I think this is just as simple as that. There has been plenty of opportunities. It\u2019s just we are very selective and I think that you guys will quite appreciate that.","Joel Marcus","And I mean, I think one property that Peter will comment on next quarter it hasn\u2019t closed and it\u2019s in process is I wont say where it is. I mean, what it is, but it\u2019s a property in Cambridge. It\u2019s a property we were kind of interested in but as we heard the whisper number and it\u2019s a good size property, maybe in the -- I can\u2019t remember the exact amount but pretty good size, combination of office and lab.","When we heard the whisper number, we just kind of pulled away and said that doesn\u2019t really make sense and so we didn\u2019t even bid on it. But there was a pretty fierce bidding war among the number of institutional investors and a whole lot of pension funds we heard. But that was one that again when it started, when it came up on our pipeline, we said wow. Given location to us, we\u2019ve really liked it, liked the combination but then when it got to the point of what brokers were putting out on the market as the whisper number we just said, it just wasn\u2019t of interest to us. So, I mean that\u2019s a good example.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citi","Thanks for that guys.","Joel Marcus","Yeah, thank you.","Operator","(Operators Instruction) We\u2019ll go next to George Auerbach of ISI Group.","George Auerbach - ISI Group","Great. Thanks guys. Dean or Joel, as you look into 2014 on the development spend number, if 50 Binney is kind of out of the running and I'd think that the third building in New York would be out just because of the leased up efforts on the second tower. How do you see development spend trending next year?","Joel Marcus","Yeah, I think what we\u2019ll do is let and what you just said is correct, we wouldn\u2019t see starting the Third Tower in New York, little too early. We\u2019ve got some leasing to do and clearly until Ariad is resolved to our satisfaction, we wouldn\u2019t kick-off another project on Binney. But we\u2019ll update and we\u2019ll give you very granular detail on the spend number for \u201914 when we do our Investor Day. I don\u2019t think I want to preempt at this point.","George Auerbach - ISI Group","Okay. And maybe just a follow-up on, well, Tony\u2019s question about the land sales.","Joel Marcus","Yeah.","George Auerbach - ISI Group","I think you mentioned that they sort of flip into next year, so we sort of expect a similar amount of land sales in next -- in 2014?","Joel Marcus","Well, we do have under negotiation as what I commented on which is the $30 million, but we have also broadly accommodated, George, that we are looking at different parcels and I think, we will provide more color over Investor Day and possibly the next couple quarters on exactly what we might monetize next year.","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah. But it should, we would hope that it would be well north of that.","George Auerbach - ISI Group","Great. Thank you.","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah. Thanks George.","Operator","Our next question will come from Dave Rodgers of Robert W. Baird.","Dave Rodgers - Robert W. Baird","Yeah. Good afternoon. Maybe Joel or Steve, for one of you. You have done a great job leasing up space, you have gone from a 2.5 million square feet of availability on our numbers down to closer to about a million square feet? Currently, I guess, one of the question I would have for you is, do you see more of a restricted ability to lease space just due to availability next year to that we should kind of expecting as we think about 2014 leasing guidance? And can you perhaps talk about any kind of stubborn vacancies in that number where you are seeing a little bit better traction?","Steve Richardson","Dave, I think, again, looking at the 2014 rolls and we have got probably a good 30% under negotiations there, only about 600,000 square feet remaining, half of that is in the mix of Boston in the Bay area. So I think we will have plenty of quality leasing opportunities there.","We have talked about near-term development and redevelopment opportunities whether they might emerge from acquisitions that, Peters, had talked about or that we have highlighted in the supplemental as well. So, I think, we have plenty of near-term growth opportunities both in the operating portfolio and the development and redevelopment portfolio as well.","Dave Rodgers - Robert W. Baird","And I guess just given where the leasing spreads are, given where the vacancy in the portfolio is and the demand profile you are seeing, the question before, I guess, was would you see accelerating more development starts? I guess take it more broadly and say do you have kind of a limit or a target as percentage of enterprise value that you would like to see kind of development get up to given your comments, Joel, about how strong the market is today relative to what\u2019s been over the last five or 10 years?","Joel Marcus","Yeah. I think we look at it on a submarket by submarket basis. I think if you look at the supplement pretty closely you can see us pushing forward a couple of parcels in Seattle. We have very robust demand up there and we have very little product to meet that demand similar in San Diego. I think that\u2019s also true. So I think you will see those two markets will be pushing ahead both development and redevelopments, New York no, obviously Cambridge no, until 75\/125 is resolved.","We do have -- we have done a good job of leasing space up in Maryland. We are getting tighter there even in North Carolina. I was at the meeting the other day and there was interesting immediate requirement for a fairly large amount of space, we can\u2019t deal with but we are hoping to capture the long-term opportunity through a development there.","So, yeah, it\u2019s a little bit of a good conundrum or quandary where we have demand and we don\u2019t necessarily have absolutely immediately available space of the size that they are looking for, I guess that\u2019s a good thing.","And remember too, I think, this sector and the sector obviously go through its own mutations, but is less dependent upon the general economic environment and much more dependent upon, it\u2019s really event driven and so that\u2019s what we have to be focused on.","On chronic vacancy, you mentioned, do we have any spaces? We did have a few spaces in the suburbs say at Massachusetts over the past year or two that or three years that we viewed as chronic. We had trouble getting traction. We had one tenant we do something with and then it kind of flaked out on us. But we have been very successful, Tom, in the team of leasing virtually all the chronic vacancy. I don\u2019t know Peter or Steve if you know of anything out there that today we would say is just tough space.","There are some buildings that may have like a basement level space of 5,000 to 10,000 that just happens that isn\u2019t ideal, but short of that kind of a minor rounding everything, I don\u2019t think we have much.","Steve Richardson","We used to do, well, we\u2019ve focus on that pretty much but a lot of that was in the 495 corridor out in the outer suburbs of Mass.","Joel Marcus","Right.","Steve Richardson","So, we did resolve those.","Joel Marcus","Yeah.","Peter Moglia","And.","Steve Richardson","And we haven\u2019t really had much out since then.","Joel Marcus","Yeah. And I think our dispositions that we made late last year and early this year helped not only to give us some capital to recycle, they helped resolve some of the submarket issues we just were in love with and I think that turned out to be a good thing for us.","Dave Rodgers - Robert W. Baird","Great. Thanks. And then just final question. I guess touching on those dispositions or potential future dispositions, I know you have got the portfolio largely where you would like it? But given the pricing you talked about in the market today? You can kind of re-contemplate either some joint venture sales, where you would kind of maintain some management and ownership or just more outright sales to continue to improve the balance sheet?","Joel Marcus","I think on the income producing side there might be minor things in like Pennsylvania asset, or this asset or that asset, but nothing that would be of almost any substance. We don\u2019t have anything that we are targeting right now specifically. If somebody came by and gave us an offer we might consider it in a secondary or tertiary submarket, but we don\u2019t have a think plan. I think on our game plan for 2014, Dean, is that a fair statement?","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah. That\u2019s true. There might be a couple very small things, very small things, very small in the fourth quarter.","Dave Rodgers - Robert W. Baird","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","So from an analyst and investors who have told us to sell like the New York asset or some like that to establish a benchmark, but we are smarter than that. Doesn\u2019t make any sense?","Dave Rodgers - Robert W. Baird","Yeah. Don\u2019t do that. Great. Thanks.","Joel Marcus","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","And next is Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Carroll - RBC Capital","Thanks. On page 29 your supplement, how should we think about the near-term development projects, when could these be actually be started and is there kind of a way we should think about that?","Joel Marcus","Absolutely, as I just mentioned, Mike, we clearly, while 50 and 100 residential on Binney, obviously we are moving forward with a bunch of infrastructure and things like that we have to do. But as far as moving round up we certainly aren\u2019t going to do that till Ariad area is resolved.","I think you will see us move Science Park pretty quickly. I think Illumina will move at some point here, Campus point as well, New York will hold off and then both Seattle\u2019s will move.","So I think of the ones I mentioned and I mentioned just a moment ago, San Diego and Seattle, I think you will see move pretty rapidly in 2014. We are trying to make sure we have the entitlements perfected in any upzoning for increased FAR to get maximum advantage and then in Seattle we have literary tenants in hand who we know need space, so that would probably go very fast in San Diego. We know also Illumina has certain demands. We know down there, LIlly, UCSD have demand on space and in the Science Park we have, Dean circled a tenant or two.","So I think on Investor Day we will give you a more detailed rollout of those, but I think you will see those move ahead aggressively in predevelopment and hopefully as best as possible in development where it makes sense where we have got a target of tenant. We clearly won\u2019t do just random spec development but we will make sure we have got tenants soft circled or hard circled.","Michael Carroll - RBC Capital","Okay. And then as 50 Binney Street still kind of your mark for a tact tenant and use one to delay that project to be conservative what happened to 75\/125?","Joel Marcus","Well, yeah, the answer is we are trying to get a approval to divide that building into two buildings. We think one would be easy for tech because we have been approached on that by tech opportunities and the other potentially, so it would be 200 and somewhat 1000 square feet building, so we are going through the design work and the approval work right now. But, yeah, we still would like to go maybe one tech and one lab there, but we wouldn\u2019t start anything at all even if it was tech just until we resolve 75\/125 to our satisfaction.","Michael Carroll - RBC Capital","Okay. Is there any update on the India transaction? Have you received any significant interest from those assets?","Joel Marcus","Yeah. We are, as I said, looking for an investment partner to go forward with this platform, we think it\u2019s a great platform, it\u2019s lead by our number one Novartis. We think it offers a great opportunity and we are well into discussions and we hope that we can bring in a partner to really help us move that platform forward.","Michael Carroll - RBC Capital","Okay. Thanks.","Joel Marcus","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","And we have time for one final question and that will come from Emmanuel Korchman of Citi.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citi","Thanks guys. Just one very quick question. Real capital analytics seems to picked up in acquisition, credited, do you guys of a Walgreen's in Anaheim. Was that...","Joel Marcus","Yeah. We did it. That\u2019s new headquarters. Now don\u2019t know anything about it. Let\u2019s Peter have doing random, he has gone road.","Peter Moglia","Actually that was Steve, you\u2019ve, it wasn\u2019t a part of 1030.","Steve Richardson","Right. It was part of an OP unit transaction that we had consummated several years ago up in South San Francisco with a partnership there and so as part of the recapitalization in the OP units, yes, we did acquire that Walgreen\u2019s for this partner.","Joel Marcus","Right.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citi","Thank you for that.","Joel Marcus","But we don\u2019t know that.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citi","Clear.","Joel Marcus","Our partner owns it. Just to be clear.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citi","Perfect. Thanks.","Joel Marcus","Thank you.","Operator","This was all the questions that we had for today. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to our speakers for any additional or closing comments.","Joel Marcus","We want to just thank you very much and we\u2019ll talk to you on year end and fourth quarter in February.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Ms. Rhonda Chiger. Ms. Chiger, you may begin.","Rhonda Chiger","Thank you and good afternoon. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company\u2019s Form 10-K, Annual Report, and other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Joel Marcus. Please go ahead.","Joel Marcus","Thank you everybody and welcome to the third quarter call and all of us here are obviously praying for the safety of those impacted by hurricane Sandy. I\u2019m going to try to breeze through my comments pretty quickly, turn it over to Steve Richardson and then to Dean Shigenaga and then go to Q&A. ","But as I finished my first board meeting last week for the NIH, it reminded me actually of the great work that the life science industry has done in disease management. If you think about what has happened to HIV AIDs, moving that disease from a death sentence to a chronic condition, I think emphasizes the critical nature of this industry and its ability really to manage the economic cost of disease to society. So I think we remain very positive on the critical nature of this industry\u2019s impact on society. ","I think the third quarter and certainly year-to-date for the industry and then our tenant base in particular has been a, I think a good year in another wise very tough macro market, and one that seems to be eroding pretty much daily. The NASDAQ biotech index was up almost 40% year-to-date. We have 13 IPOs in the first nine months and many of them are performing pretty well. ","The FDA approvals as I mentioned on past calls are up 27 to-date and 59% are our tenants, which is pretty amazing and then a recent notable clinical success was Lilly\u2019s success with the huge market potential of that drug for CNS, for Alzheimers. So all pretty good news in general.","Moving real quickly to balance sheet leverage, capital allocation and Dean\u2019s going to have a lot to say about this, so we\u2019ll focus his comments pretty detailed. Our target as Dean will get into, our target debt to EBITDA for year end is about 7.2 and that will be almost leveraged neutral from last year\u2019s 12\/31\/11 at about 7\/1 times and again he\u2019ll talk about, we don\u2019t expect to draw down or to use the ATM this quarter. ","I think one of the highlights for the balance sheet this quarter has been land sales. We\u2019ve got $46 million completed for this year as you see from the supplement. We got $34 million pending and another $13 million headed in the sale direction, so that will aggregate a total of almost $93 million, so that\u2019s good news and a strong effort by our teams in many of the regions and we will continue this effort into 2013.","Steve\u2019s going to talk about asset recycling, but in general, again, by the supplement we\u2019ve had about $30 million to-date, $84 million pending. We are looking at potentially others. Again, this suburban to urban theme and Dean will detail the implications on the NOI run rates. I\u2019ll see you on the take account of that.","On construction spend, $167 million for the fourth quarter. At the mid point, about $630 million some odd for 2013. We\u2019ve got many second submissions in that, as that will be the peak year trailing down into 2014 and we are working hard to manage down those cost project-by-project and we\u2019ve done some good work, given some earnings release.","Dean will walk you through the categories of spending for 2013 and the likely specific sources of capital for each. So the significant land sales, free cash flow and construction financing are needs for equity for the coming year. Actually, more modest than I think some of the street has anticipated.","When we get to internal and external growth for the third quarter, I think one of the highlights continues to be our quality of tenant. 40% of the AVR from investment grade tenants is about equal the last quarter and again, particularly important in a tough macro economy are leasing and Steve will try to give you some granular views. It was pretty solid at 732,000 square feet. Dean will talk detail about the core. We are pleased with our deliveries this quarter; 131,000 square feet out of development, 100% leased and 226,000 out of redevelopment, 99% leased.","When it comes to the Alexandria Center for Life Science, New York City as we announced on September 20, we\u2019ll begin vertical construction of the 420,000 odd square foot West Tower in the fourth quarter, with delivery approximately fourth quarter of 2013. In our fourth quarter and year-end release in February, we\u2019ll detail the estimated constriction costs and expected initial stabilized yields. ","Talking about pre-leasing progress to date, again about a 420,000 square foot building. Roche has signed a lease for two floors as we\u2019ve highlighted in our release and there\u2019s been many articles written. We are in negotiations with two-biotech companies to move to the Alexandria Center and they would take between a half a floor and one floor each. ","We are also in discussions with an existing tenant for two floors and others at the showing stage we have one floor to a contract research organization and another floor showing to an institutional shareholder. So we feel pretty positive about progress to date and our target rental rates we\u2019re comfortable with.","Dean is going to get into guidance. We\u2019ll release 2013\u2019s very detailed guidance in conjunction with our Investor Day in New York City on December 5 and a topside view of 2014 to put a longer-range view into context. ","And then I guess finally on the dividend, the board will continue to assess an ongoing increase in the dividend as a way to share increasing cash flows with shareholders and you\u2019ll hear more about that. ","So, let me turn it over to Steve for a pretty detailed view on the leasing side. ","Steve Richardson","Thank you Joel and today my comments will focus on four key areas; asset recycling, life science real estate markets in 2012 leasing, a preview of 2013 roles and prospects and finally the 499 Illinois evolving demand.","First on asset recycling, the company\u2019s pursuing asset-recycling program in a very careful and disciplined fashion during the year. We are seeking to monetize non-essential land assets as Joel referred to and sub-urban assets lacking strategic long-term importance. ","As we really move the concentration of our facilities to tightly integrated brain trust cluster submarkets in high barrier to entry core urban locations. A number of these recycled facilities are legacy assets that originally served as viable locations for life science companies 10 to 15 years ago. ","The industry has grown and matured over time and high quality facilities became available in more desirable urban knowledge locations, adjacent to the major academic institutions and in high quality recruiting locations, the nature of the demand for these locations have evolved and so it makes good sense to recycle this capital. ","Moving onto the life science real estate markets and 2012 leasing, we\u2019ve leased 2.6 million square feet to-date during 2012, including another strong and solid quarter with 732,000 square feet leased. The 7.6% GAAP increase for renewals and release space will provide consistent and term growth going forward and let me also add for a moment the important factor of lease term.","The renewals and releases are over an average term of approximately five years. Again, bearing out that the sector provides significant stability to the company\u2019s leasing profile, as these enterprises are engaged in mission critical activities. In the new releases for redevelopment and development facilities average approximately nine years and highlight not only the long-term commitment companies are making to these facilities, but often times the significant hard capital investment made directly by the life science tenants.","Let me get into the details of some of the regional statistics and trends for the third quarter. The greater Boston market remains strong with about a 10% vacancy rate for life science space and about 11% for the office tech market. Our facilities in fact exceed this market benchmark as we are 94.3% occupied in our operating properties and have significant releasing or redevelopment projects. ","Lease rates for life science space in these Cambridge market are solidly in the 50 to 60 triple net range and higher for build-to-suit projects. The regional team this quarter leased a total of 313,000 square feet with 106,000 square feet on renewals in our Cambridge and adjacent facilities and another 206,000 square feet in our redevelopment pipeline. This success clearly highlights the company\u2019s ability to conceive design, market and complete strategic redevelopment projects with high quality client tenants at solid yields. ","The San Diego market has acted as well and is currently at a vacancy rate of approximately 11% across its key sub markets. Alexandria\u2019s properties again are better than the market level with a 95.2 occupancy rate, as the regional team has very artfully and successfully moved a number of the projects from the redevelopment pipeline and the cash flow in the assets. ","Lease rates are in the $24 to $36 range, depending upon the product quality and submarket. The regional team leased 97,000 square feet during the quarter, highlighted by a significant renewal with a strong credit tenant inventory client sub market and a long term lease renewal and expansion stabilizing the key property and its rental leases sub market.","Moving onto the San Francisco bay area, that market is highly dependant up on the sub clustering segment, the Stanford and Mission Bay clusters have vacancy in the 10% range, while the South San Francisco market has had another supply increase with sub leases from the land and Amgen, driving the vacancy to approximately 16%. ","The company\u2019s operating properties however are very strong at 98% occupancy. Lease rates remain in the low to mid 40\u2019s triple net for Mission Bay; the $30 triple net range for South San Francisco and the mid 30s for the Stanford area, so region leased 88,000 square feet during the past quarter.","Moving over to the east coast, the Maryland market is holding its own in a generally soft market, as we are roughly in line with an occupancy rate of 89.4%, although this is down from 2011. Lease rates range from $14 to $26 depending upon the submarket and the regional team leased another 80,000 square feet, highlighted by a key tenant renewal there. Seattle in North Carolina remains steady with 96.3% and 95.5% occupancy rates in our operating properties and they leased 17,000 and 12,000 square feet respectively. ","Moving then to a preview of the 2013 roles and prospects, we have a total of 953,000 square feet slated for roll over during the next year, summarized at a high level in the following fashion. About a quarter of that or 242,000 square feet are in active negotiations. 6% or 55,000 square feet are specifically targeted for redevelopment and finally 69% or 653,000 square feet are in marketing or early discussions. ","Let me get into a little bit more detail on that remaining 653,000 square feet. About 80,000 square feet of that is in the greater Boston market, primarily located in our urban facilities. Its important to note that half of the square footage is actually rolling during December 2013, so we have plenty of runway and are optimistic we will renew or secure new tenants for a majority of these space, with little or no downtime, given the ongoing strong demand for high quality release stage least space in Cambridge and its immediately adjacent urban clusters. ","Moving back over to the west coast, we have about 234,000 square feet rolling in 2013 in the bay area. Approximately 95,000 square feet is concentrated in the very hot Stanford, Palo Alto cluster and good progress is being made with the large 65,000 square foot tenant that is on the verge of commercializing its product, as well as securing a new tenant for a 30,000 square foot space at an attractive lease rate. Another 95,000 square feet is located in attractive smaller suites in the greater South San Frisco market, where we have done very well in spite of the supply overhang in the large blocks of space.","Finally about 44,000 square feet is located in Mission Bay in smaller suites where we\u2019ve had no meaningful vacancy and so we anticipate positive outcomes. We have today about 129,000 in the San Diego market, primarily in the Sorrento Valley and Sorrento Mesa clusters and we are actively marketing these remaining set of suites.","Moving back to the east coast, we have 127,000 square feet in the Maryland market, distributed across its markets. We are now in very early discussions to resolve about a third of these roll overs, another third its too early to tell and we are actively marketing the remaining one-third to new prospects.","53,000 square feet rolling in the North Carolina market. Early discussions with tenants to resolve about half of this roll over and we are actively marketing the remaining 50% to new prospects; and finally no square footage rolling in Seattle during 2013 at all.","And finally let me comment on 499 Illinois. We still firmly believe this is an absolute class-A trophy asset with long-term durable value. Its provided significant current cash flows in the order of $14 million for the 50% occupied portion and really the game changer for the development portion will be the UCSS medical center. ","We are willing to be patient to capture the high quality and innovative initiatives that are ongoing between key public and private institutions and at the same time we are also intensifying our focus on the technology sector with a comprehensive out reach effort and re-imagining of the amenity configuration and offering of the facility. ","I\u2019ve been in the San Francisco market for 20 years and I\u2019ve seen time and time again the best located properties with dramatic water front views, demanding absolute premium pricing and today\u2019s cap rates for core San Francisco property in the 5% range are certainly a clear evidence of that historical pattern.","With that, I\u2019ll hand it off Dean for a further commentary.","Dean Shigenaga","Thanks Steve. Let me start with our core operating metrics, specifically net operating income. The third quarter NOI was generally in line with our expectations. NOI from continuing operations was reported at $100.8 million and NOI before the reclassification of discontinued operations was about $104.2 million. ","Income from discontinued operations net was approximately $4 million and consisted of the following: approximately $3.5 million of NOI, about $1 million of depreciation incurred in the third quarter up to the point of classification as held-for-sale and about $1.6 million in gains on sales of real estate.","The NOI from continuing operations of $100.8 million for the third quarter includes NOI growth from the completion and delivery of the redevelopment of 10300 Campus Point with 96% occupancy and the development in 4755 Nexus Center Drive with 100% occupancy and both projects are located in the San Diego market. These projects on average were in service for approximately 18 days in the third quarter and generated approximately $370,000 of incremental NOI. This really represents about $7.5 million of NOI on an annualized basis.","Our forecast for the fourth quarter, NOI is in the range of $110.5 million to $112.5 million, but keep in mind the $3 million of this NOI relates to the increase in assets held for sale for incremental dispositions. Accordingly, our NOI from continuing operations for the fourth quarter, excluding discontinued operations is forecasted to be in the range of $107.5 million to $109.5 million and our projected quarterly NOI for the fourth quarter from continuing operations represents an increase from the third quarter of $6.7 million to $8.7 million. ","Page 17 of our supplemental package provided a forecast of 342,000 rentable square feet rolling in the fourth quarter and targeted for redevelopment, mostly late in the fourth quarter, as well as 55,000 square feet rolling in the fourth quarter of \u201813. Of 342,000 square feet rolling in the fourth quarter, 78,500 square feet will be placed in the land held for future development. The remaining 264,000 square feet is expected to undergo redevelopment. ","41,000 square feet is pre-leased at 1616 Eastlake in Seattle and 67,000 square feet at 4757 Nexus Center Drive is expected to be leased to a single tenant user within the next week or so. The 342,000 square feet rolling in the fourth quarter that\u2019s targeted for redevelopment is expected to generate approximately 800,000 of NOI in the fourth quarter, so for modeling purposes assume this 800,000 of NOI goes away by 12\/31\/2012. ","Turning to occupancy, year-to-date, 2012 we really made good progress, increasing our cash flows in occupancy, offset slightly with a step down in cash rents year-to-date related to two leases; one of which was in Research Triangle Park and another one related to an industrial type building in Suburban Washington, D.C. Overall occupancy, including spaces undergoing redevelopment in Greater Boston has increased nicely to 84.3% as of 9\/30, up from 83% as of March 31. ","Additionally, occupancy is projected to increase meaningfully by year end as we deliver pre-lease spaces from redevelopment at 20 Walkup, which is about 91,000 square feet and 400 Technology Square, we expect to deliver about 70% of the 212,000 square feet under redevelopment, primarily related to Aramco, Epizyme and Ragon. ","Overall, occupancy in the San Francisco Bay area, including space undergoing redevelopment has increased to 95.7%, up from 93.9% as of March 31. The increase really reflects lease up of some vacancy and short-term temporary space leased to Onyx, while we complete their build-to-suit development. ","Occupancy in San Diego, including space undergoing redevelopment has increased to 93.3%, up very nicely from 81.5% since March 31. About a third of this increase relates to the lease up of vacancy and about two-thirds related to the transfer of 100% leased spaces from our value-added development and redevelopment programs into operations. ","Overall occupancy, including spaces undergoing redevelopment of 93.3% as of 9\/30 is expected to decline to 88% to 89%, primarily due to the 165,000 square feet of space at Science Park, which was recently acquired specifically for redevelopment and 4757 Nexus Center targeted for redevelopment in the fourth quarter of \u201812. ","Occupancy in suburban Washington D.C. reflects the rollover in May of 2012 of approximately 110,000 square feet related to Baxter\u2019s lease of office, warehouse and industrial space in a non-core submarket. Consistent with our prior comments, we expect this space to require some time to release. ","Occupancy including spaces undergoing redevelopment at Seattle has been stable through 9\/30, but expected to decline from 90% as of 9\/30 down to about 80% by year-end, while we complete the redevelopment of space at 1616 Eastlake. In October, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center moved out a portion of their space, aggregating about 80,000 square feet at 1616 Eastlake and South Lake Union. ","About 67,000 square feet of this space is office space and as forecasted in October, we began the conversion of this office space into laboratory space through redevelopment. Approximately 41,000 square feet or 61% of this space undergoing redevelopment is pre-leased. No other significant changes in occupancy is expected next quarter in our other markets. ","Turning briefly to same property performance, as expected cash same property performance improved in the third quarter to growth of about 4.3%, representing an increase over both quarters for same property performance in the first half of \u201812, and again, we continue to forecast better cash same property NOI performance in the fourth quarter as compared to again in the first half of the year. ","Straight-line rents for the same properties declined resulting in higher cash NOI due to the start of about $5.7 million of annual cash rents from one lease in New York City that started back in February of 2012. We also had a couple of other leases with slightly higher rent steps on a cash basis; one in San Francisco at 901 Gateway, and one, in Maryland at 5 Research Place. ","Same property operating expenses for the quarter were relatively in line with the same quarter last year. Same property operating expenses for the nine months however were up about 2.4%, primarily related to an increase in recoverable repairs and maintenance expenses by approximately $1.7 million. Excluding this $1.7 million increase in repairs and maintenance, the increase in same property operating expenses would have been in line at about 1%. ","Moving importantly on to the leverage, as Joel had mentioned on our Investor Day on December 5, we\u2019ll provide a detailed review of guidance for 2013, including our projection of core operating metrics and other important items, as well as hopefully a high-level viewer thoughts on 2014. ","The following recap focuses on the leverage component of our capital strategy for 2012. We started the year with a goal to have slight improvement in leverage to approximately seven times on a debt-to-EBITDA basis. Projected debt-to-EBITDA as of 12\/31 as Joel had mentioned is targeted to be about 7.2 times. ","Our total spend for 2012 is forecasted just under $600 million consisting of about $429 million for the nine months ended 9\/30 and $167 million for the fourth quarter. Our asset sales for \u201812 are expected to be in the range from $151 million to $156 million, with the fourth quarter sales target being about $76 million to $80 million of that, including about $34 million of land sales. ","So the total increase of NOI from continuing operations from the fourth quarter of \u201811 to the fourth quarter of \u201812, on a quarterly basis it was projected to be about $9.8 million to $11.8 million, which represents an increase on an annualized basis from $39 million to $47 million and we focused on continued re-investment of cash flows from operations. ","Our ATM equity proceeds for the year through 9\/30 has been about $98 million and as Joel had mentioned, no further proceeds from the program are anticipated in the fourth quarter. ","So in summary, we expect to end 2012 at roughly a leverage neutral position from the beginning of the year. We expect to complete about $600 million of construction spending and we successfully minimized common stock equity offering proceeds to approximately $100 million. ","Very high level of our goal for 2013 is to end leverage the neutral to slightly less leverage from our target debt to EBITDA as of 12\/31\/2012 of approximately 7.2 times. Our goal beyond \u201813 is to improve debt to EBITDA closer to 6.5 times in 2014, when we also anticipate construction spending to decline from a high point in \u201813 as we go into 2014. ","Moving on quickly to our constructions spending, again on our Investor Day, on December 5 we\u2019ll provide significant detail on our 2013 construction spend forecast, but today we\u2019ll provide a few high level thoughts. ","Our forecast for 2013, the construction spend is $615 million to $665 million. Our active developments in North America, we are forecasting a spend of about $123 million, focused on a few key projects, the largest of which is about $80 million or so for 225 Binney, which is the build-to-suit for Biogen and again we\u2019ve forecasted an initial cash yield of about 7.5%. ","We also have about 16 million forecasted for 259 East Grand for the Onyx Pharmaceutical project, with the initial cash yield of approximately 8%. Most importantly the funding for this project will be provided by the construction financing we have in place. ","We also have about 13 million forecasted for 499 Illinois, again, with an overall yield on the 409 and 499 Illinois property within our initial cash yield range of 6.5% to 7%, that was announced upon acquisition. However, we are moving to the lower half of this forecast. Funding broadly for these projects, the active developments in North America, is expected to come from cash flows from operations and some use of our ATM equity program. ","Moving to our active redevelopment projects in North America, we are forecasting about $59 million of spending. The key project in redevelopment spending for 2013 is about $18 million at 400 Technology Square for various tenants with sold initial cash yields at about 8.1%. ","The remaining $31 million is spread across several other projects and I think as you look at this group of redevelopments that we\u2019ve projected for 2013, we are forecasting an average yield in the low 7% range. Funding for this group of construction projects will come from proceeds from sales of land parcels and the reinvestment of proceeds from sale of income producing assets. ","The next category is pre-construction and we are forecasting about $84 million of spending. The Alexandria Center for Kendall Square, sometimes referred to as our Binney Street development project is the key project consuming capital in pre-construction as you recall, the build-to-suit project for BioGen, which is now under active development, has an initial cash yield of about 7.5%. This provides some insight into potential yields from this development site and we expect initial cash yields to move into the 8% range. Funding for pre-construction is expected to come from proceeds from our ATM equity program the. ","The next category is future construction projects, where we are forecasting a range from $250 million to $300 million. The key projects consists of first of the West Tower in New York City. It\u2019s expected to have about $115 million of spending in \u201813, and as Joel had mentioned, we\u2019ll provide our usual detailed yield information in our fourth quarter earnings release. ","The remaining $59 million or the next $59 million is really for future target redevelopment projects, which have been detailed out in our press release, including Hanover Street, Science Park Road, 4757 Nexus Center and 1616 Eastlake, and the yields are expected to range from roughly 7% to the mid 8% range. ","We also have a spend forecast as we normally do for unidentified future construction projects and a few other projects. Funding for this category of future construction projects will consist of a significant construction loan, coupled with some proceeds from our ATM equity program. ","We also have about $30 million of spend forecasted for development and the redevelopment projects in Asia and we are looking to develop a new source of funding for our Asian operations. ","Lastly our generic infrastructure and other building improvement projects or forecasted to use about $68 million. $18 million of this represents our share of our JV development in Longwood, and remember, we have a low to mid 8% initial cash yield on this project, and we plan to reinvest almost all of the cash from the sale of 50% of our 55% interest in the joint venture. ","The remainder of the projects are spread across really two dozen different projects, including a few in San Diego like the amenity building for alumna in San Diego. This building for example was based on an initial cash yield of 8%. We expect funding for these projects to be provided by cash flows from operations. ","Moving on to the balance sheet matters; let me quickly comment briefly on a few areas of the asset sales in our ATM program. We have four income producing assets classified as held-for-sale as of quarter-end, with an aggregate sale price of approximately $84.5 million. We expect to close on one sale for roughly half this amount by the end of the fourth quarter. ","Including this additional sale for 2012, our target sales for the year will be just north of $150 million. In September of 2012, we recognize an aggregate impairment charge of approximately $9.8 million upon classification of the four assets as held for sale. The sale of these assets are in process, so the information we can provide at the moment is limited. ","Additionally, we should point out that the sales price of the $84.5 million for the four properties really reflects significant capital. The buyers are expected to reinvest to renovate the properties. As we complete the sales, we will provide our usual detailed disclosures for each transaction. ","We expect to complete a detailed review later this year of potential assets to sell in 2013, with the goal of continuing our asset disposition program. We expect to provide an update of our target disposition amounts at our Investor Day again on December 5. ","Year-to-date, we issued $100 million under our ATM program at an average price of about $73.15. This includes approximately $59.5 million issued in the third quarter at an average price of $74.97, leaving us with about $150 million remaining under the program. Again, at this time, we do not require any further ATM equity proceeds in order to achieve our targeted debt-to-EBITDA metric of approximately 7.2 times by year-end. ","Lastly on guidance, our guidance for 2012 was adjusted slightly related to our same property performance. We have been projecting our desire transition of a few tenants that we inherited when we acquired Technology Square and that\u2019s 300 Technology. We plan to re-tenant these spaces with high quality tenants in a similar manger to our success of redeveloping and re-tenanting 200 and now 400 Technology Square. ","We have absorbed some downtime between tenancy due to the leasing and minor construction, and remain confident that we will be successful with 300 Technology Square. This transition has impacted same property results this year, slightly more than we expected in the second half of 2012; again, just slightly. Accordingly we narrowed our range of same property performance on a cash basis from a range of 3% to 5% to a range of 3% or 4%, and on a GAAP basis from zero to 2% to slightly negative to slightly positive. ","I should also point out that our same property performance for the second half of \u201812 is expected to be better than the first half of \u201812. Guidance for NAREIT FFO per share diluted for 2012 was reconfirmed at a range of $4.32 to $4.36 and our guidance for EPS diluted was reported at $1.16 to $1.26.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Joel.","Joel Marcus","So operator, could we go to Q&A please.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Our first question comes from Philip Martin from Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Philip Martin - Morningstar","Good morning. Good afternoon actually. Well first of all retention rates. Based on discussions you\u2019re having with tenants, what do you think your retention rate is likely averaging in 2013?","Joel Marcus","","In \u201813 or\u2026?","Philip Martin - Morningstar","For 2013 the lease expirations, the discussions you are having around those lease expirations. Retention rates are in the upper 80s, I know this quarter I believe it was 88%, so it\u2019s clearly. Through the nine months it was 78%. Just trying to get a feel there?","Joel Marcus","","I\u2019ll have Steve comment. One item that might take exception to that general rule is 300 Tech Square that Dean alluded to. That\u2019s a building that we did not fully we did not go and re-habit like we did 200 and 400, because it was in very good shape when we bought it. But we bought it in \u201806 and MIT had recruited a number of companies there that at the time we did not necessarily viewed as long-term tenants. So we\u2019ve thought as they\u2019ve rolled out other leases not to renew or to seek to retain them and looking to aggressively back fill that space with new tenants. ","So I think our goal is given our 48% of ABR being investment grade, really where we see opportunities in core, infill locations, where we can replace I would say less creditworthy tenants with more creditworthy tenants, but I\u2019ll leave it to Steve to give you color, generally speaking.","Philip Martin - Morningstar","That was a bit where my question was heading anyway in terms of, if they were a little bit lower, might they be lower because you are seeing demand from a different or a higher quality tenant?","Joel Marcus","","Yes, the answer is for sure, and that\u2019s a good question.","Stephen Richardson","Yes, I think when you start looking at the specific markets and where we are going to have product available, Greater Boston is really concentrated in the urban core area. The Bay area market will be in that Stanford, Palo Alto cluster. I think we are actually okay generally in Maryland. So we are going to be in places where either the retention rate will be consistent with what we\u2019ve experienced in the past or as Joel just alluded to, we may have a chance to backfill with higher quality tenants.","Philip Martin \u2013 Morningstar","","When you look at the lease term, I know you mentioned that in your opening remarks looking at the TIs and leasing commissions, they are right around 523. Right now pretty consistent I think throughout the year. But you see that leveling off at this point and do you see that average lease term going north of five. Can you just give us an idea of trends based on discussions?","Dean Shigenaga","Philip, it\u2019s Dean here. I would say that the renewed and released spaces typically average somewhere between five and seven years, historically, if you go back five or seven years. And so I think that 4.8 year statistic for the three months or 4.6 for the nine months is right down where it\u2019s been historically and the development and redeveloped space traditionally is closer to 10 years. So I think the statistics for a lease term is right in line there as well.","Stephen Richardson","Yes, I think if space has turned, just remember small and medium size spaces, generally released for shorter to medium term where you have larger blocks of space, those tend to renew for longer term. It\u2019s just kind of the way it is and so I think we feel comfortable and as we migrate more space from suburban to urban, that I think can only help us. ","Philip Martin - Morningstar ","Okay, okay. And my last question, just could you provide a little more detail on Asia. I know you mentioned potentially looking for new sources of financing there, but can you just give us a better feel for how those developments are coming along in terms of pre-leasing timing, that sort of thing and that\u2019s it?","Joel Marcus","","Well, I think in China we have had some success although not at great yields in South China and in North China we are still working hard to complete that project and lease that up. ","Our goal in China over time will be to obviously look at finding someone who can come in potentially and help us potentially take the burden of those properties from us, so that\u2019s something longer or medium term we\u2019re looking at and I think the India operations, we had good success this quarter, a reasonable success on leasing and as I said previously, we are looking at trying to bring in a third party to help us finance those operations, because I think the real key message and you kind of got it from Dean, Dean took the time to go through a very detailed fashion category-by-category. ","We have more opportunities here in the U.S. than we actually have sources of funding for and so even though that has jumped a bit from this year to next year, we\u2019ve got a full platter for investment here in the U.S. on redevelopment and development. So I think that\u2019s a good sign. So we are looking to kind of shift some of the burden of overseas investment to third-party and hopefully over the coming months and quarter or two, I\u2019ll have more detailed news on that.","Philip Martin - Morningstar ","Okay, that is helpful. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Yes, thanks Philip","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Carroll from RBC Capital. Please go ahead.","Michael Carroll - RBC Capital ","Yes. Guys, can you give us \u2013 I know you alluded to this in your comments, but a little bit more details and what\u2019s going on at 499 Illinois Street. Which type of tenant is looking for that space? What kind of interest do you have so far and kind of what the outlook for that property is.","Joel Marcus","","Sure. We really do have the breadth of interest there. Technology companies are looking very closely at the cluster there. Very impressed by the facility; the ability to expand as well as the Soma market gets tighter and tighter large blocks of space are becoming a little more precious. So that certainly a set of discussions we are having with various people on the tech side. ","Then the life science side as well, early discussions with groups looking to anchor the building and got a couple of very intriguing opportunities that I had mentioned, kind of innovative, public-private types of institutions, working together in collaboration on solving some very big challenges in the life science world. So we do have what I would characterize as a series of discussions and in some cases warm discussions going on.","Joel Marcus","","Yes. So one of the challenges there is because this is a heavily institutional market, by its nature, it moves more slowly than a more dynamic market like a Cambridge or a Palo Alto. That\u2019s just the nature unfortunately of that submarket, so we just have to be patient. But I think as Steve said, we view the backend to be a good one if we can get a high quality set of tenant, the sort of tenants with solid rental rates I think we\u2019ll have a cap rate there. If we ever choose to accept that would be phenomenally attractive.","Michael Carroll - RBC Capital ","All right thanks. And could you explain why you believe capitalized interest is going to drop? I think it was at $16.8 million in the third quarter and I think the guidance in the fourth quarter is between $13.6 million and $14.6 million. Is there a specific large project coming off capitalization that\u2019s dropping those estimates down?","Dean Shigenaga","","It\u2019s actually two primary items Mike; partly the delivery of 10300 Campus Pointe and 4755 Nexus, which I described in my commentary. And then as we all know we\u2019ve been preparing for that significant increase in NOI, primarily driven by the delivery of our value-added projects in the fourth quarter. I think my commentary described the growth in NOI in the fourth quarter. ","So that NOI is offset by the shutdown of capitalization as we deliver those projects, so it\u2019s really being driven by that, offset slightly by an increase in overall CIP from the spend that will occur in the fourth quarter.","Michael Carroll - RBC Capital ","So then the commencement and the value-add portfolio is driving that or is largely driving that increase in NOI from 3Q \u201812 to 4Q \u201812?","Dean Shigenaga","","That\u2019s correct.","Michael Carroll - RBC Capital ","Okay great. Thanks guys.","Joel Marcus","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Quentin Velleley from Citi. Please go ahead.","Quentin Velleley - Citi","Hi, how are your doing? Just in terms of the 2013 construction spend, the $615 million to $665 million, Dean I know you went through a lot of detail in terms of where the funding is going to come from. Can you maybe just summarize the key resources in terms of how much cash you are going to be using from the cash flow from operations like you paid the dividend, how much you are expecting to issue on the ATM, and then how much you are broadly expecting to get from land and asset sales?","Dean Shigenaga","","Actually Quentin, that\u2019s a fair question I think as we had discussed in the prepared commentary, our plan is to provide all that granular detail on December 5 at our Investor Day, but hopefully we hope to provide some sense of funding by the major buckets. ","We are obviously at a cash flow perspective today from operations that allows us to reinvest into our business at about $80 million in 2012, and I would expect that number to increase. The mix of asset sales, whether its land, operating assets and proceeds from the ATM program will be a little bit different than what it was in 2012, but it\u2019s safe to say that we are going to continue to monetize some land parcels and also monetize some income producing assets.","Joel Marcus","Maybe to give you a better fix on that, I think Dean\u2019s commentary on the free cash flow would be somewhere about $100 million plus. Land sales and recycled assets we\u2019ll have to give you more detail at a granular level on December 5 and I think when it comes to the ATM program, probably if you think in the 250 range, that\u2019s probably where we\u2019d be thinking about for 2013, if that\u2019s helpful.","Quentin Velleley - Citi","Okay. The joint ventures, like a development joint venture or something similar to Longwood, is that something that\u2019s on your agenda?","Joel Marcus","Not necessarily. I think on the big construction project in the Binney Corridor we would be looking at a large construction loan and mini perm takeout at about 100%. So that will cover a pretty sizeable chunk of that funding requirement. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be joint venturing anything, at least domestically in the U.S. of size in 2013 at the moment.","Quentin Velleley - Citi","Okay. And then just kind of on the West Cal, it seems that the rush pre-commitment is pretty small relative to the size of the project and I know you sort of covered it a little in your prepared remarks. But can you just sort of pull through what gives you the confidence that you can commence the project when you\u2019ve only got a very small amount of pre-commitment?","Joel Marcus","Well, I think having Roche there and the decision was made, the visit was made and the decision made by the CEO. He actually wanted to know when our next building; beyond that we have an option on the Northern Parcel, when that might be ready. So, I think that\u2019s initial commitment from their translational clinical group, but it is what it is at the moment. ","We feel very good that we have two relationships with biotech companies that we believe have a very high probability. We\u2019re actually in negotiations with each one on additional space, that could be as much as half a floor to floor piece and then we have a current tenant whose business has a milestone in the fourth quarter, and if that\u2019s reached, they\u2019ve requested and we\u2019ve started to work a proposal out between us for two floors, plus we\u2019ve got a very, very strong set of active showings to a range of different parties. ","So I think we\u2019ll end up probably over the next couple of quarters, I\u2019m pretty confident probably in the 40% range, so that gives us confident. We own the steel, we own the curtain, while we only have to go vertical and I think that gives us confidence, it made sense to kick off that project. It\u2019s also a time in New York where there is less construction going on. So the ability to buy out contracts and trades with the trades is somewhat more favorable.","Quentin Velleley - Citi","Okay, thank you.","Joel Marcus","Yes, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa from ISI Group. Please go ahead.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group ","Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess the main question I had was the one Quentin asked, so I guess we\u2019ll wait until December to get some more details, but Joel maybe you or Tom could talk a little bit about the demand up in Boston. I just wanted to kind of get your -- a little more granularity on what you guys are seeing in terms of either biotech pharma and possibly tech up in the Binney Street area and then I\u2019ll ask a question about San Francisco?","Joel Marcus","Yes. So I\u2019ll let Steve address that question, but let me make a preliminary remark. I guess what we\u2019ve seen in Cambridge over the last couple of months is a number of companies and this has happened in the San Francisco Bay Area to some extent as well. We call kind of the second generation of companies that are now commercializing in products, fairly large market caps, relative to the biotech industry as a whole. ","They will move to significant cash flowing entities and they need substantial space and that\u2019s really independent of the macroeconomic environment that\u2019s because of product approval. So we\u2019re seeing I think reasonable demand in Cambridge from those groups. ","I think when it comes to pharma, we know that Pfizer has made significant inroads in their work. MIT is doing a built-to-suit. We know they\u2019re looking potentially for more space. It\u2019s rumored that Santa Fe and maybe another one or two are looking at Cambridge for moving some additional research units there, plus there\u2019s a strong continuing evolution of early to mid-stage companies. ","That\u2019s the one market we see that in a pretty dramatic fashion. Not so much anywhere else. The Bay area to some extent, but other markets not so much. So Steve can give you a highlight on Tech and maybe his observations as well.","Stephen Richardson","","Yes, just to add to that Steve, I mean I think if you look at 400 Tech Square and the leasing that was done in the last quarter, that\u2019s pretty indicative of looking forward and you had Aramco lease a chunk of space. They absolutely wanted to be in this location, they were supporting MIT\u2019s energy fund initiative, so you\u2019ve got a classic case of a company having to be adjacent to these types of institutions, you couldn\u2019t get a better credit profile than that type of company. ","And then you have Warp Drive, early stage company, very exciting technology, great venture backers and again, wanting and needing to be in this type of location and we do actually have discussions and tours with a couple of technology companies as well. So similar to San Francisco, we do see that Cambridge has the mix of both tech and life sciences and we are experiencing that interest first hand.","Joel Marcus","Yes, I think in the work drive situation, there also is a Big Pharma that\u2019s I think both an investor and a strategic partner in that company, so you might think wow, a startup sounds kind of modest, but it\u2019s a pretty big startup and it has from day one not only substantial funding, but it has a partner and an investor from big pharma, which is actually likely the commercialization path. So we feel pretty good about that market. Do you want to take a crack at San Francisco, maybe the second generation?","Stephen Richardson","","Yes. Similarly in South San Francisco with the Onyx build-to-suit that will be nearing completion I think in Q1 next year, a couple of companies that are doing very well. The anchor tenant in the 409 Illinois building, FibroGen is advancing their science as well. They just had an orphan drug approval. So we are just very, very encouraged by that.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group ","Okay, and I guess this \u2013 I don\u2019t know if this relates to some of the comments you made earlier, but obviously companies like Boston Properties and Kilroy are getting some of these new development sites by Transbay and I realized there is some overlap in terms of the tenants that you might be talking to. But how are you guys looking at sort of the new development that might be taking place down in the SOMA area in and you do feel like there\u2019s any crossover tenants that kind of maybe looking at both areas?","Stephen Richardson","","Not in the near term Steve. Those are probably a good 30 months away in general and then Transbay is at least three to five years before that\u2019s going to ultimately be delivered and occupied. I don\u2019t necessarily see traditional tech companies considering more of a conservative traditional 60, 70 story tower type of facility. So at first Transbay, I don\u2019t see that being competition. I think it\u2019s just different location, different product type.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group ","Okay, thanks guys.","Joel Marcus","Thanks Steve.","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from Dave Rodgers from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Dave Rodgers - Robert W. Baird ","","Hey Joel, maybe you could just give us a little bit more color on the disposition market. Obviously you guys have had success this year marketing the properties and the land and getting it out the door. Talking about any changes in the asset type that you\u2019ve seen or any slowdown in the process if any. ","Then I guess maybe a broader comment going in to the December meeting. Give us your thoughts about the overall economic landscape with respect to being the time for you to start really accelerating dispositions? Should we expect to see a fairly sizable number relative to this year just given that you\u2019ve stabilized NOI, the redevelopments have stabilized, you\u2019ve got the leverage down and it seems like now is the time to do that, but that\u2019s my take, but I\u2019d love to hear yours.","Joel Marcus","Yes, well I think we\u2019ll probably be able to give you a chapter and verse come December 5, but maybe broadly on the disposition market and I\u2019ll ask Steve to comment, because he\u2019s pretty deeply involved in that. But I think when it comes to one set of dispositions, they really were generated in a suburban location by a user that really approached us saying, now is a great time. ","We had targeted this for disposition. We can\u2019t really say much about the details yet, because it\u2019s still in contract process, but that\u2019s a good example where our desire and their immediate need kind of collided in a positive fashion. ","In another situation, we see that there is a need to really move the product into a broader product type in another location and there we thought not really are our cup of tea, so we looked for a buyer who had both the skill expertise and the ability to put in additional capital and look at that really interesting different product types, so that kind of met time and circumstance, which was very beneficial I think. ","When Dean gave guidance last year at Investor Day for $112 million of asset sales this year, I think we\u2019ll clearly see that number very comfortably. But I think we were taking our time, because this is a product type that is not necessarily common to lots of buyers out there as far as basic knowledge, but I think we\u2019ve seen a good reception, and I think we\u2019ve got some good targets for the coming year, but Steve you can give your commentary.","Stephen Richardson","","Yes. So there\u2019s probably two buckets to think about in terms of dispositions. The first would be the land, and as we looked at the land sales, those were in high quality locations and really a reuse of the property in terms of zoning was able to be effectuated. So you had property that we had looked to be lab product over time, ultimately be viable for residential. In another case, I didn\u2019t require a land use change, but the technology sector was stronger in that area, so that viability enabled us to move forward in the land side. ","On the existing assets, I think it\u2019s important to note, and Joel mentioned it, again these assets are legacy assets, 10 or 15 years ago. That\u2019s where the industry was located in some cases and as they\u2019ve migrated away, we have a choice to make. Do we invest additional capital, does the product type maybe get a little bit afar from our core competencies and is it really a long-term strategic asset, and at that decision-making point, the ability to raise capital and deploy it to our urban locations rather than the former scenario was again one we just thought made good sense.","Dave Rodgers - Robert W. Baird ","Okay, thanks.","Joel Marcus","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Bilerman from Citi. Please go ahead.","Michael Bilerman - Citi ","Yes, I just wanted to come back to sort of the capital and leverage for a moment. Joel you talked about leverage being 7.2 times and wanting to have gotten to a 7 by the end of the year. Clearly the agencies have you where they want, probably in the mid-6 and I guess you sort of married that up with what a significant spend into next year. Why not be more aggressive at getting that leverage down now, to not have an overhang in the future as you embark on $650 million of spend next year?","Joel Marcus","Well, that\u2019s always a question of the hour, but I think that certainly based on what we have talked about from the last Investor Day and I think you certainly have represented one of the views there that has been important in our thinking. ","As we wanted to develop a run rate visibility, a earnings guidance visibility and I think a mode of operating that is not so much in and out all the time that there is a consistency and a predictability to it; so that\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019ve thought to try to be pretty careful and pretty methodical and pretty logical about what we\u2019ve done this year and in the next year. I think you\u2019ll see construction spend will start to tail off significantly in 2014. ","I think the agencies are pretty flexible frankly, as long as we are moving in the direction. I think we\u2019ll be held in good stead. I think Dean and I recently looked at leverage numbers of a lot of the REITs and it was actually surprising to me that a lot of them are actually operating at pretty good \u2013 when I say good, higher leverage levels than I would have actually even guessed. ","But I think we are pretty comfortable where we are. I think we might decide at some point, if something came out of the woodwork that we could accretively match that isn\u2019t part of our program today, I think we would do that. But I think we are comfortable. We are almost down to seven. I think we\u2019ll be right at seven or so next year, very close and I think as we see getting into 2014, we can easily gravitate I think into the 6.5, with the huge major on boarding of projects. ","I don\u2019t know that we need to go out and create a radically dilutive, $0.25 dilutive event, when we think from the sources we\u2019ve described and we can get there in a logical way. That\u2019s kind of how our thinking is, but others may have different views.","Michael Bilerman - Citi ","Well, I\u2019m just curious, because you mentioned 2014 of construction spending coming down, but then when you start to layer in, the Binney Street project and the eventuality of the North Tower, if the West Tower is indeed successful and being\u2026","Joel Marcus","That by the way is downstream.","Michael Bilerman - Citi ","No, but it would seem as though there is enough in the hopper to have another $600 million of spend. You talked a lot on this call about redevelopments going into land inventory. So it doesn\u2019t seem like that figure is going, $600 million, each of the last two years is going down significantly. It seems that that\u2019s going to be a consistent pace in terms of\u2026","Joel Marcus","Yes, I don\u2019t think so. I think again and remember too that we got kind of a cushion as Dean described it; future development projects in one or more of the buckets, so we tried to be conservative with some cushion in the 2013 numbers and I think 2014, I think really looking forward, the only really big project we would have would be Binney. I don\u2019t see us doing anymore large scale projects in the very near future. ","I think we see there\u2019s some interesting opportunities potentially for selective redevelopments, buying, locations maybe with them, stabilized income we could convert as opposed to large scale development, so I think we see that as probably more the business model matrix for 2014. So I think we\u2019re pretty comfortable on this glide path where we think it\u2019s working pretty well. ","We had a lot of feedback from Investor Day last year and certainly over the past couple of years and so we thought to try to again minimize that equity dilution. I think Dean and his team have done a fabulous job this year of managing it and I think he\u2019s given you and will give you great granular detail on December 5, but if you look at what we\u2019ve got next year, we think it\u2019s a manageable number. And obviously if we can get our NOI run rate up and our earnings projections going into \u201814 to look at nice reasonable growth in a no-growth environment, we feel pretty comfortable with that.","Michael Bilerman - Citi ","That\u2019s very helpful. Joel, you talked a little bit about the dividend in your opening commentary, about seeing what would be a solid increase. I guess how should we think about that level and then also, how would it impact free cash flow? I think Dean had talked about $100 million of free cash flow as a source of equity for deleveraging into fund, the development since next year.","Dean Shigenaga","","Yes. Well, I think the key is to share. The increase in cash flow is not just suddenly move it obviously all to a dividend category, because clearly it\u2019s the cheapest form of capital that we have. But I think if you look at this past year or so, what we\u2019ve tried to do at the board level is kind of restore a predictable stepwise increase in the dividend. ","Again ensuring future cash or ensuring on-boarding of cash flows and I think that\u2019s probably a similar run rate you\u2019ll see, and that still leaves us with at least about $100 million free cash flows for the coming year. Beyond that in 2014, don\u2019t know, but I think that the board\u2019s discussion for 2013.","Michael Bilerman - Citi ","Sort of, if this year is a 10% increase, that\u2019s what we should be thinking about for \u201813 at this point?","Dean Shigenaga","","Probably somewhere in \u2013 I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve looked at it instantly, but I would say somewhere in the 5% to 10% range.","Michael Bilerman - Citi ","Okay. And then just this last question, just in terms of understanding the comparing contrasting 409, 499 and your confidence level when you bought that asset vacant or half the asset vacant and the confidence level here in New York about going vertical on the second Tower and you talked a little bit about this previously. But how should we just sort of think about those two situations, because when you bought 499, 409 you were really confident about leasing that up pretty quickly. I guess how should we view the ability in New York about going vertical?","Joel Marcus","Yes, well I think on 499, I think our view is actually -- we try to provide and we are still as Dean mentioned, we are still sticking with our yield projection, but at the lower end, so I think what that shows is we still feel like we put adequate cushion into that lease up. We never thought it would be simple day one, but we thought that with the hospital\u2019s momentum it would go faster than it actually has, it kind of sucks that it didn\u2019t. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve changed our view that as Steve said its high quality and that will be successful. ","The street will judge us by not what we say, but obviously by what happens, but I feel pretty good about New York. I think Roche has been a big plus. We\u2019ve got some pretty great current tenant interest. One tenant is step forward. We know that there is one or two others that are in discussions internally about expansion space that could even be as many as three current tenants, which would be pretty amazing, but we\u2019ve got two biotech companies that have high probabilities. We are in negotiation, specific dollars and provision negotiation, and then we\u2019ve got pretty active showings with a whole range of\u2026 ","I did a trip last week to the headquarters of one major company. They are very interested. Don\u2019t know where they\u2019ll end up, but my personal view is they\u2019ll come to New York. So we see a lot of activity, but again, we only want to be judged by how we succeed, not what we say, but we feel comfortable pulling the trigger on that incremental spend, because we own, as I say we own this deal, the curtail wall. We just go vertical and we think it\u2019s a good time in New York to do that and that\u2019s been another reason we felt pretty comfortable with that. ","So I guess my level of confidence is pretty solid. Time will tell I mean if we did build the East Tower through the Lehman fiasco and the cliff of almost disaster before TARP kind of came on and so forth. So we managed to get through that and had a firm delivery date to full lease up. It took a year, which was faster, two years faster than we had gathered. ","So, I don\u2019t know it\u2019s a hunch, it\u2019s an instinct, it\u2019s a heal based on all the people we are talking to and I hope we are right and if we are wrong, then we\u2019ll get on the Street, we\u2019ll make that judgment, but we feel pretty good about it. I think having Roche as the anchor has been a huge plus from the quality and the efforts they are going to put forth in New York. So I think if we had no anchor, we never would have pulled this off.","Michael Bilerman - Citi ","Great. Thank you so much.","Joel Marcus","Yes, thank you.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. Mr. Marcus do you have any closing remarks?","Joel Marcus","Just to say thank you. We\u2019ll talk in February, and again, stay safe over the next day or two. Thanks everybody.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference.

My name is Vickie and I\u2019ll be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","And at this time I would like to turn the call over to Rhonda Chiger. Please go ahead.","Rhonda Chiger","Thank you and good afternoon. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company\u2019s Form 10-K, Annual Report and other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Joel Marcus. Please go ahead.","Joel S. Marcus","Thanks, Rhonda, and welcome everybody. With me are Dean, Steve, Peter, Marc and Andres and wish you everybody a very Happy New Year. On the fourth quarter and year-end, I think the quote at the beginning of the press release summed up, I think the year 2013 where it really demonstrated the return in strength of the core operations, completion of significant value-add Class A development projects in our AAA locations in our urban science and technology cluster markets and really the completion of many significant and important improvements in our long-term capital structure. I think what 2013 also showed us based on fourth quarter and year leasing is that the strong demand in these key cluster markets really has returned in a rather robust way and we're very pleased about that.","Our fully integrated smart teams in each of the regions obviously have a lot to do with the delivery of these results, and as Dean will talk more about the balance sheet, balance sheet is in very good shape to support solid and stable growth with continuous on boarding of our EBITDA from the value-add pipeline.","A few macro comments for 2013, many of you know it was really a banner year for biotech and pharma after a long drought. 46 U.S. biotech companies priced IPOs the most in 13 years and about $3.5 billion was raised as new money and venture funds, which had a few years of tough flooding. And, importantly to us, pharma has continued in an inexorable fashion toward their external innovation hub model into our core cluster markets and we benefitted pretty greatly by that. And, interestingly enough, small companies invented most of the big drugs that received approval in 2013 and I'm also pleased to report that 59% of all drug approvals by the FDA in 2013 were actually Alexandria tenants. So that's a great testament to our underwriting.","Also the emergence of several, I think huge, new classes of drugs and drug targets including the immuno-oncology area, the non-alcoholic liver disease area, which has caught fever lately, and then, importantly, RNA therapeutics. If we go on to operations and internal growth, the demand for our product in our core cluster markets, and really ARE as the premier landlord, hit an all-time high. We\u2019re pleased to report and Dean will talk about the solid same store results and we expect the same to continue in 2014.","Occupancy continues to be strong and we believe will continue to increase in 2014, and I think Steve will talk about leasing fourth quarter and 2013; an all-time high with solid spreads on those leases. Pleased to report, which is kind of interesting that Maryland actually had the highest leasing volume of all the regions in the fourth quarter with 391,000 square feet or 29% of all leases signed, a big change from the last few years. And San Francisco had the highest leasing volume for 2013 overall, almost 1 million square feet at about 27%. So that\u2019s all really good news.","External growth, we delivered the final redevelopment to Genomatica in San Diego and also about 189,000 square feet out of our West Tower at the Alexandria Center for Life Science, our flagship campus in New York City to tenants including Roche and NYU. We\u2019re working on new leases with a public biotech company and a private biotech company. We hope to report here in the not too distant future. And one setback we had was one set of negotiations with an existing tenant for expansion of about 30,000 square feet was deferred.","Moving on the 75\/125 Binney, ARIAD has confirmed they will proceed under the lease. They may or may not choose to sublease all or part of the smaller building, but it\u2019s pretty clear based on their own statements that the 26 Landsdowne property is functionally obsolete for their needs. In Longwood, we\u2019ve seen slower leasing than anticipated due to institutional concerns regarding NIH funding, which we hope will be restored over the coming year. And this really impacts the top tier not so much, but certainly any institutions other than the top tier, I think have to worry a lot, but since Longwood medical is really the five great hospitals, they aren\u2019t impacted nearly as much, but still they are concerned about the trend there.","So we\u2019ve got a new marketing push we\u2019re instigating this month, just a week from now and we\u2019re also seeing demand from the institutions potentially to buy condo pieces out of their capital budgets as opposed to leasing through the operating budgets. So let\u2019s see where it goes. Area strategic optionality for growth, we\u2019ve got, as you know, multiple platforms, which have enabled us to be opportunistic in Cambridge and San Diego regarding acquisitions over the last 90 days and we\u2019re pleased about that.","On the balance sheet, as many of you know, at Lehman we carried 2.5 million square feet of land at Mission Bay that\u2019s now been fully built or monetized and about 2 million square feet in Cambridge and about half of that is underway.","We achieved our investment grade rating and our target zone of leverage thereafter and we\u2019re pleased that we\u2019ll continue to onboard a lot of EBITDA from those projects and we\u2019re glad we carried those through the financial crisis, but it certainly wasn\u2019t easy.","Probably most importantly, ARE now has the full range of capital choices available and will utilize the most capital efficient and effective tools in our arsenal as we grow our earnings going forward in 2014 and beyond. And then, likely in 2014 we\u2019ll see land sales and land sales of joint venture that will likely involve multiple markets to take advantage of really an unusual current strong existing tenant demand coupled with the demand that\u2019s known in the market more broadly.","And then, finally a comment on the dividend. The Board will continue its policy to share increasing cash flows with investors as we maintain a low dividend payout ratio, I think about 60% at the year end.","So I\u2019m going to ask Peter Moglia to comment on some of the capital markets\u2019 matters.","Peter M. Moglia","","Sure. Thanks, Joel. So there were two notable trades from other investors in the third quarter and I\u2019m going to take you through them. One Kendall Square, 670,000 square foot, nine building office lab camp, located in Kendall Square, East Cambridge was sold by Rockwood Capital to DivcoWest for $395 million or $590 per square foot. The property is anchored by Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, which occupies approximately 80% of the property, but there is very little in the way of credit tenancies there. The majority of the tenancies really early stage life science and tech companies who enjoy the retail amenities offered by the property. We estimate the cap rate to be about 5.75% and understand that the property had close to 10 bidders in the final round, including real estate, investment funds, all domestic money; institutional money with operating partners and REITs.","So Alexandria looked at this property a number of times and now we are very pleased with the location. We dropped out really when the price became out of balance with the credit profile and the duration of the tendency. We also believe there is a lot of CapEx needed to update the building\u2019s infrastructure. So the price was just a little heavy for us.","245 First Street which is also known as Riverview and located in East Cambridge was sold by Equity Office Properties to Jamestown, which is a Core and Core Plus investor for $192.6 million or $647 per square. That property includes the Cambridge Life Science Center, which is a low-rise lab building, which is connected to an office tower that includes nine levels of above ground parking by a three-story atrium. The main tenant there is the Forsyth Institute, which is a nonprofit research organization and we estimate the cap rate on that sale to be approximately 5.9% and understand that there were three final bidders including a pension fund advisor, a public REIT and Jamestown, the ultimate buyer.","So, although this is a great location, actually very close to our 250 First Street property. We declined to pursue the opportunity because we felt the pricing expectations did not match the B quality of the profile of buildings.","So with that, I\u2019ll pass it over to Steve.","Stephen A. Richardson","Thank you, Peter. The solid core operating performance during 2013 in our key brain trust cluster locations is continuing as we work our way through the first quarter of 2014. The trajectory of the mark-to-market metric evidenced by the gap increase of 18.2% this past quarter is very encouraging, as it highlights the increasing value and strength of the company\u2019s core class A assets in these AAA locations. We\u2019ve seen a clear sense of urgency to secure and lock down space returning to the market as we\u2019re approaching high occupancy rates in each of our key clusters. This is translating directly to enhanced activity in our 2014 and 2015 roles. We have just 491,000 square feet remaining to resolve in 2014. We\u2019re only 3.3% of our operating asset base. Nearly half of that is concentrated in Boston and San Francisco, two of the hardest markets. We\u2019re also getting out in front of our 2015 rollovers and engaging in discussions with key clients and we\u2019ll move on to the details and activity in these clusters.","We\u2019ve seen the lease rates in Cambridge increasing approximately 10% year-over-year, and now range in the mid to high 50s for existing product with build-to-suit projects pricing at $70 triple net. We\u2019re tracking approximately 640,000 square feet of known life science demand with more behind it and another 1.6 million square feet of demand from tech users. The mark-to-market for rollovers this year excluding one legacy these is 7.5% and 14.6% on a cash and GAAP basis in Cambridge.","Moving over to San Francisco, the rents in Mission Bay have increased approximately 15% during the past year. They\u2019re now in the mid-40s triple net. We\u2019ve also seen that South Francisco submarket experienced lease rate increases in this range during 2013 and on a mark-to-market basis still remain 20% below historic levels. The mark-to-market for rollovers, we anticipate resolving this year in the Bay area will be slightly positive cash and a very healthy 10% on a GAAP basis. Demand remains very robust with 1 million square feet of life science and 7 million square feet of tech tenant requirements in a broader San Francisco to Silicon Valley marketplace.","San Diego\u2019s activity is highlighted by a decrease in the direct vacancy on the Torrey Pines Bluff growth of 144 basis points from 10.1% to 8.66% at a time when we have significant activity on our Class A spectrum project located on Science Park Road. Rents have increased 7% from last year to the upper 30s triple net in the submarket and we\u2019re currently tracking 1.2 million square feet of high-quality demand across the three key clusters in San Diego.","Moving back east to Maryland, we\u2019ve seen a steady increase from its trough. Joe had noted a key lease execution there and we anticipate mark-to-market rent with a healthy 10% increase for rollovers this year. And the regional team is tracking another 0.25 million square feet of demand with an emphasis on high-quality space.","Moving back to the northwest, the Seattle market is experiencing pent-up demand as we\u2019re tracking and engage with tenants seeking a total set of requirements of about 280,000 feet. We\u2019re extremely well-positioned with our development opportunities in the heart of South Lake Union, which, many know, is also experiencing a boom in demand from the tech sector.","Finally, wrapping up in the southeast, the RTP market has tightened considerably over the past year with the 190 bps decrease in vacancy to 10.6% and we\u2019re tracking about 90,000 square feet demand in the market and do anticipate a very healthy mark-to-market GAAP rents approaching 20% increases.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dean.","Dean A. Shigenaga","Thanks, Steve. Jumping right in, the same-property performance for 2013 was very solid, about $17.4 million or 5.4% on cash basis and up $6 million or 1.8% on a GAAP basis. Cash same-property performance for 2013 was driven primarily by our favorable lease structure, again 95% contained annual contractual steps in rent and 94% of our leases are triple net. Other drivers included lease up of temporary vacancy in the first of 2012 in Cambridge, at 790 Memorial and 300 Technology Square and rent commencement for Illumina in San Diego in October of 2012.","Briefly on value creation projects that were completed in the fourth quarter, we hit a major milestone with the completion in December and the delivery of the first portion of our second class A lab building in New York City. This delivery is about 12 months and two weeks after the delivery of a crane to the site in early December of 2012. Major construction activities and capitalization of interest is forecasted to continue through the remainder of the project. Overall yields are on track with our disclosures. In fact I think you\u2019ll find that we\u2019ll be well ahead, meaningful ahead when we're done with this project, but let us work through the remainder of the lease-up there.","We also completed the redevelopment of 4757 Nexus Center. 79% of the project was delivered at the end of October and the remainder of the project will be delivered over the next 18 to 24 months. I got a few comments on the balance sheet. First, the timing of closing the purchase of 150 Second Street in Cambridge resulted in debt-to-EBITDA at 6.6 times a year end. On a pro forma basis assuming a full period of EBITDA from the acquisition leverage is right on target at 6.5 times.","Timing of transactions, spending and EBITDA growth will result in some increases and decreases in leverage quarter-to-quarter. Our overall goals for debt to adjusted EBITDA and our fixed charge coverage ratio have not changed. These metrics will continue to range within reason quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year and our growth in cash flows and EBITDA will allow us to maintain solid credit metrics.","We increased our land sales target in our guidance at the midpoint by about $125 million related to the projected sale of a partial interest in certain near-term development land parcels. We also eliminated our prior guidance of $250 million of issuances of common equity through our ATM program in 2014.","The timing of the sale of an interest in certain land parcels is conservative and earlier than our previous common equity assumptions and therefore these changes resulted in no impact to our overall guidance in FFO per share. The remaining $125 million in sources of capital was an increase in debt.","On January 31 we repaid $209 million of our 5.6% secured loan related to our 1.2 million square foot campus at Alexandria Technology Square in Cambridge. Our fourth quarter annualized NOI was approximately $67 million, really double the NOI that was in place at acquisition. That really brings our cash yield on this project to 8.5% today based on our gross real estate investment to date. Our total unencumbered NOI as a result of repaying this debt will increase to 85%.","Outstanding debt under our bank facilities was reduced by over $600 million or approximately 32% since December 31, 2012. I\u2019d like to touch briefly on our strategy for bank debt outstanding on our credit facilities. As of 12\/31 we had about $1.3 billion outstanding under the three facilities, down meaningfully from this time last year. $950 million or 73% of our outstanding debt under the facilities is subject interest rate swap contracts with various swaps maturing through early 2017. We strategically maintain unhedged variable rate debt to provide flexibility to opportunistically refinance our debt.","Our interest rate swap agreements are considered from time to time and further mitigate interest rate risk of both in notional and in effect each month as well as extending swap contracts beyond 2017. We plan to repay outstanding borrowings each year under our $500 million unsecured term loan until the loan is repaid in full by its maturity in July of 2016. Repayment of this loan over the next few years will reduce our credit facilities by 16% to approximately 26% of total debt. Additionally as our capital structure grows over the next several years Bank debt will also become a smaller portion of our capital structure.","More importantly, we will continue to focus on improvement in our capital structure while we also focus on optionality that drive stable and solid growth in bottom-line per share earnings and growth and asset value. Lastly for guidance, we updated EPS diluted to a range of $1.75 to $1.95 and we reaffirmed our guidance for FFO per share as adjusted for 2014 at a range $4.60 to $4.80.","With that I\u2019ll turn it back to Joel.","Joel S. Marcus","","So operator, we\u2019d like to go to the Q&A at this point please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","Yes, thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take the first question that from Emmanuel Korchman with Citi. Please go ahead.","Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup","","Good morning guys. Joel maybe if we can focus on your life science investment platform for a second. You\u2019ve got a $140 million of investments on balance sheet I believe the majority of that\u2019s in private companies rather than public ones. And then I\u2019ll get mark-to-market on the balance sheet so, if were to take to the total value of sort of the investments that Alexandria has made over time. Where would that be versus that $140 million on the balance sheet?","Joel S. Marcus","Yes, that\u2019s a good question. Thanks very much. Maybe just one step back very useful to say why we do, what we do and that is we think really a couple of reasons one is, it gives us the strategic window into really breakthrough science and product opportunities that ultimately in many cases lead to tenancies. Number 2, it gives us an unparalleled knowledge of industry trends and how we should be thinking about Banks, three, it allows us the homes are skilled based and underwriting tenants and obviously very importantly our financial returns.","I think right now is that amount is about 1.7%, 1.8% of total assets, I think we\u2019ve got a solid ROI over the past number of years. I would say that given where the BATAC [ph] sector has gone over the past year or two. We would clearly be well above market on marking those, marking-to-market those private investments. We\u2019re participated in some of the most important companies and we know that those companies have huge upside and huge market opportunities. So we feel very good about we\u2019re positioned.","So I think the true impairments that we recognized shouldn\u2019t be at all looked out as an indicator of kind of where that value is today the two impairments one related to a company that actually started a number of years ago and that has been winding down over period of time and the other was a clean tech asset if you work 60 minutes in the North coastal couple of weeks ago that market has really not down as well. So, the core therapeutic life science investments have really done well and we are very comfortable with where we are on that. So I hope that gives you some color.","Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup","It\u2019s worth saying, but kind of ascribing a more fair value in our NAVs, how should we think about two times that $140, three times just if we want a sort of a more, fully big number?","Joel S. Marcus","","I\u2019m going to ask the account mister.","Dean A. Shigenaga","","Yes, I would say that the large majority of that investment portfolio is held at cost and you probably realize that over the years we\u2019ve been able to end up with significant liquidity events that have realized gains and I think in the backdrop of where life science, biotech companies are valued today you are probably comfortably at true-ups on cost and this is all historical rules, early entry point, investments on these underlying life science companies. So, I think on average there and like we said we took two charges that aren\u2019t reflective of the overall valuation.","Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup","","Thanks, Dean. And then, one other question for you maybe. What drove the decision to increase the land sales on the JV agreements rather than doing the A10 [ph] as we discussed in December?","Dean A. Shigenaga","Yes, I think part of this was now that we have gotten to a point where the balance sheet and on boarding of EBITDA will help our future, will really fuel and gives us a platform to grow now more consistently and certainly a bit likely we had for Lehman. It seemed to us after a lot of internal discussions and discussions with those outside that if we do not increase our share count this year through offerings it will, I think be a good demonstration that the company can grow nicely without relying on common equity.","And I think that was a little bit of the core of how we thought about it. I think you guys commented directly on the last call and asked that question and I think we have clearly given some very deep thoughts about and I think irrespective of whether our stock was at 60 or 61 or 70, we feel that by working with a joint venture partner who can provide us immediate capital and a flexible structure to help us monetize and ultimately on board cash from development parcels where we have the ability to tenant some of those properties today to the firm to later on doesn\u2019t make sense. That will be other thing that really drove the extraordinary demand in the market, some of which is known and some of which isn\u2019t. And I think those things kind of can do a confluence, but made us move in this different direction.","Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup","Perfect. Thanks very much.","Dean A. Shigenaga","","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","","We\u2019ll now go to Jamie Feldman with Bank of America.","Jamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Great, thank you. I guess speaking with the JV, can you just talk a little bit more about your progress and timing and size and what we should be thinking in kind of what you're seeing at pricing as well?","Dean A. Shigenaga","","Well, let me comment on maybe the targets. We have three buildings left to build in the Binney Street project, 50, 60 and 100 Binney totaling almost 1 million square feet. We know there is significant demand in the market. We also have some significant demand from tenants of ours. We\u2019d like to move that forward. So that would certainly be higher priority, but as you know we\u2019ve got them. We just delivered the Biogen Idec transaction at 225 Binney and we\u2019re all underway at 75, 125 for ARIAD. So having a partner who would provide us significant amount of capital for the other Binney projects is very desirable. Similarly in Seattle where we know there is immediate demand, those would be the other locations that we\u2019re interested in.","We have to-date, I think about eight meetings, very high quality, you might call blue-chip investors, were working on CDAs and turned the deals beyond that I don\u2019t think I want to speculate about the nature of those discussions or the terms that are being talked about, but I would say it\u2019s fair to say we joint ventured the Longwood project back about a year or two ago Peter led that effort with a high-quality investor in Clarion 50% of that transaction. So, I think we have knowledge and the skill base to bring on a very high quality investor that has kind of a D&A thinking about how we think and so that\u2019s kind of where we\u2019re headed here.","Jamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And now getting back to your private investment portfolio, what would be the timing where you would set to harvest some of that value?","Joel S. Marcus","","We do kind of continuously and we\u2019ve seen a lot of, you might think about this and this goes back to the question many asked gains are conservative guide by nature. So I won\u2019t overrule this max number, but if you think about we have quite a few private investments, some of which have gone public or in the processes of going public, so that gives us a nice opportunity, once they do, goes to market and then also obviously to think about are there times where we would access most IPOs you are generally locked up 180 days. But I think we\u2019ve had very good results and we are very comfortable with where we are.","Dean A. Shigenaga","Yes Jamie, then I think I can add this, if you look back the last couple of years we probably averaged somewhere between gross gains, somewhere of $10 million to $15 million and sometimes larger than that. So, it\u2019s been a pretty consistent opportunity to realize gains over time.","Joel S. Marcus","And those were tougher years because the market wasn\u2019t nearly as buoyant as that has been over the last year or so.","Jamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay. So did you include any of that in your guidance?","Dean A. Shigenaga","There\u2019s always based run rate of recurring gains from the investment portfolio quarter-to-quarter so yes.","Jamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Dean A. Shigenaga","Any large, in a case like Jamie, we hit some home run like we did in 2012 and we got that out, it was the large.","Joel S. Marcus","And we had an $8 million plus gain from Boston Biomedical. But I would say again we try to be careful and conservative on our guidance so let\u2019s see what the rest of the year rolls out to be.","Jamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay and then just final question sticking with the guidance. Dean, can you talk a little bit about the sensitivity I know you\u2019ve kept the range constant from your Investor Day, what will give you some upside here, or some downside?","Dean A. Shigenaga","Well I\u2019d say first off it\u2019s only been a couple of months. So, although things have improved, I would say generally speaking from the demand standpoint state that\u2019s remained healthy. I think it\u2019s just too early to think about change in our outlook for the year and as we go through the year we\u2019ll revisit. But everything is pretty much on track with our views that we shared with you on Investor Day.","Jamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay thank you.","Joel S. Marcus","Yes, thanks, Jamie.","Operator","Next is Dave Rogers with Robert W. Baird.","David B. Rodgers \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Company","Maybe talking about the New York asset a little bit more, I think both in the Investor Day and maybe last quarter you talked about a better run rate there, but you mentioned Joel in your comments that you set that with an existing tenant looking to expand. But let\u2019s talk about the backlog and demand there both domestic and internationally and kind of what you are seeing from that asset?","Joel S. Marcus","Yes it\u2019s kind of interesting you have to remember when we delivered the West Tower Peter negotiated the lease with Eli Lilly, but they were our anchor, but essentially there is no market there to speak up. We actually have had to create the market which we feel very good about. We took a risk, the Citi took a risk on us and I think it maybe big dividends for both. So, you can\u2019t look at market dynamics because they simply don\u2019t exists. So every single lease and every single tenancy, we actually have to force and really work on you can\u2019t just paying out for lease time expected to show up or market demand to go there so. It\u2019s not easy listing and I know I remember very clearly when we delivered the East Tower and we St. Louis there was some discontent among what the Street that said well how come you even leased it up well.","We have a three year lease-up and we did it in one, so we are pretty pleased this time, we\u2019ve got a two year lease-up and hopefully we can do it, a year from now we\u2019ll be hopefully done. But as I said, we are in least negotiations with one private biotech company we expect to move there another public company that we expect to move their non-existing tenants we\u2019ve got some internal demand from existing tenants we\u2019ve obviously been talking to Roche and others about expansion.","We do have a backlog of a couple of companies we\u2019ve got one big pharma that is they had a great year it is not now currently in New York, as far as research. But it\u2019s really too really to tell. So, I\u2019m not sure I can give you any more color. Over to Peter.","Peter Moglia","","I could just piggyback on to the pharma discussion for life science team in New York offices, probably averaging a day with a pharma company almost every month and so there is a quite a few with I don\u2019t Joel, if you want to comment on that.","Joel S. Marcus","","Yes, I wouldn\u2019t say anything more than that I actually have some meetings in Japan coming up in two weeks we have some real interest from Japanese pharma companies who haven\u2019t done research, some exists client of our same size or Cambridge asset-base and we\u2019re talking to a couple of others about potential New York research preferences but again still too early to tell.","David B. Rodgers \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Company","","Okay, thanks and maybe a follow up two parts to it as if I\u2019m trying to get it. First, any major tenant rollover this year that we should be thinking about and I guess kind of second to that would be, any plans to take any existing operating assets, either with an expiration or without and kind of put them into redevelopment this year, as the year progresses?","Joel S. Marcus","I think on the redevelopment side I think there is someone listed.","Dean A. Shigenaga","","Yes, that we have it on page 17 that\u2019s project is footnoted to on Page 17 it\u2019s Barnes Canyon Road we acquired that in the third quarter of 2013 and 67,000 square feet it did roll in January and it will undergo convergent into hi-tech office base for redevelopment and it is a 100% pre-leased. All the remaining space that we have expiring for 2014 aggregates about 491,000 square feet this excludes anything that\u2019s leased there or under negotiations that\u2019s highly anticipated to result favorably.","The remaining bucket is only I think the largest leases are somewhere in the 40, high 40,000 square foot range and they\u2019re only a couple of two or three of them at that range. So nothing significant rolling in 2014.","David B. Rodgers \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Company","I will just add to Dean and I had touched on that during my comments on a mark-to-market basis we are looking very favorable on those roles. It is pretty well distributed across the portfolio again with a concentration in Boston and San Francisco where we\u2019re using healthy demand. So, nothing out of the ordinary there.","Joel S. Marcus","Yes, I\u2019d say one thing that was different there was a new mill I traded with one region this morning we are starting to see interestingly enough, which we haven\u2019t seen maybe a decade tenants coming to us and saying gee, our lease rolls in 15% or 16% or 17% and we\u2019d like to try to tie-down space today. We haven\u2019t really seen that for a long-time it\u2019s actually been the opposite way, going to various tenants whose leases are coming up not this year, but over the next year or two to try to \u2013 I don't know that it's a blend and extend. Maybe a couple of years ago it's more blend and extend. Today it's just renewal, but we\u2019re starting to see that reverse inquiry now. We just had one very large tenant ask us to consider renewing right away and that is kind of a nice thing to see. So that's a good sign in the marketplace.","David B. Rodgers \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Company","","Great. Thank you.","Joel S. Marcus","","Yes. Thanks.","Operator","And next up is Jeff Theiler with Green Street Advisors.","Jeff Theiler \u2013 Green Street Advisors, Inc.","","Hey, good afternoon. It sounds like your best guess right now is that ARIAD comes in and subleases a portion of that space of Binney Street. Assuming that does happen, how does that impact the timing of the remainder of those Binney Street projects?","Joel S. Marcus","Yes, I won\u2019t speak for ARIAD. They\u2019re going to have make that decision, but we know we\u2019ve had face-to-face discussions and they\u2019ve indicated that they are going forward. I would say that when it comes to timing, our timing is right now delivery in the first quarter of 2015. So none of that\u2019s changed.","Jeff Theiler \u2013 Green Street Advisors, Inc.","The remaining buildings after that, is that pushback?","Joel S. Marcus","No. Actually I think if you listen to my commentary that I just gave on 50, 60 and 100 because there is such extraordinary demand in the market today our view is by bringing on a joint venture partner we can actually accelerate the construction of those projects, one or more operating those projects. So in my view those are going to be more advanced than we would otherwise.","Jeff Theiler \u2013 Green Street Advisors, Inc.","","Great, great. And then, can you talk a little bit more about the Cray Court acquisition? I guess what you saw in that and what the plan is for that building over the longer term, how long The Scripps Research Institute lease is et cetera?","Peter M. Moglia","","Sure. Jeff, this is Peter Moglia. So The Scripps leases that building for, I believe, another six years and so that was one of the drivers for the acquisition, but another main driver is that there is very little to that you can obtain in Torrey Pines and we\u2019ve really done a great job, creating a lot of value there with our Nautilus project and some of the other developments we\u2019ve done and it\u2019s \u2013 the rental rates have really grown up. And so, getting more products there was a priority for us and this is a very mission-critical facility for Scripps. It was designed, built for them and it has a very efficient design for NIH type of reimbursement. So it's going to be very hard for them to replicate if they were to go elsewhere. So we really think they're going to stick there for a long period time and it's also very close to their campus.","Jeff Theiler \u2013 Green Street Advisors, Inc.","","Great. That's helpful. Thanks very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll now go to Sheila McGrath with Evercore.","Sheila McGrath \u2013 Evercore Partners","","Yes. Good afternoon. Joel, we\u2019ve heard a lot about the positive rent growth in Cambridge and San Francisco. I'm just wondering if there\u2019s any way you can give us an estimation of how Alexandria\u2019s portfolios in place rents in those markets compared to current market, not just like what\u2019s rolling this year.","Joel S. Marcus","","Yes, I think Sheila it\u2019s probably consistent with what we\u2019ve talked about with the rollovers mark-to-market. So you\u2019re probably in that 10% to 15% range in both of those markets on a GAAP basis.","Sheila McGrath \u2013 Evercore Partners","Okay. And then, Dean or Steve, on the gap increases they were so large on new leasing. Was that the six steps in the rents were larger or were the lease terms? What\u2019s driving that unusually large increase?","Stephen A. Richardson","Yes, I\u2019d say it was primarily \u2013 well, all the leases were extending on the terms, but I would say that you had a couple larger leases within the year and the 10 to 15 year lease terms that were extended that really drove GAAP rent increases in 2013. If you back them out you\u2019re probably still in that 13% range on growth. So it\u2019s still a very strong year, but a little bit inflated by two large transactions.","Sheila McGrath \u2013 Evercore Partners","Okay. And then last question. Just looking at building 2 and the remaining lease-up, I think you disclosed in the supplemental through 2015. Could you just talk about any more insight into timing on through 2014 and into 2015, when you expect that building to stabilize?","Stephen A. Richardson","Which one are we talking about?","Sheila McGrath \u2013 Evercore Partners","Building 2. I think you said in the supplement, yes, in New York.","Stephen A. Richardson","In the West Tower? Okay.","Sheila McGrath \u2013 Evercore Partners","Exactly.","Stephen A. Richardson","All right. So we are currently \u2013 to give you some perspective, we have about 11% that\u2019s leased, but has not been delivered yet, which leases maybe 43% of the project on the second tower to resolve. And as Joel mentioned, we have some transactions that we\u2019re working through. So I think from a timing perspective, our goal would be to resolve most of the remaining lease-up over the next, call it, four quarters. We\u2019ll have a better sense as we make our way through the year and we\u2019re sitting here in Q1. So I\u2019m talking about into early 2015 we should have pretty good color on resolving the rest of the space. Now I\u2019m not talking about necessarily delivery, but hopefully moving the remaining space through negotiation and lease over that timeframe.","Joel S. Marcus","But keep in mind, our internal model, as we said in the East Tower, Sheila, was a three-year lease up. Right now we have a two year lease up and we just delivered first space at the end of December. So we hope to beat that.","Stephen A. Richardson","Sheila, we hope that we\u2019re conservative in our modeling as well. So I think there\u2019s upside from our own model to the extent we get ahead of our delivery timeframe.","Sheila McGrath \u2013 Evercore Partners","And so, given that the faster lease up on Tower 2 or West Tower, could you give us an update on how you are thinking about the auction parcel?","Joel S. Marcus","Wow, that\u2019s a good question. There is a new sheriff in town, I guess, who likes affordable housing. So I don\u2019t know. We actually approached the city pre-year-end under the Bloomberg administration thinking maybe there was something we could do to accelerate things, but they didn\u2019t really want to put anything into play. So we\u2019ve kind of gone back to the game book or the play book that says we got to finish the West Tower before we then approach them on the option parcel.","It\u2019s just hard to know, I mean honestly speaking if the city wanted to do something they could clearly designate that as residential, if they wanted to, although not sure how affordable what our views would be from that location. But we\u2019re hoping that the long-term interest of the city are aligned with ours that said they really want to continue to build the commercial life science sector and so we hope that will happen. But I would expect now that \u2013 now Bloomberg is out, I don\u2019t think there will be any earlier discussions with them given where we are in the West Tower.","Sheila McGrath \u2013 Evercore Partners","Got it. Thank you.","Joel S. Marcus","Yes. Thanks.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take the next question from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Carroll \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. How should we think about your near-term development opportunities? How many projects could we expect to actually break around in 2014 and 2015? It sounds like you are seeing some good activity obviously in Cambridge and there is strong activity in Seattle. Are there other any other markets that you can see some near-term opportunities?","Joel S. Marcus","","Yes, that\u2019s a good question and I think Dean and his team tried to put some really color to those opportunities. So if those of you who have got the supplement if you look at Page 30, that\u2019s the Kendall Square, Binney Street corridor assets. We\u2019ve talked about those. The next page is the Spectrum project in Torrey Pines Peter referred to. We\u2019re working on that. If you go by that project you\u2019ll see still moving along. We think there are a number of tenants, both existing and non-existent tenants that would want space. So that\u2019s clearly is moving forward. I think the Illumina campus, we certainly have discussions going on with Illumina there, continuing to grow. So I think you\u2019ll see progress there in the very near-term, same thing on Campus Point Drive. We have demand from one or two of our current tenants and we\u2019re underway with expanding and confirming entitlements there. So that would seem to be more of a near-term.","The next one is the 9950 Medical Center Drive in Rockville. For the first time we\u2019ve seen that market really change and we\u2019re getting relatively full in that market. I don\u2019t think we would ever kick off anything without a mostly lease situation. I can\u2019t imagine actually having building in Maryland again, but we are at a point interestingly enough where there seems to be both institutional and pharma demand. And so we\u2019ll see what happens, not sure how near-term that may be, but if we\u2019re moving forward with our design and confirmation of settlement.","And then Seattle Page 35, I think these are probably next behind Cambridge. There is great demand from tenants from the market including Amazon. So we\u2019d like to have a partner to help us finance that. And then, I guess the final one is 6 Davis Drive. There was an announcement yesterday by the Research Triangle Foundation that basically indicated they have just bought a large parcel right across from our parcel or our sets of parcels including the Hamner headquarters campus, right across the side from I-40. That\u2019s going to be an iconic headquarters of the Research Triangle Park and looks like they are going to pour a lot of money into that.","We\u2019ve seen some substantial demand from existing tenants. We\u2019ve got two builder suits. We\u2019re actually looking at right now, don\u2019t know how soon they may be, but they could go sooner rather than later. So I think you\u2019ll see a pipeline that will start over the next set of quarters or in the next year that will develop a nice pipeline of opportunities for us to harvest in the 2016-2017 timeframe. So a lot is actually going on. We haven\u2019t seen this much activity across all the markets in a long, long time.","Michael Carroll \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, great. And then I guess my last question is, Joel, you indicated that the ARIAD\u2019s space or at least the old space is functionally obsolete now?","Joel S. Marcus","Those are not my words. I think those are ARIAD\u2019s words.","Michael Carroll \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","","Okay. And can you give us color as is that obsolete to most life science tenants, or is that obsolete for ARIAD and now I guess that\u2019s not your space obviously. So, can you talk more generally about the Cambridge market of how much space in the market could be obsolete or near obsolete?","Joel S. Marcus","Yes I\u2019ve been into 26 Lands Down many times. I\u2019m not sure that I currently have the knowledge of how the systems are functioning, ARIAD has been historically a pretty heavy chemistry user. So that\u2019s an issue. And I think obsolete for their transition from a small company to a commercial stage company. So it may \u2013 there could be functionality in the chemistry side and there could be functionality just for the nature of the stage of the growth of the company. And so I am not the best one to ask about that, I think if you look at overall space in the market I think you have to look at really I would say space in Cambridge is the only space you could look at that could be functionally obsolete as some of the Vertex space that we heard is going to be going to office. But I think Tom Andrews could probably give us better details on a property-by-property.","But remember, our experience up in Seattle we sold the Old Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center we bought it as a converted hospital many years ago. Those systems actually lasted since the 1970. So, these buildings, are built if they have done right, they have a long-term, re-leasable, reusable and if they are maintained well functionality for many, many decades.","Michael Carroll \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, great thanks.","Operator","We\u2019re now going to Steve Sakwa with ISI Group.","Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group","Thanks good afternoon. Joel or for maybe Peter, could you just wonder kind of circle upon kind of some of the assets sales and pricing, I guess I wanted to come back to the Kendall Square deals and the other transaction that was mentioned. And then maybe if you could touch on the Skanska deal. But if you kind of look at kind of cap rates, price per foot and you talked institutional capital partners. What do you think the unlevered IRRs or the institutional partners want and what do you think the unlevered IRRs were for the two deals that you passed on?","Peter M. Moglia","Good question Steve. I have talked to a number of institutional investors and I have read a number of surveys about what people are underwriting to and I\u2019d say generally for core people have dipped below seven probably six to seven on an unlevered basis for core products out of the 100 basis points plus for value add. So I would guess, that I know that the one Kendall Square, sold for a price that was probably a good 20% higher than we had originally thought it might go for. And I ran some numbers on that. I would guess that that IRRs is probably vertex, but I am not sure. I mean obviously I would, I might have a more conservative deal rents than the buyer, so we\u2019ll see. But that was obviously a very healthy trade.","The 245 First Street, that is a very good location as I mentioned, but it\u2019s a hybrid building, it\u2019s kind of funky if you went there you would look at it and it seems like a big brother and a little brother attached holding hands by an atrium. It\u2019s just kind of a weird looking building and the parking goes like nine storeys above ground and if you look at it and you go while to that location, but I wouldn\u2019t want to take an investor on a tour and show him this. So that thing traded at sub six Cap which is a good news for the market, but I do know that there was some sub few little leases in that wrap order below market. So I\u2019m sure that the buyer there is going to get at least their seven IRR. Did I answer your question Steve or is there something I also need to touch on?","Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group","No well you did for those two I was just curious as you guys looked at the Skanska Building that you recently purchased. If you could just remind me kind of on the price, the cap rate and maybe what you think the IRR is \u2013 IRR is on that purchase?","Dean A. Shigenaga","","Right, I don\u2019t comment on IRRs that we are achieving, we did give a lot of disclosure on the yield. But I believe the purchase price was $94.5 million, and then. Yes, $94.5 million, it was $767 of foot. That is fairly healthy price per pound, but considering some of the New York type of trades that you see that exceed $1,000 of foot and the high rents that you see for large space in Cambridge I think it\u2019s an appropriate price per pound. Stabilized yield will be 7.3% and that will be achieved sometime in August of 2015 when the free ramp from the existing tenants burns off. You may not know, but foundation one of the tenants was pulled from One Kendall Square and they got a pretty big free rent package in order to come over there and so that needs to burn off. And we also have another 18,000 square feet of leasing to do. So we anticipate we\u2019ll get that all resolved by August of 15 and will be cash flowing at 7.3% at that point.","Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group","Okay, thanks for the clarity.","Operator","And there are no other questions. So I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to Joel Marcus for any additional or closing remarks.","","Joel S. Marcus","Okay, thank you operator, thank you everybody for taking time.

Actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company\u2019s Form 10-K, annual report, and other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Joel Marcus. Please go ahead.","Joel Marcus","Thanks, Rhonda, and welcome, everybody, to the second quarter conference call. With me today are Dean Shigenaga, Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia, Krupal Raval. I guess I would like to start out with a bit of a macro view for I guess the second quarter which really epitomizes \u2013 I think where we see things today from a strategic advantage point. And that is scientific advancement as a team froth that can be best done in a bio-pharma hub with multiple players that\u2019s what Boston is to us.","And this was a quote recently in a interview by Elias Zerhouni he was President of the Global Research at Sanofi and as many of you know he was former head of the NIH, who really pioneered translational research in areas best positioned to take maximum advantage of this. I\u2019d kind of like to label the macro industry comments today, what I\u2019d call the gathering pipeline momentum. We\u2019re witnessing a perfect explosion of biotech products, earnings and expansion, really what I call the biotech business. And just to name a few companies that are participating, many of which are our clients, Amgen, Celgene, Biogen Idec, Gilead, Alexion, Vertex, and Onyx.","If you look at the markets, the Supreme Court\u2019s confirmation that the constitutionality of essentially Obamacare will move U.S. to full coverage of over 300 million people, which means the market, will be increasing and clearly the increasing of the emerging markets is \u2013 where big pharma is heavily focused as well. Last year, the U.S. spent $320 billion on medicine, so there certainly is a robust business.","Today\u2019s climate is actually a lot better than you might think the FDA\u2019s been doing over the last year or two, a much better job, I think from the industry perspective, a job of \u2013 approval of new medicines. And if you look at through today 7\/31\/ 2012, 18 drugs have been approved and an amazing 50% of which were ARE client tenants. The PDUFA law that was just enacted, included some very important helpful attributes for the biotech and the pharma industry, including confirmation of 12-year data exclusivity, fast track approval for new noble drugs which we were involved with and I think it\u2019s also fair to say that based on what we hear from Washington, it appear that the NIH will be spared cuts if we get an election that makes sense here. So, we\u2019re hopeful about that.","From the technology standpoint, the lifeblood of biotech and pharma, we\u2019re seeing really a variety of emerging new highly disruptive first-in-class drugs including things like small molecule inhibitors for cancer stem cell, which really potential have the ability to someday reduce or maybe even eliminate radiation in chemotherapy. So, the outlook, we\u2019re really entering a second wave for biotech\u2019s successes and we\u2019re extremely well-positioned as the leader in each of our key adjacency submarkets to take maximum advantage of this second wave expansion.","Moving to the balance sheet and capital allocation. I think it\u2019s clear and Dean will speak to this a bit. Our goal over time is as we\u2019ve said is to operate in about the 6.5 times debt-to-EBITDA range, achieved through a variety of strategies including on boarding of additional NOI continued use of the ATM and pay down of debt, continued sales of selected non-income producing land parcels, you\u2019ll see some coming up here in the third quarter, and we\u2019ll likely see an equity partner for Asia operations to share CapEx for what we consider to be a big opportunity.","We see significant near-term opportunities to take advantage in \u2013 of two converging macro forces of pharma penetration of our adjacency clusters as we\u2019ve referred to and now the emergence of this second wave of biotech expansion, primarily Greater Boston, San Francisco, and New York City. We\u2019ll selectively continue to allocate capital including recycled from suburban asset sales including some even closed today to our core cluster development sites with quality tenants where yields are significantly better than prevailing cap rates on sales of stabilized assets in such submarkets. So, there is a real good business there.","And in the second quarter, we did acquire a modest redevelopment site in the AAA location in Torrey Pines for almost $14 million. When we look to the second quarter internal and external growth, I think one thing that is I think we\u2019re very proud of and kind of an amazing statistic is an astounding 48% of our annual base rent from investment grate tenants.","Once again and Steve will speak to this, we had very strong leasing quarter, almost 960,000 square feet with pretty solid staff, Boston kind of won the price 29% of leasing, San Francisco about 22% and Maryland about 18% and this included landing the new NIH\u2019s mission critical MCATs requirement, which we\u2019re very proud of. Other than East Jamie and the Gates Seattle Headquarters conversion and gain Steve will talk a little bit about this. We had solid returns on development and redevelopment. We have pretty solid returns on our India projects and with pretty high level credit and we\u2019re working on expansion there.","South China, which was originally a failed joint venture with a U.S. and European firm, really represented our first test case, could we actually build a building in China ourselves and then ultimately lease it. It\u2019s about a 300,000 square feet two building flex manufacturing complex in South China. Hopefully after we fully lease it up, we\u2019ll exit that asset and it\u2019s a non-lab asset.","In Northern China, we\u2019re working on technical infrastructure, working hard to lease that development and the challenge in China, as I\u2019ve said a number of times is the incentive system it\u2019s when you bring a client to China there about 30 offers to go all over the country. I was just last week in Beijing and that within officials to ensure that we have an incentive scheme in place to land some of our important tenants, so stay tune there. Steve will talk a little bit about 499 Illinois.","We do continue to be disappointed with the slowness of lease up of this asset, particularly in light of strong tech demand in the Bay Area and we hope as we enter the third quarter, we\u2019ll see a little bit more robust \u2013 and certainly into 2013 and our core internal growth, but we understand we are obviously in the dramatically slower growth, macroeconomic environment.","So with that kind of as a setting, I\u2019m going to ask Steve to do bit of a detailed review of our leasing this quarter.","Steve Richardson","Hello, everybody. I\u2019ll talk about the leasing activity on key projects, the 2012 rollover status for the balance of the year, and then a little preview on the 2013 rollovers. Really the emphasis for our fully integrated regional leasing and asset management teams in the second half of this year will be an intense focus on the three critical development and redevelopment projects we have outstanding.","The first one is 499 Illinois. We do continue to have conversations with tech companies and life science institutions, but no active negotiations are underway as Joel mentioned and that is a bit disappointing. However, the Veterans Affairs lease of 51,000 square feet of lab space at 1700 Owens was indicative of Mission Bay\u2019s continued strong appeal and a must-have location for life science companies and we continue our aggressive pursuit of a quality anchor tenant for Illinois. The UCSF Hospital continues to bring a strong sense of completion to the southern portion of Mission Bay. As the curtain wall is nearly complete and a substantial nature of this facility is becoming very evident.","The technology companies continued to gravitate and growing SOMA and MDMA primarily to be amongst their peers and given the right opportunity, we believe an anchor tech tenant would change this dynamic for attracting these types of tenants to Mission Bay. The tech sector is clearly focused on SOMA and MDMA and its driven really by three factors. First, the immediate adjacency to the bart or a caltrain transportation lines. Second, the mature amenity infrastructure and third, the more edgy urban nature of the setting in the buildings as they are appealing to a younger demographic there.","The second project in Cambridge at 400 Tech Square has us very pleased. We have serious negotiations underway with letters of intent signed with two prospects totaling another 50,000 square feet that would boost occupancy to approximately 80% in this 212,000 square foot facility, and we\u2019re hopeful to have those leases consummated by year-end. Kind of more detailed floor-by-floor review of this facility looks like the following.","The lower level in the first quarter substantially leased to Reagan and Alexandria\u2019s regional offices. The second, third and half of the fourth floor are anticipated to be leased to the two prospects mentioned above. After the fourth floor and a fifth floor lease to (inaudible), and Reagan has the action on the sixth floor and leases the 7th, 8th, and 9th floor and the 10th floor is currently being marketed.","Moving back over to the West Coast, 1551 Eastlake, we do have early discussions underway with an important current tenant of ours, for 30,000 to 40,000 square feet on the second and third floors that would bring occupancy up to approximately 90% by year-end in this 117,000 square foot building. Again a floor-by-floor review, we have the lower level in first floor leased to the Puget Sound Blood Center, a portion of the second floor is leased to Adaptive TCR and the balance of the second floor is in discussions with the tenant that we noted above. The WBBA hub for the life science industry activities that is really energized this building in this is part of sells Lake Union leases a portion of the third floor and the balance is actively being marketed.","Looking over the next two quarters at the 2012 rollover status, we started the year with 694,000 square feet of leases remaining to be resolved and the regional teams have worked very effectively to reduce that figure to just a 178,000 square feet as of June 30, 2012. The majority of the final lease rollovers are concentrated in the following markets and we expect them to be resolved in a satisfactory passion.","We have 40% in the Greater Boston region, more specifically about 26,000 square feet in Cambridge where demand is very strong and lease rates for these particular spaces are in mid-$40s. There are 12,000 square feet in Waltham along Route 128, where demand is also healthy and lease rates are close to $30. And then other 30,000 square feet in Wister in the Route 495 Corridor, where demand is weaker in lease rates are in the mid-$20 range.","We have another 20% in the San Francisco region, primarily comprised of three leases in Mission Bay, where demand is strong and it looks like one of the tenants right now would renew and we\u2019re starting conversations with a tenant for the balance of the space and lease rates remain steady in the mid-$40s. Another 20% in the Seattle region substantially located in one facility in the Pill Hill submarket. Lease rates for product in this submarket are in the $20 range, but are generally in the mid-40s for the South Lake Union submarket where most of our asset base is located and where demand is the strongest.","Finally, the San Diego and Suburban DC markets comprise the balance of our renewal and the leasing activity up across the country and Sam Diego\u2019s demand has in fact slowed from its toward pace during 2011, but is still steady with lease rates ranging from the mid-20s to mid-30s and Suburban DC\u2019s demand remains weak, although we did have a few highlights for this quarter with lease rates in the $20 range.","Just real quickly a preview for 2013, we have a total of 1.2 million square feet of rollover slated for the year and we are in active negotiations for more than 300,000 square feet. The remaining 900,000 square feet is too early to forecast in a definitive fashion, but as a framework those remaining roles are concentrated in the following markets.","200,000 square feet in the Greater Boston market with a mix of suburban and urban facilities. 220,000 square feet in the Bay Area market spread pretty evenly throughout the Stanford South San Francisco in Mission Bay clusters, at a 130,000 square feet in the San Diego market primarily in the Sorrento Valley and Sorrento Mesa market, about a 190,000 square feet in the Suburban DC market distributed across its submarkets another 61,000 square feet in Seattle, again principally in the Pill Hill submarket and finally about 50,000 square feet in the North Carolina market.","I will provide additional details on the 2013 goals as we approach the end of the year and with that I\u2019ll hand it over to Dean now for further commentary.","Dean Shigenaga","Thanks, Steve. Let me jump right into our core operations. Second quarter 2012 NOI was slightly ahead of our expectations at about $103.8 million. This is before the $5.8 million realized gain in other income and that NOI is up from the $101.4 million for the first quarter of 2012. The increase in NOI was driven across multiple properties and included value add project delivery slightly ahead of schedule, the acquisition of the property in San Diego, earlier lease up of a few suites in Boston and delivery of space in India to the top tier pharmaceutical company.","Our overall occupancy including space undergoing redevelopment in the Greater Boston market was about 85% as of 12\/31 and about 83% as of 3\/31. We have leased and delivered space as a result in an increase in overall occupancy including our redevelopment space to approximately 84.1%. We anticipate further improvement in overall occupancy in Greater Boston in the second half of 2012.","The occupancy gains were realized through quick re-tenanting at 300 Technology Square and through occupancy gains at 790 Memorial Drive and 99 Erie Street, all of which are located in Cambridge. Overall occupancy including space undergoing redevelopment in San Francisco Bay was approximately 96.7% as of 12\/31 and 93.9% as of 3\/31. We have an increase in overall occupancy through lease up to 94.7% as of June 30, really through short-term tenancy for temporary space for Onyx while we complete to build-to-suit development.","Occupancy in a Suburban Washington D.C. market reflects the anticipated rollover of 97,000 square feet related to one tenant that occupied a mix of office, warehouse and laboratory space in a non-core submarket. As previously highlighted, we expect this space to require several quarters to release.","Same-property growth in NOI for the second quarter was down 0.2% on a cash basis and up 1.6% on a GAAP basis. Same-property cash performance would have been stronger this quarter. However, last year, one tenant had a larger contractual payment due under the release of approximately $2.5 million, driving up cash same-property performance in the second half of 2011 to 9.4%.","Overall, same-property occupancy was flat to up slightly, but does not reflect some vacancy absorbed during the quarter. During the quarter, we absorbed some vacancy temporarily in San Francisco and in Boston and these vacancies resulted in lower expense recoveries and cash same-property performance. Straight-line rents for same-property is also decline resulting in higher cash NOI due to the start of approximately $5.7 million of annual cash rents from one lease, which the cash began in February of 2012.","We also had a couple of other leases with slightly higher steps in cash rents one in San Francisco on and one in Maryland. Same-property operating expenses increased about 4.5% primarily due to increases in recoverable repairs and maintenance by approximately $900,000. Excluding this increase in repairs and maintenance same-property operating and expenses increased about 1.6%.","We\u2019re expecting stronger same cash \u2013 cash same-property performance in the second half of 2012 primarily due to the recovery of occupancy in the Greater Boston market. In addition, same-property performance for the second half of the year will not be impacted by the larger contractual cash payment received in the first half of 2011.","Moving onto our value-added projects, during the second quarter we completed the redevelopment of 98,000 square feet at John Hopkins Court, for an affiliate non-profit entity of Novartis and a leading industrial biotechnology company, at yield slightly ahead of our original estimate. Cash yields were 8.9%, up 30 basis points and GAAP was 9.1% up 10 basis points. We also completed the development of 26,000 square feet in Canada for GlaxoSmithKline, also, it yield slightly ahead of our original estimate. Cash yields, ended up at 7.7% and GAAP at 8.3%, both up about 10 basis points.","We also updated our total cost to completion for our development at 225 Binney Street in Cambridge, by $17.7 million as a result of certain design requirements for Biogen. The increase in this cost will generate a return and as a result does not impact our overall estimated yields for cash and GAAP of 7.5% and 8.1% respectively.","Lastly, we updated our revenue forecast for our redevelopment project at 1551 Eastlake in Seattle and our estimate of cash and GAAP deals to about 6.7%. Our revenue assumptions were updated that reflect about 17,000 square feet of this project, ending up this pure office space at office rents. And we expect our lab tenants to expand into this space over time at which point we\u2019ll generate triple net live rents. Our yields also assume higher concessions of free rent.","As of June 30, we\u2019re 75% leased on 954,000 square feet undergoing development in North America and 76% leased we\u2019re negotiating on 812,000 square feet undergoing redevelopment in North America.","Moving on to our balance sheet as of June 30, we had approximately $1.1 billion of availability under our unsecured line of credit and about $81 million of cash and cash equivalents. During the quarter, we closed a construction loan for our development project in South San Francisco, with commitments aggregating $55 million. Funding under this loan began in July, and the loan is expected to cover the remaining cost of the project.","During the quarter, we issued approximately $40.5 million under our At-the-Market common stock offering program. As of quarter end and as of today, we have approximately $209.5 million available under the program. We expect the remainder of the program to be utilized over four-quarter period for funding a portion of the equity needs related to our value-added development and redevelopment projects. As disclosed in our first quarter earnings call, in April, we also completed the amendments to the pricing and maturity date of our unsecured line of credit and redeemed our Series C preferred stock.","Moving on to the asset sales. Again, we remained very focused on our asset sales target for $112 million for 2012. In summary, we completed $33 million as of June 30th located in Boston and Seattle. $22 million as of June 30th was under contract, $8 million of which was sold in July and that was located in the Route 495 Suburbs of Boston. That left us with about $56 million remaining as of June 30th. Today, we completed the sale of two assets located in Pennsylvania for about $20 million. The PNS for this deal was just executed and as a result this transaction did not meet the criteria for held-for-sale as of June 30th.","We also have about $15 million related to asset up in San Francisco that we expect closing later this year. That leaves us about $21 million to resolve and we have a number of assets moving along to cover this amount.","We are also focused on continuing our asset disposition program into 2013 and we plan to provide an update on our target disposition amount later this year. 2013 asset sales will likely be form a range of markets including Seattle, San Francisco, Maryland, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and San Diego.","Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 7.1 times or 7.6 times excluding the $5.8 million realized gain from an equity investment in the life science entity. We remain committed to lower leverage and will require capital to balance our incremental construction spending over time. Some of this capital will come from land and operating asset sales and some from equity or through our ATM program. Our debt-to-EBITDA will also benefit from the significant amount of NOI and EBITDA contribution through the fourth quarter of 2012 and thereafter from the delivery of our significantly leased redevelopment and development projects. Again our goal over time is to improve our debt-to-EBITDA, their sub 6.5 times.","Lastly on guidance, our guidance for 2012 including the fourth quarter of 2012 reflects the significant leasing status of our active development and redevelopment projects. East Jamie Court is now 78% leased, four development projects are a 100% leased and we are working on the lease up of Illinois. Our redevelopment projects are now 76% leased are under negotiation. One lease under negotiation is for 91,000 rentable square feet and is expected to be executed this week.","We updated FFO per share guidance for 2012 for $5.8 million or $0.09 per share of additional other income in the second quarter, primarily from an equity investment. We also slightly adjusted the range for interest expense net for the year by about $1 million, in the fourth quarter by about $500,000 and slightly adjusted the range for the fourth quarter NOI by about $0.5 million for the upper and lower end of the range. These slight adjustments reflect the timing of completion of construction and commencement of rent related to spaces aggregating about 75,000 square feet. No other significant changes in our overall guidance assumptions as highlighted in our press release on pages six through eight have been made since our guidance from the first quarter earnings.","Looking forward, again, NOI is expected to increase from the $103.8 million before the $5.8 million realized gain for the second quarter to a range from $110.5 million to $112.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2012. Roughly, 20% to 30% of this NOI growth will occur in the third quarter and 70% to 80% will occur in the fourth quarter of 2012.","We also provided a range for FFO per share diluted guidance for the fourth quarter of $1.15 to $1.17. NAREIT FFO per share diluted for 2012 was provided \u2013 our guidance was provided in a range from $4.32 to $4.36, again up $0.09 over our prior range for guidance related to the other income recognized in the second quarter. Our guidance for EPS diluted was $1.36 to $1.46.","Now in closing, as a remainder, we have reported NAREIT FFO per share diluted of $0.97 for the first quarter, $1.13 for the second quarter and we\u2019ve provided a range for the fourth quarter at $1.15 to $1.17. These figures result in a range for our third quarter 2012 FFO per share diluted of about $1.07 to $1.09 per share.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Joel.","Joel Marcus","Operator, we\u2019d like to open it up for Q&A if we could, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman, Bank of America.","Jamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America","Great. Thank you. Can you guys dig a little deeper on what\u2019s going on in Cambridge, I know when we spend some time out there, it seem like you had several development irons in the fire, I\u2019m just trying to get the latest thoughts on what\u2019s going on and is there something that\u2019s changing in terms of sentiment and people\u2019s specificity of signing leases?","Joel Marcus","No. I think, I would just say on the builder suite side, I\u2019d say stay tuned. I don\u2019t what to pre-announce anything, but we\u2019ve talked about significant demand there and our Alexandria Centre at Kendall Square, one on the Binney Street quarter I think has been the target of quite a bit of interest of a range of this kind of second generation biotech companies that are experiencing significant commercialization today. So I think that is unchanged and I think you will see some of that manifests itself and unfold pretty soon.","I think when you get back to the Tech Square area and overall just demand, then I think as Steve said, we\u2019re seeing pretty strong demand. My guess is, we\u2019ll be out of space at 400 Tech Square by the end of the year. We\u2019re already assuming we sign leases for these two latest LOIs that have been signed, that gets us pretty close to where we what to be. So we\u2019re seeing kind of continuing solid demand in that market, I don\u2019t know if Steve has given other comments or thoughts.","Steve Richardson","Yeah, I mean, using 400 Tech Square specifically we talked about the stacking diagram, I mean once you start factoring the option in that rig and has their \u2013 and we\u2019ll just have 10,000 feet or so left on the top floor assuming Ragon did move forward with that. So, it continues to be a very, very healthy market.","Joel Marcus","Yeah. And Ragon just for those of you, who don\u2019t know it\u2019s a nonprofit institute of Massachusetts General Hospital and the other two LOIs that we signed, one is a very large credit tenant and then the other one is a kind of an emerging company, but I\u2019d say the demand is coming heavily overall from, the big demand is coming heavily from the second generation of companies that are experiencing kind of the commercial stage. So it stays strong. I\u2019m a little less focused on the tech sector there. I don\u2019t Peter, Steve if you guys have any comments. I think it\u2019s still pretty strong, but I haven\u2019t seen many anything specific that I could comment on.","Dean Shigenaga","I haven\u2019t seen anything announced recently, but obviously Google and Microsoft have grown, I think Microsoft actually took more space at Cambridge Center that was the last deal that was announced.","Joel Marcus","So, I don\u2019t know that\u2019s helpful color Jamie?","Jamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America","Yeah, definitely. And then, switching gears Joel, congratulation I guess and Board of Directors for the NIH, the foundation with NIH.","Joel Marcus","Thank you very much. I appreciate that there was a high honor.","Jamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America","Good.","Joel Marcus","I\u2019ll do. I\u2019ve been considered.","Jamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America","So can you talk a little bit more about what that means in terms of what you\u2019ll be doing and your time commitments and how we should think about that related to ARE?","Joel Marcus","Yeah. I wouldn\u2019t say that you know it\u2019s a quarterly board meeting in Washington, but I would say I\u2019m kind of a 24\/7 guy, so it won\u2019t have any impact what so ever. Other than it gives me a chance to interface directly with the \u2013 and we have at our recent conference with Francis Collins and a number of the people who were on the Hill requesting NIH funding. So, in a sense it gives us a direct pipeline to that discussion negotiation between the NIH and the government and Congress as far as continued funding for critical stage, basic research here in the U.S. So, I think it will be a big plus. But, yeah, it doesn\u2019t impact me David.","Jamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Yup. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa, ISI Group. Please go ahead.","Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group","Thanks. Good afternoon. Joe, I just want to know if you could talk a little bit about New York. I know there was a story about the New York Genome Center. And the fact that they had signed a 170,000 foot lease, down more in the \u2013 I guess, it\u2019s a little further south. And I\u2019m just curios that that type of tenant was something you could have looked out to kick-off the West project. The timing didn\u2019t fit or if there was just something about your project in that tenant that maybe didn\u2019t allow that deal to happen?","Joel Marcus","Yeah. Let me give you a may be a more macro view. I think that we see as I mentioned, the second wave of biotech commercialization successes coming to New York as well. We also see maybe even more importantly in New York, is really become an important destination for new research or development units of big pharma. And the Wall Street Journal documented that last year with Pfizer we\u2019ve seen it certainly in Lilly and Pfizer. It\u2019s clearly true that there are a number of pharmas looking to place a unit into the New York area. We think that\u2019s one of the most attractive targets that we would look at obviously internal demand from our existing clients.","Yeah, the New York Genome Center, I\u2019d say for two reasons, was not of great interest to us although I think it\u2019s great for New York. I think number one timing was a little too early for us and then secondly I think our own underwriting of that kind of an entity would basically say that we would be more comfortable seeing them move into a more robust funding environment than they are today. If you compare that to the \u2013 they kind of want to be a broad institute.","They\u2019re not there at, but maybe someday they\u2019ll work up to that. They don\u2019t have any anchored donors. At the moment, they\u2019ve just gotten donations from a number of the institutions. But you compare it what Steve mentioned in 400 Tech Square with Ragon. Ragon is fully funded institute of the Massachusetts General Hospital. That\u2019s kind of tenant we feel pretty comfortable about underwriting. So, for New York we just \u2013 for timing and for underwriting purposes we just weren\u2019t there.","Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group","Okay. And then secondly on page 33, I want to just thank you for providing a lot more detail on the kind of the China and India development projects that you\u2019ve got going, but it obviously kind of bags the question and you did allude to this that you\u2019ve got your two projects in China, but not really going forward. But I guess the cost seem excessively high for at least the project under development. I\u2019m curious if you could provide us the information for the operating property, I guess the roughly 300,000 that\u2019s open. Is that cost much different than $82 million that is expected to be spent on the other 300,000 foot building?","Joel Marcus","Yeah. They\u2019re fundamentally \u2013 I\u2019ll let Dean comment on the specifics, but they\u2019re fundamentally different projects. As I said, we started South China really with a U.S. company actually the requirement came out of the company that we\u2019re close to in the Mission Bay area, teamed with the European company and we then acquired this site \u2013 this land, it\u2019s a 50-year land use in South China kind of near Macau.","It\u2019s a region we wouldn\u2019t have normally gone to, but we decided we\u2019d use that our first ability to have our own team, because we don\u2019t joint ventures there, see if we could really build a product, and then once the joint venture fell apart and we kind of we\u2019re faced with, we\u2019ve got to finish this development, because in China when you sign a deal if you\u2019re a foreign company and you just don\u2019t go forward, you\u2019re not likely to do anything else in China. So, we wanted to kind of preserve reputation, and we\u2019re developing it. It\u2019s an area that really is a manufacturing and flex market, it\u2019d be kind of like an industrial area in the U.S. So, the costs there are considerably lower than we would expect if we built a lab product, but Dean can give you some highlights.","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah, just to give you some rough sense, Steve, I think if you think of what\u2019s in service, you probably have a roughly a 50-50 allocation between China and India just on the in-service assets.","Joel Marcus","But on that specific asset on cost on the Southern China.","Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group","Yeah, I guess...","Joel Marcus","Steve, you cut off. Do we have more color on the cost?","Operator","Your line is open, Steve.","Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group","Hello, can you hear me?","Joel Marcus","Yeah, let us work on that and we\u2019ll try to give you a little more color on the costs in Southern China, but we would see them to be considerably lower than building a lab building.","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah. I agree. We\u2019re probably about $70 a foot there in South China.","Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group","Okay. And then, Joel, can you just comment \u2013 it does look like your leasing activity in India seems to be much stronger. I think your lease \u2013 three building are 100% leased, one building is about two-thirds lease, but maybe just talk a little bit about the demand drivers that you\u2019re seeing in India. It did sound like you are much more optimistic about that market and it sounds like you might bring in a joint venture partner to fund that, how far along are you on that?","Joel Marcus","Yeah. So let me maybe just say one or two other things about China and then I\u2019ll speak to India. I think when it comes to China, we\u2019ve realized the basic challenge in China is less the demand in China, it is more the incentive system and Steve and I had both spent considerable time in China, I was just there last week. You bring a client over and literally that client once they go shopping in China can end up with a dozen, two dozen different offers from any number of economic development zones, cities, provinces and it creates a challenge of sticking of tenants.","So our view is, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be doing much more in China, but if we were ever to do it, it would have to be done on a pre-lease build-to-suit because otherwise, it\u2019s just a very hard goal, but we need to work out of the two projects we\u2019re on. We hope to complete them and ultimately, we would probably exit those projects.","In India, we think because you can actually own land, there is no government interference, there is, no real incentives. It is much more of a normal environment although India still is \u2013 it is an emerging world country. There is huge demand from really what we would consider to be life science, kind of the health science, industrial, uses of laboratories. We think it\u2019s a big opportunity in a number of clusters throughout the country. We like the South, but the North and the Northwest are particularly good. Delhi is an interesting location.","We\u2019ve tried to establish kind of critical mass. We\u2019ve got our own team on the ground. We\u2019ve put into construction and development a number of projects where we had \u2013 we tried to do a little bit like we did pre-crash, where we would try to meet existing demand with a product that we\u2019re actually constructing. I think going forward, we would really go-forward only a either 100% built-to-suite or a substantial prelease for future developments. But we think the demand is really substantial. It\u2019s a county of as you well know of \u2013 well over a billion people, healthcare is \u2013 and health science is an important part of what they are doing. They\u2019re still, there is a bit of battle over patent protection, but fundamentally most of the big pharmas and a lot of the industrial companies who used laboratories for their R&D aren\u2019t looking at India\u2019s Novel discovery platform. They are using it as a base to penetrate that huge market and one where they can do process work. So, it\u2019s a pretty fuddle market. It produces, I think the most engineers of any country on earth.","There is an emerging big middle class, the size of greater than the U.S. So we think that the demographics and the pieces are in place for good productive work. We think the yields are pretty good and we think the locations when you can cluster in a knowledge canter make a lot of sense. But we do think given kind of where we are in the capital side of things where the U.S. is in macro wise, it would be to our best interest much like we did with Longwood to team up with a financial partner, there not \u2013 we don\u2019t need an operating partner. But a financial partner that we could split the upside, but also split the capital cost and I think we\u2019re proceeding without that effort. So, I\u2019d be happy to answer anything more specific than that.","Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group","Is that something you think you could get done this year or is that a 2013 event?","Joel Marcus","I think that\u2019s probably first, my experience in India, I don\u2019t know I\u2019ve been there may be 40 times, is it kind of depends, if it was a U.S. firm that operates there, it could go fast; if it is a firm in Asia, somewhat slower. So I would say six to nine months would be kind of an estimate. It could be that our effort with Clarion and Longwood went pretty fast. But, again India is different. So I would say probably early part of 2013 first half.","Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group","Okay. Thanks.","Joel Marcus","Yup. Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Stewart, Green Street Advisors.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Thank you. A couple of questions for Steve, actually. Steve, first of all, just curios, what is the Veterans Administration doing with lab space in Mission Bay. And then if you could give us an update on sales force and then last but not least, you and Joel both sort of alluded to 499 Illinois and I guess just given the perceived strength of that market, would have expected to see more leasing there. So could you give us kind of \u2013 I guess the quarter is what do you thing has held you back there, has it been \u2013 or tech users gone shy on Mission Bay or is there you need to put more capital in the building, what\u2019s going on there?","Steve Richardson","I think it was the regional managers held this Bay.","Joel Marcus","That\u2019s always a contributing factor. Yes. On the VA they had an existing research facility. It\u2019s really their leading research facility in the entire country for veterans as they have various maladies and they relocated from location in the Presidio based in San Francisco that was very antiquated. So, we\u2019ve been talking with them literally for a number of years. I think we first chatted with them five years ago, just shortly after we purchased the property there in Mission Bay. And so, they were very keen to locate kind of a must have type of location and we are able to pull together a lease with the government actually in record time. It went very, very quickly, because they\u2019ve really wanted to see the opportunity there.","On the sales force land there is really nothing new to report. They had said that it would be two or three quarters while they were in pause mode looking at their existing head count needs, trying to find existing facilities to accommodate that and then revisit whether or not they would move forward with actually building out a campus. It\u2019s really not clear at this point. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re overly optimistic or pessimistic. It\u2019s just under further consideration by their team.","And then finally with Illinois, it absolutely has been that disappointing there. And you see somebody like the VA who have to be in Mission Bay, wants to be in Mission Bay. So, they moved quickly. We just haven\u2019t seen additional demand in the window of time we\u2019ve had since we acquired the asset from a high profile, high credit tenant and the tech companies really have wanted to stay very, very close to their peers. I think there\u2019s a little bit of frankly a lemming mentality, where they get concerned about recruiting people, if we\u2019re next door to Twitter and Zynga and their brethrens and they just have more comfort. Mission Bay hasn\u2019t really been identified as a clear tech destination. I think if we were to secure an anchored tenant with a floor or two, I think that would change literally overnight but we\u2019re just not there yet.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","You might just talk about when the hospital gets delivered, because that\u2019s clearly a game changer.","Joel Marcus","Yeah, that couldn\u2019t be a bigger part of Mission Bay with a couple billion dollars of investment going on right now and we do see the full substances impact of a 1.1 million square foot facility there. Just like we saw when a number of the research buildings were being built out that drove a lot of the clinical demand that has now resulted in 100,000 square feet of leasing by UCSF at 1500 Owens. We do expect additional demand and it doesn\u2019t necessary have to be UCSF at all, but other entities that really make an imperative for them to the nearby if not adjacent to the hospital to look at 499 as a very logical location. That still is a ways off from ultimately being up in operational. But I think the fact that the Curtain Wall has completed and it looks much more like a finished product will have a meaningful impact on how people perceive this area over the next couple of quarters.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Have you had any contact with sales force or have they just gone Ray a silent?","Joel Marcus","No we\u2019re in very close contacts with them, consistent contact. We\u2019re obviously neighbors and they just haven\u2019t changed their view on their plans for the future.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay. And then, Joel just on the asset sales, a couple questions, one; what is the mix for the $57 million that sort of targeted to get the \u2013 hit the full-year guidance. What\u2019s the mix, the breakout between income producing and land sales?","Dean Shigenaga","I\u2019m looking at that right now. So, we just closed of the $56 million remaining we closed $20 million today to Pennsylvania since there were operating maybe a $15 million or so would be land, they\u2019re last $21 million is still to be determined. I don\u2019t think there is any significant land in there. So I\u2019d say, it\u2019s more operating in that bucket.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay.","Dean Shigenaga","I think that\u2019s correct.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay. And then, it may not be entirely fair to draw inferences from the discontinued operations on page 18, but if you do look at you had the one income producing asset and just if you did take the disclosure it looks like you\u2019re talking a double-digit cap rate on the \u2013 the route 495 asset is that kind what we\u2019re looking at for a suburban lab not cluster asset?","Joel Marcus","Yeah. I think you\u2019re taking the implied information from the P&L and balance sheet disclosures on page 18 of the supplemental.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Yup.","Joel Marcus","And I think what you have to keep in mind is the 196,000 square feet is more of a land type...","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Right. So we would have expected the NOI will be entirely attributable to the income producing asset.","Dean Shigenaga","On $8 million, I don\u2019t recall the cap rate. There is income related to the land partials, they are operating, but just not at office or lab rents. There is income being generated, I don\u2019t have the breakdown, John, I can give you some better color offline.","Joel Marcus","They are happy to follow up offline. One last...","Dean Shigenaga","I won\u2019t read too much into the $8 million sale as a benchmark for yields on dispositions or even cost per square foot.","Joel Marcus","Yeah because it\u2019s kind of one-off assets it\u2019s not even clustered. It\u2019s not part of the Wister asset group.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Sure and it\u2019s obviously a small deal, but we just don\u2019t see a lot of comp, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m interested. And lastly for you Dean, if I may and I apologize if I missed this, your disclosure, obviously continues to improve and thank you for that. But do you breakout anywhere the NOI that runs through the P&L from properties that are still in the development pipeline?","Dean Shigenaga","We do. It\u2019s on page \u2013 it\u2019s in the AFFO reconciliation, which shows up on page 12 and it\u2019s actually burning down fairly significantly. Most of the revenue \u2013 always find at your \u2013 it was 72 \u2013 so it\u2019s $478 million in Q1, $72 million in Q2, so it\u2019s really burnt down. We used to be running if you go back to June of \u2013 the second quarter of 2011, we\u2019re about $1 million a quarter. What\u2019s happened is most of that income was being generated out of the Cambridge and Binney Street development site and as we move closer to vertical construction, we slowly vacated tenancy in the buildings and since then have taken down most of the buildings out there. So if you\u2019ve been out to Cambridge lately, you\u2019d see most of the sites leveled now.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Thanks, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman, Citi.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. It\u2019s (inaudible) with Michael. Thanks again for the China and India development disclosure. Would you be able to give us some kind of sense for what the stabilized development yield expectations would be for China and for India. My sense is that China would be pretty low, somewhere in the low single-digits, but India will be, I guess probably going to be above 10% or an 11%, would that be kind of right?","Joel Marcus","Yeah. I think in China, the South China being kind of a flex manufacturing, our guess is that\u2019s going to be lower single-digits, again because of both our being our first effort in a market that we would not have chosen had it not being for this kind of, original kind of group that asked us to go there. In Northern China, I\u2019m sure we can tell you anything, yet. We don\u2019t know enough ultimately because the rents could vary, if we were able to land and we\u2019re working actually with one specific tenant right now that\u2019s a tenant of ours in the U.S. If we\u2019re able to land a bigger incentive package, the rent would correspondingly be higher. So I\u2019m not sure we can give you any guidance there, yet. I\u2019d say, stay tuned, but again I don\u2019t view China as really a core international operation given what we\u2019ve said to you.","In India, however I think the level of credit of the tenants by in large is very high. Most of our tenants and over time will try to break that out more specifically or fairly large international players, they aren\u2019t a lot of startups or who we stage companies by in large there. They\u2019re some of service companies. So, it looks a lot like China in that sense. And I would say yields probably will range from low double digits to mid to high double digits, it\u2019s kind of range based on a variety of factors. And so, I think that\u2019s kind of where we see things and if we\u2019re able to achieve in a great market here in the U.S. maybe an eight yield \u2013 those yields probably I think are going to be somewhere between 300 and 700 basis points above that just on average, but you\u2019ll see those develop over time. And I think that\u2019s pretty fair.","Unidentified Analyst","So, just a question is like that I\u2019m going to speaking. As you think about sort of the balance sheet and in terms of raising equity, you did launch the ATM in the quarter looks like you\u2019ve had a pretty hard at least in the couple weeks that was opened in June with about 40 million raised. And, I think being said, expect the next 210 over the next four quarters I assume that subject market conditions and if you have the opportunity to you \u2013 you may accelerate that. And you sort of line that up relative to disposition volumes of 112 which you\u2019ve held pretty formal year. Part of that dispositions is always going right back into development with the one land sale and in Longwood. So, I sort of treat that a little bit separately, why not be more aggressive in terms of the asset base in terms of the asset base, in terms of selling, a substantial more of the assets rather than continuing to raise equity or even try to do a large joint venture on some of your assets or even clusters to raise that capital more efficiently than through the marketplace?","Joel Marcus","Yeah, I think that\u2019s a fundamental question that we think about and discuss almost on a constant basis and I would say to you the Longwood process was and that Longwood venture and the yields are actually pretty good and they\u2019re likely to be higher rather than lower over time. In the one sense, it\u2019s a great opportunity to bring in a money partner to off lay capital costs. On the other hand, you can\u2019t get better real estate and you\u2019ve got by enlarge credit tenants and really good yields. I mean if you could build to an 8.5 cash yield in Longwood and if you exited that market, my guess that\u2019s got to be a low-six or a mid-five probably, I don\u2019t know Peter can talk about that. That\u2019s a hard thing to necessarily just give up. So, we have to think very carefully about do we really want the joint venture partners for Kendall Square as an example, and that\u2019s an issue that\u2019s not easy to digest.","When it comes to sales of assets, we\u2019ve really looked through each of the regions. We\u2019ve worked hard to tee up a variety of sales. You\u2019ve got an environment today where obviously capital is cheaper and available, but in many cases, we\u2019re not interested in selling core \u2013 our cluster assets. We\u2019re interested in selling really some of the suburban and you really have to do that in a measured fashion. It would be hard just to put in an entire submarket for sale in this particular environment or not in 2005, 2006, 2007 we\u2019re really in a market that is still is a little different. So we\u2019re working hard to take it step by step, but it\u2019s hard to jump to large volumes. We all have to be mindful that where we have critical tenant relationships as we do in a number of these cases just to simply offload an asset, we have to be mindful of that.","We also, obviously, have taken the decision to seek an equity capital partner in India, like that something that is easy to reflect on because it\u2019s a new market, it\u2019s one that as I think great promise, there is a lot to do there and so it makes good sense. So we\u2019re trying to, I think, attack it in a pretty dogged, methodical, analytical fashion, but it\u2019s not so easy just to simply accident entire market, submarket. And many of the markets we\u2019re in, we really don\u2019t want to exit. So it\u2019s really those suburban assets and there is only one or two locations and you just can\u2019t wholesale sell them all. I don\u2019t know Peter, you could comment as you spend a lot of time on this effort.","Peter Moglia","One thing you don\u2019t what to do is dilute the market. You don\u2019t want to go out with a bunch of assets that are all on the same place. I mean it\u2019s going to cause someone to want to take a big discount to take those assets, and so that\u2019s not really the strategy we want to do. But one of the things that we are looking to do are take certain operating assets that could be high cap rate assets because the reason they are is because the credit isn\u2019t very good and we want to take that capital and recycle it into something like Binney Street where we could get a much lower cap rate for that asset. So, overall I think we\u2019re going to get our NAV much higher by selling some suburban assets and putting them into urban.","Joel Marcus","I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a helpful perspective, but...","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","No. No. It is...","Joel Marcus","That\u2019s how we\u2019re approaching as we\u2019re thinking about it.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","And then, in terms of the aftermarket equity program, you did $40 million in the three weeks of \u2013 last weeks of June from when you launched it at price of $70.64, with the stock higher today? Is there not a desire to do that quicker than over the next four quarters, just from the standpoint of where leverage is today and understanding that you\u2019re sort of want to get back into mid-6s, obviously rising that 200 would equate to almost half a turn?","Joel Marcus","Yeah. Yeah. I\u2019m going ask Dean to come in, but I would say we just had face-to-face meetings with the rating agencies and I think to keep in mind to, it isn\u2019t quite like a balance sheet point in time, it really is a process in an operating mode, modality, and level and so, we do believe we could operate very comfortably at a \u2013 within a boundary of around 6.5 times. But it\u2019s also a process to get there, not just an automatic goal and suddenly we\u2019re there. So I think that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it, but Dean will comment specifically.","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah. I agree with Joel\u2019s comment. There is not a goal or a pressure in our view to jump to the 6.5 times, we\u2019re going to get through there through the delivery of our EBITDA and NOI ramp up, which occurs in the fourth quarter and obviously thereafter because we have a lot of product behind it that\u2019s leased and scheduled for delivery. The ATM program, we tapped a little bit of capital in June, we \u2013 it wasn\u2019t clear \u2013 we\u2019ve been off the program in July, and we\u2019ll will look for opportunities over the coming four quarters to execute a little more equity over time.","Joel Marcus","Yeah. But, I think Michael it is true though that if we do move forward with additional construction spending, we would ramp-up the pace of that program. There\u2019s no doubt about that.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","And just lastly on 499, you haven\u2019t change your sort of yield expectations or your cost expectations, but it definitely sounds like things are going slower than you had hoped when you purchased the asset. So, I\u2019m surprised that nothing has changed from a yield or cost and if you think that things are going to take a little bit longer, I would assume you capitalize interest longer, maybe you have to provide a little bit more incentive to land at anchor tenant. I don\u2019t know where rents are today relative to what you originally under road I think it was look like $350 net a month. So, maybe just talk a little bit about what\u2019s happening there.","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah. I don\u2019t think you have an eroding rental rate market and I don\u2019t think concessions are the issue. Obviously carry will always be important, but Steve you could comment on general economics?","Steve Richardson","Michael, we originally underwrote this conservatively looking at lease rate that we\u2019ve already achieved at the three facilities they are operating Mission Bay and really what\u2019s change it has taken longer and ultimately we\u2019ve pushed out just by two quarters the delivery of that. So, that in and of itself hasn\u2019t had an impact given other considerations with the lease rate, but the original underwriting, I think was fairly conservative.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","Okay. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Martin, Morningstar.","Philip Martin \u2013 Morningstar","Yes, good afternoon.","Joel Marcus","Hi, Philip.","Philip Martin \u2013 Morningstar","Just wanted a bit of a macro question Joel, could you provide us with a sense of how the uncertainly in Europe may be effecting tenant needs and growth strategies and what that may mean for Alexandria in terms of more or fewer opportunities or may be a shift towards strategies to the emerging markets. Again, just thinking a little more macro level.","Joel Marcus","Yeah. I mean I can give you one recent example. Well, I think if you look at the big players in Europe, there is not a lot of expansion going on in Europe for pharma. There is some biotech, but a lot of that is really sales and marketing not core research. Novartis has obviously moved worldwide headquarters from Basel to Cambridge, Roche has obviously paid a lot of money and acquired Genentec as their oncology platform and really their engine of product pipeline and beyond that based in the U.S. You recently had Sanofi, I think Chris Viehbacher about a week or two ago announced that he was shutting down sites in Southern France. These are core research facilities. Remember there is a French company I think in Toulouse and forgot where the other location was, but both on the South of France. And so what that tells you is, he said, that they have been historically may be over the last two decades, pretty unproductive as far as new molecules whether it be chemical entities or biologics into the Sanofi system.","And so for a French company in a fairly \u2013 with a new leader who is pretty socialistic to be willing and he is obviously Canadian, but being willing to step up and close sites down in France, that\u2019s a pretty big deal and he\u2019s obviously made clear statements as well as the quote I use from, he is head of research, Zerhouni that they view often as the main place they\u2019d like to grow their core research. It seems to me European pharma is moving across the pond to the U.S. into the hubs and not really focused on much expansion in Europe. So, that\u2019s the reason we\u2019ve not focused on Europe because we don\u2019t see it as a real growth opportunity. And, I think those three examples give you a little bit of taste of what\u2019s going on over there.","Philip Martin \u2013 Morningstar","And, I know in some past discussions, I\u2019ve had with you. If I came away with the sense that there was some pent-up expansion demands even within your own tenant base and you\u2019re being a little more cautious given the world we live in today et cetera, I\u2019m trying to balance all of that out. What types of pent-up demand expansion organic growth exists in this portfolio of Alexandria\u2019s. Today, are you having to say no in some cases or you\u2019re pushing it out further bit?","Joel Marcus","Well, yeah. Go ahead, I\u2019m sorry.","Philip Martin \u2013 Morningstar","No. No. Are you pushing it out further a bit?","Joel Marcus","Well, I think, we still maintain, we\u2019re pretty careful on underwriting. I answered one question about New York and how we looked at demand there. We want to wait for real strong credit anchored tenant. We don\u2019t want to compromise with just an entity that may need a bunch of space, but then we don\u2019t view as highly creditworthy. In the Boston market, Cambridge market in particular there\u2019s a number of fairly sizable transactions that are requirements. I think, we\u2019ve done a good job of sorting through those and making sense of what those are and what those mean.","So, I think it\u2019s pretty clear that there is some good opportunities and we\u2019re maybe best positioned out of all the players in Cambridge to take advantage of that, and MIT has got a lot on their plate, Forest City has got a lot on their plate, they\u2019re kind of the big Boston properties business as well and we\u2019ve got some opportunities. So, I think we will be energized. So I think New York City obviously, the Cambridge opportunity and clearly if something moves in Mission Bay, we could take advantage of that. So, I think those are primary pent-up demand opportunities that we\u2019re looking at today.","Philip Martin \u2013 Morningstar","Okay. Okay, thanks for the insight.","Joel Marcus","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll, RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Carroll \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Hey, guys. Can you give us some color on the upcoming France Park redevelopment project? How extensive will that activity be?","Joel Marcus","The new acquisition?","Michael Carroll \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Exactly, yeah.","Steve Richardson","Yeah. Probably, too early to say, we have one existing tenant that is looking at some or all of that, but nothing to announce at the moment. It clearly is a critical piece. It sits across from our one of our prime campuses in Torrey Pines and next to one of the major institutions there. So it\u2019s probably almost as good as you can get as far as location. So, we\u2019re looking at doing a combination of redevelopment on part, and potentially ground up development on the other part, but I\u2019d say stay tuned, but it\u2019s a really I think it\u2019s a high quality credit opportunity in a AAA location.","Michael Carroll \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Do you know how much capital you\u2019d have to spend on that redevelopment?","Steve Richardson","I don\u2019t know. Dean, do we have any estimate at the moment?","Dean Shigenaga","No, the estimates are still being built, Mike.","Michael Carroll \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay.","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah. Too early.","Michael Carroll \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","All right. And then according to your guidance, you have about $377 million left to spend on your development and redevelopment projects, but you would have about $225 million left to spent on your in-process developments. What\u2019s the rest of the capital coming from?","Joel Marcus","Yeah. There is actually a pretty good breakdown Mike on page 32 of the supplemental that shows the breakdown for the last half of 2012 at $377 million. For those of who that don\u2019t have it for reference, let me just read off of some numbers, $95 million for developments on the backup this year, $131 million for redevelopments and these are North America numbers, about $43 million for preconstruction, generic infrastructure and building improvements in North America of about $55 million; future construction projects in North America of about $30 million and redevelopment and development projects in Asia of about $23 million, and that totals to $377 million.","Michael Carroll \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","All right. Thanks.","Operator","And you final question will come from the line of John Stewart, Green Street Advisors.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Thanks for sticking around. Just two quick ones. Joel, just wondering if you have an assessment of what potential overlap or exposure you may have from Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s acquisition of Amlyin, would that (inaudible) that space is potential for rationalization?","Joel Marcus","Yeah. We have our exposure to Amlyin over the next, I think their lease goes out another three or four years as I recall, I think about it\u2019s about 75,000 square feet in San Diego. We see that rolling. We don\u2019t the Bristol-Myers taking that space and in fact Amlyin has been, Steve or Peter you could try on that. I think it\u2019s been on the sublease market for a while. So it\u2019s been kind of noncore. I don\u2019t see Bristol using San Diego as a major expansion hub, but I think they\u2019ll keep certainly certain parts of the operation. It\u2019s much more of a development and commercialization effort than it is really an R&D hub for them.","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah. Amlyin and it\u2019s been shirking for quite a while in the market, they\u2019ve got a lot of space for sublease. So I think once their R&D phase was over where \u2013 then they \u2013 were concentrating mostly on development and commercialization. They just stopped using a lot of space, so I wouldn\u2019t expect BMS to take any of it.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay.","Steve Richardson","Yup. So we have it targeted, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s in 16 \u2013 15, 16, whatever the date is, I don\u2019t have it right in front of me, but we\u2019ve assumed actually even before the acquisition that would roll and not be renewed and I think that\u2019s pry too of a bunch of their other space down there, would be my guess.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","That\u2019s helpful. And then, Dean, I know you gave a run rate for straight line rent for \u2013 on a quarterly basis, but just wondering if you\u2019ve got the fourth quarter number, just given the ramp up of NOI coming online, what\u2019s the cash contribution or rather what\u2019s the straight line rent adjustment for fourth quarter?","Dean Shigenaga","It\u2019s probably \u2013 I don\u2019t have the two quarters on the back half of this year, but they\u2019re averaging about $6.5 million. I\u2019d say, I think my expectation is a little bit more straight line rent in 3Q, a little bit less in 4Q.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Yeah.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer portion for today. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Joel Marcus for closing remarks.","Joel Marcus","Yeah. Thank you, everybody.

Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Matt and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Rhonda Chiger. Ms. Chiger, you may begin.","Rhonda Chiger","Thank you and good afternoon. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those projections in forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements as contained in the Company's Form 10-K, Annual Report and other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","And now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Joel Marcus. Please go ahead.","Joel Marcus","Thanks, Rhonda, and welcome everybody to the third quarter call. With me today are Dean, Steve, Peter, Tom and Dan. So we've got a full house here. We are pleased to report the third quarter FFO of $1.21 a share and an increase in our narrowed guidance of $4.79 to $4.81, FFO up over 14% from third quarter of '13 I think characterized by strong demand as well as strength in our core operations. And I think the key to the success this year has clearly been our platform which is our Class A facilities located in our collaborative science and technology campuses and the best urban innovation clusters we've certainly benefited significantly from that.","I think if you think about Alexandria at this point in time, maybe 10 kind of key strengths come to mind. First of all very strong core operations across all key metrics as set forth on Page 1 of the press release and accelerating FFO growth into 2015. Two, we've got 2.3 million square feet in current value creation development or redevelopment projects, 85% leased or in negotiations, Page 29 of the sup, I think this is a great testament to the teams in each of our markets, plus an additional approximately 1.8 million square feet in near term value creation development projects, virtually all of which are under active negotiations, again Page 29 of the sup.","I think what's also important to note is the average initial cash stabilized yield generated from about 6.4 to 8.3 in value creation substantially exceed our implied cap rate base cost to capital, resulting in strong profit margins over the coming several years. You can take a look at Pages 30 and 34 for those updates.","ARE clearly owns the best science and tech campuses in our urban innovation clusters of any REIT or private investor today. A very well run asset base at the asset management level. Five, very few challenged assets. Six, I think a deep long tenured and highly talented team which are fully integrated -- members of fully integrated teams in all of the key innovation clusters. As Dean has pointed out, the [indiscernible] a high level of liquidity, almost 2 billion, it is a strong balance sheet able to support strong value creation pipeline for the future. Nine, a low dividend payout ratio and increasing dividend, sharing growth in cash flows with our shareholders. And I think 10, continued sales of non-income producing assets as well as non-core assets while maintain accelerating growth into 2015.","Just a few macro comments. There certainly is a strong trend toward the urbanization of the innovation economy and workforce and again we have been fortunate to take a significant advantage of that. I think also on our tenant base we see the strong confluence of structural factors with also positive cyclical factors which don't necessarily line up in time, but we are seeing that now really in the best of times for our tenant base. On the operations and internal growth side of things, we continue to beat our occupancy and rental rate increased estimates. And leasing in the key regions helped drive internal growth this quarter at about $871,000 square feet, Greater Boston contributed 35% and San Francisco 32%.","On external growth, Steve will comment on the acquisition. The Mission Bay parcels in connection with the Uber joint venture, development of 422,000 square feet in the heart of Mission Bay. It's a superbly executed transaction to continue to drive our growth in San Francisco. ARE's goal is to maintain strategic optionality regarding its growth strategy. This is really kind of our mantra. And as such, due to the extraordinarily strong build-to-suite leasing demand for Binney Street development parcels and a corresponding reduction in the lease-up risk, we\u2019ve updated our strategy which we announced in the fourth quarter of '13 which was to sell a minority JV interest in the Binney land parcels and we will now seek to keep on balance sheet assuming their term leasing and all. So again, that\u2019s just an update on the strategic optionality approach. If we aren\u2019t successful in leasing, we wouldn't move forward with the joint venture.","Clearly a key to this move on the assumption side of things is our desire to capture the extraordinary economics and the extraordinary demand for these three buildings versus an ability to move out our leveraged target somewhat. But Dean will deal with how we plan to address that through free cash flow, the growth in EBITDA, land sales, some asset recycling, et cetera. And we\u2019re very comfortable I think with our current plan regarding our overall leverage. Dean will talk about the balance sheet and I would conclude by saying on December 3rd at Investor Day we\u2019ll lay out the 2015 business plan which will confirm accelerating FFO growth into 2015 as well as what we expect to be a strong increase in our NAV into 2015.","So let me turn it over to Peter Moglia for some comments.","Peter Moglia","Sure. Thanks, Joel. So we had one notable Life Science trade to report in the third quarter which occurred in the Route 128 quarter at the Greater Boston region where GI Partners a private equity investor based in San Francisco purchased 850 Winter Street from Marcus Partners for a 6.3% cap rate. The price per square foot for this suburban asset was $404. The other notable trade involving Boston was BXP's sale of a 45% interest in two Boston and one New York City office buildings to Norges for what ISI calculated to be a 3.8% cap rate. This rate was noted by Green Street when they increase their NAV to $91.75 per share on October 1st.","The Bay area continued to be extremely hot in the third quarter with 989 Market, 650 California, 50 BL and 60 Spear Street trading separately at a weighted average cap rate of 4.08% and a healthy $621 per square foot.","In Seattle, 500 BL Avenue in South Lake Union traded at a 5.71% cap rate. The property is anchored by tech startups space provider WeWork. The buyer was Trinity Capital led by former speaker executive Richard Leider. A number of Seattle Office assets have hit the market this quarter and pricing guidance has been in the low to mid 5s as owners like Wolk Insurance, Brookfield look to capitalize on a diverse pool of buyers in the market including foreign funds German and Hong Kong based. Domestic funds such as Invesco, private equity investor GI Partners and a number of other public and private REITs. A number of these investors were bidders in life science asset 401 Terry purchased by Kilroy in March, which had a weak tenant credit anchor.","The trend of cap rate compression is continued through the third quarter due in part of low interest rates, a lack of alternative investments and a deep pool of investors including foreign funds. It appears that the inventor market is only getting tighter as an analysis of comps that my core market shows the weighted average cap rate drop from 5.58% in 2013 to 4.8% through the third quarter of 2014 driven largely by a 100 basis point plus tightening in the San Francisco Bay area.","As a follow up to questions we\u2019ve received about who is bidding on life science real-estate assets, we can give you some names of those who have been actively bidding on them in the greater Boston market. They include the related companies, Deutsche Bank Asset & Wealth Management, which is formerly RREEF; Korean fund Mirae Asset Management, JP organ, private investor the Rockefeller Group; Swiss fund, AFIAA; Clarion Partners; private REIT KBS, prudential and principal.","To wrap up my comments, I want to acknowledge that with the end of [indiscernible] there\u2019s a lot of conversation about if, when and by how much interest rates will rise and the effects they will have on cap rates. Analysis of data from the first quarter of 1989 to the first quarter of '13 by Robert Charles Lesser & Company determined that the average spread between cap rates and the 10-year treasury yield is between 250 and 300 basis points. According to real capital analytics, the current spread for office product is between 400 and 450 basis points. So we believe there is room for cap rates to absorb increases in interest rates and remain at current levels.","In addition, rising interest rates should reflect improving economy and real estate fundamentals, which should dampen a rise in cap rates driven by a rise in interest rates.","With that, I\u2019ll pass it over to Steve.","Steve Richardson","Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019d like to take a step back today as we head into the final months of the year and frame the drivers for what has been an exceptional year for ARE's performance and the unique urban and science and technology clusters in which we operate.","One, the deep and broad based demand in the critical science and technology sectors; two, the significant supply constraints in ARE\u2019s highly desirable urban innovation clusters; and three, the rental rate strength and pricing power in those sub-markets. These drivers have contributed to strong core performance again this quarter and year-to-date as we reported cash and GAAP increases of 6.2% and 14.1% year-to-date and 5.6% and 18.6% respectively this past quarter for renewals and releasing of space as well as historically high occupancy levels of 97.3% for North American operating properties.","Very powerful global economic forces are intensifying demand for ARE's Class A product in its urban innovation clusters as they possess unique and mission critical attributes that simply cannot be replicated in other locations. Against the significant wave of demand is a set of political and geographic factors that are constraining supply. The ability to aggregate and deliver new product in urban settings is a very complicated and politically charged endeavor as well as the imperative for high quality design, technically capable and creative collaborative work environments. These two powerful forces, significant demand and constrained supply have created pricing power in the market.","Alexandria's client tenants have therefore been keen to renew early to ensure stability of operations and more importantly, to seek trusted and long-term partnerships as they seek to establish unique and high quality urban campuses. A long term lease and joint venture between ARE and Uber has created a new paradigm and clearly illustrates the desirability of the ARE collaborative urban campus platform for its science and technology partners.","Broadly, we've essentially resolved the rollovers for 2014 less than 0.5% outstanding and just 794,150 square feet remaining to resolve or just 4.29% of our operating asset base for 2015. Drilling down on ARE's core urban markets, the statistics reveal a very robust set of activity.","In Cambridge, Boston, we've seen demand intensify during the past quarter in the Life Science market with 2.5 million square feet of demand and another 2 million square feet of tech demand. Most notable is the high quality demand from seven different potential client tenants seeking large blocks greater than 100,000 square feet. We've refreshed our mark-to-market analysis and across the entire operating ARE asset base we see solid cash increases at 9% and 13.2% on a GAAP basis and pretty amazing metrics for Cambridge, Boston. Growth of 18.2% on a cash basis and 22.4% on a GAAP basis.","Occupancy is up by 230 bps to 98.6% compared to the same timeframe last year and lease rates are again being pushed to the high 50s to near $60 triple-net for existing product. And prospects seeking new large blocks of space at ACKS are anticipating rents in the low 70s triple-net. Vacancy rates overall continue to tighten and on a regional basis are just 5.7% on direct basis with 7.8% of total availability.","Moving west, the San Francisco to Stanford clusters are also experiencing an intensified demand cycle from science and technology companies. Occupancy is up by 290 bps from the same period a year ago to 99% in the operating asset base. We're tracking nearly 900,000 square feet of Life Science demand and 9.3 million square feet of tech office demand with market highlights of several pre-leased large projects with tenants such as Google, EMC, Machine Zone and again, most notably, ARE's groundbreaking long term lease and joint venture for 422,000 square feet with Uber in the heart of Alexandria's center for science and technology at Mission Bay.","Lease rates for new product are now in the mid to high 50s triple-net as the Prop M office allocation continues to constraint supply of new products in San Francisco. The mark-to-market refresh indicates impressive 8.6% cash and 14.4% GAAP growth trajectory and the market continues to tighten as vacancy rates drop to 100 basis points in the lab sector to 6.2% and a steep drop of 430 basis points to 4.1% in the SoMa tech district.","Moving to south, we see that San Diego's market is again a similarly positive story. Demand in the market is up 300% to 2.4 million square feet compared with last year. Core performance is very solid with an occupancy increase of 340 bps to 96.1% and the operating and redevelopment asset base and market vacancy has dropped 140 bps to 9.6%. The existing tenant base growth trajectory is very strong and our key large campuses, Campus Pointe and Illumina's headquarters have more than 600,000 square feet under negotiation, a clear testament to ARE's underwriting team's unique capabilities and expertise and I'll pass along to shout out for their standout contribution.","Finally, the long entitlement and approval process in San Diego continues to constrain supply in Alexandria's core clusters which in turn will continue to support rental growth which is reaching all-time highs in the mid to upper 40s triple-net. Finally moving north, Seattle has seen explosive growth in the tech sector during the past quarter with leasing in excess of 1 million square feet. Vacancy rates remain below 5% for lab and tech space with upward pressure on rental rates for new ground-up lab product in the high 40s to low 50s triple net.","With that, I will hand it off to Dean.","Dean Shigenaga","Thanks, Steve. Dean Shigenaga here guys. Good afternoon. I have got three important topics I want to cover. First, I will provide an update on our capital strategy and our ability to continue with the delivery of strong growth and FFO per share and then asset value. Second, I will provide an update on the positive impact of accelerating demand. And third, I will provide a summary of key guidance items for 2014, a few important thoughts for 2015 and our confidence in our ability to deliver solid growth in cash flows, net asset value and FFO per share from our Class A buildings and land parcels located in urban innovation clusters.","First on our capital strategy. Our key capital matters for 2014 are substantially complete. In July, we completed our $700 million unsecured bond offering with weighted average interest rate of 3.5% and a term of 9.6 years. We updated our targeted sales for 2014 to a midpoint of 120 million, down 75 million from our prior guidance. And we have about 83 million of dispositions under contract and expect to identify additional sales in 2015. I will come back to this topic in a minute.","Moving to leverage. Debt to adjusted EBITDA was 7.2 times as of the third quarter and forecasted to be 7.1 times by the end of the year based on significant growth in EBITDA and targeted dispositions of 83 million, both of which offset our estimated construction spend for the fourth quarter. Also, significant growth in EBITDA continues into 2015 and we will keep leverage within a reasonable range as we deliver highly leased projects and commence new development projects. Lastly, we expect leverage to improve towards the target range of approximately 6.5 times as pre-lease developments deliver significant growth in revenue, NOI and EBITDA.","Briefly and importantly on our capital strategy, our capital plan focuses on funding all or almost all of our growth in 2015 and is aligned with our strategy to grow FFO per share and net asset value. Additionally we are very comfortable with our capital plan and credit metrics going forward and we will provide an update in detail on our Investor Day on December 3rd.","First, we'll plan to invest cash flow from operating activities after dividends currently greater than 110 million per year into high value development projects. Second, we expect to issue long-term debt to fund Class A highly pre-leased development projects on a leverage neutral basis through significant growth in EBITDA. Combined with operating cash flows after dividends, these two items in 2015 should allow us to allocate 500 million to 600 million of capital to high value development projects. Third, we expect to supplement our sources of capital by identifying real estate to dispose off over the next one to five quarters including operating properties, both non-core and core like in addition to land parcels.","We are in a great position to continue to deliver solid growth and FFO per share and net asset value from 2014 to 2015 including the impact of dispositions and the related reinvestment of proceeds.","Moving next to the positive impact of accelerating demand on our asset base. As Steve pointed out, tenants clearly looking to tie down early renewals in anticipation of increasing rental rates in a very supply constrained environment. Occupancy reached 97.3% as of 930 and now exceeds our upper end of our guidance. We expect to end the year with very strong occupancy at the top end of our range of guidance of 96.9% to 97.3%. Same property NOI growth has strengthened throughout the year. Year-to-date same property NOI growth was solid at 4.5% and 5.2% on a cash basis. Our guidance for same property NOI growth for the full year \u201914 remains strong at a range from 3.5% to 5% and from 4% to 6% on a cash basis. Rental rate growth on lease renewals and releasing the space has also been very strong year-to-date, up 14.1% and 6.2% on a cash basis. Our guidance for rental rate growth for 2014 remains very solid at a range from 11% to 14% and from 4% to 6% on a cash basis.","While we're on core performance, let me briefly comment on operating expenses. Operating expenses for the third quarter increased approximately 9.7 million or up 20% compared to the third quarter of '13. One half of the increase was driven by increases in variable expenses due to the increase in occupancy in our same properties. Occupancy was 96.9% and 93.6% as of September 30, \u201914 and 2013 respectively within the same property pool. The reminder of the increase was driven by the completion in delivery of highly pre-leased development and redevelopment projects. Operating margins remain very solid at 69% for the third quarter due to our triple net lease structure with 95% of our leases providing further recovery of operating expenses.","Lastly on guidance. The completion of highly pre-leased development projects will drive a reduction in non-income producing assets to 13% of gross real estate by the end of the first quarter. There are no significant changes in prior ranges of guidance for straight-line rent G&A expenses capitalization of interest and interest expense net. Now that we only have one quarter remaining for 2014, we've provided guidance for these items specifically for the fourth quarter. Capitalization of interest for 2014 is targeted at 46.7 million for the year based upon a midpoint of our guidance. This represents a significant reduction of about one-third from our capitalization of interest for the year of 2014, driven primarily from the completion of high pre-leased development and redevelopment project over the last couple of years.","The decline in capitalization of interest is expected to continue into 2015 again due to the completion of additional highly pre-leased development projects. Really from September 30, through March 31 of 2015.","High quality science and technology entities continue to drive strong demand for our Class A assets and AAA urban innovation clusters and drove improvement in our outlook for 2014. We updated our guidance FFO per share diluted to range of $4.79 to $4.81 or a midpoint of $4.80. This represents a solid increase over 2013 of 9.1%. Our guidance earnings per share diluted is a range from $1.65 to $1.67.","Briefly let me provide a few key thoughts for 2015. We will not comment further on 2015 beyond these brief comments since we plan to cover 2015 in detail during our Investor day on December 3 in New York City. We expect to continue to execute on our strategy to deliver solid growth in FFO per share and net asset value including the impact of reinvesting capital from the sale of operating assets, both non-core and core like and also certain land parcels.","Core performance is accelerating and we expect cash run regroup on renewal and re-leasing the space to be significantly stronger than 2014 and cash same property NOI growth should be very solid and in the general range of growth as 2014. We are occasionally asked about the mark-to-market for rental rates on current in-place leases. We believe the mark to market for cash rental rates for in place leases are on average north of 10%. More importantly, we are expecting growth in cash rental rates to be very solid in 2015 for lease renewals and releasing a space. Construction spending for 2015 is fairly fluid at the moment with various build-to-suit negotiations in process and we expect to finalize our construction budget for 2015 over the next few weeks.","As you know, 2014 is turning out to be a very strong year with FFO per share forecasted to be up 9.1% over 2013 and we anticipate 2015 FFO per share growth over 2014 to be very solid as well. We look forward to providing our detailed outlook for 2015 at our Investor Day on December 3rd in New York City.","With that, I will turn it back to Joel.","Joel Marcus","If we could go to Q&A, operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. (Operator Instructions) At this time we will take a question from Emmanuel Korchman with Citi.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Dean or Joe, does common equity play a part in your capital strategy at all?","Dean Shigenaga","Well as we've said earlier, it certainly doesn't for this year. And based on I think our comments to date and we will certainly give you a full detailed business plan update on December 3rd. Our goal would be to try to eliminate or minimize any common equity for next year based on the factors we talk about. Land sales and recycling of assets together with clearly cash flow and growth in EBITDA. So that we hope to kind of do what we did this year if possible.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","You spoke earlier about strategic optionality. You had 50, 60, 100 planned to be in a JV. Now it's wholly owned unless it gets, unless leasing is already expected to be and then it will be back into the JV. How do sort of a -- how does a partner think about that given sort of the unsurety of leasing and what they will be coming into and also if you do it at 100% now, is there a potential for that to become a JV in the future?","Joel Marcus","When we announced the intent to go down the JV path last year fourth quarter, we had no tenants in hand for 50, 60 or 100. We thought it would be prudent to make a sale of less than a half interest in that set of parcels. It certainly would help us in a variety of ways and we didn't know how long the leasing would take on that. And we did one-on-ones with more than I think 15 high quality joint venture partners. I don\u2019t think there was a single one of which said we\u2019re not interest. We ended up boiling that down to a handful and then ultimately one and reached the term sheet in the \u2013 or at least a general term sheet in June.","But during the summer months when the kind Tsunami of demand reared its head and that's what Life Science and tech in Cambridge, it was pretty clear to us that if we could -- again the tradeoff being if we could take advantage of this very unusual and extraordinary demand in the market versus the desire to joint venture, we would do that. But we clearly want to maintain flexibility. And if the lead joint venture partner were we to go back to them many time decided not to, we know there is a handful of other high quality partners who would covet being our partner with this land. This has got to be ground zero land in the best certainly life science market and one of the best sub markets in the entire country, if not world and so we are not too worried about that. So I am sorry if I didn't, what other part of that question didn't I cover. ","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","If it would potentially become a JV in the future once they\u2026","Joel Marcus ","","I think if they turned out that we are not able to sign substantially all of the demand that we are getting at the moment, we certainly would look to go back to a joint venture. And, as I said I think, there are numerous partners that would be willing to go forward with us. ","Peter Moglia","I think that if we weren't successful in 100% leasing these projects like we expect to do, then a joint venture partner\u2019s hurdle rates will make more sense for the risk profile that we would be bringing back to them. I mean right now, with the type of returns that they are looking for and we are providing very little risk, it is not a big match. So I think we'd be returning an opportunity that is more to a JV. ","Operator","At this time, we will go to Sheila McGrath with Evercore.","Sheila McGrath - Evercore","Yes, Joel I wonder if you could talk about how far long in the process are these leases and are they all life science or tech at 50, 60 and 100 a Binney.","Joel Marcus","Yes. Well since we have Tom here, I will let him comment but the suffice it to say we have letter of intent that we are working on and coming very close to an agreement on which would then move to a lease pretty quickly on 50. We are trying to tee up the parameters of the economics on 60 and we are deep into LOI negotiations on a 100, but Tom do you want to maybe characterize it even more globally than that. ","Tom Andrews","Yes, that's accurate Joe. I think the, we have some companies, some of the demand is pure growth from existing Cambridge based tenants including the couple of life science companies, there is one which is a consolidation of an existing Cambridge tenants have leases in multiple locations in the city and wants to be under one roof. There is another one that's to me and from an out of market life science Company. So, we have a number of ongoing discussions and we are quite confident that we will be able to lock down one or more of these probably soon for summer and perhaps all of the spaces available which totals over 950,000 square feet. ","Joel Marcus ","Yes, at the moment all of these are life science companies but there is a significant demand from tech and there is one large tech RFP that's out there that we will clearly respond to as well. We are looking at multiple back up offers as well. So it\u2019s not just one shot on goal here, so we feel pretty comfortable with that. ","Sheila McGrath - Evercore","And if we look at the potential cost, is it accurate to look at the cost per square foot of 75 to 125 Binney to estimate or is that higher?","Joel Marcus ","So I think we in some cases here we are looking at tenants who are more office and lab use within some of these buildings you recall when we did 225 Binney we had a life sciences tenant that took office use in that building. So he cautioned that the lower in total I would say the range could be up to as much as the 75\/125 Binney that's kind of a higher cost project in terms of the a model lab space in that in that tenant requirement and it could range down somewhat from, but it wouldn't be too far off the total that 75\/125 [indiscernible].","Sheila McGrath - Evercore","Okay, last question on funding, Joe you mentioned asset sales, these projects will be coming online till '16 and '17. Are the asset sales going to be mostly concentrated in '15 or stretched over a longer period?","Dean Shigenaga ","","We are working through number of assets that will identify here over the coming months. So it's a bit fluid on the dispositions but our bogie at least for solving for our capital needs for '15 will be to execute a number of transactions that fit the capital plan in our business. Really, that will allow us to reinvest the capital into these really high value development projects. But I would say we would likely continue with this broad strategy i.e. invest cash flows that we retain from operations, use EBITDA growth to debt fund without impacting leverage and then continue to identify asset selectively for a recycling and reinvestment in to the business and like we mapped out, there is not a whole lot of land left but we\u2019ll do some lands, but there will be some non-core assets and we will identify some that are more core like which should represent some high value opportunities to monetizing and reinvest. ","Joel Marcus","I think Sheila with that though different than happened in the past; I think you can still expect that we would have an increase in FFO per share during this time period. So that\u2019s something we\u2019re keeping firmly in mind as well.","Operator","And now we\u2019ll take a question from Jim Sullivan with Cowen and Company.","Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company","My question for you in terms of just how strong this market is in Cambridge, it does seem to be a level of demand growth which is exceptional and I think in the prepared comments you talked about low 70s is the rent per foot triple net for high quality built to suite. And I wonder if you could just remind us back in first half of the year I think we were talking about low 60s to mid-60s, is that right? Is that how much the movement has been?","Tom Andrews","The movement is on that order. I would say that we\u2019ve certainly seen in proposals that other landmarks have been sending out to tenants and our own proposals we\u2019ve seen significant movement from earlier in the year on the magnitude of $10 a square foot or more.","Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company","Can you give us a handle on what might have happened on construction costs, for the same period?","Dean Shigenaga ","We project construction cost increases currently in the range of 6% NOI.","Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company","And then finally from me, can you give us an update on what\u2019s happening with the Volpe site? I know this is some time off, but there was this I guess RFI. Maybe I don\u2019t know if there is another date certain for the next step in the process but if you could just give us an update, if there is another step and number one and number two. What Alexander\u2019s posture is here in terms of partner or not and the scale and the size of that project.","Joel Marcus ","So there was and RFI which was due in early October, we know there were significant number of respondents to that RFI were told that the federal GSA is working on an RFP, we\u2019ve had some folks tell us I think it might be out as early as sometime in Q1 of next year. We would imagine there would be probably a multi-month response timeframe for that. And that many development companies and operators would likely pursue that property which under proposed disowning in Cambridge accommodates if my recollection is correct over 2.5 million square feet of commercial space, over 1.5 million square feet of proposed residential zoning. So Alexandria certainly is following this closely, we made a response to the RFI. We expect that once we see the RFP then we\u2019ll work carefully to evaluate how we ought to pursue what will be a very interesting opportunity.","Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company","And in terms of, you have a partner I believe with this working with you on this?","Joel Marcus ","We have spoken with multiple partners; we have not selected a partner.","Operator","This time we\u2019ll move Graham with [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst ","Just wondering if you could sort of approximate the returns on joint ventures versus just going in company owned route? What order or kind of spread are we talking about?","Peter Moglia","This is Peter, I mean from a yield on cost standpoint that\u2019s not -- it wouldn\u2019t dilute what we\u2019re going to achieve, it\u2019s just going to -- the amount of investment we have would be obviously diluted by the amount of partner capital we bring in. We would be in a position to earn a promote, so it\u2019s possible that we could actually leverage that partners investment and increase our own return. But what it does as it gives up upside to the future because we take that capital.","Unidentified Analyst ","Take that capital -- possibly are you yielding assets in the future?","Peter Moglia","I am sorry you cut out, could you ask that again?","Unidentified Analyst ","I mean employee capital being that you can employ the capital at higher rates in the future that you anticipate at higher lease rates of because they are the properties that you see with higher potential returns.","Peter Moglia","Well the reason that we might employ other people\u2019s capital is an alternative to raising equity through common stock sales. So it\u2019s just an -- the opportunity cost for doing that is up side in our own developments.","Unidentified Analyst ","Have you figured what the blended cost to capital is for ARE currently versus those alternatives?","Joel Marcus ","We have but we\u2019re not prepared to share though.","Unidentified Analyst","The land sale inventory.","Joel Marcus ","I think we need to move onto another questioner.","Operator","Next question will be from Ross Nussbaum.","Ross Nussbaum - UBS","Couple there's some questions. Joe is there anything you can say at this point about the press reports that you're acquiring Memorial Drive and Cambridge.","Joel Marcus","Yes I can tell you that similar to the press report that we were joint venturing with somebody for an apartment building in Boulder, Colorado you can't always believe everything you read but I think it's fair to say that we don't comment on speculation and when we're prepared to announce if that happen to be an acquisition or whatever it is we'll announce it when the time is appropriate so I'd have nothing more to say.","Ross Nussbaum - UBS","Okay, second question is back to Binney Street. How would you characterize your discussions with the tenants you're having today versus where you were three months to six months ago, because I know when we've spoken and met all year you've been I'd say similarly extraordinarily bullish on the leasing prospects there. So are you finally at the point where you're pretty darn confident this is getting over the finish line ASAP?","Joel Marcus","Yes let me say this and then I'll ask Tom to come in. When we go back to 4Q of '13 when we announced kind of on our strategic optionality, strategy if you will that we were assuming, we were going to joint venture and we put into play a pretty intense process to accomplish that I'd say the level of demand and forward movement of that demand in Cambridge probably didn't come to a head until the summer. And so maybe that's the really operative time then I\u2019ll let Tom kind of characterize it.","Tom Andrews","Yes look I think it's really number of transactions that we would characterize it in the pipeline and a handful of them are getting to be very-very real in terms of the trading of proposals the frequency of discussions with brokers and with principles and these feel very much like they're moving toward completion and of course the answer, the truth is that they're not complete until they are complete and we don't have anything signed yet, but we're very positive negotiations ongoing and they feel it's been a compliment since specifically they feel like they're moving patients quite soon.","Joel Marcus ","And I would say that in all three circumstances the lead party in all three of these cases we've had our prior relationships with so these are not parties that we have that we have not had a prior relationship with in other words we don't know each other so that's also I think a very helpful factor.","Ross Nussbaum - UBS","Okay and then finally for me, I guess I'm wondering a little bit why you'd wait if you will for proceeds from potential asset sales to come in ex-quarters or ex-funds down the road rather than just hang up the phone from this earning's call, pull the trigger and issue equity aid handle on the stock price given that we're in and uncertain and increasingly volatile world why take the risk that you'd be able to transact on asset sales couple of months from now then just take the equity now and get the balance sheet down toward your goals.","Joel Marcus ","Yes, well that's certainly a relevant question and certainly one part of an argument that one could conceive of. In reality though Ross, we have enough confidence in the demand going forward here for a while, I think Peter articulated we also feel that we're in a pretty decent environment on the recycling of both land and some assets that I think we can look forward to I don't know how long that will last but I feel good about at least as we look at a few quarters. Our leverage, let\u2019s face it, we\u2019re operating in a better leverage level than we ever had before and better than a number of other companies that are really in great shape and have strong stock prices. And we just had meetings with the rating agencies in July. So we feel comfortable with where we've come over the last couple of years we've made dramatic improvements on virtually every single credit metric one could look at. And I think we feel good about where we are. And I think we'd like to protect our growth and earnings by minimizing the equity issuances and looking at those assets that we could sell. So I think that's our current game plan at the moment but I mean the situation you passed is related certainly one that reasonable people could look at but I think we're going to try to repeat what we did this year and in '14 and try to do it in a way that I think makes the most sense all around and minimize this dilution. But again, if there was a big change in the equity markets then we'll deal with that.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) At this time we will take a question from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Can you talk about what was the other income in the quarter, looks like you are a little bit higher than usual?","Dean Shigenaga","Jamie, Dean Shigenaga here. Other income was $2.3 million. Actually I call it a little tad light from our run rate rather than higher, it was just higher from the second quarter. Second quarter was down less than 500,000. So that was an usually low quarter due to very small amount of investment gains in the quarter. So I would suggest from onward purpose as you should expect about a $3 million run rate for quarter. ","Joel Marcus ","Which is been historically pretty much worth enough. ","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, and then can you talk about your any of the largest 2015 expiration been any that may not be covered or you think might be moving out of this point?","Joel Marcus ","Yeah the two big ones that I will let Steve deal with that but the two that strike me we have one full building user in a suburb in Route 128 that is moving out and that\u2019s a building that we are looking to release or potentially market. And then another one that rolls a full building user, government user in North Carolina and we have already got good re-leasing prospects on that. Those are the two standout full building users but as Steve said we've got unresolved paired down to three quarters of a million feet in \u201915 which we think is really at this point in time pretty great. ","Steve Richardson","You know that, that\u2019s right. Jaime just a add to that. That\u2019s just about 4% of the asset base and when you take out those two pieces that takes out about another third, got a block of space in tech square, so we think that will be an opportunity rather than a concern that\u2019s in the 60,000 square foot range and then potentially in the ETC market and San Diego as well. So, no other real large blocks other than the two that Joel cited and spread out pretty uniformly with smaller pieces. ","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, and then I guess for the 2015 expiration schedule. Give the sense of where you think those are those rents are versus market?","Dean Shigenaga","Well that\u2019s kind of a mix, but if you want to go back, Jaime its Dean here again. If you want to go back to my prepared comments. I didn\u2019t give specific guidance for \u201915 but I did comment that cash rents on lease renewals and releasing a space should be meaningfully stronger than our performance in \u201914 and we will layout the plan on Investor Day for you in more detail. ","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, so just higher at this point. And then I guess just finally on San Diego, we have seen market conditions are getting stronger there generally across many sectors. What are you guys seeing in terms of your portfolio and maybe opportunities to do more non-life science leasing? Just how should we think about your business plan there going forward given the conditions seems to be exciting?","Dan Ryan","Yeah hi Jaime, this is Dan Ryan. So, word on usual situation at San Diego that we basically are out of inventory like most of the other regions, and we are now actively employing what land bank we have. As Steve mentioned earlier we are in discussions of an excess of 600,000 square feet of new build in our region. So it\u2019s a rigorous mark right now, lot of what we responding to is internal portfolio growth. The question about whether we are crossing over into seeing some tech demand, we do have a couple of things. We did a Barnes Canyon project which we leased to a tech user; they have come back after having moved in for three week and asked if they can lease the next building over which is about 45,000 square feet, so we are working through that. ","So we are seeing probably not as vigorous as Steve\u2019s market, but probably 80-20ish kind of life science and tech demand. ","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And do you have a preference one versus the other in terms of your return?","Dan Ryan","I think we are generally agnostic about I think it\u2019s a matter where you are in the risk level with life science tenant fee versus the tech tenant fee. And we are generally agnostic about it, just really trying to target the best return in the overall risk adjusted capital investment. ","Operator","That does conclude question-and-answer session. I will turn the things back over to Joe Marcus for closing remarks. ","Joel Marcus","Thank you everybody. We did a well under an hour and that is great. So we will see many of you at Marriott and look forward to Investor Day or year-end call. Thank you again. ","Operator","Again that does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation."],"1561":["Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz with Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Paula Schwartz","Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Federal Securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","And I would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel.","Joel Marcus","Thank you, Paula and welcome everybody to our second quarter call. With me today are Dean Shigenaga; Steve Richardson; and Peter Moglia. I want to start with focusing on the cover page to our 20 -- our 2Q19 press release and supplemental, which features our recently developed Vertex Pharmaceutical West Coast research base, designed in the shape of two human lungs together with a quote from the mother of the two children suffering from cystic fibrosis, which I quoted in the first quarter call.","This is our solemn mission to build the future of life-changing innovation as we have each and every day over the past 25 years as the originator and innovator of the life science real estate niche and we thank each and every team member of the Alexandria family for their important contribution each and every day.","As we sit here after the close of the second quarter, we really are very proud on a couple of aspects. I think we've reached a point where we can say we really have built a fortress balance sheet with over $3.4 billion in liquidity and a weighted average remaining debt term of greater than 10 years, and Dean will highlight some of the capital accomplishments this past quarter.","We also have a pipeline which will \u2013 which could enable us to double rental revenue from January of 2018 to December 2022. The strongest client tenant base with 53% of our annual rental revenue from investment grade or publicly-traded large cap client tenants with a weighted average lease term of 8.4 years. In addition, a robust 2Q cash same-store growth number that Dean will talk about as well and Steve will highlight robust cash re-leasing spreads this past quarter.","And we're very proud of a very strong value-add pipeline leading into 2020 with significant positive activity in each one of our markets, including the 88 Bluxome win, which is a really big win and a very unique one, Steve will talk about. Notably, we increased our dividend -- our quarterly dividend 3.1% during the second quarter as well.","In July, we're proud to be notified that we were selected by NAIOP as the 2019 NAIOP Developer of the Year for our outstanding design, work, sustainable outcomes, scientific prowess and connected campuses driven by our unique and differentiated mission and deep thoughtfulness toward enhancing the communities in which we work.","And if we focus for a moment on the next life science frontier, it's pretty clear that the sheer scale of unmet medical needs for patients suffering from diseases of the brain is quite staggering, the cost to society enormous, just the nine most common neurological diseases are estimated to cost the United States $800 billion a year. Dementia today affects 50 million people worldwide and 10 million new cases diagnosed every year. Alzheimer's alone affects almost 6 million Americans and more than 1 million Americans live with Parkinson's at a total cost of about $50 billion plus a year, nearly double previous estimates.","It's estimated by 2050 that more than 12 million Americans will suffer from some form of neurodegenerative disease. In the realm of psychiatric diseases, nearly one in five adults, almost 50 million people experience some form of mental illness in a given year, costing our economy almost $200 billion of lost earnings alone, while approximately one in 25 people, 11 million daily suffer from a form of mental illness depression, now the leading cause of disability worldwide, and has become the major contributor to global burden of disease.","On the addiction front, and we touched upon our efforts in the opioid abuse area last quarter, the abuse of illicit drugs as well as alcohol and tobacco in the US is costing us almost three quarters of a billion, I'm sorry, three quarters of $1 trillion annually related and costs related to crime, loss work productivity and healthcare. The ongoing opioid epidemic is now estimated to cost the US over $500 billion annually, largely driven by the immense scale of preventable fatalities caused by opioid overdoses, where on average 130 Americans die each and every day. Imagine if that was in a war, how that would be covered by the press.","Discovering new treatments and cures for diseases of the brain has become a goal of ever-increasing urgency and one on which Alexandria is super-laser focused on with our financial capital as well as our human capital.","And with that, let me turn it over to Steve to give some highlights of the quarter.","Steve Richardson","Thank you, Joel. Steve here. We're very pleased to report the company's unique cluster campus business model is not only driving superior operating and financial results, but it continues to provide tremendous value to our tenants and stakeholders. Alexandria's dominant franchise and brand, its best-in-class team and highly differentiated campuses continue to exceed expectations and drive significant internal and external growth opportunities for the company. I'll provide a granular analysis of the following key clusters and metrics.","In the Mission Bay, SoMa submarket, Alexandria\u2019s leadership role dating back from 2004 in establishing Mission Bay as one of the country's most vital life science translational research clusters has and continues to provide significant value. Our campuses, totaling 2.7 million square feet, have been nearly 100% leased for a number of years. Our lab vacancy is 0% and the tech vacancy in the market is 1.3%. Lease rates for existing lab and tech space is now in the high-60s to low-70s triple net, while we anticipate new deliveries to exceed 80s triple net.","Significant lease transactions include Pinterest\u2019s 488,000 square feet lease at Alexandria\u2019s unique 88 Bluxome project in SoMa, which we'll discuss later, as well as Sony leasing a 130,000 square feet; Autodesk, a 117,000 square feet; Glassdoor a 116,000 square feet; SamCERA, a 116,000 square feet; Workday, 74,000 square feet; and Zoom, 64,000 square feet.","Just want to highlight, it's very important to note the overall high regard respect and leadership position of Alexandria as was epitomized by last week's decision by the San Francisco Planning Commission to provide Alexandria with the only full project approval in Prop M allocation for our new Class A plus game-changing 88 Bluxome Mixed-Use Urban Campus in SoMa.","I just want to step back and take a moment to say how proud we are of the company and the team for this accomplishment, as we're very thoughtful at the very outset to embrace exceptional design, sustainability, and very importantly, the community and its needs, all resulting in a full project approval and the only Central SoMa project to have secured an anchor tenant, Pinterest and now nearly 60% leased. We are very honored to have received this overwhelmingly positive endorsement from both the city and the community.","Moving further south in South San Francisco, we're very well positioned in this submarket. Our campuses totaling 2.2 million square feet are 99.3% leased, including the delivery of Merck\u2019s Class A 300,000 square foot Innovation Center at the start of 2019. We've taken a balanced and prudent approach towards expanding our South San Francisco campuses and are very pleased with the leasing progress at our new ground up, 315,000 square foot, two-building campus on Haskins Drive with a signed LOI for nearly 30% of the space.","The South San Francisco vacancy rate is just 2.9%, but we're closely watching the supply pipeline with a potential for significant blocks of space coming to market if a speculative construction like others were to advance. As this is ultimately a submarket, and not a cluster centered around a world-class institution like UCSF. That's our careful prudence here. Lease rates are now in the mid-to-high 60 triple net and new leases in South San Francisco include Atreca for 75,000 square feet, Cytokinetics for 235,000 square feet and Tolerion [ph] for 25,000 square feet.","Finally, talking about leasing and same-store performance, which was stellar this past quarter. We leased 819,000 square feet this quarter for a total now up 2 million square feet in the first half of 2019. Again, a testament to Alexandria\u2019s world-class leasing and operations team, 61% of these leases are early renewals. So it's very clear that there's a continued sense of urgency in our campuses.","Historical increase in renewals and re-leasing rates for this quarter, 17.8% cash and 32.5% GAAP for the 580,000 square feet in this pool and when you look at the same-store growth of 9.5% cash basis, splits roughly between the burn off of concessions and step-ups, a very, very healthy and very stellar quarter.","And on that note, I'll hand it off to Peter.","Peter Moglia","Thank you, Steve. This is Peter Moglia, everybody. I'm going to spend the next few minutes updating you on our near-term pipeline, our acquisition in the seaport area of Boston and give you some thoughts on recent capital flows into the life science real estate area.","During the second quarter, we placed 218,061 square feet into service from six different 2019 deliveries that I'll touch on. In South San Francisco, we delivered 24,396 square feet of our 279 East Grand project anchored by Alphabet\u2019s Life Sciences subsidiary, Verily.","We've now delivered 78% of that project at a very strong yield of over 8%. We delivered another 27,164 square feet at 188 East Blaine, our new flagship property on Lake Union and Seattle and are on track to meet or exceed our pro forma cash yield on cost of 6.7% which is very strong when considering Class A operating assets and this market continue to trade at sub 4.5% yield.","12,822 square feet was delivered at 266 and 275 Second Avenue in Waltham and that property is now fully leased with the remaining 19,000 square feet under construction and expected to be delivered in the fourth quarter. The initial stabilized cash yield on this redevelopment is 7.1% in a market where stabilized lab buildings have historically traded in the low side 6% range.","A significant portion of Phase I of Alexandria Center for AgTech located in the Research Triangle market was delivered in the second quarter, bringing that highly unique 97% leased project to 74% delivered. We delivered the remaining 76,400 square feet of 681 Gateway in South San Francisco this quarter, and more importantly, increased the pro forma initial cash yield cash yield, cash yield from 7.9% to 8.2%.","Completing second quarter deliveries was 3,450 square feet at our multi-tenant 80,000 square foot building at 704 Quince Orchard Road in Gaithersburg, Maryland, where we remain on track to deliver an outsized 8.8% initial stabilized cash yield. Looking further out, our 2020 development and redevelopment pipeline currently consists of about 2.2 million square feet and Dean will provide some high level information on this commentary - on his commentary.","Next, I'd like to talk a little bit about our Seaport acquisition. The acquisition of 5 and 15 Necco, also known as Innovation Point represents a strategic opportunity to expand Alexandria\u2019s unparalleled world-class franchise in the Greater Boston area. Innovation Point in part delivers a fully renovated 95,000 square foot historic building, 5 Necco Street that will be the global headquarters for GE. GE will occupy approximately 75,000 square feet or all of the office space in the building for a 12-year term.","It also provides Alexandria the opportunity to deliver an iconic 330,000 square foot to 360,000 square foot world-class Life Science building with a robust and vibrant set of retail and ground floor amenities at 15 Necco Street and the existing approvals that resides there will enable us to expedite the entitlements and likely put us in a position to break ground in early 2020. When combined with our adjacent 10 Necco asset, the acquisition provides Alexandria the opportunity to scale this campus to between 600,000 square feet and 650,000 square feet over time.","Finally, in light of substantial capital flowing into the Life Science Real Estate niche, we created and pioneered. We'd like to remind investors and analysts that there have been others in many of our markets for a number of years. It has not affected our ability to grow and thrive in any of them, because Alexandria is much more than a landlord or capital allocators. We are a long-term, highly ethical and trusted partner to our tenants who put their mission critical facilities needs into our hands, because they know we have a long tenured and highly respected experience and expertise to build and operate them to the highest standards.","We understand their signs, business and strategic goals. We provide highly curated cluster campus environments that accommodate their growth and allow them to recruit and retain the industry's best talent. We are solidly positioned to continue to lead this ecosystem in building the future of life-changing innovation. And with that, I'll pass it over to Dean.","Dean Shigenaga","Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll briefly cover five key topics today, including our second quarter results and continued strength from both internal and external growth, our very strong balance sheet today, our recently published corporate responsibility report, venture investments and then lastly, our updated guidance for 2019.","Total revenues for the second quarter were up a significant 15% over the second quarter of 2018, reflecting continued outstanding execution by our best-in-class team. Our adjusted EBITDA margins continue to remain near the top of the REIT industry at approximately 79% for the second quarter. Same property NOI growth for 2Q was up 4.3% and significantly at 9.5% on a cash basis as compared to the second quarter of 2018.","Our team executed very well across key drivers of our same property results. We completed in an outstanding volume of leasing activity in the first half of \u201919, aggregating 2.1 million square feet, including 1.1 million rentable square feet related to lease renewals and re-leasing the space with very strong growth in rental rates of 32.6% and 20.1% on a cash basis over the expiring rental rates.","Very strong execution of leasing supports were high and stable occupancy in our same property pool approximately 96% to 96.5% for both the second quarter and the first half of 2019, and our very favorable structure with annual rent \u2013 annual contractual rent escalations approximately about 3% drives growth and same property cash NOI year-to-year.","Continued strong external growth and a few important key highlights for you today. Now that we're about \u2013 just about midyear through 2019, it's clear our team has executed extremely well on the delivery of projects in the first half of the year, with a number of highly leased projects aggregating about 1.5 million rentable square feet targeted for the delivery through the remainder of 2019.","Our team has also done an outstanding job this year working with key relationships in the Life Science industry, and successfully executed almost 950,000 rentable square feet of leasing related to the development and redevelopment projects. As Peter mentioned, we have grown our pipeline to about 2.2 million square feet of projected deliveries with initial occupancy in 2020, which are weighted to the second half of \u201820. And we will have more details to share over the next two quarters.","In aggregate, our projects undergoing above ground vertical construction with initial delivery dates through 2020 are now 74% leased plus an additional 5% under advanced negotiations. We also have a pipeline of strategic growth opportunities on balance sheet, including certain pending acquisitions, providing important visibility of potential deliveries beyond 2020 aggregating 10 million square feet.","Our team has placed our balance sheet in a very strong position today with significant flexibility, our strategic pursuit of opportunities to refinance outstanding debt and extend our maturity profile with attractive low cost, long-term fixed rate debt continued into 2019 for the third year in a row. In March and July of 2019 alone, we raised 2.1 billion with a weighted average coupon of 3.86% and an amazing term of almost 18 years.","The proceeds of our most recent $1.25 billion bond offering in July were used primarily to execute a tender and redemption of our outstanding bonds that were scheduled to mature in 2020 and 2022. Upon completion of the redemption of our remaining outstanding 2020 and 2022 bonds, later in August here, we will be in a really amazing position with no debt maturities until 2023.","We have no significant remaining debt capital requirements for 2019. However, we are working with one of our JV partners on a potential early refinancing of a construction loan which has a maturity today of 2021. Weighted average remaining term of our debt is truly outstanding and has been extended to 10.1 years, and notably is longer than our weighted average remaining lease term of 8.4 years.","During the second quarter, we also completed transactions aggregating 8.7 million shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $144.50 per share for proceeds that ultimately will \u2013 generate $1.2 billion. $86 million this closed in the second quarter. 8.1 million shares do remain subject to forward equity sale agreements that we expect to settle in 2019. We've got tremendous liquidity as Joel highlighted earlier of $3.4 billion, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA and fixed-charge coverage ratio has remained very solid and is on track for our goal of 5.3 and greater than 4 times respectively by the fourth quarter.","As a mission-driven urban office REIT really focused on making a positive and lasting impact on the world. We're truly honored to highlight our recently published annual corporate responsibility report and our focus on leadership and environmental, social and governance matters. It's important to also recognize that our strategic business initiatives are well aligned with those of our highly innovative client tenants, really highlighting the importance of our initiatives.","Key highlights from our corporate responsibility report include; 58 LEED certified or in-process certifications, that upon its completion, represent over 50% of our annual rental revenue recognition as a leader in workplace, health and wellness, and key philanthropy initiatives with over 2,600 volunteer hours by the team, and key social initiatives like our partnership with Verily, an Alphabet company really to design and develop a fully integrated campus ecosystem in Dayton, Ohio for the full and sustained recovery of people living with the opioid addiction. And lastly, continued progress on our 2025 goals to reduce energy consumption, carbon pollution, portable water consumption and increase our waste diversion rate.","We also want to congratulate our awesome team on their fourth NAREIT Gold Award for communication and reporting excellence in the large cap category. Our team is really proud to be recognized for their efforts to create clear, concise and efficient disclosures for the investment community. Thanks to our entire team and truly great work, guys.","During the second quarter, we recognized $21.5 million of investment income including $11.1 million of unrealized gains. In the second quarter, importantly, we also recognized $10.4 million of realized gains. As you look back over the last several quarters, realized gains from venture investments have averaged about $10.7 million per quarter.","Closing here on guideline \u2013 guidance. Since our first quarter earnings call, we updated guidance on June 20 through an 8-K filing and further updated our guidance yesterday, primarily for the improvement in our outlook for 2019 rental rate growth, when you compare that to expiring rates on lease renewals and re-leasing the space and our range increased by 1% at the midpoint to 28.5% and 17.5% on a cash basis.","Now this represents our second increase in our outlook for rental rates for the year. Our EPS guidance was updated to a range from $2.39 to $2.47 and we increased the midpoint of our guidance for FFO per share diluted as adjusted by $0.01 to $6.96 with an increase of the lower end of our range of guidance by $0.02.","Guidance was also updated for the outstanding execution by our team on the opportunistic bond offering and refinancing of our 2020 and 2022 bonds as I highlighted earlier. And please note, as we have disclosed for a number of quarters now [indiscernible] a 117,000 rentable square foot property located in San Diego is now vacant, resulting in temporary \u2013 a temporary 49 basis point decline in overall occupancy by September 30th, while we renovate and re-tenant this property.","Additionally as disclosed on page four and page six of our supplemental package, an acquisition of an operating property in San Diego, with several buildings aggregating 560,000 rentable square feet with in-place leases, has an occupancy of 76% and this will reduce our overall occupancy by another 57 basis points and represents an opportunity for our team to grow cash flows from this property post acquisition. Please refer to page six of our supplemental package for further details on our guidance assumptions for the year.","And I'll turn it back to Joel.","Joel Marcus","Operator, if we could go to question-and-answer, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Sure, thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will be from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jamie Feldman","Great, thank you. I guess starting with Dean, you've raised a lot of capital in the quarter and slightly after. Can you just give us your thoughts as you look out over the next -- through 2020 and the development spending, what you think next year's capital plan might look like compared to this one, this year's?","Dean Shigenaga ","So Jamie, thank you, it's Dean here. So good reminder that we do plan to hold our Annual Investor Day event on Tuesday, December 3rd later this year at our New York Center in New York City. As we're thinking about this time every year, we do get questions about the next year and our preferences to respond to those questions about our outlook, once we publish that on the morning of our Annual Investor Day event. But, Jamie broadly, I think if you look back over the last several years, our objective with capital and our capital raising needs each year, we\u2019ll remain to be very disciplined and prudent with funding our needs from various sources as we have historically.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then, we've seen a pickup in kind of value-add or development that are -- kind of development related acquisitions over the last couple of quarters. Can you just talk about maybe the returns you're getting or what is it lately that's made those types of opportunities come in the surface for you guys, looks like you've even got more to close going forward?","Peter Moglia","Hey, Jamie, it's Peter. Look, the volatility and interest rates, latter part of last year, I think woke up a lot of people that were holding real estate and decided, if I'm going to sell, I'm going to sell soon. Of course, that has tempered and we're looking at \u2013 continue to look at a low rate environment. Nonetheless, a lot of opportunities have come into the market and in great locations where we wanted to expand.","So we've been able to capitalize on that, especially considering our stock has performed well and our cost of debt has gone down due to Dean and his team's great work. So with all those things aligning, we've gone ahead and purchased some things and we certainly strive for a good spread over exit cap rates of at least 150 basis points or something ground up and we\u2019ll continue to maintain that.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. You\u2019re saying the acquisitions you\u2019re underwriting 150 basis points better than ground up?","Peter Moglia","That's typically the target, we sometimes do better. It's going to depend on the risk, obviously. But we're certainly aware of risk adjusted return concepts. And I think we do a good job of allocating capital that way.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then just as you think about the legislative environment or regulatory environment, especially related to the drug pricing, have you seen any change in tenant behavior or any thoughts that you can pass along on just either how your tenants are acting or how you think they might act going forward?","Joel Marcus","Hey, Jamie, this is Joel. So we haven't seen any real impact at the moment. I think it is pretty clear though that from the executive branch to the legislative branch, in light of the impending 2020 election, each -- a party wants to have some talking points about what they've accomplished on drug pricing. Unfortunately, they\u2019ve focused on the 10% to 12% of the healthcare pie and haven't appropriately focused on the big numbers. But I think it's fair to say, given some of the movement in the Senate Finance Committee that we\u2019ll see something done over the next few months. And my sense is that, it may reside in a -- some adjustment to Part D of Medicare.","Remember, outside of the 8% to 10% of Americans who are not insured, two-thirds of people are covered by private pay or self-insured plans and one-third is Medicare. So the one-third is going to be focused on the PART D. It's also important to remember, there's this notion of trying to index somehow Medicare pricing to international standards, but that President can't enact that by Executive Board or individually. So that's something to think about.","Jamie Feldman","If you would boil it all down, I mean, what's your view on how this plays out for you in terms of your business?","Joel Marcus","I think that, if there is a fixed Part D that would impact what we call the oral oncology drug sector and the two biggest players in oncology are Bristol-Myers, Celgene and Roche have pretty dominant positions there and so they'll have to think about how that impacts them, a company like Lilly wouldn't be impacted in any way, shape or form. So I think it's selective. And remember, Medicare is about a third of overall drug. Medicare covers a third of US people, so it's not 100% by any means.","Jamie Feldman","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","You\u2019re welcome. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. Please go ahead.","Manny Korchman","Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Maybe this question for Dean. Dean, the accelerated acquisition pace in 2019, does that at all impact your goal of doubling revenues and does it sort of speed that up or this all sort of contemplated and is this just going to be land bank essentially through those years?","Dean Shigenaga","Manny it's Dean here. The acquisition pipeline as you can imagine, is very unpredictable. It does add to our five-year growth plan in that sense. So it doesn't move along to that target nicely for us, but that was not critical in our initial outlook that we had contemplated in our five-year plan.","Joel Marcus","And remember, that's a framework we haven't given definitive guidance on that since we only give one year guidance.","Manny Korchman","Okay. And then you talked about the competition, specifically, I guess, in South San Francisco. Have you seen anyone coming into more of your cluster markets that\u2019s a more of a developer or a merchant developer that's who is trying to put up and get out or is that limited to that one market?","Joel Marcus","Well, I think historically, certainly, over the last 5,10, 15 years, there have been both national players and regional players in every single one of our markets. So I think that just is the way it is, and that hasn't really changed. There is a lot of capital moving into this sector. So that's why Peter maybe mention that he did, because people are looking at this as a \u2013 to some people, this almost becomes a valuable core asset, whereas when we started out for many, many years, this was looked at as kind of a funky oddball, a niche that you wouldn't group with retail, housing, office, industrial, et cetera, but that's changed around and that's why the cap rates have gone where they are. So that's a net process for us [indiscernible].","Manny Korchman","Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please go ahead.","Rich Anderson","Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Dean, first to you. Why do a forward deal if you plan to settle it as soon as this year? I can understand having a longer tail to the plan. I'm just curious what your line of thinking was there?","Dean Shigenaga","Sure, Rich it's Dean here. Forward equity sale agreements generally, most of them are set for about a 12-month term, contractually, very few of them extend meaningfully beyond that, it might go to 15 months, but not much beyond that. So I think conceptually, Rich, forward transactions are short-term settlements.","I would say that most useful transactions on a forward has really \u2013 is really focused on settling somewhere in the near-term over several quarters to match your funding requirements. And that's the reason why we use it. Rich, it's really to align with our timing of funding.","Rich Anderson","Fair enough, just curious, usually, it's a next year sort of event. But I understand the answer. So the second question is somewhat conceptual. You guys are doing a lot in the way of early renewal activity, 61% again this quarter. I'm curious if there's any impact on your ability to negotiate those rents? In other words, if someone's coming to you early, do you think about the current market rent or you think about what the future market rent would be for them? Had they waited until they were contractually expiring and hence you kind of get a bigger number out of that in negotiation? Is that something that makes any sense at all or is the market just the market?","Steve Richardson","Rich it\u2019s Steve Richardson. It as you might imagine, it is all a balance and we are certainly looking at an increasing rental rate environment, how to tackle that. So I think, with that balance, we get the benefit of locking the tenant down. I think we are getting upside beyond what the rent is today. And really importantly, and this is a metric that we've noted for a long time now, the reusability of these improvements, the lower CapEx requirement is really enhanced when we can renew somebody in our space that they've already invested in.","So I really do think we end up with an optimal balance where we get the best of all worlds there.","Joel Marcus","But we're also mindful of relationships and we're not pushing the last dollar and the last cent, because you can be penny-wise and pound-foolish in a sense, because these relationships are long-term and we want to be a partner, not a financial landlord who is pressing every last cent out of the property.","Rich Anderson","Perfect answer. Thank you and then last, on the \u2013 I think perhaps the one of the jewels of the story as you\u2019re pre-leasing of your development pipeline upwards to 80%? Curious how much of that is, you start to deal and you are almost amazed by the level that you're able to get to in a relatively short period of time? Or do you manage it and I guess the short question is, where are you and what type of pre-leasing you need to just get the engine rolling on a development? And how does that vary from one market to the next, I imagine you be more willing to go spec in a Cambridge and less so in maybe, San Diego or something?","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah, I think since the financial crisis, we've tried to match going vertical with commitments in hand. And I think fortunately \u2013 we've been fortunate and also with relationships, we've been able to match those after the last \u2013 over the last many years with a very comfortable kind of dovetail, there's no magical number, obviously as you could imagine, there would be more momentum in Cambridge than there would be, say in the New York City. But, it's one that just you have to have kind of the touch and feel of that particular sub market. So it's pretty differentiated.","PeterMoglia","Hey and this is Peter Moglia. I mean, the other thing I think I would add is that, it's a testament to how ingrained we are in the fabric of the industry and each market that we are well aware of the demand well before the market is. So that allows us to plan for these things. And if you plan well, you can deliver quickly and that's what our tenants need. So really our long-term presence in these markets, and our teams that are highly experienced and with long tenure pays off, and the ability to forecast when we should be delivering product.","Rich Anderson","Okay, lastly, can you mention who the San Diego seller was?","Dean Shigenaga","No, we need to keep that confidential.","Rich Anderson","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Thanks, Richard.","Operator","The next question will be from Sheila McGrath with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Sheila McGrath ","Yes, good afternoon. On 88 Bluxome, you have the approvals. That's great news. I'm just wondering the status of any lawsuits there and what you expect the timing to be and is this going to be in two phases? Or is it all one phase?","Joel Marcus","Yeah Sheila, I'm going to kick it over to Steve in a moment. But I think, remember what Steve said, we're the only project to get full, one-time approval for the entire project and we don't have to go back for any prior approval and a full Prop M allocation. No other developer in Central. SoMa has that, they must come back. But Steve can speak to the lawsuits that I think we're pretty optimistic on.","Steve Richardson","Yeah. Hi, Sheila it\u2019s Steve. That's exactly right. There are ongoing discussions, everybody is reasonably encouraged and we would hope through the balance of the year that we would be able to resolve those, enabling us to be in a position to go ahead and kick off construction. So, again, we're very hopeful.","And that, again, that would be for the entire project as Joel just emphasized there, we do not need to go back to the city. So we could in fact, kick off the entire 1 million square foot project.","Sheila McGrath","Okay, great. And then just a question on Alexandria District for Science in the Greater Stanford area, that's a big project. It's already 37% leased. Just wondered if you could give us an update on that and is that a ground up development? Or was that redevelopment?","Steve Richardson","That is a ground up development? Yes, we're very pleased. And I think this really speaks to what, Peter had discussed with our long-term presence there. And the insight that we have with the teams on the ground that we've been able to have this type of success this early in a ground up project, so very pleased with the progress there.","Sheila McGrath","Okay. And then two questions for Dean. On the forward equity, should \u2013 in terms of timing, should we assume that is back-end weighted to fourth quarter?","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah, yeah that's fair to assume, Sheila.","Sheila McGrath","Okay. And then on the other investment gains, I'm just wondering is the active IPO market in biotech is that driving these realized gains a little bit higher this year? And given current equity market conditions, should we assume a similar level as the first half of the year?","Dean Shigenaga","Sheila it\u2019s Dean here again. I'd say, when I think back several years now or maybe even longer than that, because we've been investing in early-stage companies for quite a number of years. The liquidity events that drive realized gains are always \u2013 have always been a combination of IPOs and M&A activity. And that seems to be pretty true for the last number of quarters. The IPO market has been fairly active since 2013, but you still see quite a bit of M&A driving liquidity events and gain for this business.","Sheila McGrath","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Michael Carroll","Yeah. Thanks. I wonder if you guys can touch on your investment activity. I know Peter kind of discussed this a little bit earlier. I know you've been acquiring a lot of future development sites. I mean, what \u2013 how do you underwrite that? And when do you break ground on those projects, once they potentially be stabilized down the road? And how willing are you to increase your land bank today?","Dean Shigenaga","So, Michael, it's Dean here. I think, broadly, what we'd like to comment on is that, what we've done here is, I think, given really nice visibility for our investors to think about how we can manage growth into the future, because now we have a pipeline that goes beyond \u201820 of about 10 million square feet. So we just want to be able to provide strategic visibility for everybody and I think we\u2019ve accomplished that in recent quarters with adding to the pipeline.","Michael Carroll","Okay, is there a limit to how much land you want to add to your land bank? Or is it just the market fundamentals are so strong you're willing to grab high quality sites and you can find them?","Dean Shigenaga","We're always been very thoughtful in that regard, Michael, as it relates to the amount of product we have. What we did on page two of our supplemental disclosure was, add some visibility into that pipeline, about half of it is currently vertical, highly leases, 74% leased and included in this bucket is the 88 Bluxome project, which is also about 60% pre-leased today.","What I think that most of our investors should focus in on is, what's behind that. And it's a fairly modest number. So this is land that's either nothing vertical is going on with these land sites, but it's really strategic sites for future growth. That number is only 6% of our gross investment in real estate. So it's pretty modest today.","Michael Carroll","Okay, great. And then Steve, can you talk a little bit about your comments on the South San Francisco market? I know demand has been pretty strong and I know one of your competitors had some good leasing activity on one of their development projects. I mean the supply, were you in that market? And then maybe can touch on about the - if you can, the acquisitions you put in the sub regarding the three sites in the San Francisco Bay area that's pending acquisition right now?","Steve Richardson","Yeah Michael hi, it\u2019s Steve. Yeah we\u2019ll provide further color when we're able on the pending acquisition certainly in the Bay Area. And on South San Francisco yeah I think as we've said for a while, we've just been very thoughtful and prudent in the approach there. We\u2019ve got a tremendous set of campuses, they are essentially fully leased, adding product like we're doing at Haskins is the right thing to do with the right time. And we are watching this supply very closely there with a number of different projects that if people choose to build on a speculative basis, could add more supply than we've seen there for a while. So we monitor this extremely closely, but right now we're taking a very balanced approach.","Michael Carroll","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Daniel Ismail with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Daniel Ismail","Great, thank you. Peter you mentioned the amount of new capital flowing into the space and with potentially lower rates. I\u2019m curious to get your thoughts on where you see cap rates across your markets and have you noticed any accelerating cap rate compression in any specific markets?","Peter Moglia","Yeah, thanks Daniel. Yeah it\u2019s Peter. I wouldn't say that we've seen accelerated cap rate compression, but it has ticked down. I don't think anybody would have forecasted that at the end of last year. But I think I may have had this conversation with you in the past, but right now, a great look or a well located lab building in a core market is probably more valuable on a cap rate basis than an office building, which is unique considering what Joel said about how people looked at our assets back when we started.","So, obviously that has been a terrific or had terrific impact on our NAV. And we expect that it will continue, we do get contacted quite a bit from people interested in our assets when we do put things out for sale, we do have some pending transactions with that had very high quality investors interested. And next quarter we\u2019ll be giving some news on that, and I think everyone will be pleasantly not surprised, but satisfied with the cap rates that we\u2019ll show. So, it's a good time to be a laboratory owner for us and that's another reason we continue to create value through some acquisitions, because we wanted to create even more.","Daniel Ismail","And just a quick one for Dean, noticed expenses picked up a little bit this year or this quarter again, anything we should know driving that\u2019s and maybe that outlook for the rest of the year?","Dean Shigenaga","Daniel I think I missed the key part of your question.","Daniel Ismail","It\u2019s the express - excuse me, expense growth this quarter looks like it picked up again eight points \u2013 about 8%. Anything driving that we should know?","Dean Shigenaga","Nothing unusual in our operating expense growth, I think that it probably had a little bit of repairs and maintenance and property taxes is a driver lately over the last few years. I think what you find in our \u2013 as we build out and renovate product or redevelopment or development, the different regions are sometimes slow to assess the values and that creeps in overtime and doesn't necessarily all commence in the year that we actually deliver product. ","And it\u2019s importantly, though, Daniel as you know, our leases are triple net, so we're able to pass through almost all of our operating cost or tenants and I think that's really important, because that mitigates volatility to earnings or net operating income.","Daniel Ismail","Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","The next question comes from Tom Catherwood of BTIG. Please go ahead.","Tom Catherwood","Thank you. So a question on San Diego. This cluster has always been somewhat unique for you guys and that it's been more spread out than some of your other markets. But in this quarter, you've taken down more land adjacent to your campus point projects and you're looking at kind of a pretty substantially sized dense cluster there. Is this the case of just taking advantage of adjacent assets that came up for sale? Or do you think that a denser cluster in San Diego could help drive demand in rent growth?","Joel Marcus","So this is Joel. I remember San Diego was our first market and I think campus point is pretty unique, because it fits essentially as part of a university town center, which is a more urban like market than you would normally find and say other parts of San Diego per se sales compared to Torrey Pines, which is one of the most beautiful, but it's not so urban. So I think that is an important factor.","And then obviously, we have the preeminent campus and a world-class set of client tenants there, both Life Science and Tech and so the opportunity to expand that campus by adjacencies is, I think super-prudent. So those things play into our mindset.","Tom Catherwood","So will it be fair to say that you're starting to see some interest by tenants in getting those adjacencies to similar companies that you've seen, obviously not the same level, but as you've seen in a Cambridge or in Mission Bay?","Joel Marcus","I think yes and also we've been fortunate that existing tenants have wanted to expand. So having the ability to both, build or provide product that there may be some near-term vacancy ability is a real plus.","Tom Catherwood","Got it? And then, I know it was a small deal, but you announced the LaunchLabs partnership with Columbia University this quarter. I assume that\u2019s the West Harlem campus, is that correct?","Joel Marcus","That's correct. The motivation for that is a little different than you might imagine, broadly speaking, New York really is a early-stage company. It is, clusters take about a generation 25 years to really evolve and develop, Boston, Cambridge is in there, second generation, so as San Francisco, but New York is really in the first decade. So there's not a long waiting line of tenants like there is in Cambridge, it really is an early-stage market and one that you really have to create. So we've tried to meet that reality with a product that makes sense and we've partnered with that by far the largest and most dominant institutions in that market.","Tom Catherwood","Very fair and I think along those lines, we've seen new lab space development that happened and it's also ongoing in West Harlem, there was an incubator up there right now and there's been a number of companies that have formed a Tech transfers out of Columbia up there. Is this kind of a test the waters kind of move where you get to feel out the potential, a growing cluster in New York or is it just the connection to Columbia that was really the benefit?","Joel Marcus","Well, I think most of the \u2013 and you have to take demand kind of with a grain of salt in New York, there is some institutional demand. And I think that's been the focus of some of the developers there, because there's not a line of companies waiting like there is as in San Francisco or Cambridge has pretty prototypical examples. Columbia is the biggest and most dominant institution. They have a huge amount of NIH funding. So it's really part of a strategic ability to take advantage of that opportunity. I'm not sure whether there will be a sub-cluster of any effort up there. There is you mentioned one incubator, that's the Harlem bio space, but that's 3,000 square feet. So I think you can't assume that a massive amount of incubation space.","Tom Catherwood","Very fair. Thanks, Joel.","Joel Marcus","Yeah.","Operator","The next question comes from Dave Rodgers with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Dave Rodgers","Hey, good afternoon. Steve wanted to start with you on the 88 Bluxome property. I think you've quoted now couple of times like 60% leased or committed and Pinterest only get to you a portion of the way there. So if you had said it earlier, I missed it and you mentioned a lot of leases at the beginning of the call. But have you announced the second lease there? Can you give a little more color on that?","Steve Richardson","Dave, hi it\u2019s Steve. Yeah this is the historical kind of relationship we had with the Bay Club. So that's the other leased that\u2019s counting towards that occupancy percentage of the overall mixed-use complex.","Dave Rodgers","Got you. That's helpful. Thank you.","Steve Richardson","Sure.","Dave Rodgers","Dean, the increase in capitalized interest I think, for this year. Was that just purely a function of more land kind of acquired in the most recent quarter? Were there any other changes as you looked at kind of that bucket of capitalized properties?","Dean Shigenaga","No, I just \u2013 what has increased is the dollar basis on average days under qualifying activities, which could be construction, vertical construction or pre-construction which is entitlements. So we have more activity today than we did last year as an example. And that's I think apparent as you look at our disclosures for product beyond 2019 as an example.","Dave Rodgers","Right. It is and I guess I was just thinking within the guidance that went up not necessarily versus last year, but in your own guidance. So I guess I was just trying to reconcile any changes \u2013","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm sorry, Dave, you're right. In June \u2013 on June 20th, we filed an 8-K which highlighted an increase in our acquisition guidance. And a portion \u2013 a significant portion of that is future redevelopment and development opportunities. And that results in almost all those projects have qualifying activities that require capitalization of interests or guidance for cap interest went up at that point. And net interest went down, because there weren't any increases in interest costs anticipated. And just to round that out a little bit, Dave, we fund that with common equity, because that's non-income producing, there's no cash flows on the future development product. So that kind of helps you understand why there's no increase in interest cost, it\u2019s equity funded projects.","Dave Rodgers","And you're capitalizing the average cost of debt, I assume so that's the change.","Dean Shigenaga","I'm sorry?","Dave Rodgers","Yeah, I get you, that\u2019s helpful. I appreciate that. And then maybe last question for Joel. Joel, I think in the last cycle you go back to kind of early 2000s you guys were very aggressive buying buildings, land redevelopment, et cetera. But I guess I was wondering aside from the balance sheet which hasn't been much improved from that point in time. Have you guys done anything different? Or is it really just a market that's cooperating this time versus last time kind of the market that sell out, if you will, for a couple years?","Dean Shigenaga","Well, I think if you listen to the story, you would realize that Mission Bay took place in 2004-2005 and beyond where we shifted from single asset to a campus cluster strategy. We, in 2006, we moved Big Time [ph] into Cambridge with Tech Square and the entire Binney Street development of over 2 million square feet. And we won the RFP in New York. So the pivot in the days of 2004, \u201805 and \u201806 have vastly impacted our growth over the last number of years.","And I think that the leveraging and the investment grade that we achieved in 2011 have significantly enhanced our balance sheet to where we are today, we believe we've got what people sometimes refer to as a fortress balance sheet and that has enabled us to continue to grow. I think there's nobody who has this kind of a unique business. So I think nothing is ever the same. If you look at some of the things that we've done and some of the approaches we've taken in each of the markets, I think they're pretty highly differentiated than where we were say even five years ago or 10 years ago.","Dave Rodgers","Right, thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks.","Joel Marcus","Exactly at 60 minutes, 1 o'clock and 4 o'clock on the East Coast.

As we think about the second quarter, I guess management\u2019s take is, it seemed a little bit like the good old days one of those really ideal quarters pre-Lehman when ARE was hitting on all cylinders and we hope we are back to doing that and those were the days when we were among the top performers on a total return basis from IPO to Lehman. So we\u2019d like to return to that at some point here.","U.S. life science R&D spending is up this year to $82.7 billion, pharma performing well in the capital markets. They are obviously profitable with about $181 billion as of late on the balance sheet. The open innovation external research in key cluster markets continues to be the driver for pharma innovation and ARE has signed over 16 significant leases with big pharma over the last several years. The IPO window for biotech is actually open big time for the first time truly in a decade with a big upswing in drug approvals as well.","For 2013, there is 13 either new chemical entities or biologics that have been approved by the FDA through July 25 and an astounding 9 out of 13 or 69% were ARE client tenants. So we\u2019re very proud of that record. The NASDAQ biotech index is up about 27% for the first half and some of our clients have really had astounding performance Biogen Idec up 52% in 12 months, Celgene 99% in 12 months, Gilead 117% in 12 months, Onyx 70% in 12 months, Alumina 91% in 12 months. We really haven\u2019t seen that kind of performance in many years.","Scientists have been laboring for years to develop treatments that harness the body\u2019s immune system to destroy cancer, so-called cancer immunotherapy. Bristol Myers, Roche and Merck have experimental treatments in their pipelines which could become the biggest new drug class in history which is a very good thing; also a class of cancer stem cell companies are also holding great promise.","When we move from macro to internal growth I think we\u2019ll continue to see positive movement in occupancy in most of the markets probably Maryland still showing some uncertainty but we\u2019re making steady progress. RTP is likely to recover nicely and positive moves in Seattle particularly in light of this quarter what was a dip primarily due to the delivery of one of our Eastlake properties.","Solid quarter on leasing 768,000 square feet in both cash and GAAP were up nicely led by the San Francisco cluster market and the 499 Illinois lease with Alumina that Steve can comment more on during Q&A.","Moving to external growth, it was a solid leasing with deliveries of about 22,000 of re-development almost 250,000 square feet of development and about 167,000 square feet of previously vacant space. Over the next one to two quarters I think we\u2019ll see some positive leasing momentum continuing at 499 Illinois. We hope we\u2019ll be leasing another one to three floors at the Alexandria Center for Life Science in New York.","And then let me move to, I think our Alexandria Center at Kendall Square, our Binney Street corridor property. I want to focus particularly on 50 Binney which has probably the best water views of any of the sites there. We\u2019re working on a substantial redesign as well as a work going on to drive down cost to build and we\u2019re targeting now a very strong digital health and technology that of tenants in the market kind of a unique opportunity and time and potentially with a kick-off potentially in the first quarter of 2014.","We are tracking nice tenant demand in Lake Union in Seattle and Campus Pointe in San Diego for future developments. On the acquisition sides we get asked a lot about our philosophy on acquisitions. We\u2019re always in the market and we are tracking every possible lab or lab conversion deal that comes to market and we hope we\u2019re very discerning on that regard. There is quite a bit of product on the market today and we\u2019re looking carefully.","The top priority would be value-add and obviously good submarkets where we have ability to match tenants in hand with the acquisition and create value. If we acquire stabilized assets they must be at solid yields not low yields in secondary submarkets. On the balance sheet which Dean will have more to say about in a moment, clearly we continue to realize land sales of our non-income producing assets like the Mission Bay West which has been announced this quarter.","In India, we are working hard on new investment with respect to our platform and in China we\u2019re working hard on the potential contribution of our assets into a broad healthcare services platform. When we move to the dividend I think you will continue to see the Board increase the dividend and continue to share I should say increases in cash flow with investors particularly as we bring on some major projects during the latter third or fourth quarter here this year.","Let me turn it over to Peter Moglia for few comments on internal growth on leasing.","Peter Moglia","So our outlook for same-property performance for full year 2013 remains solid and up 5% to 7% on a cash basis and up 1% to 3% on a GAAP basis. Cash same-property performance at 8.3% for the first half of 2013 was driven primarily by the rent commencement for Alumina in San Diego in October of 2012 and the lease-up of some temporary vacancy in Cambridge at 790 Memorial and 300 Technology Square that had been vacant in the first half of 2012.","Same-property expenses were up 6.2% for the first half of 2013 primarily due to an increase in property tax rates in Greater Boston, higher snow removal expenses and higher repairs and maintenance expenses. 94% of our leases are triple net and therefore the increases in these operating expenses are recoverable from our tenants.","Rental rates on leasing activity have improved this year. Key drivers this quarter include better than anticipated rental rates primarily in Cambridge on releasing of space at 300 Tech Square and 215 First Street.","Value-added development projects that will deliver in the second half of 2013 include the fully leased 225 Binney project that will deliver on October 1 and the West Tower at Alexandria Center, which is currently 44% lease that will deliver in mid to late December. Value-add redevelopment projects with targeted deliveries in the third quarter include three of the five projects in redevelopment. 100% of the 285 Bear Hill Road project in Greater Boston, 25,000 square feet of the 36,000 square feet of CIP at 343 Oyster Point and the Bay Area and the entire 9800 Medical Center Drive project in Maryland. I\u2019ll add that we also expect to deliver 79% of 4757 Nexus in the fourth quarter.","With that I\u2019ll hand over to Dean.","Dean Shigenaga","Thanks, Peter. Real briefly here guys. Quickly to the balance sheet. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA was about 6.6 times and our fixed charge coverage ratio was about 2.7 times for quarter end. And we\u2019re projecting improvement in leverage to 6.5 times by the end of the year and our fixed charge coverage ratio to be about 3.3 times by - at year end. Our unhedged variable rate debt is down nicely to approximately 11% of total debt. We\u2019ve got a tremendous amount of liquidity today with $1.5 billion available on our line and $300 million in cash.","Our outstanding debt under our three bank facilities were reduced by over $700 million or approximately 37% since January 1. Briefly some updates on our three bank facilities. In July, we completed an amendment to our 2016 unsecured term loan to reduce the interest rate to LIBOR plus 120 basis points. Our goal is to retire this $600 million term loan over the next one to three years so we kept the maturity around mid-2016.","At the end of August, we expect to close an amendment to our $1.5 billion line of credit in our $600 million 2017 unsecured term loan. The amendment is focused primarily on extending the maturities from 2017 to January of 2019 reducing the interest rate for outstanding borrowings and minor adjustments in our favor to a few financial covenants.","Aggregate commitments will not change. Pricing at the line of credit will be reduced to LIBOR plus a 110 basis points plus an annual facility fee up 20 basis points and our 2017 term loan will drop to LIBOR plus 120 basis points.","Our guidance for the full year includes an estimated loss of $0.02 per share that we expect to recognize in the third quarter related to the write-off of a portion of unamortized loan fees related to these amendments.","We also expect to close the secured construction loan over the next couple of weeks for 75\/125 Binney Street with commitments of approximately 65% of the total cost to completion. The anticipated interest rate on the loan will be LIBOR plus 135 basis points.","Lastly on guidance, we updated our guidance for earnings per share diluted to a range from $1.53 to $1.63. We reaffirmed our guidance for FFO per share as adjusted for 2013 to a range from $4.35 to $4.45. Our guidance for FFO per share as adjusted as a reminder excludes $0.03 of losses on early extinguishment of debt due to the write-off of unamortized loan fees, $0.01 was recognized in the second quarter and again $0.02 are estimated for the third quarter. And as a reminder, our detailed guidance assumptions for the year are included on page three of our earnings release.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Joel.","Joel Marcus","So, that\u2019s it for prepared remarks. We did it in less than 15 minutes. So, let\u2019s go to the operator for Q&A please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) And for our first question, we go to Emmanuel Korchman with Citi.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citi","Hey, good afternoon, guys.","Joel Marcus","Good afternoon.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citi","Just you guys sort of breezed through but can you give more details on what exactly you said on China it sounded like some kind of contribution into a services platform and also the continued build out in India and how we should think about maybe size and scope and timing of that?","Dean Shigenaga","Well, let me - let me say this about each one of those. With respect to China, we\u2019re working on a pending transaction so I don\u2019t want to say anything more but we\u2019re looking at contributing our assets to a broader healthcare services platform, which we think has enormous value. We don\u2019t plan to put any significant more capital into that but this gives us a chance to add our assets to a larger pool and potentially earn some significant fees for helping manage some of that effort.","In India its, we\u2019re involved in raising additional investment funds. We don\u2019t again plan to put any significant or really any significant funds into India it would be primarily through third-parties so there is nothing changing. According to our business plan we just moved it ahead quite a bit as we\u2018ve announced in the past. So, that\u2019s about all I could say about it for the moment.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citi","And Joel, I don\u2019t know if you can talk about this or not but in China you would still maintain some type of equity position or you sell it completely?","Dean Shigenaga","We would maintain some kind of an equity position but potentially that would be a liquid security.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citi","Okay. And then just looking at the back half acquisition pipeline, it looks like from your disclosure you have $64 million of projected completed or in-process acquisitions. I was wondering kind of what stage that\u2019s in right now and what those might be and just what the remaining asset acquisitions might look like?","Dean Shigenaga","Yes. So, we have something in the range of $64 plus million in process today. We expect to close those this quarter. And then behind that, we have probably another $150 million of asset acquisitions that are in relatively near-term pipeline but not in a formal process yet. So, that kind of where we are at the moment I\u2019m not sure, I want to say anything else about where how, whenever. But if you listen to my comments about the attributes that we\u2019re looking for we\u2019ll stay true to how we\u2019re thinking about those.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citi","So, just so I get this correct, those are unlikely to be sort of value-add opportunities and more likely to be sort of portfolio quality acquisitions?","Dean Shigenaga","No, I didn\u2019t say that. I said, we really are looking at two kinds of acquisitions and I think you\u2019ll see whatever we end up acquiring this year will be either value-add or if it happens to be stabilized it will have a good yield or strong yield and it won\u2019t be in secondary or tertiary markets. We\u2019re not looking for those kinds of acquisitions. So, that the parameters under which we are thinking about things because we\u2019re seeing a fair amount being brought to market these days as I shared over the past quarter or so.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citi","Okay. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you.","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","And for our next question, we go to Gabe Hilmoe with UBS.","Gabe Hilmoe - UBS","Hi, guys. Just following up on --","Joel Marcus","Hi.","Gabe Hilmoe - UBS","Just some pricing around the acquisitions and the yields I guess, when we were looking at kind of the conversion, redevelopment type plays versus core, how should we kind of be thinking about growing cap rates with that type of stuff?","Peter Moglia","Yes. This is Peter Moglia. I think that the way that things we\u2019re underwriting for the redevelopment properties that we\u2019re looking at now they are obviously going to range depending on the market something in a core market like Cambridge may price differently then something in a market in San Diego. But in general, we\u2019re looking at redevelopment stuff that\u2019s between 7% and 8% right now.","Gabe Hilmoe - UBS","Okay. And just kind of on core, I mean for best of the best in Cambridge?","Peter Moglia","We don\u2019t -- we\u2019re not really looking at anything new and we\u2019re obviously developing the Binney Street projects to very high yields and we\u2019ve plenty in our pipeline for that market. But I would say that it\u2019s still a very vibrant market for investment and if we decided to switch from development to acquisition there I think we would find cap rates to be very low. So, we\u2019re very comfortable with what we\u2019ve now in our development. As Joel said, we\u2019re going to look for stabilized opportunities but we don\u2019t want to go too crazy with cap rates and things that are priced fairly.","Joel Marcus","Yes. And ideally they would be in the high sixes or well above that. I don\u2019t think you will see us buy anything in the six range or below or even mid sixes unless it was something unusual but we don\u2019t have anything in our pipeline today that kind of is targeted there.","Gabe Hilmoe - UBS","Okay. And then on the 50 Binney development Joel I think you mentioned potentially starting that January of next year, did I hear that correctly?","Joel Marcus","First quarter.","Gabe Hilmoe - UBS","What kind of pre-leasing do you need to have to go live with that?","Joel Marcus","Yes, I think stay tuned because we\u2019re working hard on a number of requirements that seem to be unusual in the market and I don\u2019t want to commit at the moment. I mean, we ended up, we\u2019ve done 100% pre-leasing like Biogen Idec at 225 and in New York we did 15% and now that\u2019s stepped up to much larger than that. So, I think it kind of depends. But we see an unusual interesting opportunity in the market very little competitive product, which is very important and a surge in requirements in the Digital Health and Tech area.","As you know on the lab side, we\u2019re still looking at 100 Binney for one or more lab tenants but we\u2019re also mindful that there is a lot of lab space not necessarily competitive maybe second, third or fourth generation space that\u2019s coming back over in 2014 from Vertex\u2019s move to Fan Pier so we\u2019re mindful of that. But we see kind of unique opportunity in the market for a period of time, where we maybe the only game in town and there are some pretty good sized requirements there at pretty good yields. So, let me just leave it at that.","Gabe Hilmoe - UBS","Okay. And I guess, just one more for you, Joel. Just on the land sale in Mission Bay. I was wondering if you can give a little bit more color on the decision to do that because you have spoken in the past about your expectations are pretty sizable institutional demand kind of coming down to that part of the market after the hospitals done I'm just looking for a little bit more color on the (business in that sellout)?","Joel Marcus","Yes, I'm going to ask Steve to comment obviously it\u2019s a pending transaction so he may just give you some broad brushes, but I think it\u2019s fair to say that we have to think cleverly, in-depthly and flexibly our balance sheets now probably the best its ever been but we\u2019re mindful that we still have a bit more non-income producing property than we want and our targets are to bring that down even more over time we\u2019re looking at a ratings upgrade hopefully over the coming year from S&P and so we want to be mindful of that.","And here was a very solid opportunity that came long, there was ownership desire and ownership that was desired by the acquirer and so we thought long and heard about it, but felt we have enough flexibility in the Mission Bay area over time that we felt that was not getting heard us strategically to do that, but Steve can give you some further color.","Steve Richardson","Yes. Just to add to that the ownership dimension was really an imperative. So we had enough heading down that path and it will be a mix of the land and existing improvements as well including parking spaces.","Gabe Hilmoe - UBS","All right. Thanks guys.","Joel Marcus","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question we go to Jeff Theiler with Green Street Advisors.","Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors","Good afternoon. I was wondering if you can just give a quick update on the cap rate environment and why did it rise in interest rates lately, do you expect to see cap rates trend up do you expect certain markets to be more affected, any additional color you can provide on that would be helpful?","Joel Marcus","Okay. We\u2019re helping you with your next edition. Peter will talk to you about that.","Peter Moglia","Yes, I mean we - we\u2019ve been discussing it obviously we got to pay attention to a rising interest rates and how that\u2019s going to affect our business. But, I\u2019ve been in the business for over 20 years and doing acquisitions for much of that, and I think what - I think that it\u2019s if the rates remain up a 100 basis points and we kind of stabilize here I think there is plenty of room in the risk premium that cap rates have over treasuries to absorb it. So I wouldn\u2019t think that we\u2019re going to see much of any movement.","I think if they continue to rise and it\u2019s rise in real interest rate I mean rise and really yield that\u2019s driving it then cap rates will ultimately have to adjust. And however, I would say that there is going to be at least 6 to 12 months delay before that happens because sellers are the last to understand that they need to lower their price. I\u2019d say that if the rise is due to inflation and may be the effect would be muted a little bit because it\u2019s a possibility that more funds will flow into real estate looking to hedge, but that\u2019s basically how we feel right now and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see much of any movement.","Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors","Okay. And any markets if you do see markets - movement any markets in particular that you would be more worried about than others?","Peter Moglia","I mean the markets that have the weakest demand for products obviously are going to be the most sensitive to it, and we\u2019re not really in acquisition mode in any of those markets.","Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors","All right. Okay, fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","And we go next to Jamie Feldman with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Greta, thank you. I just want to focus on internal growth a little bit. So you guys have had a pretty solid year for leasing spreads and same-store growth. Can you talk about the sustainability of both of those metrics as we roll on to the back half of the year and even in the 2014?","Dean Shigenaga","Well I think Jamie its Dean here. On same property you can tell from our first half results being at least on a cash basis very solid at 8.3% and our guidance has remained for the full year at 5% to 7% which is very solid results anticipated for the full year. It also implies that the first half as Peter had commented on had a few drivers lease-up of some space in Cambridge that was vacant in the first half of the 2012 that boosts the first half of 2013 cash performance. So I think you\u2019ll see slightly small or same property cash results on the back half of 2013, but still falling right in the core of our targeted 5% to 7%.","I think if you roll these numbers forward to 2014 you\u2019ll see statistics that should be big picture roughly in line with our current target for 2013. So I\u2019d say somewhere in that north of 5% range on cash and GAAP same property results in that similar range up to 3%, but we\u2019ll give you a better update as we get out into our Investor Day presentation in December. When you think about leasing, the leasing stats are very strong at 6.5 on a cash basis, 12.7 on a GAAP basis those fall relatively in line with our guidance for the full year. Cash leasing stats at 3 to 5 for the full year slightly down there, but the GAAP numbers are going to be right down the fairway for the back half of the year.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","So I guess focusing on rents, what are you guys thinking and what are you seeing in terms of just market rent growth?","Dean Shigenaga","Well, I think when you look at - you almost got a go market-by-market, we\u2019ve been successful as you can tell from our commentary for the last two calls and in Cambridge and re-leasing our spaces. San Diego we\u2019ve done well and Seattle we\u2019ve done well and I think Merrill Lynch been clear that rents have remained challenging in and out C&E dramatic growth coming out of that market. So I think our opportunity set remains in our core markets from Cambridge, San Diego, Mission Bay and up in Seattle.","Peter Moglia","Yes. Just to add to that Jamie, I mean when you look at vacancy rates and trends the direct vacancy in East Cambridge is dipped down pretty significantly 300 bps from 9.9% to 6.9% I mean Joel mentioned that Vertex space becoming available but that\u2019s always a little bit when you\u2019re dealing with sub-leases. The Boston Office market has improved as well with the tax sector to repines the availability debt 40 bps as well from 10.3% to 9.9%. San Francisco market burning off some of the availability at 99, Illinois, South San Francisco, San Mateo County we\u2019re about in 9.5% vacancy. So the overall market stats are trending in the right direction as well.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Did you have a sense of where market rents are for your product year-over-year and may be on the net effective basis what kind of growth you\u2019ve seen?","Peter Moglia","Well, I think there are reflected here in the stats that we\u2019ve been talking about with the cash and the GAAP increases.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Joel Marcus","And Jamie to fair, we don\u2019t have the net effective numbers right in front of us. So I can\u2019t give you an exact answer to your question.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","And then turning to your comments on Digital Tech and Health, can you just help frame may be how large that opportunity is and may be it sounds like in Cambridge but is it that something we\u2019ll see spread across other markets?","Joel Marcus","Well, it\u2019s a big opportunity right now and we\u2019re - we\u2019ve signed one lease and we\u2019re looking at some others in the San Francisco Bay area I think the Bay area is really where the home of this is resident, but we see Cambridge, Boston and the San Francisco Bay area is really the major areas. Yeah, Digital Health is kind of an interesting area because of the very broad, it\u2019s a very broad intersection of essentially the IT platform type companies and healthcare and it\u2019s one of those situations where there are going to be and they\u2019re already are many opportunities for the convergence to take advantage of lowering healthcare clause this isn\u2019t so much in the pharma and drug area it relate to a large extent is in many of the other areas which are really big areas.","And so it will happen in pharma and drugs to some extent but the big -- the big opportunity are in electronic monitoring and number of the service components, it\u2019s quite a quite a big area. If you want to read something that\u2019s pretty stellar about this read Eric Topol\u2019s book. He is really the guru in this area. He is a professor -- tenured professor down at UCSD and he is really predicted this to be the fastest growing area of the new economy over the next decade and I personally believe it.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","And then what kind of - how is the building requirement different for Digital Health versus your typical life sciences?","Joel Marcus","Well, it would be much more of a techie kind of building, but they meet our qualifications because most of those locations want to be in Mission Bay for example, they want to be in Palo Alto, they want to be in Cambridge, they want to be in Boston, they want to be in really the CBD areas that we focused our Class-A, our AAA locations and Class-A product force. So, we see it as a natural kind of extension of what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re not dramatically changing our focus but it\u2019s clear that a lot of demand we\u2019re seeing in these markets is aimed in that direction.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","And so you are saying its more like traditional office space I know its Tech but --","Joel Marcus","I don\u2019t think its traditional office. It\u2019s really new generation high-tech and we\u2019re building out a space for the probably the premier incubator backed by Kleiner Perkins in San Francisco called Rock Health and its very cool, very techie, very cool space and its taken about couple of 1000 square feet in our 455 Mission Bay facility that was actually going to go retail interestingly enough. So, we see it as a natural compliment to what we\u2019re doing.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. Their last component or no?","Dean Shigenaga","I\u2019ll add to that --","Joel Marcus","","Dean Shigenaga?","Dean Shigenaga","Jamie the infrastructure you\u2019re going to see in that type of use is you\u2019re going to need a lot of air to keep the computers cool. You\u2019re going to need a lot of power, a lot more power than you would supply in office building with so. As Joel said its not traditional office, it is an infrastructure play. It just doesn\u2019t have the weight component to it.","Joel Marcus","And it\u2019s not data centers either.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. All right. Great.","Joel Marcus","Yes. The key is we want to be in the best AAA CBD locations where we have our anchor business and with Class-A assets and if we can do that and meet some of this demand that\u2019s going to be great and meet our yield hurdles.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","So, the yield is comparable to your traditional life science?","Joel Marcus","Well, I think its case-by-case. We don\u2019t have enough experience there but certainly the cost of construction is less and so one would hope you could meet pretty good yields.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","We\u2019re pretty comfortable in the yields we\u2019re targeting in Cambridge.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We go next to Matthew Spencer with Robert W. Baird.","Dave Rodgers - Robert W. Baird","Hey, guys, its Dave Rodgers. I wanted to follow up on 499 Illinois and maybe kind of tie-in the digital management question. I mean is that kind of what you\u2019re looking at for space out there or is that going to be continued to be more traditional lab. And can you give us some of the color on the backfilling work you\u2019re doing for that vacancy?","Dean Shigenaga","Yes. Hi, Dave. Right now we\u2019re looking at a mix of technology Digital Health and more traditional lab users as well as translational uses so then core benefiting again from that location and a number of different demand drivers there. We do have 30,000 square feet for a lease that\u2019s out for signature that\u2019s more on the traditional lab or translational lab type of side but we\u2019re actively talking with people on the technology in Digital Health side as well.","Dave Rodgers - Robert W. Baird","And then I guess maybe a question for Dean or for Steve if you have it. How many assets do you expect to come out of the core of the operating portfolio maybe during the second half of the year and move into redevelopment either the number of assets are particularly I guess square footage of assets coming out in the second half?","Joel Marcus","Well, I think if you go to - if you go to the supplement I think its kind of -","Dean Shigenaga","Page 17.","Joel Marcus","Yes, page 17. I think clearly this year we don\u2019t have anything targeted for redevelopment and we\u2019ve one or maybe two combined assets next year that are kind of a little bit older office like properties in the suburban DC market that if they in fact will that we would likely try to enhance those and go for some kind of a laboratory use but other than that we don\u2019t have anything unless we buy something that we would be converting like the Barnes Canyon.","Dave Rodgers - Robert W. Baird","Okay. Thank you. And then maybe a question for Peter on the disposition side it sounds like acquisitions remain competitive but are heating up in terms of the number of offerings out there is that bleeding over to the dispositions you\u2019d like to do and make you think a little bit broader about the disposition pipeline of assets that you think about putting out there?","Joel Marcus","Yes. Well, I think we\u2019ve indicated we don\u2019t have any plans for any significant dispositions. But we are continually looking at the asset base for non-income producing assets much like Steve mentioned the Mission Bay West sale. You may see some more of that. We would hope that we would be able to lower our total non-income producing assets. But I think there may be here and there are small income producing asset or so. There is a handful but nothing of any significance. But I think the place you ought to focus would be further sales of land asset.","Dave Rodgers - Robert W. Baird","Great. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","And we go next to Steve Sakwa with ISI Group.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group","Thanks. Good afternoon, Joel.","Joel Marcus","Hi, there.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group","I was wondering if you could just touch on a little bit more about the New York demand it sounds like you\u2019ve got another use that might take one to two floors. I\u2019m just curious kind of the pace of leasing now that you\u2019ve got kind of the major anchor tenant and what are you seeing, what are happening with rents?","And then second question, if you could just comment on the TI and leasing commissions figure this quarter and I know that jumped quite a bit and I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s tied directly into the leasing that you might have done in New York?","Joel Marcus","Yes. So, when you look at the floor plan of Roche is taking the top two floors. The floors are all about 30,000 plus square feet a piece. Our second anchor investment grade tenant is taking floors two, three, four and five. The lobby will be, we\u2019re actually moving our office. We\u2019ve actually leased our office in which has great views and so forth at a great rate and we\u2019ll be moving when the building opens to the ground floor the new building together with the fitness center and so forth. But we\u2019ve in process and we\u2019re still at the exchanging LOI stage with one former tenant to take potentially one to two floors and this would be lab space. I\u2019m pretty optimistic. It\u2019s hard to know exactly the timing but third and fourth quarter I give it a plus 50%.","We\u2019re also working with a joint venture of a biotech and a big pharma for potentially a full floor so that might take 12 and 14 and 9 in those two separate transactions. And then we have a biotech tenant that is actually in public offering mode right now that looks to take potentially the better part of maybe a half a floor more and then we\u2019ve our accelerator effort, which we hope to get off the ground this quarter in fact to take the other half of the floor.","So, I say in the short-term we probably got three, four floors working I kind of round down just to be conservative so may be one to three is what I said on my commentary those are all lab users. Rents have held very strong. We\u2019re in the well within our targets in the upper 70s approaching $80 triple net. And as you know, I think the lease we signed leasing commissions in New York are just always higher than many other places and our TIs are maybe a little bit more than because of the nature of the tenant.","But I think our yields are holding in fact our yields might even have some room for growth and certainly the average stabilized yield, which we disclosed this quarter in New York is above seven. So, we feel pretty good about if we were to turn around and sell a first class building in New York with credit tenants that are 10, 15, 20 years my guess is we could do better than a seven cap rate on that by a long shot. So, I feel pretty good about the economics there and the demand is.","It\u2019s a market that there is not normal demand because its not a Cambridge or Boston established so we\u2019ve created the demand and I think with the product type and the cluster ecosystem we\u2019ve developed I think we\u2019ve done a really nice job of doing that and so I feel very, very good about the prospects in New York. If you remember the East Tower when we built that it was a 100% spec pre-Lehman. We delivered it in the mid, well in the fall of 2010. We had a three year lease up and we actually finished leasing it up in 12 months. So, I\u2019m not saying we can do that exactly but I think we\u2019re on track maybe to come close to that.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group","Okay. And then, I know you guys have been working very actively to kind of whittle down the land bank and the kind of development pipeline but as you start to get some of these other projects completed whether it would be Binney or New York and obviously you are making progress in San Francisco. Have you sort of think about backfilling the development pipeline over the next two to four years?","Joel Marcus","Yes. That\u2019s a really good question. I think though if you look at the supplement, which Dean and the team have I think masterfully developed there is we\u2019ve quite a bit. I mean we - there is no shortage of opportunities. San Diego we\u2019ve got quite a bit. We\u2019ve got some in Seattle. We\u2019ve got some in the San Francisco Bay (inaudible) probably isn\u2019t going to happen. We\u2019ve got another option parcel in New York and we still got over a million square feet in Binney.","So, I think for the next two to four years, we\u2019re probably in good shape but if we have an unusual requirement and we wouldn\u2019t hesitate to try to go out and buy land to match I don\u2019t think we need to do that I hope we don\u2019t have to. But our goal is to get that rating up with S&P and ultimately both rating is up over - over the more medium term.","So, we\u2019re mindful of not carrying that land. But if we\u2019ve opportunity in hand and we could snag a land parcel that would be a better way to go rather than keep it on balance sheet for an indeterminate time. We\u2019ve certainly been beaten up over the last many years for that strategy, which work so successfully pre-Lehman but we\u2019ve obviously adjusted that strategy.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group","Okay. Thanks.","Joel Marcus","Yes. Thanks, Steve.","Operator","And we go next to Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets","Yes. Thank you. When did you guys first noticed the pickup in the acquisition opportunities that you are tracking in the market today?","Joel Marcus","They have seen that way for a while we\u2019ve focused. I mean we\u2019ve never been out of the acquisition market. But remember our major focus was getting our balance sheet to an investment grade level that would enable us to upgrade our BBB minus rating with S&P. We\u2019re BBB flat with Moody\u2019s that\u2019s been the focus. So, we\u2019ve not wanted to put additional pressure on the balance sheet over the last couple of years.","We\u2019ve done some last year. We bought a great site in San Diego that we\u2019re likely to start development on here in the coming couple of quarters. It looks like we may have some tenants there at the Spectrum project. So we\u2019re in the market we see everything. We look at everything. We think about things. We looked at big project in Cambridge that we have some real interest in but it kind of waned and ultimately never got sold. So, I\u2019d say we were always in the market.","Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And what\u2019s the - is there more single type assets out there or are there portfolio deals with typical type of opportunity?","Joel Marcus","It varies. I would say larger portfolios no but as asset or two or three or larger asset those are out there and sometimes we go hunting. We don\u2019t just wait for things to come to market. We actually look at opportunities that we\u2019d like to be involved with and see if there is some way to create a win-win opportunity. So, it isn\u2019t like we just wait for something to come across the fax machine or email that isn\u2019t how this business is done.","Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then are there stabilized lab assets or should we expect more of these redevelopment type office assets like the one you completed this quarter?","Joel Marcus","Yes, I think you\u2019ll see I think somebody else asked that question. I think you\u2019ll see a combination and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see as by high price, low cap rate assets in tertiary market that\u2019s not a business model that we would subscribe to.","Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Market","Okay. Thanks.","Joel Marcus","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","And with a follow-up question, we return to Emmanuel Korchman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","Yes. It\u2019s Michael Bilerman speaking. I may have missed this but this one 1600 Owens what\u2019s your sort of all-in basis with the allocated parking and improvements for that land?","Joel Marcus","Yes. I think one thing we would say Michael is because it\u2019s a pending transaction allow us to complete the transaction then we\u2019ll fully disclose that. I think at this point it would be better not to say make any comment on that but we\u2019ll have a gain on the transaction.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","Is there a range of gain are we talking about 10%, just to understand -- to understand how much of the non-income producing bucket because its obviously an important part of your strategy of whittling that down and then creating capital for future growth?","Joel Marcus","Yes, Michael to give you some idea its - inside of 10% of the transaction.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","Okay. And Joel just a question for you in terms of the shareholder vote and to Say on Pay which arguably was probably disappointing to yourself and to the board of only getting 9% of shareholders to support Say on Pay and the compensation. I guess, what have you gone back? What is the comp committee you\u2019ve gone back and sort of evaluated based on what shareholders have said and voted effectively? I recognize its not binding but it\u2019s clearly was a message and so I\u2019m just curious how you as well as the comp committee have reacted?","Joel Marcus","Well, I think that you have to put it into perspective when I renegotiate in my contract in 2012 with the company it took many, many months to figure out a formula going from kind of what was the old and established and accepted contract, which have the bells and whistles that the folks at ISS and others ultimately didn\u2019t like and many CEOs were in that position and we worked long and hard. We probably spent about six to nine months on it because it\u2019s a black box ultimately because it\u2019s a little different than going to the IRS, where you get an advanced drilling and say if we do this transaction, can we get approval with ISS and other folks that overview that kind of stuff. You actually don\u2019t have. You can\u2019t get that ahead of time and they are also looking at every company as the same. This company is a science driven company. It\u2019s a development company. It\u2019s got a senior management team of 12 to 15 people, who have been with the company for more than a decade.","This is a complicated business if not let\u2019s go out and buy suburban office and just kind of do that as a play. So, it\u2019s a complicated set and I\u2019m probably one of the only people that have technical experience both on the life science side from decades and also on the real estate side. So, we ultimately ended up with a contract that actually got approved by recommended for approval by ISS last year. They said you have made enough changes and you worked well and they gave it a stamp of approval. And again, we didn\u2019t, we couldn\u2019t know that ahead of time, which was always kind of tough because you wok hard and it\u2019s always give and take on both sides.","So, this year, what really made the difference I think, there was a signing bonus that was vested over the I think, I forget the ratio but let\u2019s say it\u2019s 50\/50 it might have been 40\/60 but part over - over a number of years none of which vested in 2013 and then in separate part that was based on total performance again none of which vested in 2013 but the value of that signing bonus was a $5million but all of which was downstream over many years not a huge number if you compare to other CEOs out there I\u2018m sure.","And ISS absolutely because of the way they stack and the way they measure its not whether it realized, it\u2019s whether, it just comes to fruition by a reporting matter. So, that was the thing that kind of tip the scales encrypt it. And so obviously the company, myself independently the comp committee and their advisors are looking how do we kind of fix that in a way that\u2019s there and reasonable for everybody.","So, we\u2019re working through that and that\u2019s gong to take a deal time again the challenge is one can\u2019t go back to ISS and get some blessing you kind of have to do you best and then hope that they bless it. But I\u2019m also mindful that I don\u2019t want both as the CEO, a member of the board, the founder of this company I don\u2019t think that, we ought to have some agency that has a lot of conflict that\u2019s being investigated by Congress to actually order us or tell us what to do when we compensate whether its media or senior executives.","They can suggest things. They can set best practices but I don\u2019t think they ought to like control the world. So, I think, we have to take a balanced approach to that and I think the board, the comp committee myself and the company as a whole are trying to do that. we have operated in good faith. We have always done the right thing. We certainly never done anything that didn\u2019t make good sense and I think you\u2019ll see that outcome in the 2014 proxy so that\u2019s kind of how we view it.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","Well, I guess ISS and Glass Lewis and not everyone has to vote with them you still had 52 million shares that were voted against the plan. They don\u2019t necessarily have to vote upon those recommendations and as sort of you and also from shareholders perspective right because the shareholder can make their own independent determination?","Joel Marcus","For sure but yeah for sure but they carry a lot of weight. I think the other thing that obviously trips - has tripped the company, it didn\u2019t trip them in approving last year the nature of the contract but this year I think our total return performance over the 1, 3, and 5 years has not been what it was pre-Lehman and one of the reasons is if you look at we ended up the end of 2008 at one of the highest stock prices of any REIT.","And then if you take that as a base going forward on a comparison of 1,3 and 5 years, if you start at $60 a share and a lot of guys were selling in single-digits the performance over the next couple of years were going to be naturally devastated by that high stock price. And so, we just haven\u2019t performed up to par and obviously we\u2019ve been in a multiyear balance sheet transition. So, those things have obviously hurt us and hurt us in the eyes of shareholders as well.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","Just a question on the acquisition so of the 200 to 300 that is in guidance what sort of contribution to earnings do you have in there for the back half of the year?","Dean Shigenaga","Michael, its Dean here. It\u2019s relatively smaller. It\u2019s $0.02 to $0.03 in that range. And keep in mind it\u2019s probably more impactful in the fourth quarter because what we\u2019re doing is taking cash sitting idle on our balance sheet today and putting that to use so.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","Right and well I guess, and it does depend I guess, its value-add I guess, you are not going to earn the return on those value-add deals that you - could that just be land or that is more redevelopment in terms of spend?","Joel Marcus","","Well, the one way to think of it Michael is it really depends on the transaction itself but the Barnes Canyon transaction as an example that one is really small but its real and you can look at it. Our disclosures indicate that we\u2019ll carry a 7% return. Short-term, while we\u2019re able to do our planning and design for the redevelopment and with any luck there is limited downtime to transition from a value-add 7% yield to a redevelopment return to be slightly (viable).","Michael Bilerman - Citi","And I guess, just lastly Joel, I guess the acquisitions some have worked out in the past, some haven\u2019t you obviously have a great significant amount of redevelopment, new development, good internal growth going. I guess, when you sit back do you seeing what. I\u2019m just going to forget about these acquisitions and I\u2019ll keep my leverage, my leverage will be lower or I have enough money to fund the development I won\u2019t have to really on ATM and really allow the stock to gain some momentum rather than trying to replenish or going out and doing other value-add or even higher cap rate, core assets. I guess, if you rethought maybe saying what forget about it let\u2019s just move forward on what we already have in our plate, which is quite substantial.","Joel Marcus","Well, I think that again, you have to look at everything combined. Its not, it\u2019s no binary. I think when we look at the acquisition we made last year in the Barnes Canyon if we have we see a particularly good location that we like. We have targeted tenants that we are pretty interested in and in both cases, we do. We feel like it make sense. We\u2019ve got pretty high occupancy and a lot of our key markets.","So, I think, Peter said, we\u2019re not necessarily looking for big Cambridge acquisitions because we\u2019ve got a lot on our plate then I think San Diego is very interesting place, New York City represents an interesting opportunity to the extent that it make sense in a market or two.","So, I don\u2019t think you are going to see us change dramatically from what we\u2019ve been doing. I mean, we\u2019ve been in the acquisition market as I say every quarter all the time and we try to be pretty discrete. So, I don\u2019t think, we\u2019re trying to be, we\u2019re not trying to ramp that up in any unusual way. We may or may not meet those targets but I think we\u2019ll be able to hopefully meet guidance as best we can and I think we\u2019ve got all the wherewithal to do that. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re changing our strategy and I think we\u2019re committed to lower leverage. Our balance sheet is in great shape.","But we want to grow and where we see the opportunity for to match tenants with product and if we don\u2019t own it, we can\u2019t necessarily just go out and build everything. And as you see from the schedule, we don\u2019t have anything targeted for redevelopment this year and only one or two assets that we currently own potentially for next year maybe there was some other add-on. So, I don\u2019t think you will see anything dramatic that we\u2019re doing that would change what we done in the past.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And with that ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019ll end our Q&A session and therefore Mr. Marcus I\u2019ll turn the conference back over to you for any closing remarks.","Joel Marcus","Okay.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz. Please go ahead.","Paula Schwartz","Thank you and good afternoon. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company\u2019s actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company\u2019s periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","I now would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus. Please go ahead, sir..","Joel Marcus","Thank you, Paula, and welcome everybody to the second quarter earnings call. With me today are Dean Shigenaga; Steve Richardson; Peter Moglia; Dan Ryan; and Tom Andrews.","I want to first of all congratulate the entire Alexandria family on a truly excellently executed second quarter against a backdrop of continuing economic growth. We\u2019ve been fortunate to have continuing strong demand in our key cluster markets with very limited supply, continued help and growth of our tenant base, continued strong leasing activity with solid rent spreads.","And I guess, this quarter the prize goes to San Diego for 34% of the rentable square foot lease, Greater Boston at 32%, San Francisco at 18%. We also had continued very strong same-store growth come in on a number of these items in a moment or two, continued strong rental rate increases in occupancy, continued strong operating margins and continuing strong and flexible balance sheet.","On the macro side, the biotechnology sector has outperformed the broader markets and now sentiment has moved closer to sector fundamentals and help generally buy an industry-friendly draft executive orders, legislation and political appointments. Venture funding for life science companies remained strong and stable and 2017 is on pace to meet or exceed the historic funding levels of 2015 and 2016.","The FDA has approved 27 new therapeutics, both chemical and biological entities so far in 2017, exceeding 2016 and on pace for potentially a five-year approval average of 35 to 40. The new FDA Commissioner, Scott Gottlieb has announced a number of initiatives that help improve the FDA and encourage and support innovation.","And with the attention turning to tax reform, biopharma could benefit from cash repatriation and reduce corporate taxes freeing up additional capital to invest the top nine-based \u2013 U.S.-based biopharma companies have over $130 billion in cash overseas, so quite a significant cash store.","When it comes to healthcare, it\u2019s pretty fair to say that innovation, primarily technology innovation will ultimately be the big disrupter of the healthcare system. The economics, the healthcare will be the challenge of our time for many years to come and there are no simple and clear solutions. There\u2019s a great deal of need for payment reform for continuing to fund in innovation and for healthcare to be dealt with on a more regular basis rather than every seven or eight years.","The therapies and drugs in general are not the burden, there\u2019s only been a 3.8% increase over the last number of years and only about 14% of total costs, it\u2019s patient access to drugs being the critical issue and bill bags, meaning co-pays or deductibles. 30% of the price of therapies now go to middlemen who don\u2019t create any value, primarily the pharmacy benefit managers.","A comment or two about the ACA. You hear about it all the time. But interestingly enough, the exchanges only affect about 4% of the U.S. population, about 10.3 million people separately Medicaid expansion included about another 11 million. The industry is \u2013 has a number of different interactions with the ACA. I think it\u2019s fair to say that, insurance has turned into a utility on the exchanges and many insurance companies have really dropped out the marketplace or the exchanges truly are broken and that will be the challenge.","For now, the ACA, which was passed in the long 2010 provides insurance, as I said, to have between 11 million and 12 million people and will also keep in place Medicare expansion, I\u2019m sorry, Medicaid expansion coverage in 31 states, including the District of Columbia. Right now, there are 40 counties on federal exchanges, which have no insurers. And next year, over 1,300 counties are projected to have either a single insurer or no insurers. Nearly 3 million people may have only one insurer and companies like Athena, Anthem, Signal, Humana have pulled out of many of the exchanges.","Americas total Medicare \u2013 medical cost hit a record $3.4 trillion, 18% of GDP. But it\u2019s fair to say that, 5% of the population accounts for 50% of total medical cost, we call them, kind of super utilizers. And it\u2019s basically treatment in the end of life span or medical costs created by bad behaviors, the ones I mentioned in the number of quarters ago, including bad dietary habits, smoking, drinking, drugs, lack of sleep.","So with that, let\u2019s move it to some comments on external growth. As you see from the press release and supplement, we\u2019re on track to deliver in the second-half fully leased of projects at 100 Binney, 510 Townsend and then 505 Brannan all had very solid yields, and we\u2019re now focused on pre-leasing at 399 Binney, 279 East Grand Avenue, and 5 Lab Drive.","With that, let me turn it over to Dean for some detailed comments.","Dean Shigenaga","All right. Thanks, Joel. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everybody. We\u2019re very pleased with our continued strong execution and delivery of strong earnings growth by our entire team, and importantly, by our senior leaders that are now approaching 17 to 20 years with Alexandria. We\u2019re in a great position today and remain on track to deliver 9.3% growth in FFO per share in 2017.","I would like to briefly highlight one important topic before covering four other key topics. We have over many years now realized significant gains from our equity investments, primarily in life science and technology-related entities. We have also established important industry relationships through these investments.","The depth of our life science technology and real estate industry relationship has and will continue to provide our team with important leasing and real estate opportunities. While we have done very well in our investments, we\u2019re required to recognize impairments when appropriate.","In the second quarter, we recognized $4.5 million in impairments on our non-real estate investments, about 1.5 of this related to a publicly traded investment in a biopharmaceutical company focused on liver disease. The other half of the impairment related to an investment in a privately held life science entity. Keep in mind both entities are still in business and continue to execute their business strategy.","We remain in an excellent position in four key areas that I\u2019ll highlight today. First, we have continued solid internal growth. Second, we have strong and disciplined external growth. Importantly, we\u2019re in a unique position within the REIT sector with the third and very strong attribute, solid real estate in life science industry fundamentals. Fourth, we have a very strong balance sheet today, which will continue to improve and we will remain focused on our disciplined approach in our allocation of capital to drive growth into the future.","Leasing volume was very solid at $1.1 million square feet this quarter and rental rate growth was strong and up at 23.2% and 9.4% on a cash basis. Year-to-date, we executed $2.4 million rentable square feet of leasing, of which 56% represented early lease renewals on lease expirations in 2018, 2019 and 2020.","Fundamentals in our submarkets remain solid, which translates to a landlord favorable environment and minimize rent concessions and tenant improvement allowances. Our great asset management team combined with our unique triple net lease structure drove very strong EBITDA margins of 68% for the second quarter.","High occupancy of 95% over the last 10 years combined with operating performance, I just mentioned, has driven continued strength of same property performance at 2.2% and 6.2% on a cash basis for the first-half of 2017.","We\u2019ll remain on track for solid 2017 same property NOI growth of 2% to 4% and 5.5% to 7.5% on a cash basis. We\u2019re pleased with the consistency and level of our cash same property NOI growth that is as it is amongst the strongest in the industry.","We\u2019re on track to deliver on the commencement of another $100 million of incremental net operating income in 2017, 75% of this will be recognized in 2017 and the remainder will benefit NOI growth in 2018, oops, 25% of that will be recognized in 2017, 75% of that will benefit NOI growth in 2018.","New Class A buildings that are targeted for delivery in 2017 are on average, 85% leased. Our cash returns on our total investment are very solid at about 7% for projects targeted for delivery in 2017, 2018 and 2019, with individual projects above and below this average.","As Joel mentioned, our team made great progress on five tenant prospects of our development side at 100 Binney Street in Cambridge, and we anticipate being fully resolved on leasing on this projects in the third quarter.","As mentioned on our call last quarter, $40 million of contractual rents commenced on April 1, related to recently completed development and redevelopment projects. As of June 30, we have another $55 million of contractual rent commencements spread relatively evenly over the next five quarters through the third quarter of 2018, again, solely from recently completed development and redevelopment projects.","Our acquisitions to-date in 2017 have been primarily focused on disciplined allocation of capital to urban innovation cluster submarkets that will drive growth through selective development of Class A buildings. As a reminder for modeling purposes, these acquisitions generally provide enough of a benefit close to 4% in the intermediate term, or in the immediate term, I should say, representing the weighted average interest rate required for capitalization of interest.","Peter Moglia, along with our highly experienced team remain very disciplined in the underwriting of acquisitions and selective final decision to proceed with an acquisition. We are one of the few REITs in the \u2013 in a great position to describe solid internal growth; solid external growth; and importantly, continued solid real estate and life science fundamentals.","Our submarkets across the country continue to have limited supply of Class A space generally also characterized by a limited ability for developers to bring new supply of Class A space over the next couple of years and continued demand for our Class A buildings.","Life science fundamentals also remain solid. We are pleased to report one of the top tenant rosters in the REIT industry with 51% of our annual rental revenue in effect as of June 30, from investment-grade rated tenants. Additionally, the weighted average remaining term of our top 20 tenants was 9.7 years, excluding the long-term ground lease with Uber. The quality and stability of our cash flow is a truly unique within the REIT industry.","Our balance sheet is in an excellent position today and will continue to improve. We remain on track to achieve our leverage goals of 5.3 times to 5.8 times, both on a net debt and net debt plus preferred to adjusted EBITDA. Our fixed charge coverage ratio is strong and north of 4 times and we continue to maintain significant liquidity at $1.8 billion.","Our goal remains focused on continuing to improve our long-term cost of capital to support our strategic goals. Our capital allocation strategy will remain disciplined and will focus on adding significant value through selective high-quality development and redevelopment projects at solid returns on our total investment. Our goal is to be in a position to decide project by project to meet the demand of some of the most innovative entities in the world.","During the second quarter, we issued 2.1 million shares through our \u2013 at the market common stock offering program at about $119 per share. This was a very efficient capital that will fund significant value creation opportunities through the development of new Class A buildings.","Our current ATM program has been completed and we expect to file a new program soon. We still have 4.8 million shares under our forward equity offering from March of 2017 that we will settle over the next two quarters. Our equity capital for 2017 will be spread relatively evenly over the year with slightly higher amounts in the second-half of 2017 versus the first-half of 2017.","The equity capital that we are solving for in the remainder of the year is approximately $230 million, including some proceeds from the sales of non-core assets. As a reminder, this assumption along with our usual detailed assumptions included in our guidance for 2017 is disclosed on page five of our supplemental package.","In closing, we thank our team for their continued and strong execution quarter-to-quarter. Each of us are excited about the tremendous pace of innovation today and it\u2019s an honor and privilege for each of us to be an important partners to some of the world\u2019s most innovative entities.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Joel.","Joel Marcus","Thank you, operator. Let\u2019s go to Q&A please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","All right. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Sheila McGrath","Oh, yes, good afternoon. Joel, I was wondering if you could give us a little more detail or insight on the recent development site acquisition in the Greater Stanford market? Does that require additional entitlements and what are your thoughts on timing?","Joel Marcus","Yes, let me ask Steve to comment on that.","Stephen Richardson","Sheila, hi, it\u2019s Steve.","Sheila McGrath","Hey, Steve.","Stephen Richardson","We\u2019ve got \u2013 hey, we\u2019ve two parcels there. One of them is fully entitled, ready to go 500,000 square feet, the other adjacent parcel represents another 500,000 square feet, and we\u2019re estimating it will take about a year for entitlements. And we\u2019re just very excited to be in this cluster. As you know, we dive very deep into these core clusters.","We\u2019re tracking just a 1.9% vacancy rate right now there in the lab side, just about 8% on the tech side, very strong demand with about 3 million square feet of lab demand, 3.3 million square feet of tech demand, recent transactions both by lab companies, such as Grail, taking another 47,000 square feet, Amazon\u2019s leased 200,000-plus square feet, as well as Facebook another 200,000 square feet, and very constrained supply with no availability of lab space at all in the near future and really just one other project.","So when we put all of of those together, we think we\u2019ve got a really unique offering, where we can provide Class A product in really an urban-type setting at scale, which is again very unique.","Sheila McGrath","Okay, great. And as a follow-up, just you did put out a press release during the quarter on increased focus in the Research Triangle market. I was wondering if you could talk about that opportunity there? And are development yields expected to be higher than the 7%, given land costs are lower?","Dean Shigenaga","Yes, Sheila, the press release we issued on July 5th talked about the site on Cornwall, as we\u2019ve now renamed that five laboratory way, I guess, and it\u2019s made up about 70% lab and about 30% greenhouse. We\u2019ve got \u2013 right now we\u2019re both marketing and trading paper and proposals with a sizable amount of quite a number of entities that could, in fact, fill the whole thing, obviously, too early to tell, but we\u2019re very optimistic.","We think yields are pretty strong in that market. But remember, although, land costs are lower, rents are lower. But we do think, as the press release mentioned, there really is nowhere in the country that has become a hub for the second part of human health disease you\u2019re well focused on in our core clusters. But the issue of food and hunger, we really haven\u2019t dealt with in any market in a constructive way.","And so we\u2019ve felt based on what we\u2019ve seen over the last five years, we try to be trend makers rather than trend seekers. And our work over the last five years has indicated that the Research Triangle Park region will be the kind of the center of the universe for AgTech and new innovation in ag, because feeding and increasing population is going to be really tough.","Peter Moglia","Yes. Hey, Sheila, it\u2019s Peter Moglia. I can tell you one of the things that was really appealing with this transaction was that, we were able to buy an improved campus. So we\u2019ve got a lot of infrastructure that was already there. Our investment will be in a more reconfigure it and modernize it, and I think our basis is roughly around $50 a foot going into it. So it gives us an allowance to really create a great place for the AgTech industry to center around in that area and allow us to make returns that should exceed our 7% goals.","Joel Marcus","Yes, and as we said, we own and operate about 1 million square feet in that market today and have about another 1 million square feet for future development, we\u2019re about 98% leased and we have a pretty nice roster of both life science, but particularly agricultural technology kind of companies. So\u2026","Sheila McGrath","Okay, great. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. Please go ahead.","Emmanuel Korchman","Good afternoon. Just wondering what sort of the increase in potential development or growth in the pipeline, how you\u2019re thinking about speculative development if you have any sort of pre-leasing goals in mind before going ground up on any of these projects?","Joel Marcus","Yes. So we haven\u2019t done any speculative development since the financial crisis. Our view of the world is so far we don\u2019t really need to do that. We are working in a number of locations to prepare sites and the foundation work and so forth. But in hopefully, all cases, we want to have a level of pre-leasing before we go vertical. We did that in New York with the West Tower, I think, there we only had 15%. But that was important, because we had a time, where costs were very favorable to the developer and we had a chance to snag gross.","So I think it\u2019s so dependent in each market at a level, so I don\u2019t want to give out some onto this level for the overall markets. But I think it\u2019s fair to say, we look at each market and feel like, we\u2019ll develop kind of an approach based on the demand and supply in that market.","Emmanuel Korchman","Great. And then, Joel, just switching to New York for a second Any updates on the conversations on the city about the North Tower?","Joel Marcus","We\u2019re still continuing those conversations and we\u2019re very optimistic, but don\u2019t have anything to announce at this moment.","Emmanuel Korchman","That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jamie Feldman","Thank you. You guys put out an 8-K in early July talking about April 2018, Joel moving to an Executive Chairman position. Can you talk about \u2013 Joel, can you talk about what that means for the day-to-day for you, and what you think will be different in that role?","Joel Marcus","Yes, so\u2026","Jamie Feldman","And then how we shall be thinking about backfilling your spot?","Joel Marcus","Yes. So I think, if you think about, I don\u2019t know what your work week is like, but I\u2019m a kind of a 24\/7 guy. And if you take just hours focused on daily work plus travel, that\u2019s probably very much an 24\/7 effort.","And I think it\u2019s fair to say that, I would continue with more than full time at \u2013 on and after April 1, 2018 and heavily laser focused on growth, we\u2019re putting together a five-year growth plan 2018 through 2022, and to be able to realize what we think will be a tremendous growth period implementing our very unique and special strategy is, what I\u2019m going to be spending my time. So I think, if you think about me, I\u2019d be moving from player to player coach.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then what \u2013 do you expect to join more Boards, or do more things outside the company? I know in recent years you\u2019ve been a little bit more active on that front?","Joel Marcus","I think, I assess limits the outside Boards, you\u2019re on a public sense and I\u2019ve been on two biotech Boards for quite a long time. I don\u2019t plan to increase that. And I\u2019ve been involved in a number of Boards historically that i.e., ebb and flow, but I go with what is our moniker is people, passion and purpose.","I did join this year the Board of Robin Hood and Mayor Bloomberg asked me to join the Board of the 9\/11 Memorial and Museum. So those are two new ones, but I gave up two other nonprofit Boards I was on. So I\u2019ve got a good balance and I\u2019m fully engaged and don\u2019t plan to be any less engaged, I can promise you that.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then when should we expect to hear about any other management changes?","Joel Marcus","Probably by year-end.","Jamie Feldman","Okay.","Joel Marcus","We\u2019ve started just so you know, we started this process at the Board level early last summer actually kicking it off with a full day with Jim Collins, and we\u2019ve been involved both at the Board level and at the company. So we\u2019re \u2013 the process is seamless. It\u2019s fully embraced, and I think it\u2019s excellent. So I\u2019m wholly confident that the company will continue to operate in a fabulous way.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","You\u2019re welcome.","Jamie Feldman","And then just shifting gears to the impairment charge, Dean, can you just talk about, I mean, is this something that, if the stock comes back, you take a gain or just how do we think about the permanent of these impairments and then the more we may see just I think this is the first large one we\u2019ve seen so far?","Dean Shigenaga","Yes, we\u2019ve actually had a pretty good history of really solid performance on the portfolio of equity security investments. So \u2013 but GAAP requires that you do recognize them from time to time. The impairment write-downs are permanent. But if we do find a liquidity event, Jamie, you could end up in a game downstream. These companies are still in business, which is the important message. This was a valuation adjustment, not a company that died and they\u2019ve roused.","So we think we\u2019ll get our money out of these investments at the end of the day. But we have to adhere to the GAAP requirement to take a write-down.","Joel Marcus","Yes. And if the stocks go up then, obviously, there would be gain that we would recognize, because the basis is written down.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Yes.","Operator","Next question comes from Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Please go ahead.","Tom Catherwood","Thank you. Good afternoon. Switching over to external investments, this quarter you bought an operating asset on Page Mill Road in 3Q was that you closed then two assets in the Route 128 Corridor, all of those deals were done at \u2013 what looks like some pretty strong valuation. How do you get comfortable with the pricing on these? And then what do you see is the upside from these deals?","Joel Marcus","Yes, if I\u2019m going to ask Tom to comment on the Suburban Massachusetts just kind of broadly how we think about that?","Thomas Andrews","Sure. This is a Tom Boston office, and we acquired earlier, I guess, the last month A two building asset of about 200,000 square feet, which presents an upside opportunity to couple of factors. One is, we think the existing leases in the operating portion of the asset, it\u2019s about 70% leased at the moment.","We think those leases are somewhat below market and expect that plan will roll over those leases we\u2019ll have fast and material upside to market rents. And then, about 30% of the building is \u2013 of the asset is currently vacant office space. We have a plan for conversion of that office space into laboratory space. We\u2019ve given market conditions \u2013 relatively tight market conditions right now. We expect that we\u2019ll be able to convert that office space to lab space at a pretty good upside in rents to yields.","This property happens to be immediately adjacent to one other 100% lease property that we have in this submarket, both is probably the best suburban sub-market in Greater Boston. It\u2019s with most central, it\u2019s with the most amenities in the area. So we\u2019re very comfortable investing there. Boston Properties is by far the largest landlord of commercial space in Boston and we\u2019re comfortable investing in this location with our number of other life science companies. So we definitely see upside.","Joel Marcus","Now I\u2019m going to ask Steve to comment briefly on the Palo Alto acquisition.","Stephen Richardson","Tom, hi, it\u2019s Steve. The Stanford Research Park has done exceptionally well over a number of years. We have both a growth of existing companies plus a pretty intense influx of large Fortune 50, Fortune 100 companies coming into the Research Park as their industries are being disrupted. They are absolutely seeing an imperative to be close to Stanford\u2019s engineering talent and the entrepreneurial activity there.","So as we look at this asset, we\u2019ve got an investment grade quality tenant on a long-term basis. And for the future, we see upside there as well. So it was a nice blend of a nice accretive acquisition immediately and then long-term upside as well in probably one of the best submarkets in the country.","Peter Moglia","Hey, it\u2019s Peter Moglia. I think I\u2019ll add onto Steve\u2019s comments by mentioning, I mean, it\u2019s a 5.5 cap rate on the Palo Alto deal. And if you look at what\u2019s been \u2013 it\u2019s not been a lot trading around the country. I think activity has certainly slowed down. But we do see a lot of things trading in Seattle and the cap rates there for buildings with much lesser lease or credit behind some of these deals in the four category.","So to pick something up at a cap rate of 5.5 in the Stanford cluster, we thought even though it might historically be a low cap rate relatively, it\u2019s a pretty good transaction for us.","Tom Catherwood","That\u2019s very fair, I appreciate that. And Peter, kind of sticking with your comment on Seattle, when we look at your developments, it looks like 1818 Fairview in Seattle has picked up that extra 9% of potential square footage. You moved 1150 East Lake into the intermediate development projects. This indicate that you\u2019re even more positive on Seattle and kind of trying to put more money to work there?","Joel Marcus","So let me maybe just give you a perspective. Yes, we think that the Seattle market, I mean, there isn\u2019t a day goes by that you don\u2019t hear the word Amazon right, and not that we\u2019re focused on Amazon per se. But Amazon\u2019s growth has really impacted many other companies in that market looking for space.","And back in 2002 and 2003, when we moved up pretty aggressively into East Lake Union and South Lake Union, in those days, we didn\u2019t have so much capital. But we had made a decision that that was going to be our focal point in the Seattle market. It turned out to be a huge correct call. It\u2019s pretty clear that given our occupancy in that market, the pretty big historic demand in that market that we\u2019re trying to position some of our land bank to move into income-producing over the next few years.","Tom Catherwood","Got it. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Yes.","Operator","Next question comes from Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Jed Reagan","Good afternoon, guys. Just a quick follow-up on the Page Mill acquisition, you mentioned some longer-term upside. Is that \u2013 you see a lab plays there eventually and then on the 1 million square foot site in Research Park, is that envisioned that as lab or office?","Stephen Richardson","Jed, hey, it\u2019s Steve Richardson. On the Page Mill asset, potentially we could put light lab in that facility, it\u2019s a brand new Class A facility right at a very prominent corner along Page Mill there. But their rent is somewhat below market. So just from a straight mark-to-market basis over time, we expect we\u2019d have upside in a renewable releasing, but that\u2019s certainly down the road.","And then shifting on the million square foot campus, we absolutely will be designing robust laboratory shelves, and we\u2019ve been initially chatting with both life science and technology companies. So, stay tuned, we\u2019ll see how we do with either sector.","Jed Reagan","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And I guess, sticking on acquisitions, I mean, with some of the deals you\u2019ve struck this year, I mean, it is generally off-market, or are they marketed deals? And for the marketed deals, I mean, how deep are these bidding pools and what is your competition look like?","Joel Marcus","I would say, every situation is so different, every market, every deal. And at the beginning of the year, you don\u2019t know generally what may come to market. We\u2019re not typically a \u2013 in the market to acquire assets. We\u2019re a primarily a developer of Class A assets in our urban cluster campuses.","But when interesting opportunities come up, we obviously look at them going back to One Kendall, which was pretty heavily marketed. The pool of buyers, I think, we\u2019ve showed, Peter, has a slide on Investor Day that has some 50-plus buyers who\u2019ve invested in somewhere in or around the U.S. in life science assets. So it depends by deal.","Peter Moglia","Yes. Hey, Jed, it\u2019s Peter Moglia. I won\u2019t go into the specifics, but out of the five acquisitions, three of them were competitive bids and then two of them were done through relationships that Alexandria had with the principals and we just went directly to them. And in one case, we actually just convinced someone to sell it, and they weren\u2019t really thinking about disposing it at the time, but we made a compelling offer and we\u2019re able to get the asset.","Jed Reagan","Great. I appreciate. May just last one for me, just in terms of your disposition plans, can you talk about how much you expect to sell the rest of the year? And maybe any color on which markets you\u2019re targeting?","Joel Marcus","No, not a whole lot of color other than these are non-core and we\u2019re working through handful of opportunities. We\u2019ll provide more color as we can over the next quarter.","Jed Reagan","And sort of magnitude-wise, dollar value?","Joel Marcus","Call it, definitely sub $100 million.","Jed Reagan","Okay, great. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Yes, thank you.","Operator","Next call \u2013 next question comes from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","Richard Anderson","Thanks. Good morning out there. No, good afternoon. So I probably ask a form of this question every quarter. But if there\u2019s any \u201cflaw\u201d to the story, it\u2019s the geographical concentration risk, 61% in two markets. Do you ever give increasing thought to pursuing more of a balance there one way or the other, whether it\u2019s, maybe breaking up Cambridge and San Francisco a bit more, or entertaining a bigger exposure to some of the smaller markets, or is that just too good right now and you\u2019re not inclined to sort of make a move in those directions one way or the other?","Joel Marcus","So I think how we look at it is, we\u2019re putting together a five-year growth plan from 2018 through 2022. And I think, as you look out or as we look out in 2022, I don\u2019t want to reveal what the numbers are. But it\u2019s pretty clear that the Greater Boston market will not be as dominant in our asset base as it is today. I think, we see good growth from places like San Diego, Seattle, San Francisco, particularly New York.","And so,we\u2019re not too worried about that. And it will self-correct, I think, over the coming five years, and we\u2019ve got a fabulous plan to implement to make that happen. So we\u2019re not obsessed by that.","Richard Anderson","Okay, no need to be, obviously, it\u2019s a good problem these days. The other question is, to what degree do you get reverse inquiries from outsiders looking to buy assets from you? And has that been a part of any of your dispositions to to-date, whereas you weren\u2019t necessarily doing it, marketing it, but someone came to you initially?","Joel Marcus","Well, we do get, I would say, what we get more than anything, and I\u2019d say, it\u2019s quite often is entities with a lot of capital wanting to team up with us.","Richard Anderson","Okay.","Joel Marcus","In various locations. I think, that\u2019s more the inquiry as opposed to, do you want to sell some assets? I\u2019d say, that doesn\u2019t happen \u2013 that often. But given our strategy and our game plan and our history, but teaming up with us, I can tell you there are many, many entities that would cherish the thought of teaming up with Alexandria and our brand.","Richard Anderson","Okay. And then last question, recent inclusion into the S&P 500, so congratulations for that. And I\u2019m curious if you had any differentiated conversations with investors, new people looking at the space, one thing that\u2019s \u2013 you don\u2019t have much of a comp in the U.S. REIT market. So I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re \u2013 finding yourself educating a wider swath of of investors these days?","Joel Marcus","Yes, I\u2019d say, the two types of investors we\u2019ve seen, I think, Dean and I have seen and others have seen over the past three months, six months, 12 months would be one non-dedicated investors certainly looking at this space and particularly our company, which offers a combination of both growth and income, which is attractive, given the market is a bit frenetic and certainly has been led by the technology sector.","And I think, the other is, foreign capital looking to buy not so much even direct assets, but stock in the company, because they see it in a very strong growth sector. So I think, those are the two groups that we\u2019ve seen over the past probably six to 12 months.","Richard Anderson","How about inquiries from biotech investors that are looking for a proxy to their space?","Joel Marcus","Yes, we\u2019ve tried that approach for many, many years. We present at JPMorgan, we present at Cowen, we present at \u2013 we did at UBS recently. But it seems to me, those are probably a handful of people as opposed to a wave. So I don\u2019t think those have turned the needle.","Richard Anderson","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Joel Marcus","You\u2019re welcome. Thanks, Rich.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next question is a follow-up from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jamie Feldman","Thank you. I just wanted to focus on San Diego. I think, you had mentioned it was your busiest leasing market in the quarter. Are you seeing a turn there, or a real pick up there? I now that you and others are really focusing your attention in that market, it sounds like [Multiple Speakers].","Joel Marcus","Yes, good afternoon, Jamie. I wouldn\u2019t say, there\u2019s a big shift in what\u2019s happened. We just had a couple big leases that took a while to consummate, one being Takeda, and then Lab Corp, the other one took a little while. I think, we\u2019ve been pretty happy, though, with a consistent steady demand when I look at our properties and availabilities. We basically have activity on every single one of them. So I think that\u2019s sort of the combination of both sort of our position in the marketplace and I think in overall pretty healthy circumstances in San Diego.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then finally for me, as you look ahead to 2018 and your lease expiration schedule, are there any large move-outs you know about, or any tenants that maybe moving out that we should be aware off?","Joel Marcus","Yes, so the only two that we have and both are actually pretty nice opportunities of any moment would be 681 Gateway, which is Roche\/Genentech, that\u2019s all office building. But when we built it, it\u2019s a lab-ready shell, as Steve knows well, and the team knows well. We\u2019ve got some ability there to add FAR under that site. So we think that would be a prime conversion to much higher yielding lab building, that\u2019s about 120, what is that?","Dean Shigenaga","126,000","Joel Marcus","126,000-plus an additional 15,000 to 30,000, and the other one is in Dan\u2019s market 9880 Campus Point, which is a \u2013 an asset that we leased to Amylin back in the day and that lease rolls during 2018, and we\u2019re going to be doing a full \u2013 that was kind of a specialty building that they put together. So that\u2019s going to be a full lab redevelopment and lab rents today in that area.","Dean Shigenaga","$48.","Joel Marcus","Yes, $48. So we think we can make a pretty nice yield on those. Those are really the only two that are of moment, the rest are pretty ordinary course. And as you know, our run rate on leasing has been super strong.","As Dean mentioned, we\u2019ve extended the leases now 2018, 2019 and 2020. So we\u2019re \u2013 we feel very good about handling the lease rolls for next year 1.3 million, 1.4 million square feet. So \u2013 and the average rents are about below $38. So there\u2019s, I think, very good upside in those roles.","Dean Shigenaga","Yes, and Jamie, one additional comment. The largest lease after those two that Joel mentioned drops down to 60,000 square feet or less from that point.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. How big did you say the Amylin leases?","Dean Shigenaga","It\u2019s about 81,000.","Jamie Feldman","Okay.","Joel Marcus","Yes, so nothing of any big significance.","Jamie Feldman","And will both of those projects go into your redevelopment pipeline so as long as you hit occupancy?","Joel Marcus","681 will be a conversion, because it is office currently, and 9880 would be a renovation project, Jamie. So no, it would not go into the same property, I\u2019m sorry, would stay in same property.","Jamie Feldman","Both of them would stay?","Joel Marcus","No, 681 would be a redevelopment would come out and convert from office to lab. And 9880 would be a renovation and stay in same property results.","Jamie Feldman","Got it. Okay, all right. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Yes, but the demand for both those \u2013 in both those submarkets super strong these days. So we\u2019re pretty \u2013 we\u2019re actually happy to get 681 back and move from office to lab in the South San Francisco market and in San Diego, Dan has got more than \u2013 more demand than he can deal with at the moment in the UTC market.","Operator","Next question is a follow-up from Manny Korchman with Citi. Please go ahead.","Michael Bilerman","Hey, sorry about that. It\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Manny. Joel, I\u2019m just curious that going down the valley, how much of that is sort of views on San Francisco Prop M entitlements, pricing in San Francisco and the desire to move further afield?","Joel Marcus","Yes, I don\u2019t think we view it that way. I think we view it as we have \u2013 actually our view has always been that we wanted to get out of Alameda in the early days when we had space kind of our legacy pre-IPO. We have always focused kind of from the city down to Palo Alto.","We\u2019ve always felt that that was kind of the sweet spot of life science in the Bay Area. And what\u2019s emerged, remember, when we started, there was no life science in Mission Bay. In fact, when we went out in 2005 to meet with a lot of people, they actually didn\u2019t believe anything would happen there. SoMa was never really in play in those days. It was Genentech South San Francisco, and then obviously, Palo Alto through spinouts outo f Stanford.","So we\u2019ve always viewed the valley from the city down to the Stanford area as really core of what we do. I think, today, when you can assemble a big campus with large leasing opportunities there, you have to pay attention to those. So I consider those all pretty integral parts of that submarket or set of submarkets.","Michael Bilerman","And where does Prop M entitlement stand in relation to $88, I mean, and how you think that\u2019s going to play out?","Joel Marcus","Yes.","Stephen Richardson","Yes, Michael, it\u2019s Steve. Yes, the expectation now is the city did receive a lot of comments on the initial draft, i.e., our plan for Central SoMa. They expect to bring that to the Board during the spring of 2018 for certification.","So at that point, the projects that are in the queue would start receiving allocation. Our expectation is that politically it\u2019s going to make a lot more sense for a number of projects to receive a phased allocation. Most of these projects can be phased. So Phase one for a number of projects brings community benefits on the front-end to the city, which is critically important.","So we don\u2019t think that any one project will receive all of its Prop M allocation. But instead a number of projects starting later in 2018 will start receiving their Phase one Prop M allocations.","Michael Bilerman","Okay. And then just last one, just Jeol, as you transition next year to Executive Chairman, I guess, is that set in stone or could that be sort of pushed further in? And then you talked a lot about how you will continue to be actively involved in Alexandria and being in that player coach. I guess, how will your time shift in the public market activities role that you serve?","Joel Marcus","Well, we\u2019ll see how it plays out, I think, unless my Corbett asked me to take over research at Citi, I\u2019ll probably stay here and beat 777. But I don\u2019t think it will shift that much. Although, I think I will have less facing with investors and analysts. But now I do some of that, but Dean, and Steve, and Tom, and Peter, and Dan, and a number of other people do certainly a big bulk of that anyway.","But I think where my time will be super invested in my 24\/7 style will be on this growth plan and making it work and executing it. So, \u2013 but I don\u2019t think, you\u2019ll see any huge demand \u2013 dramatic shifts.","Michael Bilerman","And this growth finally would be put out to the street at Investor Day in December?","Joel Marcus","I wouldn\u2019t say for all five years. You\u2019ll see the first-year and a little peek of what\u2019s to come after that.","Michael Bilerman","Okay. All right. Thanks so much.","Joel Marcus","You\u2019re welcome. I don\u2019t think, we\u2019re ready to give 2022 guidance yet.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks.","Joel Marcus","Thank you, everybody, for your time today.

Fourth Quarter and Year End 2014 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jenifer and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Rhonda Chiger. Ms. Chiger, you may begin.","Rhonda Chiger ","Thank you and good afternoon. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those projections and forward-looking statements, additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements as contained in the Company's Form 10-K, Annual Report and other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","And now, I would like to turn the [Audio Gap]. Please go ahead.","Joel Marcus","Thanks Rhonda and welcome everybody to our fourth quarter and year end 2014 call. With me today are Dean, Peter, Steve and Dan, and I want to start out with a couple of macro comments and first of all, really very proud of what our amazing Alexandria team collectively accomplished in 2014, our 20th anniversary year. We are really blessed to have a great business, an outstanding opportunity set and a business which passionately and positively impacts the quality of human health each and every day. We had an exceptional year with strong core growth and significant growth from completion of highly pre-leased value creation projects.","Important to our success this year was Alexandria\u2019s class A facilities and our collaborative science and tech campuses and really the hot urban innovation clusters, characterized by rising ramps, giving us pricing power, rising occupancy and constrained supply in our core urban cluster markets. 2014 also saw the U.S. FDA hit a 18 year high with drug approvals, 41 novel medicines versus 27 the year before and we\u2019re very proud that 56% of those 41 companies were ARE client tenants. And there were a number of very significant breakthrough treatments for a variety of cancers and rare diseases.","Dean will comment on guidance in a few minutes, but the midpoint of the guidance as we go forward for 2015 as you know is 510, which is an 8.3% growth and when combined with our dividend we're predicting a double digit return for this year. Internal growth operations in leasing really are characterized by very strong year end occupancy at 97% for North American operating properties. We have very solid same store or same property NOI growth and the fourth quarter witnessed solid leasing, particularly from North Carolina and San Diego.","Let me just comment on two markets for the moment. One is the Cambridge, Boston market. The mark-to-market analysis that we\u2019ve done internally indicates this is a continuing durable market, our so called greater Boston cluster and we\u2019re expecting growth of about 17.5% on a cash basis and 21.8% on a GAAP basis. Occupancy is up 200 basis points to 98.8% compared to 4Q '13; lease rates were in the $60 plus range, triple-net for existing product; and prospects seeking new large blocks of space at our Alexandria Center at Kendall Square are anticipating rents in the low 70s triple-net on a GAAP basis.","In the San Francisco cluster, occupancy is up by about 120 basis points from the same period a year ago to 98.9% in the operating asset base and worth noting that we resolved the remaining vacancy last week. So we\u2019re now fully 100% leased. Lease rates for new product are in the mid to high $50 triple-net as the proposition allocate -- office allocation continues to constrain supply of new product in the Bay area.","The mark-to-market refresh indicates further growth to about 11.7% cash and then somewhere between 17% and 18% on a GAAP basis. And as I'll mention in a moment, we\u2019re advancing the entitlements and lease negotiations at 510 Townsend and anticipate completion in the near term as well as finalizing the design this month for what will prove to be an absolute world class and iconic tech facility for Uber at Mission Bay adjacent to the amazing league leading warriors arena and we\u2019ll disclose yields on those in the 1Q supplement once our construction cost and so forth are finalized.","Moving to external growth briefly, again we had good leasing progress on our value add development projects, both at Longwood and the Alexandria Center for Life Science in New York City, and I want to comment a little bit on the near term value creation development pipeline, Page 31 of the supplement.","At Campus Point, Dan's been very successful. He expects to have the lease for about 75% of the project, the new building finalized hopefully this month, entitlements following shortly thereafter and then construction starting probably by the second quarter. At 50 Binney, we look to finalize the lease for the full 50 Binney project in the first quarter here and hopefully to finalize a lease in the second quarter for 60 Binney and that construction is fully underweighting and then our plan. When it comes to a 100 Binney we\u2019re trading paper with at least five substantial space users. Construction will depend upon significant pre-leasing but we expect that to happen in the relative near term.","Coming back to 510 Townsend Street for a moment, we expect the lease to be finalized this month, entitlements to follow in March and probably kick off a construction by the end of the second quarter. And as many of you noted, we did make a number of acquisitions over the past quarter, including the remaining 10% interest in the Alexandria\u2019s Tech Square Center, which we purchased from MIT, the remaining 10% interest half paid this year and half paid next year, and as we indicated in the supplement and in the press release, we see very significant upside in the lease rolls and that project is really kind of the -- probably the single best located project in all of Cambridge.","And then also we did acquire another project from MIT, their 640 Memorial Drive. Dean may make a comment or two. We did have a 5.9% initial cap rate, moving to 6.4% at 116 when the rental phasing is completed. This purchase in the mid-Cambridge market really ties to our 780 Memorial Drive and 790 Memorial Drive clustered development that have been very highly leased and very successful. So now we\u2019re starting to build a cluster in the mid-Cambridge market. It is subject to a ground lease with MIT and MIT in -- for their decision to use our capital for future development decided to put this market out for sale. We have a very unique relationship with MIT, and also the two tenants that inhabit 640 Memorial Drive.","I won\u2019t get into any details on the balance sheet. We\u2019ll try to make this presentation somewhat shorter than normal. And I\u2019ll ask Dean to kind of comment on a number of subjects, and then we\u2019ll open it up for Q&A quickly here.","Dean Shigenaga","Thanks Joel. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon everybody. I\u2019ve got four important topics I want to cover today. First, obviously our strong performance in 2014 and continued focus on growth and FFO per share and growth in net asset value. Second, I want to touch on our quality cash flows and disciplined allocation of capital in the high value urban innovation cluster sub markets. Third, I\u2019ll touch on and update on our significant progress on our capital plan for 2015, and key considerations for net asset value, and lastly I'll close out some comments on guidance. Jumping right in, the fourth quarter was a very strong quarter of performance with FFO per share of $1.23, and really the wrap up of an outstanding year with total shareholder return of 44.7%.","Our FFO per share for the full year was $4.80, up 9.1% over 2013. Our strong performance in 2014 is projected to continue into 2015 with our mid-point of FFO per share of $5.20 or 8.3% over 2014. Our strong cash NOI growth from value creation deliveries throughout 2014 is driving significant growth in NOI and cash flows in 2015 with further increases from significant value creation deliveries in 2015.","We continue to focus on growth in FFO per share and net asset value in 2015 and beyond. One of the key drivers of growth in FFO per share and net asset value in 2014 was the significant quarter-over-quarter growth in net operating income and cash flows and we expect this growth to continue into 2015. That will drive continued growth in net asset value.","The quality of our ABR has improved significantly in recent years, supporting high quality and strong cash flows, the three key areas driving quality, ABR, and cash flows include; first 56% of our ABR is derived from investment grade rated client tenants, and again this represents an industry leading statistic. Second, 83% of our ABR is generated from high value urban centers of innovation, including Greater Boston, primarily the submarkets of Cambridge and along with Medical Center, the San Francisco Bay area, primarily Mission Bay and Suma, Palo Alto and the Stanford Research Park, New York City, San Diego, again primarily Torrey Pines and UTC and in Seattle, primarily in Lake Union. 83% of our ABR R&D's high value centers of innovation reflect a significant focus of our capital allocation over many years in our urban innovation cluster submarkets.","And third we remain disciplined in our allocation of capital going forward. 85% of our capital allocation in 2015 is projected to be in the same high value urban centers of innovation that drive 83% of our ABR today. Additionally over one half of our capital allocation for 2015 is projected to be invested in two of the top destinations for science and technology innovation in the Cambridge and Mission Bay\/Suma submarkets.","Let me briefly clarify our initial cash yield for a purchase of our ground lease hold interest at 640 Memorial located in Mid Cambridge. Our release disclosed an initial cash yield of 6.4%. For clarification one of the two leases we acquired with the property has about one year remaining before a rent concession burns off. So our cash yield, as Joel had mentioned on day one is approximately 5.9% to 6%, which increases to about 6.4% in about 12 months.","Moving next to the great progress on our dispositions and our capital plan for 2015, we have $235 million in dispositions identified to-date, of which about $113 million was completed in the fourth quarter and January of 2015. We have an additional $122 million of properties held for sale, and these proceeds from the sales will be invested immediately into substantially leased Class A value creation development projects. Our mid-point of our 2015 guidance for asset sales is approximately $390 million with $178 million completed or identified and held for sale. The remaining of our mid-point of our guidance is about $212 million, which represents our sale proceeds. At a very high level, a portion of the $212 million in proceeds from remaining asset sales really will provide a benefit or a reduction of leverage, so reduces our debt to offset a reduction in EBITDA. The exact mix of land versus operating asset sales will be determined in the next couple of quarters.","While we\u2019re covering capital, let me briefly touch on approximate pricing for unsecured bonds. At a very high level we believe pricing for 10 year unsecured bonds in the last month would have been roughly about 180 basis points over 10 year treasuries or approximately 3.6%. In 2015 we have the flexibility to execute a 10 year bond deal with a maturity in 2025, providing us the opportunity to both extend their weighted average remaining term of outstanding debt and continue to ladder maturities.","Next I just want to touch on some very important NAV considerations. For your reference on Page 4 of our supplemental you\u2019ll find a brief outline of key considerations for NAV models in our Company from recent dispositions and assets held for sale. The key point here is that various important items included in our fourth quarter results will drive a meaningful overall increase in net asset value due to the following: continued significant growth in cash NOI in the fourth quarter of $4.6 million or $18.3 million on an annualized basis. This is on top of the cash NOI growth for the third quarter of about $5.8 million or $23.4 million on an annualized basis. We expect significant growth in cash NOI quarter-to-quarter to continue, which has been and will be a key driver of growth in NAV going forward. We have increased our developable square footage by approximately 416,000 square feet, 88% of which represents increases for near term development projects located in University Town Center, including 214,000 square feet at 5200 Illumina Way and about 103,000 square feet at Campus Point, and we continue work on finalizing these entitlements.","Page 4 of our supplemental package highlighted other key NAV considerations, including the sale of real estate located in Toronto. The key highlights of this transaction are that we had an operating property classified in rental properties generating operating losses due to operating expenses of about $1.4 million per year related to ground rent expense. As such we believe most NAV models had no value or negative value attributed to this investment. We completed this sale in January 2015. So if you update your model for the fourth quarter NOI, remember to make an additional adjustment to increase NOI in order to eliminate the annual operating expense of $1.4 million.","Additionally, since most NAV models likely attributed no value to negative value for this asset, remember to add the proceeds from the closing of the sale of $54 million as a positive adjustment to NAV. Also because of factors I just described, we believe the impairment of $16.6 million for this asset had no impact on most NAV models. I should also point out that the impairment is primarily related to foreign currency exchange rates, taxes and other closing costs for that property.","The next item to consider for NAV is the impairment related to the sale of nine land parcels with seven old industrial buildings located in South San Francisco. The buyer of these assets operates, redevelops and develops industrial buildings. These parcels were previously classified as land held for future development. The impairment charge was about $24.7 million and will slightly offset increases in NAV I just described. Further details on this sale are also included on Page 4 of our supplemental package.","Briefly on 500 Forbes, this is a high quality core like asset located in South San Francisco that we acquired in 2007. However we did recognize an impairment related to the write off non-cash items, including both net book value related to an acquired below market lease and improvements we received from the prior tenant.","We expect to complete the sale of this property at a market cap rate reflective of a high quality asset with quality improvements and an investment grade rated tenant. Since most NAV models value at this property based upon cash NOI and a market cap rate which is consistent with our expected sale, we believe this non cash impairment of $9.6 million has no impact on most NAV models on our Company.","It's important to also note that the proceeds from these sales will be in immediately invested into highly lease value creation development projects at very attract cash yields relative to current market capitalization rates. Additionally these sales, an immediate investment into value creation projects is well aligned with our overall strategy to continue to grow FFO per share and net asset value.","In closing on this topic, the key here is that we believe there are several drivers in our fourth quarter results that will result in a significant increase in net asset value, including significant growth in cash NOI, additional FAR that we are adding to key near term ground up development projects, and a net positive impact from completed and pending sales including any end back from impairment charges.","Briefly I want to comment on our 7% series D preferred stock. You may have noticed during the quarter we purchased about 513,000 shares or roughly 5.1% of our outstanding 7% series D preferred stock for an aggregate price of about $14.4 million or $27.98 per share. This results in a preferred stock redemption charge of about $2 million or about $0.03 per share. Our guidance assumes that we do not repurchase any additional shares of our outstanding 7% series D preferred stock in 2015.","Lastly on guidance, the detailed assumptions underlying our guidance for 2015 are included on Page 5 of our supplemental package. We are extremely pleased with the solid execution by our team in 2014, with the delivery of strong growth and cash NOI, FFO per share up 9.1% over 2013 and significant growth in net asset value. We remain focused on continuing this growth into 2015 with FFO per share forecasted up at 8.3% over 2014. A key driver to our growth in net asset value as been and will continue to be the significant growth in cash NOI quarter to quarter. We believe we have the right assets, in the right locations, and the best to roster our client tenants and we remain focused on continuing to build our best in class franchise.","With that I'll turn it back to Joel.","Joel Marcus","Thank you. Operator, let's open it up for Q&A please.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Smedes Rose from Citi.","Smedes Rose","I wanted to ask you on your Technology Square purchase. Was there any decision around -- buying the 10% now versus at some other point, was there some sort of trigger that you needed to buy that now; and if you could give maybe a little more color on the 100,000 square feet that you could potentially out there as well. And then just more broadly, are there additional opportunities with MIT, where you would be kind of the natural buyer I guess?","Joel Marcus","Well let me -- this is Joel. With respect to the timing, it really is driven not by us, but MIT's Management Company's decision to sell certain assets so that they can invest them in development projects both on and off campus. So that really drove the decision for timing on Tech Square and 640 Memorial Drive.","When it comes to other opportunities, certainly those would be very interesting. That given, Cambridge is one of our most important markets. When it comes to the 100,000 square feet, we're working on the design and entitlement of that. And so I'm not sure I could say much more than that. Tom is unavailable today, but I'll make a note. We'll comment in our next conference call and give you some updated details on that. ","Smedes Rose","Okay. And then could I just ask one more about the land bank that you've talked about, potentially selling pieces from -- and you mentioned the Forbes Boulevard and South San Francisco, but is there more or much more from kind of the 2006, 2007 sort of vintage if you will that you would look to bring to market this year?","Joel Marcus","Not particularly. We did use a set of parcels there for the development of the Onyx campus, which when Onyx got acquired by Amgen, they succeeded to those assets. We do have another set of parcels for development, but I think that's something we'll continue to look at as time goes on. So it's possible but nothing certain at the moment. ","Operator","And we will go next to Jamie Feldman from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jamie Feldman","So if you look at your acquisition guidance and what you've already done year-to-date or scheduled to do year-to-date, you've kind of hit that number. So what does the acquisition pipeline look like from here?","Joel Marcus","I don't think we have anything that is in the near-term, but we look at everything that comes to market that we feel is in the sweet spot of either the nature of the facility, and certainly the nature of the location. But I don't think we have anything in the near-term that we're looking at. And as I just said to Smedes, the timing of the Tech Square acquisition or really the sale by MIT and the decision to market 640 Memorial Drive really driven by their own capital needs and on decision making timing had nothing to do with ours, I can assure you. ","Jamie Feldman","And then you had meant -- you had commented that you are starting to build -- you could start to build a cluster in the mid Cambridge market. Can you talk a little bit about what might be different about that segment of Cambridge, whether it's tenants or building type or if that becomes a real investment for the future for you guys, what's different about it?","Joel Marcus","Well I think if you look at a map, it's directly west of East Cambridge. It encompasses, kind of circles -- it kind of touches MIT and circles around towards Harvard Square. There are a number of owners and developers in there. MIT certainly has an important toe hold. Some years ago we actually owned a property next to 640 Memorial called 620 Memorial that was ultimately leased to Pfizer and then I think we sold it to them and they -- I think they turned around and sold it just a year or two ago. But back about 10, 12 years ago we built 790 Memorial Drive and 780 Memorial Drive. Tom really managed that development right near the Polaroid building. And so that's been a real important anchor for us in that mid Cambridge market. So we like that market, and when this opportunity came up we decided to move on it.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then I guess a similar question in San Francisco. As Mission Bay is filling up, what's kind of the next cluster you could create there? Will you go further south or you just try to keep penetrating the CBD?","Joel Marcus","Well I think you will see naturally it move out -- you can't move east from Mission Bay, because you'll be in the Bay, but you can move south, you can move west, and you can move north. So I think those would be the natural extensions at Mission Bay. ","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then finally on the land sales in the quarter, any impairments? If we look at our current land bank, just what level of impairments you think you still need to see if you did sell some of that remaining land? Or is it finally now more of a mark to market?","Joel Marcus","Yes that's -- well it's always difficult to speculate what land will trade at Jamie, but I think if you turn to Page 37 of our supplemental, bifurcate the land holdings into two buckets, we have 2.3 million square feet in near-term and that product that you know is heavily under negotiation. So I'll skip over that. That's all going to yield very nicely, very attractive returns. The future bucket, you have about 2.9 million square feet, and if you go through that the larger components -- where the largest component 1.7 million spread across multiple markets is $32 a foot, I don't -- I am not really concerned in any meaningful way with that. It's $56 million. Everything else? If you\u2019ve got, Technology Square, just some residential and Cambridge, Grand Avenue, which is adjacent -- the fourth side at the Onyx, Amgen campus, plus some other land on Grand Avenue. So great locations. We can make money on those deals. If we sold we'd be close to that depending on the buyer. If you compared it to the trade we just did we traded out of San Francisco to an industrial buyer at about $80 a foot. So maybe a slight haircut, but these are pretty small dollars, Jamie. So I think all in we're in really good shape.","Operator","And we'll go next to Sheila McGrath from Evercore ISI.","Sheila McGrath ","The GAAP cap rate on 500 Forbes looks to be about 5%. I'm just wondering if the cash cap rate is going to be close to that and could you describe the level of interest from buyers for that asset?","Joel Marcus","The GAAP cap rate is shown on our disposition page on the supplemental, probably at about 51, Sheila as you stated. I think the cash number trails that just a tad, maybe somewhere in the 30 to 40 bps behind that.","Sheila McGrath ","Okay, and were there a lot of potential buyers interested in that asset?","Joel Marcus","Let us not comment about the transaction itself, other than to say that you have a very high quality asset, that I think will be very attractive and we feel you can get a sense for our approximate price point that we expect to complete on the transaction. So I think it's an attractive trade for us.","Sheila McGrath ","Okay and then on 50, 60 and 100 Binney, the supplemental says 2016 and '17. If they are complete in '16 it would be very, very late in the year and not contributing or how should we think about timing in '16 for those projects?","Joel Marcus","Yes, I think -- it's hard to speculate on timing too specifically because there's a lot of negotiations ongoing and it ultimately will depend on the terms of the lease, but I think it's safe to say that if it contributes into '16 at all, its fourth quarter. That's probably the earliest. But the exact timing for each of those buildings will depend very specifically on the lease negotiation. So we can provide better color as we execute transactions.","Sheila McGrath ","Okay, and last question on investment page, you did have some unrealized gains. Was there an IPO or two and should we assume that there will be some sales from that bucket in 2015?","Joel Marcus","Yes, we had -- actually over the past two years I think we've had '14 IPOs. So yes, there will be I'm sure sales over coming quarters and years.","Operator","And we'll go next to Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Carroll","Hey Joel, can you discuss the demand you're seeing at the Illumina campus in the UTC. With a doubling of the size of the project that's under development, has the timing changed on the potential projects that are in the near term value creation pipeline?","Joel Marcus","Yes, Dan is here. So I'm going to let him comment.","Dan Ryan","Yes, good morning. So when you ask about the demand, in terms of Illumina's growth it has been extremely robust. The delivery of this next filming basically taps out there existing entitlements. So we're in front of the city now to entitle for about now at 350,000 square feet of additional space and we have -- they have asked us to go ahead and progress on that additional square footage that we think we can get.","Michael Carroll","Could you expect -- I guess could that break ground in the next few years also? Is there enough demand for that?","Dan Ryan","Yes, I think that's a fair assumption.","Michael Carroll","Okay, great. And then I guess my last question, can you talk a little bit about your asset sales in general? How much of the portfolio going forward do you want to sell? Is it that, that you just want to raise capital through asset sales or is there other assets that you want to dispose of?","Dan Ryan","Well, I think for the moment you have our guidance on what we'd like to accomplish for 2015. So we've got a range -- call it at the midpoint of $390 million. Again $178 has been held for sale. So either it's been completed or pending, and that leaves us with $212 million to complete for the rest of the year. And again that number is a mix when we think about what remains -- a little bit of land and some operating assets, and again we'll bring more color in the next couple of quarters. And I think when you go forward it's hard to speculate what will look towards in 2016 but I think we'll look at our options as we manage through our capital plan like we have this year, a lot of -- how much will be debt funded and then is there an opportunity to recycle assets for reinvestment. I think those would be our two priorities.","Operator","And we'll go next to Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.","Rich Anderson ","What is your tenant retention percentage generally, and how has it trended over the recent past?","Joel Marcus","I think we did a study about a year ago when we looked back probably seven years if I recall and the retention rate has been pretty consistent as you roll that forward. It\u2019s been averaging about 85% over that time frame. And the only qualifier I'd give -- as you know acquired a couple of assets recently that were development targets right out of the gate. It was leased. We acquired a lease in place but had generally maybe 12 months of remaining term and we\u2019ll exclude something like that because that\u2019s intentional targeted lease rolls that were planned for redevelopments. But it\u2019s a very solid retention rate. You could tell from our occupancy stats and our leasing performance that it's all very consistent, so very strong retention.","Rich Anderson ","Okay, and then looking at the leasing schedule, average lease term of 4.3 years for this quarter, it's kind of moved around that number over the past few quarters. What is your kind of desire, to make that a longer or shorter number, considering the strength of the markets?","Joel Marcus","Yes, it depends Rich, so much on the nature of the lease, the nature of the location and multi-tenant buildings with companies that grow rapidly and need flexibility on space. Three, five, seven years are kind of where the sweet spot is and then you get into the development. You see this quarter was about over 10 years. So you see in the larger blocks of space 10, 15, 20. That\u2019s really how it's broken down for years, and years and we don\u2019t expect to change that.","Rich Anderson ","Okay. And then thinking of NAV, you\u2019re developing to 7% to 8% stabilized return. What you think -- if you were to turn around and just sell those assets upon stabilization, what do you think the market would purchase those assets for?","Joel Marcus","Well, of course it depends on what market you are in.","Rich Anderson ","I\u2019d say Cambridge. So let's go high.","Joel Marcus","Well, I think you\u2019re probably in potential sub five cap rate.","Rich Anderson ","Okay. And where do you think a range would be? If that\u2019s the floor, do you think it could be six of us at the top or depending on where you are in the country?","Joel Marcus","Well again, it depends on the nature of the building. If you have an older multi-tenant building, it would be higher than five, but if you have a new Class A facility with a long term lease and the credit tenant you\u2019re not going to be above that.","Rich Anderson ","Got you. And then last question. You took Asia out of the occupancy statistics. I know you have a dedicated sheet for Asia on Page 47, but I\u2019m curious, is there anything symbolic about why you did that? Is there any change of strategy in Asia or if you can comment on that please.","Joel Marcus","No change. There is really -- Asia is a such small portion of our business, and as you know we\u2019re really focused on our domestic growth opportunities here. So we continue to focus on the lease up of our properties there, but we have some work ahead. But again it\u2019s a small piece of the business.","Rich Anderson ","It is small, but do you think the long-term strategy is to be there at some point in five, 10 years or something like that?","Joel Marcus","I\u2019d say -- it\u2019s hard to speculate. I think we yield nicely in India on the operating assets and you can tell from our disclosures, China has been a little tougher on the returns. But it\u2019s hard to speculate going forward. But I think it\u2019s clear we\u2019re not trying to put any significant new capital into those markets. Clearly investors and management and the board et cetera want us to focus on our core urban clusters here in the United States.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Michael Knott from Green Street Advisors.","Kevin Tyler","It\u2019s actually Kevin Tyler here. You commented earlier on Mid-Cambridge then you just give some color as it relates to cap rates in Cambridge overall, but the lease yield reported -- cash lease yield was about 5.9 as you said on 640 Memorial Drive, and I guess I was just curious -- based on the activity in that market, what is an appropriate spread between Mid-Cambridge and Kendall Square let say? And if this was 5.9 and Joe you say 5.4 high quality in Cambridge, how do you kind of explain that differential.","Joel Marcus","Unfortunately Tom is not here. So we\u2019ll make a note and ask that question during our next call, but let me give you my own view on that. There could be -- again, it so much depends on the nature of the facility itself, new versus somewhat data is at multi-tenant, single-tenant, made term the lease credit and then exactly where it is. So 640 Memorial Drive, I think it\u2019s encumbered by a ground lease. So that\u2019s one thing. It is Mid-Cambridge. It is a really developed fairly new facility but has two tenants, long term leases. So that was in the heart of Kendall Square. My guess is maybe 50 basis points. It may drop to a five, five.","Dean Shigenaga","There is no upside on those rents as well. They are long term. There is no near term ability to try to mark-to-market. So it\u2019s more of the stabilized asset.","Joel Marcus","It could even be -- maybe better said between 50 and 100 basis points between Mid-Cambridge and Cambridge.","Kevin Tyler","Okay, thanks. On the development side you guys are continuing to talk about bringing development down. As a percent of gross investment I think the number you're quoting is 13% in the first quarter. But is there any broader read through on that number kind through a shift in strategy, acquisitions versus development going forward? And then how much of the reduction can you ascribe to portfolio growth or just recent deliveries.","Joel Marcus","Yes, so maybe I\u2019ll talk to strategy and let Dean talk to the arithmetical calculation. And on strategy -- no change in strategy. We view ourselves really as best at creating value through development and re-development. We do take the opportunity on occasion to look at acquisition. 640 Memorial Drive was unusual for us. Tech Square was right up our sweet spot, because we've covered it. We've approached MIT for years actually and trying to buy that interest but they haven\u2019t been ready, because they didn\u2019t have a use of proceed. And then they kind of decided they were ready. So it kind of just depends, but I think it's fair to say that we believe we can create better value by creating value, not buying somebody else's value. ","Dan Ryan","Yes. And let me add some color. I would say that the land bank dropping down to 13%, or I should say non income producing assets as a percentage of growth real estate declines to 13%, and that's really through -- substantially through deliveries, offset a little bit increase in construction spend. If you want to put that into perspective though, that\u2019s still roughly 1.4 billion of non-income producing assets with 50% of that being active projects, which as you is highly leased, and about another 25% another of that number sits in near term which is in Cambridge 50 Binney, 60 Binney and 100 Binney.","So I think we've got a good sized future pipeline but I think to put that number into further perspective, back in 2007 it was still about $1.3 billion. The Company was much smaller. So as we grow in size, that percentage will naturally become a smaller piece of our business, while still providing us great opportunities to grow respectively with build-to-suit opportunities. And I think our focus will be just being very careful and prudent on how much land we carry at any given point in time so we can minimize the carry and deliver product to the market as quickly as we can. ","Operator","(Operator Instruction) And we'll go next to Dave Rodgers from Baird.","Dave Rodgers","Joel, one question for you with regard to the backlog of demand and interest in your four key hub market. Are you seeing -- or what's the breakdown maybe between tech office or traditional office and kind of lab demand? And I guess the gist of the question is, one, are lab tenants in any particular market being priced out by higher rents? And two, are there any particular markets where the lab demand has really ebbed as the tech office demand has been flowing?","Joel Marcus","Yes, I would say maybe just taking around the country real quickly, I think Seattle tech demand and lab demand have been fairly steady there. I think again its very site specific. In San Francisco clearly tech demand -- I think as Steve has indicated, if you took a benchmark today, it's probably 10x of what lab demand is. But yet certain markets remain pretty key hot beds of laboratory properties South San Francisco, Mission Bay, even though Uber's coming in. But I think some of the other markets have gravitated or stayed much more tech. San Diego, I don\u2019t know, Dan, you could you speak to that.","Dan Ryan","Yes, I think that we find that the life science demand is more significant than the tech demand.","Joel Marcus","And then moving to the other side of the country, I think in Research Triangle Park, really the ag demand and tech is really dominated there. Maryland is pretty much kind of lab. We haven\u2019t seen a big tech influence there. New York, we're pretty much focused on life science there. We haven\u2019t really gravitated to tech for our center. But obviously Silicon Ally and what's going on in New York City, certainly some of the other REITs have been very strong tech demand. But we think that\u2019s -- we're creating a life science market there. So it's a little different for us. And then Cambridge -- clearly lab or office -- lab office or office by lab companies is still a main stay. But there is increasing demand by big tech users. So we're seeing both of it. So a little bit of different story in each of the markets. I don\u2019t think any significant lab tenant is getting priced out of the market, because if you look at the health of the bio tech industry and the pharma industry, it's the best it's ever been for those two industries. So they\u2019ve got more than $200 billion on balance sheet. And so if they want a site, they'll go after it and if they're competing against a big tech tenant, they can certainly go head to head.","Dave Rodgers","I'm assuming that Uber building is not a lab ready building. Are there any other new construction projects of the major variety that you're looking at or you started there are not going to be kind of lab ready at some point in the future?","Joel Marcus","Maybe let's say it's not lab ready. It would be -- lab capable would maybe be a better way to say it. Clearly Townsend in we are likely sign a lease here on the very near-term with a brand name tech tenant. And then Binney, it's kind of a combination of who is bidding on that between life science and tech. So we'll see what shakes out there. But generally if we build a building -- and I think Tom and Steve had gone through this in a prior call, we try to -- if it's in the sweet spot of a Cambridge or a Mission Bay, we would make it lab capable and it's just a few bucks a foot to do that. ","Dave Rodgers","Of your 20 tenants, I think AstraZeneca is the only one that comes up in the next two years or before the end of 2016 with a major maturity. I think its 350,000 square feet. Are you having any discussions with them or can you talk at all about that tenant and their desire to be in that space?","Dean Shigenaga","Well, I think there's a few leases there. Some of it comes up early. The reason why it's got 1.7 remaining years is some of this comes up in early '15. Half of that space that does come up in early '15 I think has been resolved and has been leased. We're still working on the remainder of that and that's probably about a third of that ABR that I'm referring to of that $9.3 million. ","I don't have the details Dave on the other stuff with me.","Joel Marcus","But I think it's fair to say under the new leadership of Pascal Soriot, they obviously thwarted the Pfizer takeover. They've made a big presence -- continued significant presence through their MedImmune acquisition in the Maryland market. They have a big presence in the Boston market. So they are not retrenching in any of the locations that we've seen. ","Dean Shigenaga","Dave, I think the other two leases go out to '18 and '19. So it's really weighted by a near-term rule.","Operator","And we will go next to Jim Sullivan from Cowen Group. ","Jim Sullivan","Joel, I wonder if you could give us kind of a top down summary of your view of East Cambridge and mid-Cambridge. And what I'm referring to is that obviously the Volpe site I gather is still under discussion negotiation, I guess with the GSA and we keep hearing about not just yourself but your peers in MIT looking to increase density where they can on sites that they control. And then of course I guess there's a local community pressure to increase the amount of residential space anytime any increased density is provided. And as you think about the value creation opportunities in East Cambridge, as well I guess those value creation opportunities in the adjacent market and mid-Cambridge, maybe you can kind of summarize for us how much square feet -- additional square feet might be entitled in the next couple of years in East Cambridge and kind of relate that to the demand that you foresee continuing or emerging over the next two years?","Joel Marcus","Yes, that's a question again I would probably punt on that to Tom and will try to address that in the next call. But let me just say this. There is right now about 2.3 million square feet of demand from at least seven major potential tenants, seeking blocks greater than 100,000 square feet just in the East Cambridge area. And so if you just look at what's out there just at this moment in time the numbers are pretty significant. MIT has a big development that they are working. I'd suspect that some of the capital that we've provided them will go into that. It's a pretty large site that they will be able entitle and build on, I think probably over the next maybe over the next -- begin over the 18 to 24 months. The Volpe site is a large site that -- a couple of million square feet including both commercial and residential. Obviously probably every developer between Boston and New York is looking at that.","There is the North Point site which is -- at the moment has not been in favor, a couple of million square feet up there both on commercial and residential. We understand that that actually is in play right now. It was owned by a private equity shop here out of Los Angeles and they're looking to market it. We've heard that there is a lot of foreign interest in that particular site. And then others are looking to add density, as you know Boston Properties et cetera. So there is a pretty big -- there's a pretty big movement to expand entitlements and capabilities and availabilities in that market. But there is somewhat tougher Cambridge council now looking at all kinds of issues including both residential and obviously traffic demands, and just demand on city services. So I think those are the kinds of things that will be balanced and be meted out over time. So I think there is great opportunity, but there is also timeframes. We happen to have hit a very sweet spot. Actually just you'd always like to think you're really smart but luck helps a lot with our 50 Binney, 60 Binney and 100 Binney. We hit a time when there is virtually nothing else that competes with us on a class A ground up construction basis in that market in the time went rents are at -- approaching all-time highs. So I think we feel very fortunate about that, but we're always on the lookout to make sure that our three and five year plans are cognizant of the growth in those markets. And we think both East-Cambridge and Mid-Cambridge makes sense.","You have to remember too there is Alston [ph], which is a gigantic future development which Harvard manages over on the other side of the campus across the river, and that could provide huge amount of space and growth for the next generation of companies. But that's probably five to 10 year out project. So a lot going on in that market.","Jim Sullivan","Yes. can you also just remind us when these sites might include as part of an increased density entitlement, the development of residential what your philosophy is and how you're going to handle that if you do get entitled to do residential? Are you bringing [indiscernible]?","Joel Marcus","Yes, we've been required to build certain residential on the Binney street quarter. I think it's about 273.","Dean Shigenaga","Yes, 273 is the first project. It's probably about 90 some odd units and it's probably an investment in the $40 million - $45 million range for that project.","Joel Marcus","Yes. So that's part of the give and take that we had with Cambridge a number of years ago when we entitled and up-zoned our Binney street sites. So that's just part of doing business. In New York, a lot of developers are facing the same issue, how to address the housing issue. That obviously is front and center with the mayor. So I think a lot of -- and I think San Francisco over time, workforce housing is going to be a very important issue for a lot of companies in a lot of cities.","Jim Sullivan","And in terms of doing that, your approach should be to do it on your own balance sheet, not bring in a partner?","Joel Marcus","We talked to a partner but in our case in Cambridge it was small enough that it made sense. What our long term hold on it, we don't really know. We're not really a residentially holder for I think long term, but we haven't made any short term decisions. But I think part of being a commercial developer today in urban innovation cluster centers is the reality that residential is going to be front and center in some cases.","Jim Sullivan","Okay and then finally for me, you've mentioned in the past digital health as a segment of life sciences where you thought we were in the early stages of maybe some material demand growth. And I'm just curious. There was a lot of capital formation in that. And I wondered if you could just remind us whether you anticipate digital health as a demand segment to be concentrated in any of your existing submarkets?","Joel Marcus","Yes, so far we see it more importantly in the city of San Francisco. A number of companies who are really brand names in that area have grown up. They occupy at the moment kind of tech office space. I think the challenge with digital health -- and I do think it will be an important segment as time goes on is you have kind of a juxtaposition. You have the baby boom generation needing more healthcare services but less capable when it comes to social media and electronic kind of digital if you will tools to implement that health and then you have on the other end a millennial generation, highly sophisticated in the digital world but not caring a whole lot about health because when you're 15 or 20 or 25, your health, there are exceptions to that -- generally is in good shape. So this industry is still in the formative stages. There's a lot of venture capital going into it. But it will probably take three to five years to begin to kind of shake out and mature. But it is here to stay and this intersection between healthcare and the digital world will clearly make an important cost impact difference over time for sure.","Operator","And it appears that we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the program back over to Mr. Marcus for some closing remarks.","Joel Marcus","Okay, well thank you very much.

My name is Karris, and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","And now I would like to hand the call over to your host for today, Ms. Rhonda Chiger. Please proceed ma\u2019am.","Rhonda Chiger","Thank you. Good afternoon. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws. Actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company\u2019s Form 10-K Annual Report and other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","And now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Joel Marcus. Please go ahead.","Joel Marcus","Thanks, Rhonda, and welcome everybody to our actually 60th quarterly conference call as an NYSE listed company and the 15th anniversary this month of our IPO on May of \u201897. With me today are Dean Shigenaga, Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia and Krupal Raval.","It actually struck me driving into work today as I was listening to sports radio on The Dan Patrick Show that yesterday has gone and it\u2019s all about today and tomorrow. So we\u2019re going to focus with that as our theme focus on today and tomorrow.","So 1Q was actually a pretty solid quarter and we have the much work to do through the rest of 2012 and that\u2019s really our laser focus. And I\u2019m going to start-off really with balance sheet and capital allocation thoughts. We did have, I think, a very productive first quarter when it comes to the balance sheet as you saw from the both the press release and supplemental. The consummation of our debut bond offering, the perpetual preferred, the line credit, which we just closed and the \u2013 I think really hallmark, high quality JV capital or JV transaction with JV capital.","We\u2019ve got much more to do through the balance of 2012 focused on suburban asset sales and as well as non \u2013 other non-core asset sales for our capital recycling program. Dean is going to talk referred to that. Obviously we\u2019re focused on land sales and we\u2019ll be reporting some in the quarters to come and potentially in other potential JV relationship that we are exploring.","But as you know or should know, asset sales on a lapse based world are more complex and time consuming then simple generic offers and that\u2019s important to keep in mind. So as we think about some of our markets and this recycling program obviously Seattle, San Francisco, Merlin, Massachusetts are one areas that we\u2019re focused on.","As many of you know from our press release and then the previously, we did complete a very high quality joint venture in the key Longwood Medical submarket, market we\u2019ve held a critical probably one of the best locations in all that submarket highest concentration and density of research hospitals and really teaching platform. And we consider our main and main location truly a triple like location, which we\u2019re always focused on and we will once we open the Longwood center we\u2019ll be the best-in-class building there by far.","We\u2019re looking and we\u2019ll report next quarter at a strong yield and no net future capital outlay, which we were pleased about. We completed partial sale of the land at a gain and we match funded the future capital with both the construction loan and our JV capital as you know. We did make one small acquisition in a really one of the best locations in all of Research Triangle Park with a solid yield. It wasn\u2019t something we were necessarily looking to do, but it was a very opportunistic situation and we took the opportunity and it will create that kind of a platform for other things we\u2019re doing down there.","One key new build-to-suit that Steve is going to discuss a little bit more in South San Francisco which help moves another key parcel from our land bank in South San Francisco which has been a challenging submarket into development process for cash flow at a solid yield. It\u2019s really one of the best locations in South San Francisco and it\u2019s certainly is a best-in-class tenant. Steve will tell you a little bit more about that with whom we have very close relationship and we\u2019re proud that they chose Alexandria over numerous other potential landlords in land sites down there or up there.","We continued to be very focused on attracting high quality tenants to key land parcels for NOI creation or liquefied certain land holdings and clearly our target is to lower non-income producing land as a percentage of GAV to about 15%.","When we move really to operations for the first quarter, it\u2019s important to remember as many other teams have reported, the macro market still remains challenging and the political climate clearly in disarray. Following our fourth quarter highest volume leasing quarter in the history the company as well as the highest leasing year in the history of the company in 2011, we\u2019re very pleased to report really solid leasing demand in the first quarter, 63 leases signed for 912,000 square feet and really balanced by region, 19% coming from San Diego, 24% from San Francisco, 15% from RTP, 13% from Maryland and 27% from Boston. This really confirms the solid life science demand really for our best-in-class properties and our best-in-class submarket adjacency locations.","There are lower quality lab spaces overhanging some submarkets which are keeping somewhat of a lid on rents and some of those landlords are making in some cases hard to understand deals. But when you have the best locations and best quality assets, we feel good about the outcomes that will we have and we\u2019ll be having.","On the development side, we\u2019ve got six projects that are in development. Steve will talk to you somewhat in depth about 499 Illinois. But our 225 Binney with Biogen Idec, our Onyx deal in South San Francisco, Illumina in San Diego another small build-to-suit in UTC with 100% occupied tenant and our small Canadian development with GlaxoSmithKline are all 100% leased. And we know our challenge at 499 Illinois and as I say, Steve will highlight that in some detail.","On the redevelopment leasing, we\u2019ve made, I think very good progress on for principle urban redevelopments, 400 Tech Square. We\u2019re almost 40% leased. We have two or three prospects that we have a good dialog going on. We expect to have some good results in the coming quarter or two. John Hopkins is now in move-in mode so that\u2019s put to bed. At Campus Pointe, we actually have 17,000 or 18,000 square feet on lease and that\u2019s under a hard option to Celgene. And then finally at our 1551 Eastlake, the former Gates Foundation, we\u2019re almost half leased and we expect to have good progress over the next quarter or two.","Steve will update East Jamie for you and I think it\u2019s important to remember that a very significant portion of active development and redevelopment are actually leased and make up much of the projected NOI ramp up for the fourth quarter.","So we think we go into the rest of the year with a good momentum and I\u2019m going to ask Steve to have comment on detailed leasing activity.","Stephen Richardson","Hello, this is Steve Richardson and I\u2019ll go ahead and comment on the significant key trends, primarily focused on the Greater Boston, San Francisco Bay Area cluster markets. From a broad pattern perspective, we\u2019re really seeing the life science sector in these markets experiencing demand from a critically important segment of the industry\u2019s ecosystem and that is an emerging second cohort of companies that are driving towards commercialization and significant product revenue sales.","Large biopharma enterprises historically that provided a foundation of excellence for the industry Genentech, Amgen, Biogen are now being followed by companies that have been working diligently for many years in product research and development with the promise of delivering novel therapies and that promise is now becoming fulfilled.","Commercialization from these companies is a very exciting and compelling evolution in the industry as the roster of biotechnology companies joining the ranks of the aforementioned giants with significant product revenue is growing in on the move.","So with that backdrop focusing on Cambridge\u2019s Kendall Square district, we really see the lab market demand today dominated by companies in the second cohort. There really organic growth from home grown enterprises at the cost of commercialization and this demand ranges between 1 million and 1.5 million square feet today.","The companies are seeking to consolidate in high quality headquarters facilities that will provide a platform as a commercial company moving forward. The lease rates today in Kendall Square range from the mid-50s, triple net to low 70s triple net for existing space and build-to-suite opportunities respectively. And has a market vacancy rate of approximately 15%.","Alexandria\u2019s asset-base in Kendall Square is performing very well with a 4.4% vacancy rate. And as Joel mentioned, we\u2019re in the midst of good activity in the 400 Tech Square redevelopment project although we are experiencing some competition from chronic vacancy in other projects in the market.","Turning to San Francisco, and in particular the South San Francisco cluster, we\u2019ve consistently indicated our caution regarding this important cluster as we\u2019ve exercised discipline and restrain regarding capital allocation for acquisition opportunities during the past few years and focused exclusively on our existing asset base in build-to-suit opportunities.","With that, we\u2019re pleased that this discipline and focus has been rewarded as we are announcing the execution of a long-term lease with Onyx Pharmaceuticals for 171,000 square feet at 259 East Grand Avenue. This is Onyx\u2019s second facility on Alexandria\u2019s fully integrated East Grand Campus and brings their footprint up to approximately 300,000 square feet.","Onyx really represents one of the best of the second cohort of companies mentioned before, as they are enjoying significant product revenues today and have great promise with additional products and their pipeline and we are delighted to grow our partnership with the company.","The overall South San Francisco lab market is incrementally improving with a vacancy rate at approximately 9.4%, lease rates remain in the low to mid 30s triple net for existing space. And our asset base in this submarket is performing well with a vacancy rate of 3.2%. We continue to be engaged in negotiations within an existing tenant and a new tenant at out East Jamie Court development for a total of 4.5 or approximately 40,000 square feet in its 163,000 square foot facility. And we\u2019ll be targeting Q2 to Q3 to consummate these transactions.","Moving north a bit up to Mission Bay, it remains a tight market with vacant in our portfolio of just 1% or so when excluding a couple of retail suits. The 499 Illinois project represents the only block of space available for life science use as the China Basin building has been fully observed with tech users. Given the high quality water front location, we are exercising patience as we continue dialog with institutional life science users.","We\u2019ve been here before in Mission Bay and brought 1700 Owens, 1500 Owens and 455 Mission Bay Boulevard South to the market in a similar state in ultimately secured excellent anchored tenants.","Salesforce.com is in a pause mode as they\u2019re evaluating their options during the next six months that we \u2013 as we mentioned before, but UCSF continues to make very significant and meaningful investments in Mission Bay with a grand opening of their 2,237,000 square foot Neuroscience Center on their campus and rapid progress on the $1.6 billion medical centers hospital complex.","Moving for a moment to the 2012 rollovers, we\u2019re making steady progress in that room as well. At the end of Q4 2011, we reported 694,000 square feet of remaining leases to be resolved and are pleased to have reduced that figure to 352,000 square feet. We signed 36 leases in the rollover category totaling 275,000 square feet during Q1 at lease rates that provided a cash basis increase of 1.1% and a GAAP basis increase of 7.6% when excluding the one lease in the secondary Sorrento Valley submarket of San Diego.","The remaining 167,000 square feet of space that\u2019s rolled this quarter is concentrated about 50% in Cambridge and very high quality assets. So we expect to define 33% in Maryland, which may present some challenges and just 13% in San Francisco where we should also define.","The forecast for the balance of the year at this time from a lease rate perspective is consistent with guidance that was provided at the end of 2011 cash basis of relatively flat and a GAAP basis up to 5%.","Thank you and I\u2019ll turn it over to Dean.","Dean Shigenaga","Thanks Steve and good afternoon everyone. Our results for the quarter really reflects a $0.01 increase in our interest expense net for one month related to our debut 4.6% unsecured bond offering and approximately one-half of $0.01 increase in preferred stock dividends related to the overlap of our 6.45% Series E preferred stock with our 8.375% Series E preferred stock.","Additionally our results included a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $623,000 or $0.01 per share related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees from the early retirement of our 2012 term loan. Our results also included a D-42 preferred stock redemption charge of approximately $6 million or $0.10 per share upon calling for redemption or 8.375% preferred stock.","NAV read FFO including these items aggregating $0.11 was approximately $0.97 per diluted share and FFO per share as adjusted was reported at $1.08. Earnings per diluted was $0.41 before the loss on early extinguishment of debt and the preferred stock redemption charge.","Turning to core operating metrics, the first quarter of 2012 NOI was as expected at $101.6 million and consistent with fourth quarter \u201811 NOI of $101.8 million. Last quarter, we highlighted 2012 occupancy declines in South San Francisco, Greater Boston and the Suburban Washington D.C. markets. The San Francisco Bay overall occupancy declined from 96.7% to 93.9% primarily due to the 54,000 rentable square foot move out at Oyster Point. Occupancy should increase in the second quarter from leases scheduled for delivery at 951 Gateway and a couple of other properties.","Additionally, occupancy is also projected to continue to increase in the second half of 2012. Greater Boston occupancy declined from 93.9% to 91.7% primarily due to move outs at 300 Technology Square and 790 Memorial Drive. We expect occupancy to increase to the 93% to 94% range in the second quarter from executed leases and expected deliveries at 790 Memorial Drive, 99 Erie Street and 6-8 Preston Court.","Lastly, Suburban Washington D.C., as you recall from our last conference call, we have one large user of approximately 95,000 rentable square feet at Virginia Manor that is planning to move out in May at the end of their lease term. These spaces are both part lab and part traditional office and we expect the space to require some time to release. Another user of 105,000 rentable square feet at 1413 Research Boulevard that was evaluated in which research groups to remain in occupancy recently confirmed that they will be vacating the space in May of 2012.","We get assume a 50% chance of renewal previously, so this change was partially included in our guidance. This tenant at 1413 Research has been in the building since the \u201890s and the older brick building is currently planned for future development or redevelopment.","Looking forward, NOI is expected to increase in the second quarter and the third quarter in our estimate for NOI for the fourth quarter remains in the range of $111 million to $113 million.","Our same property growth in NOI was approximately 1.7% on a cash basis and a decrease of 0.7% on a GAAP basis. The cash performance was primarily driven by contractual rent steps, rent commencement on a development project at 249 East Grand starting on April 1 of 2011. And rent commencement on significant amount of space in the East Tower at in the Manhattan project in New York.","Same property performance also reflects the impact of anticipated rollovers in Cambridge at 300 Technology Square and 790 Memorial Drive in the first quarter resulting in a reduction in both rent and recoveries. We are expecting an increase in occupancy in Cambridge related to deliveries in the second quarter from executed leases.","Same property operating expenses increased 1.3% reflecting an increase in property tax expenses offset by a reduction in steam and snow removal expenses due to the mild winter in the first quarter of \u201812.","Briefly on our leasing stats, rental rate changes from new or renewal of previously leased spaces increased 3.3% on a GAAP basis and decreased 2.8% on a cash basis. We actually had one lease for about 18,000 rentable square feet driving the statistics down for the re-leasing of the space to a new tenant in the Sorrento Valley market. And this particular submarket by the way is the lowest rental rate submarket in the San Diego lab market region for Alexandria. If you excluded this one lease, the rental rates would have been up 1.1% on a cash basis and up 7.6% on a GAAP basis.","Our G&A run rate has moved ahead of schedule with the hiring of additional personnel and continued build out of our fully integrated regional operations. Since December of \u201811, we have added 6% to our number of employees, additionally Joel\u2019s employment contract was amended in April and now includes a total stock return performance and other key changes to retain in Joel for performance will also closely aligning with the interest of the shareholders. G&A expenses are expected to be fairly consistent for the full year of 2012 with 2011 at 7% to 8% of total revenues.","Moving next to our balance sheet, as clearly highlighted in our press release and supplemental, we had a very strong quarter of balance sheet management milestones. Briefly, the 4.6% unsecured notes resulted in higher interest expense on a net basis in the first quarter by $0.01 related to been outstanding for about one month in the quarter and is expected to result in additional interest expense net in the second quarter by an additional $0.02.","The 6.45 series E perpetual preferred issuance did overlap with the outstanding series E until the redemption in \u2013 on April 13th resulting in an increase in preferred dividends in the first quarter in the range of one-half of $0.01. The second quarter will not realize a benefit from this refinancing due to the overlap of the two securities for a couple of weeks in April. In the third and fourth quarter this refinancing will reduce preferred stock dividends by approximately $0.01 per share again in each of the third and the fourth quarters of \u201812.","The amendment to our unsecured line of credit reduced pricing by over 1% from 2.4% over one month LIBOR plus 40 debt fee for unused commitments. For an annual rate of approximately 2.55% the new pricing under the amendment is 1.2% plus an annual facility fee of 25 debts. This amendment will reduce interest expense net by approximately $0.01 per quarter.","In summary, in the first four quarters at 2012 we have been very successful in cap in the variety of sources of capital, going forward we expect to close another small but important construction loan for approximately $50 to $55 million. This loan is currently under negotiation for a recently announced development in South San Francisco at 259 East Ground Avenue.","We will also actively pursued asset sales to meet or exceed our targeted dispositions for 2012. We are currently 42% through our targeted dispositions for the year. We remain committed to lower library general well required capital to balance our incremental construction spending over time, some of this capital will come from land and operating asset sales and we may consider implementing the modest ATM program.","Our debt EBITDA will also benefit from the significant amount of NOI and EBITDA contribution beginning in the third quarter of 2012 and ramping up into the fourth quarter from the delivery of our significantly leased redevelopment and development projects. Again our goal overtime is to improve debt to EBITDA to sub 6.5 times.","Turning to page seven of our press release, I\u2019d like to radial through some key assumptions underlying our guidance. Same property NOI performance, targets for cash and GAAP have not changed from previous guidance. On a cash basis we\u2019re expecting it up 3% to 5% on a GAAP basis up zero to 2%. Out expectations on rental rate steps have not changed as well and we expect the renewals and re-leasing of space to be up \u2013 up to 5% on a GAAP basis and slightly negative, slightly positive on a cash basis.","Straight-line rents have not changed in our projections and our expected average about $6.5 million per quarter FAS 141 at 800,000 per quarter has not changed either. G&A expenses are expected to be up meaningfully at 12% to 14% over 2011. Capped interest has been adjusted downward slightly to a range of $55.5 to $61.5 million and it\u2019s somewhat depended on timing of construction activities and the decline is really reflective of our lower interest rate on our line of credit. Similarly, our interest expense net has also declined in our forecast to $73 million to $79 million.","Moving to page eight of our press release, we continue to make progress on our target NOI growth for the fourth quarter, a significant amount of this NOI growth is contractual pursuant to executed leases. We updated key assumptions for the fourth quarter and reconfirmed the range of NOI expected at $111 million to $113 million. Updated G&A slightly to $11 million to $12 million also updated interest expense to $20 million to $23 million, preferred dividends reflective of our preferred refinancing down to $6.5 million and reconfirmed FFO at $71 million to $73 million and FFO per share of $1.15 to $1.17.","Importantly, let me turn to the sources and uses table on page eight of our press release, and just highlight what we\u2019ve completed and what has changed since our last guidance that was reported on February 22.","Our asset sales remain at $112 million for full target and as I mentioned, we\u2019re 42% of the way through that target. Our unsecured senior notes was updated for the final offering increased by $50 million. We continued to negotiate our secured construction financing for the project in South San Francisco and there is no changes to the estimated proceeds from that but the total loan will aggregate closer to $50 million to $55 million.","We\u2019ve updated our sources for the Series E Preferred Stock offering at $125 million of net proceeds. And our debt, equity and JV capital increased from $238 million to $247 million just slightly. The remaining projected number at $331 million for the last three quarters of the year includes about $130 million of borrowings under our line of credit to redeem our Series E Preferred Stock.","Turning to uses of capital. Our construction spending has increased from $584 million to $612 million for the full year of \u201812 really up about $28 million, primarily related to acceleration of timing of construction payments from \u201813 into 2012 combined with some expansion construction spending related to luminous expansion requirements. And a little bit from our Longwood project that we intend to reinvest some of our proceeds that we cashed out.","Acquisition assumptions are up slightly, it still very minor number for the year and no other changes other than updating our Series E Preferred Stock redemption in our uses of capital.","So in closing, our range of guidance to 2012 was reported as follows: normalized FFO per share diluted remains unchanged at $4.37 to $4.41, NAV read FFO per share diluted was provided at $4.23 to $4.27 and earnings per share diluted was reported at \u2013 are provided at $1.6 to $1.46. And just keep in mind our guidance for 2012 was updated to reflect $0.14 of charges, $0.03 of it related to the write-off of a portion of loan fees related to the modification of our line of credit, $0.10 for the D-42 preferred stock redemption charge and previously we had provided a guidance charge of $0.01 related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees from the early retirement of our 2012 term loan.","With that I\u2019ll turn it back to Joe.","Joel Marcus","Okay. Operator, if you would open it up for Q&A. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS. Please proceed.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","Hi, good afternoon everyone. Couple of questions from me. First I understand the language regarding the increase to the budget for G&A expense this year. What I\u2019m trying to understand that was, why wasn\u2019t any of that known or contemplated when the guidance was given just a few short months ago?","Dean Shigenaga","Well that\u2019s actually pretty easy that\u2019s because the effort to, if you \u2013 well actually maybe the easiest thing to do is, refer you to our proxy. We spent good deal of time in the proxy outlining the process that we undertook to what kind of look at kind of the ISS issues and that took the study of two independent comp groups plus the board plus the comp committee plus myself on the Joel side. And then on the expansion side, we\u2019re always looking at opportunities in the market and we\u2019re actually pretty somewhat busier than we thought in a number of markets with the activities we had. So those are things that just evolve overtime as you know Ross.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","Okay. Fair enough. In your very expensive supplemental, I think its page 20, that\u2019s the same question I asked last quarter, the yields on the suburban redevelopment, are those still targeted in the mid to high-single digits?","Joel Marcus","Yeah, I think they vary by individual projects. Some at the upper range actually are north of 10 and some at the lower range or like in the mid-single digits.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","Is there any reason for the second quarter in a row that those numbers got left out from supplemental?","Joel Marcus","I don\u2019t know that they\u2019re left out but they\u2019re not all that material to the other projects that are much bigger.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","$234 million, so leave that one [indiscernible]. Same \u2013 similar questions on India and China, looks like it was about $7 million spent in the first quarter, $38 million budgeted for the remainder of the year it looks like. Can you give us a sense of exactly what kind of activity is going on there and I notice the square footage also looks like it changed a little bit.","Joel Marcus","Well as you know we have two projects that we\u2019re working on China small one in the south and the little bit larger one but by and large they\u2019re not super material projects in China and we continued to enhance the buildings and working on leasing in those markets and we\u2019ll report over time on that our success although China we said, publicly is a tough market for a lot of reasons.","In India, our footprint is larger. We think it\u2019s a big future market but as we\u2019ve said both at Investor Day where you attended and then certainly on the fourth quarter call that we had cut our capital allocations to India based on just overall spend this year by of about 50% but we\u2019re primarily working with credit tenants who are at the top of our credit tenant roster to fulfill their needs over there. So we\u2019re pleased about that as well.","Dean Shigenaga","And Ross, it\u2019s Dean here, to close out your last question on that change in the square footage in Asia under construction, had to do with the completion of some preconstruction activity on a land parcel, so it dropped off capitalization and is sitting at an idle land today.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","Okay. So just to be clear on the $152 million that\u2019s budgeted to be spent, $114 million has already been spent. Is there actually anything physically there or is that all moving dirt and predevelopment work?","Dean Shigenaga","No, they\u2019re actual operations, buildings et cetera.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","And but nothing is leased at this point?","Dean Shigenaga","Nothing leased at this point, no, considerably leased actually.","Joel Marcus","And the stuff that\u2019s under construction has some pre-leasing on it.","Dean Shigenaga","And we\u2019re all also operating properties with some top tier pharma that are already in operations.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","Okay.","Joel Marcus","And over time when that operation becomes more material, we\u2019ll probably even tour people out there, so if you want to fly to India over the coming year too we\u2019ll take you there.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","Okay. I appreciate that.","Joel Marcus","You\u2019ll be amazed. Say again?","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","There is there on the leasing in terms of the percentages that\u2019s why the question comes from.","Joel Marcus","Yeah, no we have actually considerable leasing.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","Okay. It might be helpful.","Joel Marcus","Our model for India is not to do spec of element by and large, our model in China was to see if we could build in China. We know we can do a great job. But as I said, I think many times our challenge in China is when we bring one of our pharma tenant over there, they end up with 30 bids from local economic development groups, economic zone cities, provinces that creates a real distraction. So we\u2019ve kind of figured out how to overcome that but we\u2019re not sure we want to commit more capital with the Chinese market certainly in the short-term.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Yeah, thank you.","Operator","Paolone with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Anthony Paolone \u2013 JPMorgan","Thanks. Are you seeing any lift in lab rents in the Bay Area given just how much rents have moved for conventional office from all the Tech demands?","Steve Richardson","Yeah, hi Tony, it\u2019s Steve. In Mission Bay again we\u2019ve got the only lab facility there. So I think consistently as we\u2019ve said in the past, we pro forma the project at rents that we\u2019ve already completed at 1500 Owens, at 455 Mission Bay. So I think we\u2019ll certainly do that or better. And then moving to the South San Francisco, we are seeing some incremental improvement. I would say it\u2019s modest at this point though, there are still are a couple of sublease opportunities that need to be burned off. But I think we\u2019re finally turning the corner over the next \u2013 it\u2019ll be a few quarter, it\u2019s not going to be the next couple of weeks. But we will see some uplift in rental rates there towards the end of year and in the beginning of next year.","Joel Marcus","Yeah, I think Tony what really and Steve and I were talking about this earlier, what really has fundamentally changed the Bay Area at least the mid and inflow which would be South San Francisco market is really the acquisition by Roche of Genentech the full acquisition that power house of spin-outs, spin-offs expansion just has changed fundamentally because Roche being a big pharma just operates very differently even far differently than Novartis which is another Swiss company. And I think until things settle down with that, I don\u2019t think at least in the South San Francisco sub-Mission Bay aside, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see dramatic increases there, I think Palo Alto remains very strong there is virtually no space available down there. And then Mid-peninsula is not so much a huge lab market other than the Cluster at San Francisco, and I think East Bay is the same thing.","Anthony Paolone \u2013 JPMorgan","Is there \u2013 in Mission Bay with your Illinois Street assets, would you consider leasing those to Tech and is their demand for Tech other than just lab space at this point there?","Joel Marcus","Yeah, well we, I think we\u2019ve commented before and I\u2019ll let Steve expand. We clearly have looked at and had a lot of interest from Tech users if not like in Cambridge, its not our primary focus, but if somebody is willing to pay us a significant amount of money and it makes sense on that opportunistic situation. We would look at it much like we did Google\u2019s First Campus I\u2019d mentioned, but Steve can give you a sense of how Tech is viewed at.","Steve Richardson","Yeah we have had serious discussions with the couple of Tech groups, Tony, and the way we are warming up the building, we\u2019re able to accommodate that use and not over invest in the building. So I think we\u2019re providing flexibility from that perspective and to the extent a floor or two out of the six-story building ends up becoming a Tech use and then further downstream becomes a life science use. We\u2019ve seen that happen occasionally in the portfolio. But it\u2019s not necessarily that top priority at all for us.","Anthony Paolone \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. And then Steve, did I catch this right in Cambridge you said it was 1 million to 1.5 million square feet of demand, did I hear that?","Steve Richardson","Yes that is accurate.","Joel Marcus","And that\u2019s lab Tony, that\u2019s not including tech.","Anthony Paolone \u2013 JPMorgan","And what\u2019s availability across the whole market?","Steve Richardson","I think you would have a mix of existing facilities and build-to-suite opportunities. And there is a 15% vacancy rate, but as far as large blocks of space that provide flexible expansion opportunities, you really don\u2019t have too many of those at all.","Anthony Paolone \u2013 JPMorgan","Yeah I guess it seems like a lot of demand. Is there \u2013 do these folks have options or is it going to be really a requirement that stuff will have to get built?","Joel Marcus","Yeah, more likely a build-to-suite \u2013 correct \u2013 for the bigger requirements.","Anthony Paolone \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. And then just last question, Joe. You mentioned exploring potentially some other joint venture relationships, just was curious whether that was for perhaps development or existing assets or just any color there?","Joel Marcus","Yeah, I think primarily development we\u2019ve thought about it for existing assets, but that\u2019s an almost like creating a preferred equity structure. So I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s what we wanted. We\u2019ve spent time thinking about that, but I think on the development side if we\u2019re fortune that in the land some significant developments that are out there, we might look much like we did on the Longwood project at a creative structure.","Anthony Paolone \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay thanks.","Joel Marcus","Yeah, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Quentin Velleley with Citi. Please proceed.","Quentin Velleley \u2013 Citi","Hi, thank you. Just in terms of the build-to-suite, 259 East Grand, the speculation at Bayer supposedly bringing talks of a takeover of Onyx. If that was to eventuate, what might that mean for that project and some of the other space that you have Onyx in?","Joel Marcus","Yeah, I\u2019ll let Steve comment again on the ground, but from a pharmaceutical perspective and a biotech perspective, we would expect given the nature of Onyx their platform and their operation that they would leave that fully intact and operate out of South San Francisco. It certainly wouldn\u2019t change Bayer\u2019s research presence in Mission Bay release separate and apart from that. I think for us it would be credit enhancement and frankly it might be interesting from the standpoint that they would use that to further expand in the South San Francisco area as well so that could be very good, but Steve can comment on the ground.","Steve Richardson","Yeah I think that\u2019s exactly right. We have a long-term lease commitment from Onyx. They worked very hard on the design to build out a fully integrated operation. And the trend in the Clusters over the past couple of years has been for pharma to keep the operations intact and grow the operation. So I would be hopeful we\u2019d see the same thing here.","Joel Marcus","Yeah I think you have to be careful too not to generalize every big pharma really stands on it\u2019s own and Bayer is one that would be looking for a bigger footprint where others who hardly have a very large footprint might want \u2013 might not have the same view of maintaining as bigger base or expansion, each one really is kind of considered separate and apart.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","Joel, its Michael Bilerman speaking. Is it a \u2013 just quick follow-up, you mentioned having income from India and China, but looking on page 38 of the supplemental, there is no sort of \u2013 the only international assets are listed here are from Canada. And so, I guess the question is, when you look at page 42 and the $767 million growth that\u2019s been spent on the development pipeline of which you have $114 million spent in India and China. Is there any income coming off of that today? That\u2019s been recognized in NOI?","Joel Marcus","All right. On the projects in Asia, Michael, that are under construction there is no income associated with those projects. There is a small amount of completed space in India that\u2019s probably generating\u2026","Dean Shigenaga","Maybe about $1 million.","Joel Marcus","In that range, it\u2019s $5 million in revenues at the moment.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","Yeah, on a quarterly or on an annualized basis?","Joel Marcus","On an annual basis. And I suspect over the next four quarters, we\u2019ll be able to complete some of the build-to-suite projects build-to-suite released credit projects and you\u2019ll start to see some additional information on projects in India.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","So what else is again at least my impression was everything that\u2019s in CIP, the $767 million that you spent is earning [indiscernible] in zero on it right now. Is that not the case? Are you actually earning income from this capital?","Joel Marcus","That\u2019s true Michael. The basis in CIP is not earning any revenue, its all under construction.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","So the \u2013 in India that you\u2019re referring to \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t be able to pick that up anywhere because that\u2019s not in the property listing that\u2019s separate from the money that you spent in CIP in terms of what million dollars that you\u2019re talking about?","Joel Marcus","Yeah that\u2019s correct Michael. It\u2019s a small piece of real estate that\u2019s operating in rental properties today.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","And you\u2019re still earning some income, if I remember correctly, off of some of the Benny Street stuff from those existing buildings correct?","Joel Marcus","A little bit and it shows up in our AFFO reconciliation and it\u2019s about just shy of 500,000 for the quarter.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","Okay. And then I pause and I jumped on late and Joel I caught you the end of the sentence where you said something about not understanding other landlord deals and I just didn\u2019t know what that was in reference to.","Joel Marcus","I think in some markets you find somebody who has got chronic vacancy that\u2019s willing to make such a sweetheart deal that doesn\u2019t make necessarily market sense or when you talk to brokers or you go out they set a, I mean this happened at San Diego up on Torrey Pines, a landlord leased a building that had chronic issues for $1.50, this is about two years ago, when the lowest price ever leased in for similar quality properties where at least $1 higher than that. So we see some of that around and until that chronic vacancy is absorbed ultimately that does tend to not allow rents to lift as much as possible. We see a little bit of that in South San Francisco a little bit of in Cambridge, a little bit of in few markets in Seattle so that\u2019s something that\u2019s out there.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","And on 409, 499 Illinois have your, I understand you\u2019re being conservative in sort of pushing out the initial occupancy by six months. But I guess have your return expectations changed at all or your capital needs for that project changed at all in how you\u2019ve looked at it?","Dean Shigenaga","Michael, it\u2019s Dean here, no. The capital investment has not changed and our return expectations have not either.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","Okay. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Yeah. Thanks Michael.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Conor Fennerty with Goldman Sachs.","Conor Fennerty \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks, good afternoon. Joel, just you mentioned the redevelopment conversations you guys are having. How much of that potentially could come in 2012 and how much have you guys included in your guidance if any?","Joel Marcus","Guidance, there is no incremental redevelopments like I think of beyond what\u2019s on our schedule that could come into guidance.","Conor Fennerty \u2013 Goldman Sachs","No I meant what Joel reference conversations you guys are having with potential tenants for redevelopment assets.","Joel Marcus ","Yeah I mean\u2026","Dean Shigenaga","I think the only one that has some incremental NOI potential for delivery is really the 400 Tech Square project in Cambridge where we\u2019ve got a few discussions with prospects that could deliver in the fourth quarter. And that\u2019s not a meaningful component of our NOI ramp up. It probably represents maybe 300,000 of potential NOI from that project in the fourth quarter of \u201812.","Conor Fennerty \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then just looking at the $934 million left of land on the balance sheet. I realize a bulk of that\u2019s the West Tower and Kendall Square. What else is included in there?","Joel Marcus","Hang on. I\u2019m turning to go to the page. Okay, so the $934 million of book value is really two buckets, $550 million of land undergoing preconstruction activities and $387 million of land held for future development which is not under capitalization and that detail actually for both buckets shows up on the last page of our supplemental, a couple of pages beyond the table you were just referring to. And it provides the break out land undergoing preconstruction activities which is part of our CIP category and under capitalization, the bulk of that is are development site in Cambridge, 1.6 million square feet. 250,000 square feet roughly in San Diego and then the second tower in New York City is the third component.","Land for future development is really spread across multiple markets, a little bit in Boston, a little bit up in Mission Bay about 1 million square feet in San Francisco, 1 million is Suburban Washington D.C. and 1 million in Seattle, other markets about 1 million and internationally about 6 million square feet of potential development product.","Conor Fennerty \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then just lastly on the balance sheet, is any of the secured debt that comes to in \u201813, \u201814 pre-payable?","Dean Shigenaga","Generally \u201813 and \u201814 debt maturities on the secured side only have the standard prepayment window of roughly 90 days.","Conor Fennerty \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay.","Dean Shigenaga","So I do not expect any early retirement of any of the secured debt.","Conor Fennerty \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, thanks.","Joel Marcus","Thank you.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of George Auerbach with ISI Group. Please proceed.","George Auerbach \u2013 ISI Group","Great, thanks guys. Dean, you mentioned in your comments that you used this ATM program. I guess can you quantify how large you could see that program being and I guess would you be using potential equity to fund the 2012 development or redevelopment spend?","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah, I think most companies typically saw is their ATM programs roughly not that every company does the same. But roughly at 10% of their equity market cap just to limit the size of the program. For a company like Alexandria, you probably see no reasons for it be much outside of the 250 to 350 range in size. And it\u2019s not intended to replace a traditional follow on offering but in smaller needs for equity capital you can raise in a much more cost effective manner is we\u2019re all aware of over time.","George Auerbach \u2013 ISI Group","And just on the timing of use, I guess would you sort of \u2013 maybe see yourself using that over the next 12 months to fund development?","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah, I\u2019d say over the next 12 months. It\u2019s fair to say that without any significant news in a big way on the asset disposition front, we would likely use an ATM to raise some equity capital.","George Auerbach \u2013 ISI Group","Right. And I guess just lastly in terms of the disposition program, I know you sold the Longwood property and maybe another property on the market were under contract. Can you kind of quantify above the 64 mainly show here is additional disposition planned for this year kind of what\u2019s on the market, how interested in those assets? And maybe in terms of pace of sales how you see the rest of the year playing out?","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah, I think beyond the few that are under contract which gets us to 42% of the way, the $65 million you\u2019re referring to is the remaining of the $112 million. I would say that we have some early discussions on a couple of assets that could close over the next two, three, four quarters that could aggregate a little north of $100 million. I\u2019m cautious about banking on that number because those discussions are still early and there is not contract in place.","We continue to evaluate a number of assets for potential disposition. I think our product type is a little different than the traditional assets that go to the market. We are very careful about which assets we sell and the buyers that ultimately we want to sell these assets to. So it sometimes takes a little more time to execute.","Joel Marcus","But I think two points, George. One would be, I think you\u2019ll definitely see more activity on the sale side both at the asset level and we would have to be careful what we say here for disclosure purposes both on the land and even some, as I said, buildings both non-core and suburban. And then on the ATM, I would say the way to think about that is, we will over time probably put an ATM in place. We probably will think of it is a very modest program. And I think we think of it is, our goal is to try to keep guidance where it is for the year while maintaining our credit metrics where they should be. So we\u2019re obviously focused on minimization of dilution very laser like, so that\u2019s kind of how to think about that.","George Auerbach \u2013 ISI Group","Great, thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Phillip Martin with Morningstar. Please proceed.","Phillip Martin \u2013 Morningstar","Thank you and good afternoon.","Joel Marcus","Hi.","Phillip Martin \u2013 Morningstar","I wanted to just follow up with Steve on the second cohort. These tenants now that are playing a larger role that would appear in your going forward and leasing plans. What sort of differences, challenges, benefits does the second cohort means for in terms of square footage demands, costs, lease terms et cetera?","Joel Marcus","Yeah, let me take a first crack and then I\u2019ll ask Steve to comment Phillip. I think Steve really put his finger on one of the, I consider to be principal future growth engines of this industry. You\u2019ve got pharmas kind of reinvention of itself as one and we\u2019ve seen a big movement out of there unacquainted and isolated facilities into the hubs and that\u2019s been well documented. We\u2019ve seen a lot of product and service companies, the aluminous of the world and others who are out there pretty aggressively marketing new generation products.","We\u2019ve seen the institutional side obviously grow to some extent, but I think that in the biotech industry if you look that separate and apart from pharma, this so called second cohort that Steve referred to, really is the generation of companies that have been around some 10, 15, 20, even some I can think of more than that heavily based in the Cambridge Boston area and in the San Francisco Bay area although there are some in other markets. And what they\u2019re doing is they\u2019re creating kind of many Amgen\u2019s, if you will, smaller more nimble fully integrated companies that will that have done research they\u2019re now moving from R to D and now B to C and they\u2019ll have strike forces of sales operations, they have more targeted products. Ultimately they maybe picked up one by one or from time to time by big pharma, but these are companies that really have and we\u2019ll maintain fully integrated operations in more likely the Cluster markets and Onyx is a good example. There are several now that have significant requirements that have come to market in the Boston Cambridge area and I think that\u2019s gives you a sense of who these companies are.","Steve, you can talk further about what you see in the Bay area there.","Steve Richardson","I was actually meeting with the CEO of one of these companies yesterday and he was very enthusiastic about having four products in the clinic, $0.5 billion in cash in the bank and the ability to really build out to the next phase. So I think it\u2019s a combination of the large blocks of space they\u2019ll be requiring that credit foundation that they have now and the potential for, in this industry, some very significant meaningful growth. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re excited about in our core clusters with the availability we have of different build-to-suite opportunities in particular to offer to these types of companies.","Phillip Martin \u2013 Morningstar","Are the square footage demands pretty similar to what this portfolio \u2013 Alexandria\u2019s portfolio has experienced historically? Are they a bit smaller? Can your existing portfolio handle most of this demand or are we going to see a ramp up in development and redevelopment potentially over the next 12 to 18 months to meet this demand?","Joel Marcus","Yeah I think many of these companies and I can think of a half a dozen right now Cambridge based and San Francisco based that are looking to have small fully integrated campuses that could run from 0.25 million square feet to potentially 1 million square feet, hard to piecemeal those together, the new generation of leaders who want to be as close to each other as possible, meaning, different functions of the company. And I think if you look at what\u2019s available trying to piece together in a hodgepodge way multiple buildings in a particular market probably not ideal, I mean know a number of these management teams for more than a decade or so. And I think many of them will be forced to go to development.","Philip Martin \u2013 Morningstar","Okay. So is it fair to say that at least in the Cambridge market, we could see the development ramp up over the next 12 to 18 months potentially?","Joel Marcus","I think there is no doubt that as Steve described the \u2013 currently mark deals on the market that range from 1 million to 1.5 million square feet development will be one of the primary vehicles, yes absolutely.","Philip Martin \u2013 Morningstar","Okay. Thank you very much.","Joel Marcus","Yeah. Thanks Philip.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of John Stewart with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Thank you. Joel, how many square feet are the three assets that are under contract for sale?","Joel Marcus","Dean?","Dean Shigenaga ","Give me one second. It shows up\u2026","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Sorry if I missed it in the supplemental.","Joel Marcus","Bear with us a moment.","Dean Shigenaga","","It\u2019s about 100,000 square feet.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay. And now that they are under contract, can you let us know which markets those are in?","Joel Marcus","I believe two up in Seattle.","Dean Shigenaga","One in Pennsylvania.","Joel Marcus","And one in Pennsylvania.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay.","Joel Marcus","And more to come, as I describe, John, there are at least four markets we\u2019re looking at and pretty actively engaged in this process of identifying assets per sale I think I mentioned Seattle, San Francisco, Maryland and Massachusetts.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay.","Joel Marcus","Again on-core and suburban primarily.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Right, wonderful. And how about the markets where you added headcount?","Joel Marcus","Yeah, Seattle, San Francisco, San Diego, Massachusetts, New York.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay.","Joel Marcus","At Sedona, forgot.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay, got it.","Dean Shigenaga","To keep up with the supplement disclosure demands at the street in which we\u2019ve expanded our accounting group in measurably.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","It\u2019s definitely appreciated.","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah, no thank you.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","To housekeeping ones for Dean if I may. Dean just the language in the press release, it wasn\u2019t quite clear is the preferred redemption charge, is that was original issuance costs or if you paid above part or retire that?","Dean Shigenaga","Well it was the original issuance cost. We redeemed it at par, John.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay. And can you clear up for us what the current status? What\u2019s going to happen with the milestone payments at Mission Bay with the sales force campus in pause mode?","Dean Shigenaga","Nothing changes from our view of the world. We, in transaction, when we sold those parcels, the sales force, the company recognized the liability for an estimate of potential payments. And so if those \u2013 if the estimates pan out to be true to the T, those payments will be made over the next several years. And that\u2019s from what we understand with sales force nothing at the moment has changed our review on the timing of this potential payments. And quite honestly, it\u2019ll be a few years, John, before we really know what happens.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Right. Which from memory was on the order of $30 million, right?","Dean Shigenaga","No, it was closer to $14 million, John.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay, sorry if I got that wrong. Okay. And then one last one for Joel if I may. Obviously just a lot has changed in terms of the capital structure and balance sheet just in the last 90 days. And so it\u2019s been a while, since I remember hearing an update in terms of the long-term strategy in India, can you give us an update there based on where you are today which is obviously a much different situation then where you were a year or two years ago?","Joel Marcus","Yeah, that\u2019s a good question. And I think Michael was asking about that as well and maybe Ross as well. I guess there are two thoughts. One is my desire and our desire as a company but I personally have had a vision for Asia as a pretty big market over time. But clearly post-Lehman and post the financial, I guess the deep recession we\u2019ve had here, obviously we\u2019ve had to rethink the pace and the scale at which we could really build out in India in particular.","And so we\u2019ve done that and then even more recently when we looked at I mean 2010 was a pretty strong year up until the U.S. I think got downgraded kind of late July, early August when we were about to go to the bond market. We remember those dates well. Clearly, we refocused our capital allocation pretty substantially and cut our spend in India by about 50%. We think India is a big market. There are a lot of different aspects with the life science industry that can go on there. There is not only pure health care life science; there is industrial biotech which is big there. Companies like DuPont and others that use a similar platform.","But I think \u2013 and ultimately the goal was to try to get to critical mass to take an entity public on the Singapore Exchange that would be publicly traded and self-finance that operation in which Alexandria would have up on that share and hopefully a liquidity event and value. But I think our pace have seen that come to fruition, post-Lehman and then just post given where the world is today that period is just elongated unfortunately and we\u2019re just doing what we do in a much more measured and careful pace as opposed to one that would be more optimistic. I mean that you listen to Mort Zuckerman on Boston Properties call and he has got a pretty stem view of the world economic situation. I think that\u2019s how most people think today. It\u2019s \u2013 things are pretty good in the U.S. but they could get a lot better hopefully and the rest of the world is challenged.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Yeah and that\u2019s exactly what I was getting at. So the Singapore listing would still be the long-term game plan but the timeline has changed.","Joel Marcus","Absolutely. We thought we could probably do it by 2014 now it\u2019s clearly a couple of years later but that is our goal because we think that\u2019s the most effective and efficient way and also represents the best liquidity path for our investment. And we\u2019ve got \u2013 we hope to do a tour there. I would say over the next 12 to 24 months and we welcome, I think you\u2019ll be blown away by the quality of what we\u2019ve done and the quality of our team, but clearly the pace of what we can do and how we can at just capital allocation wise and certainly now that we\u2019re in an investment grade company just have to be much more measured.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Understood. Well I look forward to the property tour.","Joel Marcus","Okay, excellent.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Thank you.","Operator","And at this time there no further questions in queue. And I will like to hand the call back over to Mr. Joel Marcus for closing remarks.","Joel Marcus","Okay. Well thank you. We\u2019re 67 minutes in call, so I appreciate your attention.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Paula Schwartz with Investor Relations. Ms. Schwartz, please go ahead.","Paula Schwartz","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The Company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel.","Joel Marcus","Thank you, Paula, and welcome everybody to the third quarter call for Alexandria. And with me today are Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia, Dean Shigenaga, Dan Ryan. The third quarter was an outstanding quarter by almost every financial and operating metric and particularly core operating metrics that were really stellar and Dean will talk more about that.","My congratulations to our entire Alexandria family and for each person\u2019s day-to-day, day in and day out operational excellence, which is what really makes it all happen. And also congratulations to the world-class accounting and finance team on their many years of hard work, resulting in our recent credit upgrade from Moody's, something very important.","And Moody\u2019s does focus on tenant quality and at Alexandria, it's one of our strongest characteristics of the Company. As you know from the earnings release, 52% of our annual rental revenue is from investment grade or large cap public companies. We are very proud that 79%, almost 80% of that revenue is from Class A assets in AAA locations, and about 60% of that is focused in Cambridge in San Francisco. Average lease term is about 8.6 years and 12.3 for top 20 tenants. So really a very strong and stellar core to the tenant base.","I want to just make a couple of comments on the industry for the quarter. Venture funding in life science continued at very strong pace over $7 billion in the third quarter, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of over $5 billion invested. And this is really a record breaking trend driven by increase in deal size and well established venture firms raising larger funds and deploying capital at a faster pace.","Something else that I think we are very fortunate, we had our 47th new drug approved on October 24, this year and the FDA has surpassed last year's 46th drug approval count and could be on pace to beat the all time record of 53 set in 1996. Strong bipartisan support resulted in legislation enacted to increase the National Institutes of Health. Overall funding, $2 billion to approximately $39.1 billion and we are very fortunate about that. I think that is one of the critical competitive advantages of the United States in the world of biomedical research.","We did have very strong legislation, bipartisan legislation passed to address the opioid crisis signed in a law by the President, in the recent past. And certainly the opioid crisis has been a scourge resulting in the death of over 64,000 people last year greater than those died in the entire Vietnam War, which is actually hard to fathom. And so all of us in the industry and particularly ourselves are focused on specific things we can do to advance that project forward and we'll give you more details on that in coming quarters.","Biotech IPO activity has been the strongest since 2014, approaching 50 certainly over the next couple of weeks and raising almost $5 billion during the first nine months. The NASDAQ biotech index has been down a bit recently due to the volatility this month with the markets as all of you know and we've seen certainly a flight of value and big cap safety.","And I think with that, I'm going to turn it over to Steve to comment on a number of operational aspects, then Peter and then back.","Stephen Richardson","Great. Thank you, Joel. Steve Richardson here. This afternoon I'll highlight the continued strong demand for Alexandria\u2019s highly differentiated Class A science and technology campuses and the country's leading innovation clusters.","Building on what Joel had mentioned about the life science capital markets, we did have 17 IPOs this quarter and this is just part of an overall strong demand context, really driving stellar leasing and financial results with increases this quarter of 16.9% in cash and 35.4% in GAAP, the highest in 10 years.","Drilling down to Alexandria\u2019s cluster markets, it's important to know that Alexandria has been a first mover in each of these markets, and as such as a dominant position with the highest quality campuses immediately proximate to the country's leading life science research institutions.","The Cambridge market remains extremely strong with 0.9% vacancy rate and demand spiking up from 2.2 million square feet last quarter to 2.8 million square feet this quarter with fiber requirements in excess of 200,000 square feet. The San Francisco region has a vacancy rate overall of just 3.0% and no availability in Mission Bay.","Demand remain strong in the region at 2.5 million square feet and as the trend has been for a number of years, life science companies are competing with tech companies for space and increasingly for talent as there were 17 tech requirements in excess of 100,000 square feet in the City of San Francisco alone and a total direct tech demand of 7.2 million square feet from San Francisco down to Palo Alto. San Diego's core, UTC and Torrey Pines submarkets are also very healthy with a direct vacancy of just 5.3% in steady demand of nearly 900,000 square feet.","Moving North, Seattle\u2019s life science cluster in the South Lake Union market remains very tight with just 1.6% vacancy and lab demand at 400,000 square feet. Research Triangle Park has also been a bright spot with a mix of AgTech and life science demand totaling 275,000 square feet. And finally, Maryland's come back, continues with an excess of 500,000 square feet of demand and 4.6 vacancy rate.","Looking at the continued constrained supply and healthy demand here, market rents continue to remain strong. We continue to have pricing pressure in the market. Cambridge is now at $80, plus triple net. New York City is in the mid-80s triple net. San Francisco, the mid to high-60s triple net, San Diego in excess of $50 triple net, Seattle similarly mid to high-50s triple net and Maryland in RTP north of $30 triple net.","Finally, as a key market takeaway, would really like to highlight that 68% of the renewals and releasing year-to-date or from early renewals. There was a sense of urgency in the market and that's enabling Alexandria and our teams to work collaboratively with its industry leading tenant roster and continue to drive meaningful rental rate growth.","With that, I'll hand it off to Peter.","Peter Moglia","Thank you, Steve. I'll spend the next few minutes updating you on our near-term pipeline touch on cap rates and address construction costs as they remain a major topic of interest. 2018 deliveries have 217,000 square feet in service and another 489,000 square feet with a cost to complete of $76 million will be delivered by the end of the year.","The 706,000 square feet total is close to stabilization with 96% of the space leased or under negotiation and is expected to stabilize at a 7% cash yield. Great leasing progress was made this quarter at our five laboratory drive project in RTP, which is now 51% leased and has another 47% of the space under negotiation. This is remarkable success considering the projects started only 15 months ago and was not expected to stabilize until 2019.","399 Binney in Cambridge were delivered by year-end and has all the space other than the retail under negotiation with a number of high quality venture capital backed companies, who will likely anchor a number of Alexandria projects in the years to come. This 174,000 square foot development in the heart of Kendall Square is projected to stabilize at 6.7% cash yield.","9625 Towne Centre Drive in the University Town Center submarket of San Diego remains on target to be delivered to investment-grade tenant Takeda in the fourth quarter at a 7% stabilized cash yield. The 1.1 million square feet to be delivered in 2019 with the cost to complete of $319 million is already 85% leased with another 6% under negotiation.","Major leasing progress was made at 1818 Fairview, renamed 188 East Blaine Street as of this quarter, which went from 24% leased are under negotiation in the second quarter to 62% buoyed by leases from high quality life science companies and institutions seeking a presence in Alexandria\u2019s Eastlake neighborhood headquartered at Lake Union.","The initial stabilized cash yield is projected to be 6.7% in a market where institutional assets have been trading in the low- to mid-4s. Seattle's life science ecosystem is rich with high quality institutions, such as the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the Infectious Disease Research Institute, and the University of Washington.","The area is preeminent in the fields of cancer, infectious disease and immunotherapy, but the pace of commercialization from the areas institutions has historically been slow. However, our deep relationships in ecosystem building are beginning to show results, as illustrated by the aforementioned success at 188 East Blaine and at 400 Dexter delivered last year.","We are confident that we will continue to capitalize on our long-term investment in the market, which dates back to 1996, which is why we recently added 701 Dexter to our asset base. It will allow us to develop up to 217,000 square feet of life science or tech space in South Lake Union in close proximity to the University of Washington Medical School and the Gates Foundation.","Now I will touch on cap rates. As at anytime during the cycle where we've seen the 10-year treasury rise, people's minds start to wander towards cap rates. We saw the 10-year break 3% barrier for the first time in almost 4.5 years in May, and although it's toggled above and below that market is averaged around 3% since then. As of today, we have not seen any contraction in cap rates for lab product that has traded during this time. In fact, it's been quite contrary.","Alexandria sold our interest in Longwood Center in Boston for a 4.7% cap rate to our partner [Clarion] at the end of the quarter. So a solid lab market given the presence of multiple Harvard-affiliated research hospitals, the Longwood medical area is inferior to Cambridge, so a mid-4 cap rate really illustrates the appeal of life science assets institutional buyers.","In addition to that trade, the sale of the LINX project, 490 Arsenal in Watertown is also an indicator of status quo, if not cap rate contraction as initial pricing guidance for this inner suburbs location was for a mid-6 cap rate and after multiple rounds with multiple bidders, it traded at a 5.4% cap rate in September.","I'll conclude my comments with an update on construction costs. In the first quarter, we noted that our 2018 and 2019 deliveries were insulated from the effects of tariffs because we have GMP contracts in place. Only a change in scope involving steel or aluminum could expose us and although we don't anticipate any scope changes, we have adequate contingency to cover any impacts of the tariffs we incur in.","In the first quarter, we reported that if we had re-priced those projects, including the impacts of the tariffs, we would have had an increase in total project costs of approximately 1%. We have updated that estimate and have moved it from 1% to 1.3% of total project costs and are including this impact in all of our escalation assumptions for new projects.","Likely a bigger threat to our development cost structure is labor shortages, caused by the last recession that removed a number of skilled workers from the market. Workers are coming back, but the shortages can impact our costs and schedule if we don't proactively manage them.","We've been doing just that by leveraging our deep relationships in all of our markets to ensure we always have the contractors A team and employ a number of processes such as bringing contractors into the planning process early, ensuring we have the labor lined up and all costs included in our underwriting.","With that, I'll pass it to Dean.","Dean Shigenaga","Thanks Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll briefly cover six topics. Our solid third quarter results, continued strong internal growth, our balance sheet and improving credit metrics, non-real estate investments, sustainability and our updated guidance for 2018.","Kicking off with the results. As we enter the fourth quarter of 2018, it's useful to look back over the past year and reflect on the strength and consistency of our execution by our entire team really quarter-to-quarter. The third quarter of 2018 also reflects continued strong execution.","Total revenues for the nine months of 2018 annualized were $1.3 billion, up 19% over the nine months of 2017 annualized. Cash NOI for the third quarter annualized was $867 million, up $162 million or 23% over cash NOI for the third quarter of 2017 annualized. We reported FFO per share diluted as adjusted at $1.66, up 9.9% over the third quarter of 2017.","We also reported continued and strong internal growth that reflects the strength of our real estate and life science industry fundamentals and our unique and differentiated business strategy. Occupancy remains very strong, up 20 basis points to 97.3% as of 3Q and up 50 basis points since the end of 2017.","San Diego occupancy of 94.2% reflects the anticipated lease expiration of 44,000 rentable square feet related to 4110 Campus Point Court that was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2017 with an in-place lease. We are currently reviewing various renovation options for this space.","In New York City, our occupancy was 97.2% and reflects the temporary vacancy as we transitioned 29,000 square feet to multiple tenants with 77% of this leased are under negotiation today. Our rental rate growth continues to remain very strong. Over the past four years, our rental rate growth on annual leasing activity has ranged from 20% to 28% on a GAAP basis and 10% to 15% on a cash basis.","Rental rate growth for the third quarter was 35.4%, as Steve had mentioned and represented the highest rental rate growth in the past decade and it was 16.9% on a cash basis, and overall reflective of the unique and strong real estate and life science industry fundamentals in our submarkets today.","Early lease renewals represented almost 70% of lease renewals and releasing a space for the first three months of 2018 and continue to drive growth in rental rates and cash flows. We are in excellent shape with 2019 contractual lease expirations, representing only 5.4% of annual rental revenue, 25% of which is already leased. Our same-property NOI growth for the third quarter was very strong, up 3.4% and 8.9% on a cash basis and overall in line with our guidance for the full-year of 2018.","Our team has successfully completed several strategic goals this quarter and continue to strengthen our balance sheet and our credit profile. Due to the ongoing strength of the private real estate market, we remain focused on strategic and disciplined execution of important real estate dispositions, including as Peter had mentioned, the sale of Longwood generating about $70 million of proceeds, net of debt repayment, and about a 4.7 cap rate.","We also are advancing a partial sale of the JV interest in a high value core property located in Cambridge. Importantly, we are expecting a lower cap rate than our prior sale in Cambridge, which was done at a 4.5 cap rate. We are still working through this transaction and we will provide our usual details once we complete the partial sale.","Keep in mind that over the past four years, including the partial interest sale, it's in process. We anticipate completing $1.5 billion in dispositions, averaging a highly attractive cost to capital in the 4% cap rate range. We also raised about $196 million under our ATM program during the quarter at a sale price of $127.66 per share.","As Joel had mentioned, we are very proud that we received our upgrade in our corporate credit rating from Moody's to Baa1\/Stable, which really highlighted our diversified portfolio of properties with consistently high occupancy and high quality tenants, many of which are less sensitive to economic cyclicality.","Also, it's important to note that S&P has a positive outlook on our BBB flat rating moving us along to our goal of continued improvement in our credit profile. We also extended a key source of liquidity for our balance sheet with important relationship lenders through the extension of the maturity date under our line of credit to 2024, increased available commitments by $550 million to $2.2 billion and improved pricing by 17.5 basis points to LIBOR plus 82.5% basis points. ","We also extended the maturity date under our $350 million unsecured term loan to 2024 and reduced pricing by 20 basis points to LIBOR plus 90. We repaid two LIBOR-based loans, aggregating $350 million, reducing unhedged variable-grade debt to 6% of total assets. We remain committed to continued improvement in our credit metrics each year, including our fourth quarter annualized net debt to adjusted EBITDA as our goal for 2019 and 2020 is to move closer to five times.","As Warren Buffett recently stated in his most recent annual shareholder letter, new accounting rules required us to recognize significant unrealized gains resulting in unusually high net income in the third quarter, which by the way, we exclude from FFO per share diluted as adjusted. It's important to recognize that our cost basis in these investments were approximately 4.4% of total assets as of 9\/30.","It's also key to recognize that realized gains of about $25.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, really have been driven primarily by liquidity or M&A related events versus management deciding to sell securities. We are on track for about $35 million in realized gains based upon the run rate for the first nine months, and this is higher than prior years, but really reflective of the quality of innovation in the life science industry today.","We'd like to thank Ari Frankel, our AVP of Sustainability & High Performance Buildings and our entire team for our GRESB Green Star designation and the number one ranking in GRESB\u2019s health and wellbeing module. We also want to thank our team for hosting GRESB\u2019s North America real estate results of that that the Alexandria Center for Life Science in New York City. We continue to execute on our goals making a positive and meaningful impact on the health, safety and wellbeing of our tenants, stockholders, employees, and communities in which we live and work.","Our team also remains focused on our environmental impact reduction goals for 2025, as recently highlighted in our inaugural corporate responsibility report. We updated our 2018 guidance for net income attributable to common stockholders on a diluted basis to a range from $4.34 to $4.36 primarily reflecting unrealized gains on non-real estate investments of $117.2 million and a realized gain on the sale of Longwood of about $35.7 million.","We also reaffirmed the midpoint of our range for 2018 guidance for FFO per share, diluted as adjusted of 60 at the midpoint and narrow the range from $0.06 to $0.02. The midpoint of $6.60 puts us on track for another strong year of execution by our best-in-class team with 9.6% growth over 2017.","As a reminder, we will hold our Annual Investor Day event on Wednesday, November 28 at the Alexandria Center for Life Science in New York City, where among other key items we will provide an overview of our detailed guidance and assumptions for 2019. We appreciate your continued interest in Alexandria and thank you in advance for waiting until Investor Day regarding detailed guidance assumptions for 2019.","Let me turn it back to Joel.","Joel Marcus","So if we could go to Q&A operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. Please go ahead.","Emmanuel Korchman","Hey, everyone. Just I don't remember that Dean or Joel mentioned this, but the JV in Cambridge, can you give us some details as to at all \u2013 as to what that building is or more specific geography and also just your thoughts behind the new JV at this point?","Joel Marcus","Yes, I think the answer to that is, no. We'll do it when we complete the transaction. And I think Dean can talk about the capital raising. We've always tried to think about multiple sources. And so this is one key source that we're growing up on at this point.","Dean Shigenaga","Yes, Manny, I would reiterate what Joel said. As I mentioned in my commentary over the last four years, about $1.5 billion in real estate dispositions, heavily weighted to high value, low cap rate assets, which when you blend in. So attractive, very attractive cost to capital and when you blend that in with the discipline issuance of common equity as well as tapping long-term debt from the bond market. I think we were actually hitting an attractive cost to fund projects that have given about 7% on a cash basis, so pretty consistent execution there.","Emmanuel Korchman","And then maybe you could give us updated thoughts on the New York market specifically in Long Island City with your entrance into that market and where you see yourselves building a larger cluster there, if this was one-off opportunity.","Joel Marcus","Well, I think if you look at our press release of October 18, we really tried to give a picture of our strategy in New York City, which is continuing to expand the current campus at the Alexandria Center by the North Tower, looking at upsizing that a bit.","Our acquisition of one of the Pfizer buildings on East 42nd and the acquisition in Long Island City really fits well with that. There is a ferry from Long Island City right to the East Side Medical Corridor. So I would view these as almost all of the same overall East Side Medical Corridor effort.","And I think as I said many quarters ago, we do view New York in a positive fashion, although it's fundamentally different than other markets. It doesn't have an established \u2013 there are no waiting line of tenants. It isn't an established market where large companies are likely to move.","You have to recruit individual units of larger companies and it's a much earlier stage efforts. So I think our footprint and our pipeline that we've announced really recognized those underlying factors. Each market is truly vastly different than the other and you can't treat them at all alike.","Emmanuel Korchman","And one quick one for Dean, I appreciate that you'll be giving full 2019 guidance at the Investor Day. But just in terms of the impact from lease accounting, it'll impact your numbers. Do you have early estimates on that that you could share?","Dean Shigenaga","Yes. Manny, I would say there's two things that I think probably have come up for most REITs. One is what you're referring to is the initial indirect leasing cost that under the new rules will be required to be expensed. And it looks like it's fairly insignificant to Alexandria, right about in that 1% of FFO per share.","And I think the other thing to consider is that we do have certain ground leases which as you probably know under the rules would be put on balance sheet. So we have roughly a $200 million gross up on our balance sheet for that. But I would say from a P&L perspective on net income or FFO per share, there's really no impact from changes under the new lease rules for ground leases.","Emmanuel Korchman","Thanks, everyone.","Operator","The next question comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Sheila McGrath","Yes. The gap in cash leasing spreads were significant this quarter. I was just wondering if that was across the Board or if there was one lease in a particular market that was driving that?","Peter Moglia","Yes. Sheila, I\u2019d say we had good strength across our markets and it's pretty consistent with what we've observed over the year. It\u2019s a full nine months as well as prior years, as we've always had really good strength on contractual expirations, and I think the early renewals have always been a pleasant surprise to cash flow growth.","Sheila McGrath","Yes. I think Peter mentioned that much of the leasing this year was early renewals. Can you give us a little bit more details there like do you expect this trend to continue?","Peter Moglia","Well, fortunately real estate fundamentals and the life science industry fundamentals are strong, so we're operating in a very solid environment. Our expirations are fairly modest going out year-to-year, but I would say what is happening, which is a real positive. Tenants are very nervous about space. They continue to come forward to early renew sometimes three plus years prior to their expiration. So we are reaching far out. I think from our perspective, Sheila, we're just trying to be balanced, because there is some upside in rental rate growth, so being patient while taking some off the table is kind of the approach we've been taking.","Sheila McGrath","And last question on investment gains. Unrealized investment gains for the quarter were significant and I know those don't impact FFO or anything, but I was just curious, was that driven by an IPO or just depreciation of existing holdings?","Peter Moglia","That was really across a broad set of investments, Sheila. So it's a good reflection of the appreciation of the quality of that portfolio.","Joel Marcus","And certainly \u2013 hey Sheila, it\u2019s Joel. There has been a strong IPO market this year, so some of that's reflected in there. And I think Dean mentioned in his prepared remarks that 2019 lease expirations of about 1.3 million square feet. Our annual rental revenue on that is about $41, and we've got, as Dean said, 25% pre-leased and another 12% in negotiation. So that gives you some idea of kind of how people are thinking about here we are in the third quarter of 2018 thinking about 2019 already. So I think that bodes well, generally well.","Dean Shigenaga","Yes. Sheila to expand on the question on investments, I'd say roughly spread across private and public, so you actually had a good appreciation in the quarter across the portfolio.","Sheila McGrath","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Thanks Sheila.","Operator","Next question comes from Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Please go ahead.","Thomas Catherwood","Thank you. Good afternoon. Just want to kind of follow-up on Manny's question about New York City. There's a number of groups that are involved and trying to kind of push the New York City life science cluster, including the city and state with a variety of incentives and proposals. So I guess, Joel, how do you view Alexandria's role in shaping the ecosystem in New York? And do the incentives that are being provided play any part in your capital allocation decisions?","Joel Marcus","Yes. That's a really good question. Maybe let me take them in somewhat reverse order. So there are a number of people in New York, some of whom are credible and some of whom are totally incredible, and lacking in credibility as well as being incredible. That are trying to push the life science industry as if it was Cambridge and it is not, it doesn't bear any resemblance to Cambridge.","New York grew up as a strong clinical market. It\u2019s very hospital based. It's got very good basic research. But commercial activity before we started back and when we won the RFP from Mayor Bloomberg was back in 2005. There was a single incubator up at Columbia that did \u2013 bunch of companies doing research other than that, it was all office. So you're starting from ground zero, it takes 25 years to build a legitimate cluster. This cluster will be different than San Francisco, different than Cambridge.","It's an early stage cluster. There will be some large companies who put units in, but it\u2019s one off, it\u2019s stepwise growth, it's not a hockey part growth, like some people are touting. How we have really worked and then I'll get to incentives. How we've worked with the city and the state and the components of the ecosystem is, there are four elements to build a cluster, you got to have a location. The Alexandria Center was chosen as really the key location.","And when we complete the North Tower, we will have 1.3 million square feet. You've got to have great science. They do have excellent science. You got to have great management teams for companies. That's a challenge. You have to import a lot of management. Certainly at the management level and at the development level, there are good researchers there. But that's an area that has to work on.","And then Venture Capital, it's taken eight years to date to try to build a decent Venture Capital base, which is now realizing coming to fruition. So it's a big effort and we've been clearly at the vanguard of that in always. When it comes to incentives, we have not relied on city and state incentives in the future.","The city does own the land we're on. And that was their contribution to the joint venture, but we put up all the capital. And I think the city and state incentives are helpful, but really not. They're not going to make the difference of bringing and growing the industry frankly. Sorry for the long winded answer.","Thomas Catherwood","No, quite \u2013 so just to move back. So LIC investments, so there was no incentives tied, you don't need any incentives to make that work?","Joel Marcus","None whatsoever.","Thomas Catherwood","Got it. And then kind of I guess for Steve and Peter, you mentioned some strength down in North Carolina. Obviously, some pickup and development leasing, but last quarter you also picked up roughly 100,000 square feet of development rights. This quarter you moved maybe 130,000 square feet into intermediate term developments. What are you seeing in terms of demand that's making you kind of more comfortable doing developments down there?","Stephen Richardson","Yes. So let me take that for a moment. So North Carolina has seen a downturn substantially in the life science industry over the last decade with Glaxo, really kind of \u2013 I wouldn't say closing, but a substantially reducing its footprint.","The market there is kind of spread out. There's a little bit in Durham, a little bit in other places, but we've chosen to focus on the research triangle region and we've also chosen to focus on what we call agricultural technology because we think that's going to be the next big wave.","Human health is really two components. One is fighting disease and the other is good nutrition. So at the next call, year-end in fourth quarter call, I'll get into more detail on our strategy there, but it's been primarily the result of our AgTech strategy down in North Carolina.","Thomas Catherwood","All right, thanks guys.","Joel Marcus","Thank you. ","Operator","The next question comes from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","Richard Anderson","Thanks. Good afternoon. So when you talk about early lease renewal activity, how would you compare the rollup that you get in the current year negotiations versus what you're doing for those tenants that are approaching you early? Is it a similar kind of rollup versus where you were at or is it something less or more?","Dean Shigenaga","Rich, it\u2019s Dean here. It's actually a little mix of everything as you would expect. I would say that early renewals that have a large benefit to cash flows is very specific to the lease. We have a handful of those that have been occurring every year for the last four or five years now. But we're still getting really nice mark-to-markets on average across the markets. And so there's a blend of what I call normal healthy mark-to-markets occurring today and then some half a dozen or more larger, really large steps in early results.","Richard Anderson","What do you define it as \u2013 where you define as normal?","Joel Marcus","By normal, I'd say call it right down the fairway of our guidance, so 10% on a cash basis.","Richard Anderson","Okay, what you\u2019d say, Joel?","Joel Marcus","No, go ahead.","Richard Anderson","Okay. As falling onto the mark-to-market sort of question, you had a nice lift versus where your guidance was last quarter yet? No change the same-store. Is it just that the, it's just not big enough. Part of the same-store pool? Or you running at the high end of the range now or how would you describe that that issue?","Joel Marcus","It's a little bit of both Rich. I just to put it into perspective, it takes quite a bit in steps to actually move or in a GAAP pickup because those are GAAP numbers or the cash numbers for that matter on the cash side and really drive same property results because 80% to 85% of our cash flows are operations actually go through the same property pool. But we are getting an overall benefit. It's just not reflected in the strong results.","Richard Anderson","Okay.","Joel Marcus","Yes, so Rich I was going to say, just a footnote to what Dean said. So in a place like Cambridge, again the reason there's so much demand like that and companies are not looking to go out throughout 128 or to the [birds] for much cheaper space is. The cost of rent as a percentage of their overall operation is not significant.","And the need to keep these companies in the mainstream, on transit, in good recruiting locations, et cetera, really outweighs cheaper rent in a more remote location. So I think that's the other reason you're seeing this kind of confluence of early renewal activity in some of Cambridge being maybe the best example.","Richard Anderson","Okay. And then when you look ahead, I know you're not going to give guidance right now and I'm not asking for that unless of course you want to acquiesce. But the mark-to-market number has been a pretty brilliant part of this story for quite a while now. As you look ahead and you see which markets are expected to show some of the disproportion amount of the exploration activity? Do you see sort of this type of growth continue perhaps not at this level, but I mean or is there some sort of shelf life to this that we should be aware of?","Joel Marcus","Well, just looking, if you go to Page 24 of the sup, the 2019 lease expirations, they're really well distributed in Greater Boston, San Francisco, San Diego, Seattle, a little bit in Maryland, so there's no overly burdensome concentration in one location. Then if you look at the annual rental revenues of those leases in place, relatively speaking, they're pretty low.","Richard Anderson","Yes. Okay, that's good. Thanks for pointing that out. And then lastly, just a modeling question for you, Dean. With the moving parts in the unconsolidated JV line, do you have an idea of where that should shake out on a sort of an annualized run rate basis putting aside anything that might happen in Cambridge in the near-term?","Dean Shigenaga","What Richard, I don't have that in front of me right now. So why don't we think about giving the market an update at Investor Day on that.","Richard Anderson","Okay. No problem. Thank you very much.","Dean Shigenaga","Thanks, Rich.","Operator","Next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jamie Feldman","Great. Thank you. I know at the outset of the call you talked about a very strong VC funding market, a very strong biotech IPO market. We've seen some volatility in the capital markets recently. I mean, how do we think about your business in a market where those two factors are not quite so strong? And how do you make decisions for the future based on that?","Joel Marcus","Well, I think that \u2013 if you go to my opening comment, Jamie, 52% of our annual rental revenue is investment grade or large cap public. That's actually where the money has flowed these days. So I think we feel pretty good. It would be \u2013 I think not a good thing if venture dried up and not a good thing if the IPO market shut down.","But if you think about Venture Capital and you go behind the numbers, there are a handful of funds that or handful of funds that have and are raising large, large amounts of money that some have closed and some will close over the next couple of quarters that will probably restock. And this is on the life science side, not the tech side, that will probably fund those entities to the tune of north of $2 billion.","So even if things became rougher in 2019, the amount of venture that will be available for investment over the coming years will be strong. And I think actually evaluations fall that'll even be better in a sense for investors in the private markets because it will be more attractive. But I don't think we're going to see any wholesale radical change over the next year or so.","Dean Shigenaga","Yes. And I would add, if you think back to pre-2013, the biotech IPO window was pretty much shut for about a decade and they were doing fine with liquidity events. And then today, biopharma has got a tremendous, with 75% or something of the topline revenue actually coming from products that have been sourced outside of pharma, which means biopharma is going to feel capital into the biotech industry to continue to grow their platform.","Joel Marcus","Yes, I think that's right. If valuations fall, pharma is going to get very acquisitive.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. All right. That's helpful. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Thank you.","End of Q&A","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks.","Joel Marcus","Thank you very much everybody and we'll look forward to talking to you on the fourth quarter and year-end call. Take care.","Operator","This conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"1423":["Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc.

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz. Please go ahead.","Paula Schwartz","Thank you, and good afternoon everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The Company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus. Please go ahead.","Joel Marcus","Thank you Paula, and welcome everybody to the first quarter Alexandria call and welcome everybody. And with me today are Dean Shigenaga, Peter Moglia, Steve Richardson, Tom Andrews, and Dan Ryan. And I want to open up as I always like to do to congratulate the entire Alexandria family for another strong quarter operationally and financially. Also want to recognize the passing of Rich Jennings a long time director of Alexandria, who passed on February 28th after our last earnings call. And Rich was such an important influent on the development of the company and we're going to miss him a lot.","Let me start right away. At a recent investment conference, I presented kind of key three -- three key takeaways for 2016. The first thing that our markets are continuing to stay rock solid with strong demand, a little bit or no supply, rents up over the past year about 15% and continuing high occupancy.","Secondly, our highly preleased value add pipeline, which will continue to drive growth in earnings and decrease in the leverage where we've also been able to achieve significant yields is really key takeaway two. And then number three would be fundamentals are really overtaking sentiment in the life science factor. And so far as the tactical ground level as I mentioned there are no cracks. Novel and innovative bio- pharmaceutical products will be the key to managing the cost of chronic disease.","The core quickly continued very strong performance in our urban innovation cluster markets. We have a strong 6.2% cash same store NOI growth, strong occupancy of $97.3 and continuing strong margins. On the leasing side again, in virtually all of our markets, very tight and we're seeing strong demand and good performance. We leased about 390,000 square feet this quarter, down from other quarters because we're having less space to lease due to high occupancy, at about 17% cash rent spreads, contributed heavily by Cambridge, San Francisco, Seattle and Research Triangle Park.","Important to keep in mind 52% of our total ABR this quarter from investment grade tenants, so very strong underlying credit to our cash flows. When we think about underlying tenant demand and tenant health, we see that that continues very strong. In the greater Boston area, 97.6% occupied and again very strong demand. We believe that 100 Binney and Longwood will be fully spoken forward here pretty quickly. On the San Francisco side, we're 100% occupied. We're continued to see strong life science and demand from credit tenants particularly, and also very strong tech demand and we're proceeding on our build-to-suites at various stages for Uber, Pinterest and Stripe, and as some of you know, Stripe was featured on 60 minutes on Sunday night.","In New York City we're moving to a 99 plus percent occupancy. Again, more demand there than we have space available. San Diego, we've got some roll. We're about 94.5% occupied but the Nodulus [ph] campus availability of 77,000 square feet I think will be fully spoken for here pretty momentarily. Seattle at 99.2% occupancy, again strong continuing demand from both the tech and life science sector. Maryland 95.9% occupancy, solid demand, better than we've see over the last decade, and in RTP were 98.6% occupied, very strong demand and most of the remaining space will soon be spoken for.","On the development asset side, we're pleased to be realizing NAV at this stage of the cycle on our 2016 deliveries. We're 90% leased, 95% leased or negotiating, and as we've indicated in the sup, we expect $75 million to $80 million of incremental annual NOI and yields generally, initial cash yields of generally 7% or north of that. Our 2017 and 2018 deliveries were up to 72% leased and 84% leased or under negotiation, and our estimated annual incremental NOI about 120 to 130. And that's been increased due to Vertex build-to-suite in San Diego, again initial cash yields averaging about 7 plus percent.","With respect to the life science industry, a recent report by United Health Foundation concluded that an astonishing -- this number is truly astonishing, 72%, almost three quarters of American have at least one of the five most impactful unhealthy behaviors. So pay attention here; smoking, physical inactivity, insufficient sleep, excessive drinking or obesity. And these combine to be the primary contributing -- among the primary contributing factors to extraordinary rise and continuing increase in healthcare costs. Self-discipline and smart wellness and prevention could make huge inroads in managing these healthcare costs, also innovated by biopharmaceutical products which changed the face of disease, ease suffering, create happier and healthy lives and extent lives, clearly are part of the answer here.","And then finally before I turn it over Dean, who is going to take a deep dive on the balance sheet, I'd like remind everybody that bio demand for our assets is strong and we expect to continue to recycle assets to fund our first-in-class development pipeline. I think you'll see continued announcements, probably in the June time factor and Dean can highlight a little more about that.","So, I'll turn to Dean Shigenaga","Dean Shigenaga","Thanks Joel, Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everybody. Again I've got three important topics to highlight today. First, consistent execution and strong results, driven by solid fundamentals, continued asset recycling, and then lastly our funding strategy and prudent management of our balance sheet. Starting with our consistent execution, quarter to quarter and year-to-year, really driven by our unique business strategy and solid fundamentals in our best-in-class team. As Joel had highlighted, fundamentals remain solid, both for our business and the life science industry.","Rental rate growth was very strong, up 33.6% and 16.9% on a cash basis. Tenants continue to evaluate early lease renewals one to two years prior to their contractual lease exploration date. And as a reminder, we are operating in a very supply constrained and strong rental rate environment. Same property cash NOI growth continued its strong trend with cash NOI growth of 6.2%. Key drivers include our triple net lease structure and high quality tenant roster which drives quality and stable cash flows, and contractual annual rent escalations approximating 3% per year drives consistent growth in cash flows.","Occupancy was very solid at quarter end at 97.3%. Continuing into our ongoing asset recycling program, we have three categories of funding for 2016, excluding debt funding from construction loans and the unsecured bond market. At the midpoint of our guidance for 2016, we have approximately $630 million of capital needs, primarily for our accretive development pipeline, and this is beyond debt, including $350 million of real estate dispositions, $154 million for acquisitions and $125 million of other capital and\/or sales of equity investments.","At a very high level, we have identified approximately one quarter of this $630 million, primarily related to the announcement of our plans to monetize our real estate investments in Asia. We also have identified another one half of our $630 million target, and these sales are at various stages, including one key joint venture deal that should be under LOI shortly.","Since these transactions are in process and have not reached the criteria for classification as held for sale, we have limited information we can share today, but do plan to provide detailed disclosures as appropriate in the future. This leaves us with about one fourth to one third of the $630 million to identify ourself over the next couple of quarters. So we feel good about where we are in early 2016 with our funding outlook for the year.","Turning to Asia, on April 22nd, the Company committed to the monetization of its investments in Asia over the next 12 months, and obtained approval from our Board of Directors to proceed accordingly. Our cash deals and our investments in India were reasonable and generally in the 10% to 12% range. However, we\u2019ve recognized impairment charges in March and April aggregating $181.9 million, including consideration of foreign currency exchange losses of $49.8 million.","We believe this highlights a unique situation of real-estate generating solid yields with high quality multinational credit tenancy, the names of Novartis, Glaxo and others. However, valuations today in these developing international markets do not appropriately value these attributes. More importantly, we believe it's prudent to move forward with the recycling of this capital for investment into higher value Class A developments in our key urban innovation clusters.","Our estimate of proceeds from sales is just north of $100 million, and we expect to complete these sales over the next 12 months in up to seven to 10 different transactions. As of today, we completed the sale of one land parcel at a price of approximately $7.5 million. While we have no other binding sale agreements today, certain investments are under review by potential buyers. As we advance each transaction, we will provide appropriate detailed disclosures.","It's important to note that our detailed balance sheet and operating information disclosures on page 51 of our supplemental package. There you will find disclosures of our operating results that reflect our investments in Asia generated an FFO loss of approximately $53,000 for the first quarter of 2016. As a result, the sale of Asia is the equivalent of the sale of land, and will generate important capital for investment into our highly leased development pipeline with cash yields of approximately 7%.","So moving on to our prudent management of our balance sheet, I just want to start with our at the market program, what we issued in the first quarter and our plans going forward. During the first quarter, we raised about $25 million under our at the market offering program and used the proceeds to improve our all in balance sheet leverage, including preferred stock. We repurchased open market transactions of approximately $23 million at par value of outstanding 7% Series D preferred stock. As of March 31st, we have about $214 million of Series D outstanding, down from the $250 million initially issued.","Our repurchases to-date have been executed at prices of less than $28 per share. We believe the use of a modest amount of equity capital to retire a portion of this 7% convertible preferred security in the first quarter was prudent. While it's still attractive to retire additional Series D preferred stock at market pricing today, the price of Series D has been tracking the movement of our common, and lately has been trading just north of $30 per share.","So our decision to use equity raised at $88.44 per share in the first quarter to repurchase Series D at $27.49 per share resulted in roughly 5% less common shares required versus executing the repurchases of Series D today at a price of roughly $30 per share with our common stock today trading in the low to mid-$90 range. Purchases to-date, over two quarters have been completed at prices roughly neutral to FFO per share and positive to all in leverage.","Our 2016 guidance assumes no further purchases of our 7% Series D convertible preferred. However, we will continue to look for opportunities to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time. Going forward, our strategy is to continue to focus on ongoing growth and FFO per share and net asset value and remain disciplined in funding growth through our highly leased development pipeline with various sources of long term capital.","Turning to leverage; our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 7.4 times for the current quarter annualized, 7.2 times for the trailing 12 and was in line with our expectation. We are on track to improve net debt to adjusted EBITDA and hit our range of 6.5 times to 6.9 times by year-end, and this is on a current quarter annualized basis. We are also focused on improvement in our net debt plus preferred to adjusted EBITDA as shown by our $23 million reduction in our 7% convertible Series C preferred stock, with proceeds from our ATM program. We also remain focused on the ongoing improvement in both of our investment grade credit rating and our long-term cost of capital.","Lastly, a few other highlights. We\u2019ve had very limited debt maturities till 2018. We anticipate $150 million to $200 million reductions in 2016 related to outstanding borrowings under our unsecured term loan, with a maturity date in 2019. Additionally, we are in the process of extending the maturity date of our unsecured line of credit from 2019 to 2021, reducing pricing by 10 basis points and further extending the weighted average remaining term of outstanding debt. We have significant liquidity, which we believe reduces risk and allows us to be patient and flexible with the timing of capital events. As of quarter end, we had about $2 billion of liquidity including a $304 million secured construction loan that we closed in April of 2016. This loan will provide significant funding for the construction of 183 Binney Street in Cambridge, anchored by Bristol, Myers Squibb, again a very high quality global bio-pharma company. ","We executed additionally interest rate swaps aggregating $500 million, and we continue the disciplined management of our value creation pipeline and are on track to further reduce our pipeline as a percentage of gross real estate towards the 10% range by the end of the year. We also continue the disciplined allocation of capital into our value creation pipeline, averaging 90% leased for deliveries expected this year, 81% leased overall, inducing primarily deliveries in 2017 and one project that will be delivered in 2018.","In closing with guidance, the detailed assumptions underlying our guidance for 2016, are included on Page 6 of our supplemental package. And just want to remind everybody, our unique business model focuses on class A assets and triple A locations in urban innovations clusters, and continues attract some of the most highly innovative and successful companies. Additionally with our best in class team, we look forward to consistently executing and delivering growth in FFO per share and net asset value, quarter-to-quarter and year-to -year, while we also improve our credit profile and long term cost to capital.","With that I\u2019ll turn it back to Joel. ","Joel Marcus","Thanks Dean and, operator, you can open up lines for Q&A please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question does come from line of Manny Korchman with Citi.","Manny Korchman","Joel, maybe I'll turn this one to you. There have been concerns about some of the higher technology markets, mostly on the West coast but sort of around the country. What are you seeing from tenants and maybe especially, what you're seeing from their financial sponsors and how they're thinking new space and expansions?","Joel Marcus","Are you talking about tech tenants?","Manny Korchman","Both on the tech, for you guys both on the tech and life science if you would?","Joel Marcus","Well think on the life science side, we\u2019re seeing a continuation of what we've seen, certainly over the last number of years, and that is both high quality credit tenants moving into the clusters, establishing bases and continuing to expand. A great example is our Bristol Myers, at a 100 Binney bringing a footprint into Cambridge, IBM Watson recently coming into our, part of our 751-125 Binney, I think there is no shortage on the life science side. Because of the nature and the DNA and the ecosystem, they want to be in the best cluster locations. And I think it\u2019s clear that Cambridge, San Francisco and South San Diego, Seattle, New York city remain the top spots for those clustering on the tech-side. Maybe I\u2019ll ask Steve to give some off data, a bit in the bay area. ","Steve Richardson","Hi Manny it\u2019s Steve. We do continue to see a healthy, it\u2019s not historic demand. We\u2019re tracking about 6 million square feet in the San Francisco market. Right now we\u2019ve got six tenants looking for more than a 100,000 square feet, 23 tenants looking for more than 50,000 square feet. We\u2019ve got a vacancy rate in some of 3.7%. You had a number of sublease transactions that reduced the sublease space to about 1.6 million in the market, which is right where we were at the beginning of 2015, with great tenants taking additional space and expanding. So we see it healthy on both sides. We just add to the life science, in particular in a bay area, you saw the recent announcement with Stemcentrx bring purchased by AbbVie, in excess of $10 billion and a very public pursuit of medivation, which is in our Mission Day building in Illinois by Sanofi. So very healthy capital markets on the life science side for sure. ","Manny Korchman","Great thanks, and Dean, maybe one for you, when you think about sort of the volume of the ATI measurements in the press data, what criteria do you put out there to figure out how much ATM to do or how much pref to retire?","Dean Shigenaga","Manny, the challenge I think with Series D is the -- it's a very institutionally held security. There is probably a little bit of retail in there but, I think what I've shaken lose to date has been primarily retail, and the institutional ownership is probably fairly sticky. And so as a result I thank most of the activity will be relatively small as we can unwind and in an institutional position. So it\u2019s more dependent on that Manny, and when we saw pricing dip into the sub $28 range, we felt it was prudent to try to tap some. It\u2019s still attractive as today\u2019s pricing. We'll see were we end up over time, because I think we'd like to unwind a little bit as we go. ","Operator","And our next question does come from line of Kevin Tyler with Green Street Advisors. ","Kevin Tyler","Joel, can you take us through the process a little bit, fall around Manny\u2019s question, when you're deciding between tech and life science tenant, if both are interested in one year spaces, do you find you get more of a network effect perhaps from the tech tenants today, given you have a higher concentration on the lab side?","Joel Marcus","Well, I think the answer to that and maybe the Uber land at Mission Bay was a good example. I think we for many years believed that Mission Bay would become an intersection of life science and technology, in that campus area and certainly because of the synergies between the two, but it wasn\u2019t until Uber really intersected with us, did that really become a reality. And I think having done Uber really opened up the, I think what we, what our capabilities where as a company and the execution and skill and capabilities as we began to expand our Mission Bay into the summer [ph] area. So I think to me, that\u2019s a great example of that happening on the ground. ","Kevin Tyler","Okay. And if you were choosing like for like though, at this point, would your preference still be for life sciences or if you had similar terms -- maybe it\u2019s a difficult question to answer, but I guess if you had two high quality tenants, how do you think about one versus the other life sciences?","Joel Marcus","Yes. Well good example is that very issue at Mission Bay on those parcels. There was a multi-national pharma that had -- that\u2019s actually current client that had expressed substantial need for space. But it's inability to take all of the space totaling almost approximately 500,000 square feet and moving at a very rapid speed, really I think hindered its ability to compete with Uber. So I don\u2019t think so much it's an either\/or except in unusual cases, but where it\u2019s happened, I think you have to look to what you can get the best execution. Obviously you have to look a credit terms of deal and so forth. There\u2019s so many aspects. But I think that\u2019s a good case study comparison, because it actually happened in a life science dominated market at Mission Bay.","Kevin Tyler","Okay, thanks. And then Dean, have you seen the market for construction financing? Based on recent experience in Cambridge, it looked like plus 200 terms for the construction loan at Page Street were bit wider than deals in the recent past, but I was just curious if you\u2019re seeing the lending standards tighten up a bit.","Dean Shigenaga","I\u2019d say we've seen very good reception to construction financing, given the quality of the real-estate that we\u2019ve been putting to the market for construction financing. I think the pricing on this transaction is more reflective of the nature of the relationship we're establishing with the new lender. It\u2019s a pretty typical down the fairway of what they focus in on. There was an opportunity to tackle a very large financing opportunity. Typically, if we work within our bank group, I think pricing would be closer to what we achieved previously in the L plus 150 range. But I think we also have technology -- the regulatory environment today, it\u2019s changing and putting some pressure on pricing with financing from banks, and I think construction loans fall into that category. So I\u2019m a little off on the market there. We were really focused on building a new relationship with a premier lender to help provide large project financing.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Dave Rodgers with Robert W. Baird.","Dave Rodgers","Maybe Joel, I just want to start with you and you can farm it out if you want. Two questions on leasing in the quarter. I think you indicated in the supplement, four leases really impacted the spreads in the quarter. I don\u2019t know if you can provide any details on that, in terms of who or where, but that might be interesting. And then I guess the second one on leasing in the quarter, did you contemplate going direct without the bet, or was there was something about that sublease that didn\u2019t make sense?","Joel Marcus","Yes. So I\u2019ll maybe do the first one. I\u2019ll ask Steve to address the second. So on the leases that drove our leasing stats, Cambridge and San Francisco were the most contributory, as I mentioned and then Seattle and RTP also were contributory. But I think Cambridge and San Francisco certainly won that day. With respect to the sublease, Steve you can give a bit of background.","Steve Richardson","Hi Dave, it\u2019s Steve. Yes, they had towards a market, we were certainly involved in every step of the process and really active in partnership with Amgen. But ultimately from a transaction structure perspective, it made a lot more sense to stay in a sublease situation. So we\u2019ve acted as a very proactive facilitator in the transaction, have a nice direct relationship but from a transaction structure, it just made sense to go the sublease rout.","Dave Rodgers","Great thanks for that. And then maybe the 2017 expirations that now show up in the supplement, two bigger groupings of expirations for \u201917 I guess in San Diego and in Cambridge. I don\u2019t know if Tom wants to comment or Joel you can throw in there. And big or large blocks of space coming up that we need to watch for and a fairly low percentage so far of already negotiated or anticipated leases. So do we expect a lot more leasing activity that need to be done for those spaces as we go into \u201917.","Joel Marcus","Tom, you could talk you about 400 tech and 200 tech square.","Tom Andrews","Yes. So both 400 tech and 200 tech square, where we have some significant expirations, we're already very actively discussing pretty much all of what's scheduled to come available next year. In 200 tech it's pieces of the Novartis premises, and we are actually very close to batting up a lease transaction that will take that space out of play. And then in 400 tech square we have one particular tenant with a calendar 17 expiration who has an extension right and they've asked for a couple more months to exercise that right, because they have a significant milestone to achieve or not. If they achieve it, they may need more space, if they don\u2019t achieve it, they'll stay in the space and extend. So we're very comfortable, given the leasing activity in Cambridge with a near to zero vacancy rate that we'll have no difficulty at all releasing that space if the company actually exits.","Joel Marcus","And Tom, do you want to comment on the other one, 215 first, we've get a role on 36,000 would come.","Tom Andrews","Yes, that one we are in negotiations with the three or so different parties right now. In terms of who might fit best in that, it's very interesting in each situation. Cambridge right now, we have -- in virtually every space that becomes available, there are multiple perspective tenants and it's a matter of winnowing through the through the most suitable and then trying to strike the transaction that's most appropriate for the landlord advancing our [indiscernible]. So I think we again don\u2019t have any worries at all about getting that property re-leased.","Joel Marcus","Yes, other that's of note, Steve again of 1,500.","Steve Richardson","Yes, and Dave maybe to provide broader context at the offset here, we're seeing very active pipeline early renewals. We've completed about a 180,000 square feet of 2017 and 2018 renewals. The one Joel referenced specifically, we are trading papers. So it's beyond just discussions. We expect that to have that completed the next quarter. And we've got another 100,000 feet beyond that where we're in active discussions for early renewals as well. So pretty strong trend.","Operator","And our next question thus come from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jamie Feldman ","I guess just first housekeeping. When during the quarter did you guys raise the equity?","Joel Marcus","It was overtime Jamie. I don\u2019t -- it was relatively small.","Jamie Feldman ","It was over the course of the quarter?","Joel Marcus","Pretty much.","Jamie Feldman ","Okay. And then can you -- looking at the investments on the balance sheet, it looks like the balance has come down since the last quarter. Is that a change in valuation or did you sell some? How do we think about the move?","Joel Marcus","A little bit of both, but as you know, the valuation of Biotech and life science generally have been moving around quite a bit I would say that it did Jeff -- as of March 31st, it recovered about a month later and it's scaled back a tad. So net-net there has been decent movement, just from a valuation perspective, and it's purely the publicly traded securities we're discussing. We did realize about 11 million of proceeds during the quarter. So we did have some of the gains during the quarter, but the bulk of it had just to do with the changes in stock price. I would say as Steven mentioned there is healthy activity in the market, broadly, some of which includes our underlying investments and I would guess that in the near term you'll see some large mark-to-markets coming into the public portfolio soon.","Tom Andrews","Yes, if you look at page 52 of the sup, you get a snapshot of what we have publicly, and at the moment our net unrealized gains are about 3x of our cost. And then out of the private side as Steve mentioned, we have made an early investment in a company called Stemcentrx which occupies East Jamie Court and that return could be as high as 25.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then as we think about your future development pipeline, any kind of early thoughts on what you might start relatively soon?","Steve Richardson","Well I think if you go to page of the sup, we've kind of expanded at page 41, our key future projects and we try to give a little bit of context with some renderings et cetera. We don\u2019t have any plans at the moment I think as I said last quarter to initiate any new developments. We did obviously move vertex to active, but at the moment our pipeline is strong, it's full, it's highly leased and we don\u2019t see any reason to start any new projects.","Jamie Feldman","Or as you think ahead to next year and your growth prospects and the strength of your markets, do you think you would start as many projects in 2017 as you did in 2016?","Joel Marcus","If you come to Investor Day, I'll tell you.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. You're going to make we wait that long.","Joel Marcus","Of course.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then you made some pretty positive comments that 100 Binney, not a loose campus, pretty well committed. Can you just give some more color there?","Joel Marcus","Well I think in Nodulus [ph], Dan, you could give a little color on what\u2019s the activity there. It's been very strong.","Dan Ryan","Hey Jamie, it's Dan. Yes, we\u2019ve been really pleased. We just signed a letter of intent with a major Japanese firm to take roughly 30,000 square feet of a 35-65 building. So that will only leave about 10,000 square feet there. And we executed a letter of intent on Friday with an existing tenant to expand and take the 25,000 square feet of availability there. So we\u2019ll be 100% here in the next 30 days or so.","Joel Marcus","And Tom maybe comment on activity on 100 Binney, which seems to be these days pretty extraordinary actually.","Tom Andrews","Yes. We\u2019re down to the short strokes on approximately 110,000 square foot lease with a public biotech company that's in the Cambridge market currently. And it has a lease expiration that they need to deal with. So that\u2019s moving toward completion. And then we have on the balance of the space which is about 110,000 square or 2.5 floors, we\u2019re starting to see more and more activity, even though the space is going to be deliverable for -- until really or occupied until really calendar '18. And it's interesting that we\u2019re seeing 30,000 and 40,000 square foot requirements nearly two years out from occupancy date requesting proposals from us. So as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re sorting through and trying to figure out the best prospects to engage with and that will play out over the next several months.","Joel Marcus","Yes. I would also put a footnote on that. Bristol-Myers has half the building. The other half is still uncommitted, in various stages of discussions et cetera. But we\u2019ve been told that we will have likely two credit tenant RFPs for as much space as we can provide them. So there is no shortage of demand in the market for that building. And there is no competitive first in class project coming to fruition at the moment.","Operator","And our next question does come from the line of Sheila McGrath with Evercore.","Sheila McGrath","Joel, I was wondering if you could give us an idea of how the rents at 75-125 Binney compare to 100 Binney now a couple of years later, and how the construction costs have moved? How the rents look then and now, and then constructions?","Joel Marcus","Yes. So I'm going to maybe give an opening. Then I\u2019ll let Tom talk about it. But I think it's fair to say we did reach a high watermark when we signed ARIAD back a couple of years ago, and I think today we\u2019ll be reaching a new high watermark with 100 Binney. But I\u2019ll let Tom discuss the comparison of both and some of the construction cost situations.","Tom Andrews","I think Sheila, the rents have moved. I don\u2019t have a figure directly in front of me. But about $10 a square foot on a GAAP basis so the average rent over the term from when we struck a deal with ARIAD to where we are right now, I would say that we have offered -- and able to offer somewhat less dollars in TI allowance for the -- in connection with that increased rent. So, again if you adjust it for TI dollar commitment, it's an even better move up.","In terms of the cost, I think some people -- I saw some comment related to the extent of particularly 100 Binney, and one thing to recognize there is in the Bristol-Myer, situation where we have a landlord build, we do have to carry the cost of the tenant\u2019s investment over and above the TI allowance as part of the basis and the property. So I think you see high number there because of that, more than anything else. Although construction costs have been increasing, I would say they have -- they certainly have not increased faster than rents have.","Sheila McGrath","And then just on 75-125 Binney, there was some talk in the market that ARIAD looks to put more sublease space back to market. Is there any update there?","Tom Andrews","We have heard various things. They are building out nearly -- I\u2019d say over 75% of the space that they are leasing and they're nearing completion with that build out, leasing about 25% of their direct space, and this is exclusive of the IBM Watson space. So this is about 215,000 square feet that they have not subleased. They\u2019ve been building out that space. The current information we have from them is that they intend to occupy but they are -- we know that they are entertaining some discussion with sub-tenant prospects, particularly on the non-build out portion of the space.","Sheila McGrath","Okay. One last quick one on, any thoughts on 1 Kendall Square? I think that was hitting the market for sale, if there is any update there? And if you had any interest in the property?","Joel Marcus","Yes, we've seen the flier and that\u2019s all we seen. So we don\u2019t know much more than that at the moment.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question does come from line Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.","Rich Anderson","Just a quick one on San Diego. Has there been any additional thought about looking Downtown, or is there any the first kind of firm up the role, and point north before you would even consider that type of move?","Joel Marcus","Yes, maybe I'll open that and then ask Dan to comment. I think we see that there is still a lot to do as you can tell by our activity up in Torrey Pines and University Town Center, centers the Alumina campus, the Campus Pointe campus. So we have our hands pretty well occupied with a lot of moving parts and that trying to capture as much as the quality demand in that market as we see. I think we've certainly paid attention to what's going on Downtown but I don\u2019t think that it is necessarily as ready for prime time as some of the other locations if you look at the Mission district in San Francisco or some of the early activities. I don\u2019t think you see them at the same level but Dan, you can comment on me ground.","Dan Ryan","Yes. I think Joel summarized that pretty well. We have been looking around down there quite a bit. I email Joel every other week with a new idea, most of which I get a no, but we think that long term there is a probably natural extension for what we're doing down there but it's probably midterm out four, five years before we probably pull the trigger or something like that.","Rich Anderson","Can you comment on the stuff where he said yes?","Joel Marcus","I've never said yes.","Dan Ryan","Mostly I just get a note back saying will you lease the Lilly space and quit bothering me.","Rich Anderson","And then a broad -- a bigger picture question, talking about not adding to the development effort at this point, with kind of a to choose from later on. What is your comfort level in the next three or four years of the development pipeline as a percentage of your total assets?","Joel Marcus","Yes, I think as Dean mentioned our target has been, and this also for our desire to upgrade to -- get upgraded to BBB plus rating, somewhere in the 10% to 15% range, and I think the Dean on your end our target is.","Dean Shigenaga","Yes, we're hoping to be closer to the 10% number by the end of this year.","Operator","And our next question is a follow up question from the line of the Manny Korchman for Citi.","Michael Bilerman","Its Michael Bilerman. Joel, the Company's efforts to go global clearly didn\u2019t pan out, I think the way you sort of envisioned many years ago. Is there sort of any circumstances, or any scenarios that you could foresee yourself trying to do it again, or has this sort of experience now, sort of made you completely focus on the U.S.?","Joel Marcus","Thanks Michael, I think that that\u2019s true. I think the U.S. market has come a long way in the decade since we started in Asia and Europe back in kind of the '05, '06 range. I think there was a feeling that India and China would hold half the world's population and could be really great markets. I think some day they will be, but they are still I think too early for prime time. And you can tell. As Dean mentioned, we have almost $50 million in currency losses. I think it's hard for companies in the real estate sector to focus heavily on overseas operations. I think that, that given our footprint, given our high quality, really amazing campus locations and tenants, there is no reason now to think about overseas, whether it be Europe or Asia. But if you go back pre-crash, those were pretty interesting markets and I think the markets here in the United States, we're still in the process of evolving, but they've come an awfully long way in that decade.","Michael Bilerman","So what we need to change, either internationally in the U.S. for you to -- look there is currencies, there is political, there's so many other risks out there than going global, let alone just the time and the effort -- of your time and efforts, and your team's time and effort in making it matter. So could you envision a scenario where we could be talking about doing this again, or is it just completely off the table?","Joel Marcus","Yes, I think it's completely off the table. I think that over the next medium the longer term we look at newer markets in the United States, because there are markets here that are interesting, but again maybe not ready for prime time. Think about New York where we won RFP back in 2005, and here we sit a decade later with a campus. But these efforts are literally a decade long effort, and we worked hard, not only things you guys see in the supplement, but an amazing amount of work at the cluster level, to really bring those clusters along. So I think there is no way that I could see, foresee going overseas again. I think it would be expansion in the United States. ","Michael Bilerman","Right. And then just I don\u2019t know if you have it handy, but outside of the impairment charges that were taken this quarter, do you sort of have, a sort of total U.S. dollars invested internationally, whether it was China, India, Scotland, Canada and any other R&D market, sort of the total expensed dollars that you invested, and ultimately what you expect U.S. dollar wise to get back just to sort of get at the financial sort of, go around?","Joel Marcus","So well, I think in Scotland we acquired options on land, that we\u2019re able exit that land and recoup our investment, and I think make some money from that. In Terrano we obviously were involved in the March project early on and we structured that and we reported our exit from there and what happens. So I think that\u2019s -- those two have been fully disclosed. We haven\u2019t really done anything else outside of China and India, and I think China and India are pretty well documented in the supplement. So there is nothing else out there that I\u2019m aware of.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions in the queue. I would like turn the call back over to management for any closing comments.","Joel Marcus","Okay, thank you very much. We closed early and we appreciate your time and a busy earning season. We'll talk to you for the second quarter. Thanks everybody.","Operator","Thank you very much. Ladies and gentleman that all concluded conference for today. I do thank you for participation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time."],"1574":["Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc.

Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Lisa and I\u2019ll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and please note that today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Paula Schwartz. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Paula Schwartz","Good morning. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","I now would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus. Please go ahead.","Joel Marcus","Thank you, Paula and welcome everybody to our second quarter earnings call. And with me today actually here in New York City is Dean Shigenaga, Tom Andrews, Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia, Dan Ryan and John Cunningham. And I want to extend a congratulations to the entire Alexandria family for a very strong second quarter performance really in all respects.","I think the key themes for the second quarter revolve around a strong core internal growth performance, successful early deliveries of our development pipeline with strong yields, continuing strong health of our tenant base and really a truly superb execution of our capital plan. So let me move to a couple of macro themes if I can.","It's hard to imagine, but today, there are approximately 10,000 diseases that we've identified that afflict humanity and we've only addressed about 500. So we're still literally in the very early innings of our quest for prevention, treatment and cure of dreaded diseases and this battle is mission-critical for humanity. Really an answer to that challenge, there is very significant R&D investment that continues to drive innovation and demand on a global basis, $145 billion of global biopharma R&D, $38 billion of US government funding heavily at the NIH, $11 billion of US venture capital and $30 billion of philanthropic money. So the total now exceeds $200 billion for R&D, quite a stellar dedication of resources, which in all respects end up really helping our business in a material manner.","Our high barrier to entry urban cluster markets remain rock-solid. If you look at the continuing strong demand, we see that in virtually every market today with highly constrained supply, which is obviously a very good thing. Rents are up on average about 15% over the past year and we\u2019re continuing to see and maintain high occupancy. If you look at the Cambridge cluster market and Tom will be available during Q&A, current supply is about 429,000 square feet of vacancy for lab, today's demand is something around north of 2 million square feet, with about 40 tenants focused on Cambridge, and based on recent forecast of brokers in the market for laboratory, they\u2019re forecasting rents in 2018 for lab to be $80 to $85 triple net.","Alexandria is blessed with a unique business model. Our strong internal growth in core is, I think, well known and driven heavily by 96% of our leases have annual steps and many of those are 3%. Our performance this quarter on rental rate increases 27.1 on a GAAP and 9.3 on a cash. Certainly were, I think, very important to the company and key drivers included Cambridge, San Francisco and Research Triangle Park. And as I said last quarter, we\u2019re seeing and Dean may comment further, in 2016, we\u2019re continuing to see tenants aggressively seek us out to extend their lease terms, which roll in future years where they have no options and that\u2019s something that clearly, it will start benefit for internal growth purposes.","We\u2019re seeing slight occupancy gains since we\u2019re at pretty high occupancy today at 97% and we\u2019re seeing very -- solid same property performance, Dean will comment further, 4.9 and then 6.4 on a cash basis. One of the most important attributes every investor should note is that ARE\u2019s great current strength, 53% of our annual base rent is from investment-grade tenants, here in 2Q of \u201816, 82% of our top 20 are investment-grade with lease durations of approximately 8.4 years. So we've got a great runway for solid, consistent and safe cash flows.","Turning to external growth, Alexandria's business model, a unique business model, has been simplified by strong external growth. We have, as you know, a strong, highly leased, development pipeline, driving that growth, and as set forth in the sub and in the press release, our CIP for the second half will deliver approximately 1 million square feet, which is today 90% leased, targeting NOI of somewhere between 51 million and 56 million and in 2017 and the early part of 2018, 2 million more square feet, approximately 74% pre-leased with NOI onboarding and at that point of about 130 million to 140 million. So a total of well north of 3 million square feet.","We had three successful deliveries in the second quarter and Dean will comment on that, New York, Illumina and Longwood, with very strong yields and we've hit a 7% yield on our New York developments, so great kudos to the New York team. Leasing has stayed strong and we did indicate new starts far Vertex in San Diego and a parking garage for Illumina. With respect to our major acquisition during the quarter and Tom will be around to answer questions here during Q&A, we did sign a purchase and sale agreement to acquire One Kendall Square and we believe that the location of that campus and the attributes of that campus present exactly what we would want when looking for external growth through acquisitions, which we typically don't make many of, seven buildings aggregating almost 645,000 square feet, 98.5% occupancy. ","We think we can move those, the yield on this project to potentially the mid-sixes over the next couple of years. We think that allocating capital to the world's leading life science cluster sub market and Cambridge is a smart thing to do, and it gives us an excellent opportunity to expand our current campuses in close proximity at the MIT Technology Square and the Alexandria Center at Kendall Square. We think we can significantly increase NOI and cash flows. We think in place rents are substantially below market. More than 50% of the leases expire over the next three years and we've got a great opportunity to convert significant office space to lab space at significantly higher rents and we've got a great land parcel for development, about 172,000 square feet, which we will aggressively pursue and closing will be dependent upon loan assumption.","And I guess finally, before I turn it over to Dean here, when we look at key future projects, we\u2019re currently evaluating for future development, the two projects in Cambridge, once we close on Tech Square -- I\u2019m sorry, on One Kendall Square, the 172,000 square feet, we will aggressively move that forward and we\u2019re looking carefully at the additional 100,000 square feet of development we have at Tech Square. We\u2019re also looking carefully at Grand Avenue in South San Francisco and the Illumina campus. So these opportunities in each of these locations represent where we have in hand or very strong tenant demand.","So without further delay, let me turn it over to Dean for more color on the quarter.","Dean Shigenaga","Thanks, Joel. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everybody. As Joel mentioned, we're taking this call from New York today. Just want to cover three important topics, first, our consistent execution and delivery of very strong internal and external growth, second, the disciplined management of our balance sheet and then lastly, key highlights on our updated guidance for 2016, accelerated timing of improvement of leverage goals and closing remarks.","I just wanted to make a quick, but very important note, we wanted to take a moment to congratulate our entire team on their consecutive Gold NAREIT CARE award. We are very pleased to be recognized as the best in class REIT that delivers transparency, quality and efficient communications in reporting to the investment community. ","Moving on to consistent execution and delivery, strong internal and external growth, our team continued to execute on our differentiated business strategy, focused on unique collaborative campuses and urban innovation cluster submarkets, limited to no supply of Class A space continues to drive rental rate growth on re-leasing the space and lease renewals, including significant benefit from early lease renewals. Solid leasing activity in the second quarter of 817,000 rentable square feet, rental rates were up 27.1% and 9.3% on a cash basis. ","We delivered consistent and solid same property NOI growth for the second quarter, up 4.9% and 6.4% on a cash basis. One quick note on straight-line rent during the second quarter, we did receive a $9 million contractual cash payment that drove a significant reduction in straight line rent for the quarter. Looking forward into the third quarter, straight-line rent is expected to be consistent with prior quarters. Occupancy was solid at 97%. ","Moving onto external growth, our team continued our disciplined allocation of capital, 96% of capital for 2016 is targeted for investment in to high-quality facilities and urban innovation clusters, including very robust in San Francisco, New York City, San Diego and Seattle. We completed and delivered earlier than expected. The third build-to-suit on campus in University Town Centre in San Diego for Illumina, a global leader in genomics, we also completed and placed in the service the remaining 63,000 rentable square feet, including about 34,000 square feet of vacancy at our second world-class center of innovation in New York City. The key takeaway from this project is that we exceeded our initial forecast cash yields by 40 basis points for a very strong final cash yield of 7%. ","Moving onto the disciplined management of our balance sheet, I just think given the volume of events that we\u2019ve executed on during the quarter, I want to quickly highlight the key items. We repurchased 53 million of par value of our Series D. About half of that was in the second quarter and the other half occurred in July. We issued about 348 million at $95.31 per share under our ATM program and expect to file a new program. We announced 256 million in proceeds to be received primarily in 2016, from two separate joint ventures at 10290 and 10300 campus point at a 5.7% cash cap rate. We issued 350 million, 3.95% 10-year unsecured bonds, completed 304 million in commitments under a secured construction loan for 100 Binney Street, raised 165 billion in commitments under our recently amended unsecured senior line of credit, aggregate commitments available for borrowing increased by 150 million. We extended the maturity date to October 2021 and reduced pricing 10 basis points to LIBOR plus 1%. ","We executed 200 million in interest-rate swaps and interest-rate cap at 2% for up to 150 million of notional. We also executed 724 million in future proceeds from the issuance of common equity and the forward sale agreements. The goal of the forward was to lock in the cost of capital to fully fund the acquisition of One Kendall Square, while we obtain approval from the lender for the assumption of $203 million secured loan. We expect to complete the approval for the loan assumption over the next 2 to 3 months, then complete the acquisition of One Kendall Square and settle the forward sale agreements from the common stock offering. ","Second-quarter net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 6.8 times and I\u2019ll cover our leverage goals in a moment. Liquidity, as of the quarter end, was 2.4 billion. In summary, our team completed the majority of our key items for 2016 capital plan, accelerated the timing of the improvement of our leverage goals and extended our weighted average remaining term of outstanding debt. ","Lastly, turning to the guidance, the accelerated timing of our leverage goal and closing remarks, the detailed assumptions underline our guidance for 2016 are included in page 10 of our supplemental package. We narrowed the range of our guidance for FFO per share diluted from $0.10 to $0.06 with no change to the midpoint of $5.51. Key considerations for the midpoint of our FFO per share guidance of $5.51 after execution of significant debt and equity capital market activity, -- activities to date, in 2016 include.","In recent years, we\u2019ve been able to meaningfully increase FFO per share guidance above our initial guidance at the beginning of each year. In 2016, we have held our FFO per share guidance at $5.51, since first announcing guidance at our annual Investor Day in 2015. We\u2019ve had very strong internal and external growth from solid demand for our Class A facilities. I\u2019ll touch on increases in guidance for rental rate growth and same property NOI growth in a moment. ","Early lease renewals continue to drive core operating performance and mitigate leasing downtime. Our value creation pipeline, we are ahead of our initial projections on completion and delivery of several spaces, including building six for Illumina, the space at Longwood and the execution and lease up and delivery of space as is versus redevelopment at Barnes Canyon in San Diego. We also achieved better pricing on capital market activity in the first quarter or actually in June, I should say, as we completed our unsecured bond offering at 3.95%. And this was inside of the interest rate that we had assumed in our initial guidance. ","Internal growth has been solid and continues to drive operating performance. We increased the midpoint of our guidance for rental rate growth on lease renewals and release in the space by 5% and 1% on a cash basis. Our ranges for guidance for rental rate growth are now up 19% to 22%, and up 7% to 10% on a cash basis. We also increased the midpoint of our guidance for same property NOI growth by 0.5% to 1% on both a GAAP and cash basis. Our updated ranges for same property NOI growth is up 2.5% to 4.5% and up 4% to 6% on a cash basis. ","We accelerated the timing of our leverage goals and are now targeting fourth quarter annualized net debt to adjusted EBITDA in a range from 6.2 times to 6.6 times or midpoint of 6.4 times. Our goal by the end of 2017 remains focused on improvement of net debt to adjusted EBITDA to less than six times. We have about 162 million of par value of our Series D convertible preferred stock outstanding as of today and we will continue to look for opportunities to repurchase shares. ","We continued with a disciplined management of our value creation pipeline and are on track to further reduce our pipeline as a percentage of gross real estate to the 10% range by year-end. Our differentiated business strategy focuses on Class A assets and AAA locations and urban innovation clusters and continues to track some of the most highly innovative and successful companies. With our best in class team, we look forward to consistently executing and delivering growth and FFO per share and net asset value quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, while we also improve our credit profile and long-term cost of capital.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Joel.","Joel Marcus","Operator, if we can go to Q&A. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Manny Korchman with Citi.","Manny Korchman","Hey, guys. Thanks. Maybe we just think about the tenant environment, has there been any change in either the VC funding environment or changes in sort of IPL landscape and how your tenants are thinking about growth?","Joel Marcus","So Manny, I guess two items. One would be with respect to venture capital funding in the first quarter, venture firms raised virtually an all-time record amount of funding for investment into life science entities, which we feel will be invested over the next year or two or three, depending on the length of the fund. So that's a very, very strong sign. The venture capital market remains robust. The IPO size has been a little tougher this year than last year. There have been, I think, more than -- 12 or more IPOs on the life science industry side. Devon performed nearly as well as last year, but the market still is open for innovative companies that have unique products. So there is funding and then the M&A environment continues to be fairly robust. I think we mentioned last time, or if we didn\u2019t, just an update, one of our tenants, Stemcentrx, that was in our South San Francisco portfolio got sold at fairly early stage cancer stem cell company to AbbVie for almost $12 billion. So we see that, as you look out on the landscape, things look pretty healthy.","Manny Korchman","Thanks, Joel. And a couple of questions on One Kendall, the first, just what\u2019s sort of your development timing there and what are you thinking about doing. The second, the other part of the project and then sort of development piece, it's pretty well leased and seemingly stabilized. Are you thinking about holding onto that in its entirety or is there a chance that you partner that out to somebody?","Joel Marcus","Yeah. So let me give you a topside view and then I\u2019ll ask Tom to be specific. So with respect to the timing of the development, I think we\u2019re going to be pretty aggressive once we close and then Tom can give you more color and then I think with respect to the after that sales, we don't have any current intent to joint venture that outside.","Tom Andrews","Thanks, Joel. So the development side is about 172,000 square foot development site that is permitted with the city, have the special permit. Needs design completion, which we will begin promptly here after we select the design team and a group to go forward on the design. That will probably take about six months, which will coincide with some preconstruction activity that needs to be done in the site and work around the parking garage and movie theatre to make -- to repossession some driveways and things like that, so we can do development on the site. And then we expect the development to take about 18 months to construct.","Manny Korchman","Thanks, guys.","Operator","And we\u2019ll now take a question from Nick Yulico from UBS.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. Hi, everyone. I was hoping you could just talk a little bit about the demand in the market for the San Francisco area for life science and then how are you thinking about what your conversations are like with tenants, because you don't -- prospective tenants because I guess your outbound portfolio is full, your development portfolio is fully occupied and you really only I guess have that tennis club project that still needs prop M. So I mean, maybe if you\u2019re just talking about demand in the market and then how are you thinking about how you might be able to accommodate from that demand?","Joel Marcus","Yes. So I'll just make a comment or so and then I\u2019ll give -- let Steve give you the detailed color. Contrary to popular belief, San Francisco has not fallen into the ocean. It\u2019s actually remained extremely healthy, both on the lab and the tech side and demand has been robust and Steve will give you details.","Steve Richardson","Nick, hi, it\u2019s Steve Richardson. As Joel just mentioned, I mean we\u2019re tracking over 2.5 million square feet of lab demand only and that\u2019s, in addition, to 5.9 million square feet of tech demand in San Francisco only. So you\u2019re right, it has remained very healthy. We are 100% leased. Year-to-date, we've actually done 158,000 square feet of early renewals and we have another 200 plus thousand square feet in negotiations. So big companies like Celgene who renewed earlier a few months ago, are identifying Mission Bay as a long-term destination and the discussions we\u2019re having with them are how do they secure and lock up their space. So we continue to see a very healthy broad market out into the future in San Francisco.","And on the development side, again, we\u2019re 100% leased with three ground-up projects coming out of the ground with Pinterest, Stripe and Uber. So healthy on that side as well. And on the East ground site, getting to the activity there in South San Francisco, the vacancy rate in South San Francisco has now dropped to 4.8%. So that\u2019s about 440 bps lower than just last year. So very continued strong demand with upward pressures on lease rates there too.","Nick Yulico","And then do you have any update on when you think you might get Prop M approval for that tennis club project in the city itself?","Steve Richardson","Yes. So we\u2019re monitoring that very closely. We have what we think is a very, very robust package of community benefits, which is going to be high on the list of city requirements and so we are very bullish on that. You may have read, we came to an agreement with the tennis club members. So we have an absolute clear path now for entitlements there and everybody is moving in the same direction. So stay tuned over the next several quarters for an update on entitlements.","Nick Yulico","All right. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Jamie Feldman from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jamie Feldman","Thank you. Joel, you outlined potential projects where you\u2019re seeing good demand where you may start over the relatively near future, can you talk to us about the cost of some of these projects and how you guys are thinking about financing, especially after a large amount of financing you did to kind of -- to carry your needs through \u201816, and technically \u201817 and \u201918 based on your ability to raise debt, but just maybe help us think about the capital plan going forward, if you do need to start here?","Joel Marcus","Yes. I\u2019ll ask Dean to comment on that. I think when it comes to the three areas that I mentioned, the two projects on Cambridge, one is the One Kendall Square which Tom just spoke to, potentially adding on to Tech Square where we\u2019ve got 100,000 square feet of entitlements, the Grand Avenue project, which Steve talked about, which that market has really become so tied in. And as you know, Verily has taken over the Amgen sub lease that the former on its space, it\u2019s pretty clear that there is pretty robust demand in that market and then Illumina on that campus, we literally got a built-in tenant who is clamoring for more space and almost we have to hold them off, but as far as the capital side of it, I think we probably wouldn't begin any starts over the next quarter too. I think we will evaluate where we are, but we clearly would look at where we are on a pre-lease base, where we are on the construction cost basis, on a yield basis and potentially we start something in the -- again, a lot depends on the macro environment potentially next year, but I will leave it to Dean to comment on funding strategy.","Dean Shigenaga","Hi, Jamie. It\u2019s Dean here. I would say it's good to think about what we've done over the last few years in funding our growth, primarily construction and development projects. The key difference, I think in 2017 as an example versus 2016, Jamie, is that we\u2019ve got probably clearly as you look at our disclosures, a larger EBITDA growth in \u201917 over 16 as compared to \u201816 over \u201915. And the key behind that is that it allow us to debt fund more of our growth in 2017 as compared to 2016 through debt. ","So, in aggregate, as you recall over the last number of years, we\u2019ve had free cash flows of $125 million. You add on EBITDA growth and we\u2019ve been funding anywhere from 400 million to 500 million of growth from these two components, meaning debt funding through EBITDA growth and then the consumption of retained cash flows after dividends. Beyond that, we\u2019ll continue to utilize recycling of capital, Jamie, through asset sales and I think it\u2019s just an important technology that we will continue to be very disciplined in our approach, in looking at capital sources to fund growth and navigate through the markets as they unfold over the next few years.","Yes, and anything we do, our focus is to maintain the lowering of leverage to 6 or less than 6. That is one of the highest priorities and nothing we do would alter that goal.","Jamie Feldman","Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess as we think about the TIAA-CREF JV, maybe can you talk to us about that as a potential source of capital going forward, and then maybe additional JVs you might be thinking about?","Joel Marcus","So we certainly have enjoyed a high-quality relationship, Peter and Dan led the joint venture on the -- joint ventures on the Campus Point assets. We view them as a long-term partner and I\u2019m not able to comment on anything in the future, but I think we both will look for opportunities to continue to work together. We think they represent a AAA partner of ours. ","Jamie Feldman","Would you look at additional JVs or do you have a...","Joel Marcus","You mean other partners or additional...","Jamie Feldman","Additional.","Joel Marcus","I don't think we have that our radar screen so much.","Jamie Feldman","And then finally thinking about \u201817 expiration, your expiring rents are 27.99 a foot. Can you talk to us about maybe current mark to market on some of those unmet group of leases what we might be looking at?","Peter Moglia","Hey Jamie, it\u2019s Peter Moglia, I could run through the North American regions for you, kind of give you a sense of where the AVR is in the market rents are today, keep in mind that AVR I believe includes straight line rent, market rent I\u2019ll give will be the initial rents. So Greater Boston, we\u2019re got a $37.81 expiration ADR, rental rates range there from 40 to 76 in Cambridge, obviously our portfolio is heavily weighted towards Cambridge, so which should be a significant opportunity there. San Francisco at 17 we had a $32.78 rents expiring in \u201817 as market rent there ranges from $48 in the South San Francisco area to $65 triple net in Mission Bay, so again a pretty big opportunity in mark to market there. New York, we have market rents in the area of $80 to $85 per lab here, so anything that comes up I'm sure will be a nice rollup. San Diego we have a $30.25 expiration, market rent there ranges from about 33 in the Sorrento Valley Sorrento area up to $49.45 in the UTC, so another significant mark to market opportunity. Seattle we were at 45.10 that is fairly close to market today but I would say market is really 48 to 54, so I think there is still an incremental opportunity there. In Maryland, the expiration is 19.11 in \u201817 and there is literally 2% vacancy in Maryland right now which for a long time was a weak market and it added to push rent and so we are going out with proposals today in the $28 to $32 range, so possibly Maryland pretty significant growth next year. And then, at Research Triangle Park, at the 13.61, again we are at about 18 for the older product up to 30 for our newer products at it creek, so that should answer your question.","Operator","And we will go now to Kevin Tyler from Green Street Advisors.","Kevin Tyler","Dean, I might have missed it earlier but on the guidance for common equity and available for sale of securities, it looks like after you back out some of the ATM issuance and the forward sale, I couldn't tell for sure but did your up the guidance for either the equity sale piece or the additional equity issues or how do those pieces kind of play out going forward?","Dean Shigenaga","Kevin, it\u2019s Dean here, yes, you are correct, our guidance was updated to reflect the capital market activities that we've announced to date, so on that front everything that we planned in our guidance has been completed on the debt and equity front. Big picture, I think from the first quarter to the second quarter guidance, equity related needs increased by about $950 million about 50% of that increase was attributed to the capital required to fund - fully refund One Kendall Square on a leverage neutral basis, yet about another 20% very roughly of the capital to reduce leverage by three tens of a churn, you had about 10% of the capital that cover series D repurchases that have been completed to date and then roughly 20% of the remainder or the remaining 20% was really related to timing differences on both acquisitions and dispositions and how the EBITDA interplays with your leverage metrics at the end of the day. So hopefully that color helps Kevin.","Kevin Tyler","But just the equity security sales is that still on track for the 125?","Dean Shigenaga","I\u2019d say broadly speaking we are monetizing a decent number of equity securities while at the same time some of the proceeds are being offset currently by other investment opportunity, so the gross proceeds are on track, our net reinvestment I think has increased a little bit offsetting the ability to retain some of the capital for 2016.","Kevin Tyler","And Joel when the [indiscernible] deal came to the market the first time around a bit back in\u201913, you\u2019d said that you hesitated to pursue similar strategy, in part I think some of the challenges that you mentioned were government budgets and university credit profile. I just wondered today as we talk about more broadly university link strategy outside of the key clusters, does that investment model make any more sense for you or Alexandria if you could actually go out and build it organically?","Joel Marcus","And the Westward opportunity came to us I think they were represented by Goldman Sachs back in 2013, we actually knew almost every site because we have looked at it broadly whether it be Miami, Winston-Salem, Baltimore, Saint Louis, Illinois a variety of places and we took a very hard look at their platform and what they were doing and certainly impacted us in the sense that it really condemns us once again that the urban innovation cluster model is really the one that we think is the best to pursue for us. I think coupled with the fact that we\u2019re always worried probably the biggest issue that we see in that model is the releasing downstream because if you're in a place like Winston-Salem we or in Baltimore, we are in Baltimore at one point, the depth of the market is such that or the lack of the depth of the market is such that you\u2019re really reliant on the institutional tenant base, now it\u2019s a good tenant for sure, high quality in general but it is in the deep one so if they decide to leave you got a problem and in a lot of cases they want to own so there is some times a requirement that you have neither sell it back or they want to purchase and I get the other thing which has been exemplified by our struggle with Longwood, government budget have been under pressure in the last couple of years with underfunding from the NIH and that seems to be turning around a bit which is a good news situation but a lot of times institutions referred to own rather than lease and we've certainly seen that in the Longwood area. So I think for anybody just go around and bidding and the ultimate buyer I think it represents a platform that works for their business but certainly relates to our business.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will go now to Richard Schiller with Barns.","Richard Schiller","First question on New York City that the vacancy rate dropped there, the footnote shows that 62,000 square feet came online, could you describe the activity you\u2019re seeing on the remaining 34,000 feet that is vacant.","Joel Marcus","Sure, I\u2019m going to ask John Cunningham who runs our New York City region to do that.","John Cunningham","Hey Rich how are you, the activity we have on the remaining floor in the West tower which is the 14th floor which represents majority of that vacancy is actually real strong, we have leased out for half the floor right now and we recently had a press release about a month and a half ago for [indiscernible] we\u2019ll doing on the other half of that floor. That will pretty much use of all of the vacancy we have won small suite associated with the accelerator and still remains on the eighth floor precise on that we will be 100% full.","Richard Schiller","And just a high-level macro question, in some of your prepared remarks you guys were talking about how tenants are relatively looking to renew leases with 2 million square feet of demand and 400,000 square feet of vacancy like in the Cambridge area, how do you balance tenant renewables versus trying to get higher rents later on in the future?","Joel Marcus","That's a good question I will ask Tom to reflect on that.","Tom Andrews","It is certainly challenging, I mean, we have lots of tenant relationships in our portfolio in Cambridge and we like to have a balance between really promoting those relationships but also knowing that there may be others who are prepared to pay higher dollars. So we kind of walk that tightrope and it is challenging right now and in the long run we think we make good decisions on that and I'm able to as you seen [indiscernible].","Joel Marcus","Again, I think in the remarks if broker estimates are correct, if rents in 2018 are in the $80 to $85 triple net range then that does give us cause to think about how we think about delivering space over the next year or two and how we charge for that space, so that analysis is certainly ongoing and something that is top of mind and certainly one of the motivations that we had for moving on the One Kendall Square acquisition.","Tom Andrews","Certainly one things we\u2019ve done, it\u2019s Tom again, and certainly one of the things we tried to do in this part of the business cycle is really extent term and being gain higher rents for longer duration and also certainly reduce the TI allowances and really try to make sure we\u2019re spending sort of our own capital as possible in the spaces [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Hey Joel, [indiscernible] just to follow up on that comment and questions as well, I guess I wanted a little bit about, last kind of year or so or six months it sounded like on the lot of calls that you would become a little bit more cautious about starting development and I don't want to call it a change in tone, it\u2019s all that you kind of, address that how you want but seems like now we're talking about multiple development opportunities on among multiple sites, has there been a change in tone among your tenants, do you feel better, I guess maybe reconciled as to if I'm thinking about is correctly.","Joel Marcus","That's a good question Dave, I think again we have a very robust pipeline set of deliveries \u201916, \u201817 into early \u201918 so there is no reason for us in the past to double down on that you know we've got to know why coming for over the coming quarters and we wouldn't get any additional credit for adding on to that but plus it complicates the capital rates but because we've I think had great success in advancing our capital plan are leverage goals and we are well into the second half of deliveries, in \u201816 I think we can afford to take a look at where we are with the future potential development so it is really a matter of too much change in tone at and where things haven't changed on either side we feel positive on both sides but I think is just a maturation of the plan and they look at what's going on in \u201818 and \u201919, so I think it still just a natural evolution.","Unidentified Analyst","And just some of your earlier comments, I can go back and read if I have to but with joint venture in San Diego and what is that lively market or not and I guess if it was, can you talk about maybe the contrast in interest from potential joint venture partners between what you've done in Cambridge and what you just did in San Diego?","Joel Marcus","So we always talk to a number of folks when it comes to joint venture but I think it is fair to say that we've developed an extraordinarily good and mutually respectful relation with TIA, we think they're very high quality I think they feel like we are the franchise they would like to invest with in the life science industry and the core urban cluster market. So ultimately we would talk to them and give them the best shot of things but we are always looking at market as a public company, our fiduciary duty is always test market, so when you have a great relationship you will always feel that\u2019s your first choice if at all possible and they've been extremely diligent flexible timeframe and so forth.","Peter Moglia","Yes, this is Peter, I would say that we've actually used UBS to help us with some of these relationships and made some meetings with a couple of sovereigns and others just to talk about potential projects just to get a gate in what their interest would be so we have an idea of the market but the end of the day the TIA partnership was one of that we felt was the right choice for in these project.","Operator","And we\u2019ll now a take question from Sheila McGrath with Evercore ISI.","Sheila McGrath","Joel you mentioned in your remarks 3% annual increases across many of the leases, this appears to be have trended higher, I was just wondering if this is across all your market and this is the norm now and is it both for lab space and tenants base.","Joel Marcus","On the lab side it is certainly our standard that we try to achieve given where we are in macroeconomic I mean if inflation ever came roaring at one point in the company's history we went to a min 3 max 6 on annual increases but we think that this represents a stable market and acceptable market annual rental excavation. There are sometimes some changes to that especially on the development side where you might get a quarter point lower or something like that but by in large we try to maintain that across the portfolio in each of the markets.","Sheila McGrath","And then on just with the tightness in the market I was wondering if there is been improvement in trends on TI allowances that you would be giving tenants?","Peter Moglia","Hey Sheila this is Peter, one of the things I do is review all of the major proposals that are going out in total rents, pre-rents, TI especially given our sensitivity to capital, I have been counseling our regional leaders to lower TIs and I think we've done a really good job of doing that comp probably the best set of all because it's leverage he has in the market but here at the end of the day if we can lower TI significantly even if we have take a little bit less rent that's the way we prefer to do it.","Sheila McGrath","And last question just maybe Joel if you can give us an update on the Volpe process like where is that in the timeline and does that still remain of interest to Alexandria?","Joel Marcus","Yes, I will ask Tom to comment on that.","Tom Andrews","Yet we have a team putting together a response to the RFP which was issued a couple of months ago and we understand what we've planning to submit a response for the deadline of September 8 as the government is requesting proposals be submitted we believe that they intend to try to get a developer selected by year end approximately update on that one we learn more but we are planning to submit a proposal by September 8.","Operator","We will now take a question from Karin Ford from MUFG Securities.","Karin Ford","Can you please give us your latest thoughts on the potential impact of the upcoming election on your business and the business of the tenants?","Joel Marcus","As Karin, so we think that the election if you read the cover story of Baron a couple of weeks ago that probably is the best prognostication that I have read I'm not a political person but I think that really is the one that I think we adopt and we believe is true that the real race is in the House and Senate the predicted that the Republicans would retain the majority in the House and that the Senate was pretty close but Republicans might retain it that if they don't you would have a split house in Senate. As you know the president doesn't have a legislative authority although I guess our current president may be believe he does a bit. But I think it\u2019s fair to say that the split government is a balanced government and I think we continue to see that moving forward. I think where it is important to us, we think there is been very strong support and that we've seen that in fact of supporting the NIH for basic biomedical research, really critical and this bipartisan Congress has supported that and we've seen over $2 billion increase over the past few months for the coming year and looks like that may go higher. We\u2019d like to see more funding for the Food and Drug Administration because that they are clearly underfunded and have hundreds and hundreds of slots unavailable to the fiddle with the for the funding so that tends to be an important area although they approved a large number of drugs in the past couple of years and they\u2019re on a pretty strong pace this year and then a good business pro-business or good quality business environment that we can see positive growth so that we get continued employment high ranks. So that's kind of the view that I think is the majority view on the street and I think we adopt that view.","Operator","And we will now take a follow-up question from Manny Korchman from Citi.","Manny Korchman","If we go back to One Kindle for a second, how much of the cost basis [indiscernible] for development and how much do the income for properties are set differently if you were to take the lands out of the what would be the going in yields?","Joel Marcus","The going in yields Manny are reflected in our disclosures in the supplement.","Manny Korchman","How many value do you attribute to the lands when you came up the idea? There has to be some rent value... I just want to ask that\u2026","Joel Marcus","You are right, it is from a purchase accounting perspective man you are currently did allocate a portion of the investment to the development site on, 170 some odd thousand square feet at roughly twos approaching three a foot, 300 a foot which we believe is a market we will generate a very nice return on that investment and so the initial state voice you is reflective of the operating aspect today with the small allocation of the purchase price of the land side.","Manny Korchman","I think Michael has on this one","Unidentified Analyst ","Hey Joel, I just had sort of curiosity you talked a little bit [indiscernible] about ramping developments and one of the things you talked about was the balance sheet in a much better position to be able to look towards funding that growth as well as a lot of government you have long target being released and curious if you think about One Kindle in market before much did your access and cost of equity capital play into the decision to buy One Kindle and how much of that is playing in increasing development and potentially looking at other acquisitions?","Joel Marcus","Well I think it's fair to say that the well our cost of debt capital certainly has been very favorable in this environment and our cost of equity capital with the stock doing pretty well we are certainly an important factor that we'd want to go out and do a large offering whether forward or not with the stock price that would be in the 70s which it was in the February so that certainly weighed heavily on our mind and our goal has always been how do we balance a couple of things one is maintain our goal on earnings continue to increase our net asset value and at the same time achieve our leverage goals for ratings increase so those are the three things we are clearly focused on as we look at One Kindle, but as I said we looked at this a couple of years ago and Mr. Moglia is sitting here to my right, he told my desire to buy that a couple of years ago for variety of good reasons but I have always felt that asset was unique, the address alone speaks to with One Kindle, it is rare to be able to find an urban campus in the best life science cluster in the universe or galaxy maybe and also the factors that were attended to that if brokerage estimates are right and we can get 80 to 85 triple nets in 2018 that gives us even more upside than our base case projections would hold, we think we can do well on the development and we also think there is a huge opportunity to convert office to lab there. So that was kind of the constellation of considerations broadly that we thought about.","Manny Korchman","And then as you think about where your stock sits today, I guess how many more opportunities do you and your team sort of trying to either aggressively uncover and I assume there is other assets like One Kindle that are out there in markets we would like to own, I'm just trying to get a sense of whether we may see more things come.","Joel Marcus","I don't think so, if you ask us at the beginning of the year did we plan on buying One Kindle I would tell you that we didn't even know was coming to market there was another asset One Lab and One Building that 245 first I think that went out of the bid their assets somewhat older but they are adjacent to Alexandria Center at Kindle Square, I would have loved to probably owned those variety of reasons coupled with the One Kindle Square acquisition we didn't see the upside in the role we didn't bid on that but we clearly underwrote and follow all the assets so I would say that we are not in general aggressively pursuing things but we are where we see I guess the one opportunity or the one characteristic of an opportunity we look at is where we see a great asset and a great location that we like to own for a long-term and we short to medium term ability to add significant value, we wouldn't buy just a fully stabilized asset for the next 10 or 12 years, just probably no interest in that. So our main focus is on our development pipeline though that's where our key focus is.","Manny Korchman","And just last one on the ATM so a perspective of how you can use it going forward how much of the significant ATM issuance was almost use of new One Kindle is coming and you want wanted it so you get as much equity as possible I'm just trying to get a sense of when you do the issue a new program how we should think about when you use it and the volume that you're going to use at a given moment can certainly the size of the issuance is as increased the equity deal was certainly sizeable in the quarter.","Dean Shigenaga","Hey Manny, it is Dean here. At some point we\u2019ll refile the program only because it is a great tool they have an balance sheet, it\u2019s a very efficient tool as we all know, as far as usage goes going forward the only thing that is contemplated at the moment would be to the extent that we retire any amount of serious D convertible preferred. we'd like the time that and match funded some common equity and I think again we been pretty clear on that strategy. As far as your question on the ATM usage in the second quarter and refunding the One Kindle. One Kindle was funded through the forward equity offering and we just saw opportunities to utilize the program in connection with changes in the overall capital plan outside of One Kindle Square, the mix of dispositions as an example, the ability to get ahead on our leverage goals as well was interplant into that thought process so hopefully that gives you a lot of color Manny.","Joel Marcus","I would say to the extent that we think about using that future and addition to what Dean said, we\u2019d always try to think about it in a leverage neutral fashion in the sense that we want to try to maintain our earnings trajectory obviously grow our NAV and at the same time use it in whatever way that we might but in an accretive fashion. So, that's how we're trying to think about it and we try to be over the past quite a number of years as disciplined as possible in the utilization of equity.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen with no additional questions I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for additional enclosing comments.","Joel Marcus","Well, thank everybody we are one hour into the conference, so right on time, thank you for your question and we look forward to talking to you for third quarter results.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz. Please go ahead.","Paula Schwartz","Thank you and good afternoon everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The Company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","I now would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus. Please go ahead.","Joel Marcus","Thank you, Paula, and welcome everybody to Alexandria's first quarter earnings call. With me today are Dean Shigenaga; Steve Richardson; Peter Moglia; Tom Andrews and Dan Ryan. So to open, I would like to congratulate the entire Alexandria team for a truly superlative first quarter. This month of May is Alexandria's 28th anniversary celebrating its May 1997 IPO listing on the New York Stock Exchange and what better way to celebrate than a great first quarter and also Alexandria's inclusion into the prestigious S&P 500. We recently mailed our 2016 annual report to shareholders and I'm proud to read the quote on the cover, which defines Alexandria in which we're both proud and grateful.","Alexandria has achieved the three outputs that define a company, superior results, distinctive impact on lasting endurance; Jim Collins, renowned author and business strategist. In our shareholders letter, we highlight our variable strategic decisions in 2004, 2005 and 2006 to pursue the urban campus cluster strategy in Mission Bay Cambridge in New York City and that strategy and set of decisions over a decade ago presaged today's megatrend of urbanization, leading to the fostering of the innovation, collaboration and certainly is resulted in superior results and strong total returns for Alexandria's shareholders.","In fact General Electric CEO, Jeff Immelt, said recently that he changed out his suburban office in Connecticut, where he saw dare for an urban office campus in Boston, where he sees engineers, techies, kids with big ideas and sharp minds out to change the world. And that\u2019s does describe it. I want to highlight a quick first quarter snapshot and Dean will then take a bit of a deep dive, as you know FFO beat the street by about $0.03. We raised guidance $0.02 at the midpoint, and as Dean will highlight realizing spreads up, early renewals and same-store growth were really very positive.","Strong internal metrics, positive cash same-store property growth great releasing spreads and 1.3 million square feet of leasing, strong external growth was also a hallmark of the first quarter with continuing lease development deliveries and very improved balance sheet metrics. With respect to demand, I would say very solid continuing demand both for life science and technology companies, which really intersect in our core urban campus cluster markets. One of Alexander's biggest challenges today is, we simply don\u2019t have enough space to handle our own tenant demand as well as other non-tenant demand.","On the supply side, we continue to see continuing constrained supply in each of our core urban cluster markets, leasing as you see from the press release from the sub 1.3 million square feet this quarter, our cash up about 17.8% on the back of really the Novartis, Genentech, Roche and Vir Biotech leases. And in fact, we do have a tenant ready to take all of Lilly's vacated space in San Diego and we are working through that negotiation right now. We are active on the acquisition front and as I stated at the frontend, we have more demand today than we have space available.","So, we are active in Cambridge, Mission Bay\/SoMa, Greater Stanford\/San Diego and the Research Triangle Park. We really focused on unique and valuable locations where we can scale. We remain highly disciplined in our location selection and in our assumptions towards provide economically advantageous projects.","On the development side, one of best and most highly leased pipelines in the industry we have fortunately and we will continue to be highly disciplined in all aspects of our development with respect to managing project cost, managing project underwriting, tenant underwriting, timeliness, leasing and yields. On the 100 Binney leasing front, I am pleased to say we afore signed Letters of Intent, which cover all of the remaining phase except about 22,000 square feet and although executed LOIs are not signed leased, we have a very high confidence level these will all get done and by the way we do have back up.","I want to highlight a few other developments quickly, 399 Binney which was acquired at when we acquired One Kendall Square, we are working on this and preconstruction and already seeing really good demand. In Research Triangle Park, we acquired a redevelopment asset that we are redeveloping and have solid demand for both the labs there and the greenhouses. And at 279 East Grand, we are working through preconstruction issues and negotiating with several users as well. So, the prospects for future pipeline look pretty positive.","On the help of our life science and tech tenant base, these tenants are strong and well capitalized with very strong continuing R&D funding, and on the life science side as we have said before about $150 billion globally, 39 billion added to that from the U.S. government and another 30 from U.S. philanthropy and another 11 billion on the venture side. This is in past year and this year, we expect it to be at or above those levels. The NIH was fortunate to get a $2 billion funding boost over the next five months under the bipartisan spending deal that was reached a Saturday night in Congress and a plus for the policy of strong government support for biomedical research.","We have a very strong continuing tenant base, 51% of our ABRs investment grade, 78% of our top 20 tenants is investment grade and 79% of our ABRs from Class A properties in AAA locations. And finally before I turn it over to Dean, so far 2017 has seen a fast start for FDA approvals. We\u2019ll maintain new drug approvals today, five of which were approved in the past week and Alexandria has seven tenants down 37% of those approvals. So, we\u2019re looking at I think very positive backdrop to our operation.","So, let me turn over to Dean for some deep dive.","Dean Shigenaga","Thanks, Joel, Dean Shigenaga here, good afternoon everybody. As Joel, we\u2019re off to a great start in 2017 and have increased our guidance FFO per share for 2017 by $0.02 to $6.02 at the midpoint, really due to continued strong rental rate growth on recently executed early lease renewals. We are now on track to deliver 9.3% growth in FFO per share in 2017 and 36.7% growth in FFO per share over the four years ending on December 31, 2017.","There are four important topics I will cover today. First, continued solid market fundamentals. Second, continued solid internal growth. Third, strong and disciplined external growth including very important comments about the potential significant understatement of net asset value. And four, continued discipline of allocation of capital management of our balance sheet.","Market fundamentals remain strong and our urban innovation cluster markets demand remain strong and supply of existing Class A space remains very limited. We are in a unique position with a highly experience and regarded team with the strong relationships that positioned us well that would be the preferred partner to provide collaborative campuses and urban innovation clusters.","We continue to execute and deliver solid internal growth also known as our same property net operating income growth. Cash same property net operating income growth was very solid at 5.5% for the quarter. Leasing activity for the quarter was also a very strong at 1.3 million rentable square feet through release renewals or generally unpredictable from a timing perspective since these opportunities are dependent on decisions by our tenants. However, executed early release renewals represented approximately 65% of our leasing activity for the quarter.","Importantly, our team captured rental rate growth of about 28% and 18% on a cash basis on total leasing activity this quarter. In reviewing various sales side models for the quarter, we noted that most models did not capture the near-term impact of significant rental rate growth on leasing activity. The most models as many of us were built off the prior quarter NOI and adjust for acquisitions, dispositions and development and redevelopment projects and had a growth rate for typical same property NOI growth.","Our rental rate growth on several recently executed lease renewals and releasing the space through significant and immediate growth in revenue and operating income and FFO per share resulting in our $0.02 increased in our mid-point of guidance for 2017 FFO per share. 60% of this increase was driven by executed leases with strong rental rate growth and 40% was attributable to a slight average occupancy pick-up throughout 2017 as compared to our prior guidance.","EBITDA margins are very strong and have improved in recent quarters of 67% TIs and leasing commissions included in our disclosures of non-revenue enhancing capital expenditures for the quarter were 18.4 million, up about 6.7 million, 4.5 million of this increase was driven by leasing commissions on the recently executed 10-year lease extension on 303,000 renewable square feet with Novartis located in Cambridge.","As anticipated, our occupancy declined slightly in the quarter to a solid occupancy of 95.5%, the primary driver of this slight decline in occupancy was due to the expansion of the Eli Lilly from 125,000 rentable square feet to 305,000 rentable square feet at our recently completed Class A redevelopment project at 10290 Campus Point Drive. Lilly vacated a 125,000 square feet at 10300 Campus Point, and as we Joe mentioned are in negotiations with tenant for the most of the space.","As we look forward over the next two quarters, we expect occupancy to improve into the 96% range and closer to where begin the year. We are in a very unique position to provide inspiring real estate solutions to drive collaboration and innovation for some of the top biopharma entities, focused on making life better for people throughout the world. Over the past four quarters, we have completed 10 new Class A properties and we have another seven new Class A properties that we expect to complete in 2017.","The deliveries in 2017 alone are projected to generate another 100 million of incremental net operating income. Additionally these deliveries are weighted toward the backend of 2017 and we\u2019ll drive significant net operating income growth in 2018. In order to maintain a high quality engineering and asset management services among other services, G&A expenses have grown with the growth in new Class A properties and cash flows and it's important to highlight the G&A expenses has improved slightly in recent quarters to approximately 0.6% of total assets.","We are also in a very unique position with well located land parcels to decide, if appropriate to address the demand from high quality and innovative entities with ground up development of new Class A properties. This quarter our supplement package includes a new disclosure on Page 38 of certain development and redevelopment projects aggregating 1.5 million rentable square feet that are undergoing marketing and preconstruction with potential delivery dates in 2018 and 2019.","The project start date and initial occupancy date for each project is subject to leasing and or market conditions. These potential developments and one redevelopment are on average targeting about 7% cash yield. We also added a new disclosure on page 39, for other potential near-term projects aggregating another 2 million square feet that could also address demand in the market with potential delivery in 2019, 2020 and beyond.","Let me provide very important comments on the potential understatement of net asset value as of March 31, 2017. Most entity model start with the gap, net operating income and back out straight line rent to derive cash, net operating income; and then most entity models divide this cash NOI amount by a market capitalization rate to determine the value of the operating portion of our asset base.","As of March 31, 2017, our recently completed development and redevelopment projects have approximately 95 million of annual free rent that will result in significant understatement in most NAV models. At a reasonable market capitalization rate on this 95 million of rent concessions NAV models could be understated by $20 to $25 per share.","Importantly, approximately 40 million of annual cash rents commenced on April 1, 2017, and this is primarily related to 75\/125 Binney Street and 50 and 60 Binney Street. So, we encourage investors to carefully review NAV estimates for important valuation considerations.","I would like to congratulate Steve Richardson, our COO and our San Francisco team for their outstanding relationships and reputation in the market, which ultimately developed into an opportunity to work in partnership with the Golden State Warriors and Uber. We recently entered into an agreement to purchase a 10% interest in a joint venture with Golden State Warriors and Uber and expect to close this JV in 2018. This joint venture would develop two high quality office building and lease the buildings to Uber.","Alexandria will manage the development of these buildings and also earn a development fee. Our balance sheet in credit metrics are very strong today and provide a significant flexibility. Importantly we continue to focus on improvement in our credit profile and long-term cost to capital.","By the end of this year we're forecasting the following strong metrics, leverage in the range of 5.3 times to 5.8 times both on the net debt to adjusted EBITDA and in net debt plus preferred to adjusted EBITDA basis. Liquidity of 2.2 billion today combined with low balance sheet leverage really provides significant flexibility with the disciplined in patient with capital market activity.","Our fix charge coverage ratio is greater than four times. Our development pipeline is approximately 10% or will be approximately 10% by the end of the year and this includes projects under vertical construction as well as future projects and that provides us optionality to address the demand from some of most innovative entities. We have not debt maturities in 2017, very limited maturities in 2018 and a very manageable set of maturities in the three years better after. And we're very limited on hedge variable rate debt of about 5% of total debt today.","Our strategy for funding growth has been consistent and consistently executed year to year, we will continue to focus on investing significant cash flows from operations after dividends, fund a significant component of construction with long-term fixed rate debt on a leverage neutral basis with significant growth in EBITDA continue to seek opportunities to reinvest capital from selected real estate sales and remain disciplined with the use of common equity.","Our goal is to combine our discipline management of our development pipeline with the strong and flexible balance sheet and continue to remain disciplined in funding our business in a manner that allows us to drive solid growth and per share earnings, net asset value and growth in common stock dividends per share.","Closing the guidance here we provided an updated guidance for 2017 as fully detailed on Page 6 of our supplemental package. Again our 2017 guidance FFO per share with the midpoint was increased $0.02 to $6.02, again driven by strong rental rate growth and recently executed early lease renewals.","We remain in a very unique position within REIT sector today with solid market fundamentals both life science fundamentals and exciting innovation focused on improvement in the quality of life. We were also well positioned with long tenured and a highly regarded senior and executive leadership combined with a unique science and technology team that allows us to be an important partner to some of the world's most innovate entities.","Thank you and I'll turn it back to Joel.","Joel Marcus","Operator, if we could go to Q&A please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Emmanuel Korchman with Citigroup Global Markets Incorporated. Please go ahead.","Emmanuel Korchman","Joe, you talked about earlier that the lack of space within our developments for both new and existing tenants. I was wondering, how that impact the way you think about doing redevelopment doesn\u2019t make you a little bit more aggressive on whether the timing or lease up or location properties to help take advantage of that basic delivery between demand and supply?","Joel Marcus","No, I think if you go back to my prepared remarks I think what I said was, we would continue to be I think quote highly disciplined in all aspects of the development with respect to cost underwriting, timeline, leasing yields. And so I don\u2019t think anything is changed, but it is frustrating in some cases where we are unable to handle requirements for especially tenants who have certain needs, but we are doing the best we can to overcome that. But I don\u2019t think it will change our philosophy or the way we are doing things.","Emmanuel Korchman","And then Dean on the Warriors, Uber venture, what type of role do you think Alexandria will play and what is sort of 10% seen at the table get you there?","Steve Richardson","Manny, hi, it's Steve Richardson. We are playing a very active role in the project management over side of the vertical construction of the two office facilities. Neither of the entities have development experience, so they are relying on us primarily to execute on that. We are thrilled to be right in the middle of that partnership; right in the heart of Mission Bay, we think it\u2019s a fantastic attribute and amenity overall and kind of a unique one of the kind destination. So, we are very excited about it.","Joel Marcus","Steve has visions of holding up the NBA Championship.","Emmanuel Korchman","Are there any development or other fees that come your way because you are taking that role in the project?","Joel Marcus","Yes, Manny. No, it\u2019s a formal development management agreement and we're busy. The teams done a fantastic job and we certainly do have development management fees there, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Sheila McGrath","Joel, in New York, you're about 98% leased, so essentially full. I was just wondering when you think about moving forward on the option parcel, where does that stands? And are there any other opportunities in the New York market for Alexandria?","Joel Marcus","Yes, Sheila. The option parcel we are having in that discussions on that both with the city and with potential users, we do have demand internally. But that\u2019s I would say an elongated process because of the nature of negotiating the nature of side due diligence and then ultimately constructing the tower. So we are looking forward to moving that forward. But I think over the shorter medium term we are certainly looking at opportunities in New York City to accommodate the tenant base there. So, I think overtime you will see us do some things in the city for sure other than the Alexandria center.","Sheila McGrath","And then 100 Binney, that\u2019s good news with the four LOIs. Just wondering as these are life science tenants or tech tenants?","Joel Marcus","Three of the four are life science.","Sheila McGrath","And then Dean, can you just remind us on the forward equity commitment, how those additional shares ramp in the balance of the year?","Dean Shigenaga","Sure, Sheila. It\u2019s Dean here. So, the forward is about 6.9 million shares, if I recall correctly 2.1 taking down and closing. So call it roughly third at closing. Two thirds on a forward basis and the concept there was really to match our funding needs, so we added a number of transactions that closed in the first quarter that was required for the immediate funding.","Second quarter consisted of closing one of the acquisitions. The second partial installment on the Uber payment for unwinding the joint venture and then capital required for the retirement of our Series A preferred stock. So, when we recently put forward and place for our outlook was to bring some of it in quarter-to-quarter to match our funding needs.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jamie Feldman","Can you mention -- it looks like six projects potentially delivering in \u201918 or \u201919 or beyond of future starts. Can you maybe handicap or maybe just give us some more color on discussions for those and are there any that you would start to back at this point?","Joel Marcus","Well, I think, I mentioned three that we\u2019re pretty active in marketing and preconstruction which is 399 Binney, which assuming we turn the four otherwise into actual leases that 100 Binney that would leave virtually no space available there. So, the 399 Binney becomes important, we do have one-time in particular. But several tenants looking at summer all of that space. So, we\u2019re certainly looking hard at that and working on everything we need to do go vertical on that one were ready.","We did close and acquisition in Research Triangle Park and we\u2019re redeveloping that as we speak and there is existing demand that we\u2019re trying to need and then the 279 grand as we said, we have several users were negotiating with and we\u2019re moving that forward in preconstruction and marketing before we go vertical. We\u2019ll make decisions based on how we think the market is and where we think our leasing is.","Jamie Feldman","And then I guess just thinking with San Francisco. Maybe just talk about your appetites take additional development risk outside of Mission Bay and markets obviously filling up -- filled up pretty quickly. Just in terms of moving life science around that market, where you think the best odds right now for spillover?","Steve Richardson","Jamie, hi, it\u2019s Steve Richardson. Yes, I mean as we look at Mission Bay all the way down the Stanford, you\u2019ve got the vacancy right probably in the 2% range. Demand is actually picked up year-over-year and we\u2019re tracking 2.8 million square feet now versus 2.2 million square feet. And it is distributed Mission Bay, South San Francisco and a Greater Stanford Cluster. I think you did see in the discloser, the acquisition of property in that Greater Stanford Cluster. So, we\u2019re working hard to make sure we\u2019ve got adequate supply to meet the demand that is in the market today.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. Thanks. And then finally, Joel, you mentioned the budget in life science funding. Anything else we should be watching in the pipeline here in terms of budget discussions or any of builds or funding opportunities that might be out there that maybe helped hurt the business?","Joel Marcus","Well, I think that the R&D side of the business is funding along. I think it is strong, it stayed strong year-to-year from both pharma and bio. The NIH as you know will have some addition 2 billion, the FDA has some incremental additional, they actually need probably more. But they've done a great job of approvals this year with 19 to date, which is almost a record. And I think we\u2019ll just wait to see how the broader healthcare issues that\u2019s out. It's kind of interesting because if you think about healthcare in general, the one thing that\u2019s not talk about that could actually help saves significant cost is tort reform. And that adds gigantic amounts of cost to healthcare because as you know the medicines only are about 10% to 15% part of that budget whereas doctors, hospitals and all the other services and products really make up the bulk of the 85% to 90%. And if we were able to achieve tort reform that would be I think a huge, huge benefit to the healthcare system on a cost basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Michael Carroll","Joe, can you a little bit about land side that you purchased this quarter. What's your current thought on banking lands and what's the timeline we should think about these projects maybe having groundbreaking?","Joel Marcus","Well, I think the fact that we have a record number of highly leased pipeline deliveries, as Dean has updated every quarter up pretty robust schedule from deliveries Page 3 of the press release in sup obviously showed the first quarter at 0.3 million square feet. And second through the fourth quarter at well over million square feet, it's pretty clear that the current pretty intense development highly leased development were getting to the -- towards the end of those deliveries and over the next year or so and so we\u2019re looking at opportunities to continue to expand to meet that need.","And I think that\u2019s what you see in the acquisitions both the expansion of our campus at One Kendall Square, as Steve has reported the SoMa acquisition, this joint venture that Dean and Steve have talked about with the Warriors and Uber, the greater Standford acquisition and a number of pieces of puzzles in San Diego and a redevelopment like Research Triangle Park. So, trying to be thoughtful, we certainly want to maintain a prudent amount of non-income producing assets on the balance sheet so that we maintain strong and flexible balance sheet. I think we\u2019re at a great point as Dean shared with you. So, I think you'll continue to see us just try to be as I said a couple of times super discipline here.","Michael Carroll","And then what other type of opportunities that you're tracking at there I guess in purchasing land sites. Should we expect more purchases throughout this year and possibly next year or is this just kind of like onetime thing?","Joel Marcus","I think it so much depends on I mean cycle back 2004, 2005 when we bought 3 million square feet from [Catullus], it's not like we wanted to buy it all it once, but it became available and it was take it all or nothing, I don\u2019t think will have that situation again. But you never know, One Kendall Square, it's not land, but there was a land site there. We didn\u2019t see it coming to market when we started 2016. So, you just never know when sellers may decide or owners may decide to achieve liquidity it's so hard to tell.","Operator","The next question comes from Dave Rodgers with Robert W. Baird & Co. Please go ahead.","Dave Rodgers","Hey, Joe, good afternoon. Maybe talk a little bit about you comfort level today, just given the demand that you've seen first starting more projects on spec? And to the extent that you would do that, how would you think that in the context of capital risk or the balance sheet? And is there any change in kind of the tenant mix that you\u2019re seeing, there are small or larger tenant full build to suit or just smaller users that would make you want to go that route or avoid that route at this point?","Joel Marcus","Well, I think both on the prepared remarks and the answer to previous question, I think we've said, we're pretty focused on maintaining the discipline and the underwriting that we\u2019ve maintained whether it would be cost, underwriting tenants, inhering to timelines, leasing, yields et cetera, maintaining our balance sheet and as the shape it is today.","So, I think it really as a one-by-one decision, and I think we will continue to vigilant disciplined and really careful. But I think the good news is, we're delivering a really a massive amount of highly leased development through this year with substantial NOI being said, approaching about a $100 million, so that makes a huge difference. So, I don\u2019t think you'll see us do anything that we haven\u2019t kind of you haven\u2019t that we been doing over the last few years.","Dave Rodgers","Sure, okay. And then Dean your comment about 95 million of annualized free rent that was as of the first quarter and then 40 million of that such to go away April 1st. What's the remainder of the rollout this year and early next, if that\u2019s correct?","Dean Shigenaga","I think the one other large number is probably Uber brand lease that I commented on last quarter. I believe that\u2019s October and November, roughly $11 million of cash NOI that will commence at that point in time. I think the rest are just the number of projects. But as we go through, I think you will see the next color at 2Q and really 2Q being the biggest run off of free rent, the biggest step in cash rents.","And then 3Q earns a little bit more of the bump but its relatively modest, I think it's really just important to say at the end of March 31 that was the free rent from the deliveries and again on April 1, 40 million of annual cash rents would commence. It commenced and all we ask is that everybody carefully look at their NAV model to be sure we\u2019re not loosing valuation there because this is all real contractual and it has been delivered so.","Joel Marcus","Yes, so Dave, following up on your question, one a way to think about -- another way to think about your question is, 213 Grand which we put into the development pipeline, we really haven\u2019t plan to do it. But when Merck decided to open a West Coast research headquarters, it became pretty clear this was an ideal fit. And so that\u2019s a good example of where we took a solid land site in a market that\u2019s come back nicely to meet need of a long time tenant and relationship. And so at 399 Binney, which is the land parcel of One Kendall, we have quite a number of companies.","In fact, I don\u2019t want conversation with one CEO on Friday and Cambridge literally like begging us to have space they wanted the 100 Binney, but they can't. So, they are likely to go to 399 Binney. So, those are the kinds of things that would move us to go forward with vertical construction. Same thing at 279 East Grand, we've got a number of pretty hot users that are in deep discussions with us. And if one of those matures, we would likely push that forward, but again we are trying to be very careful about managing all aspects of meeting that demand, but against the back drop of maintaining our great balance sheet position as well.","Dave Rodgers","And maybe lastly for me, you've done a good job addressing some of your recent roles in the portfolio, your tenant rollover, anything that we are watching now through middle of '18 that\u2019s coming up?","Steve Richardson","Dave, hi, it's Steve Richardson. When '18 is pretty well distributed we have only got four projects in excess of 50,000 square feet. The largest one is in South San Francisco, that market is rebounded nicely. We are actually engaging the tenant today in discussions and that\u2019s later half '18. So '17 looks like it's in very good shape and as we start looking into '18 I think we are pleased with the ways those were distributed and probably a solid two thirds or more are in core clusters as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","Rich Anderson","Dean, I didn\u2019t fully get the timing of the settlement of the forward. Do you think ratably over the course of this year and maybe you said asked differently? What is your guidance assume in terms of fully diluted share count for 2017?","Dean Shigenaga","Yes, ratably over the three quarter so we took down the immediate close Q1 and then the plan is Q2 and Q3. As far as total shares outstanding I don\u2019t have it in front of me but you can just roll that forward I think.","Rich Anderson","I think that answered my question. Thank you. Question, on the Golden State Warrior joint venture and Uber to be the lessee, I mean what is the stop Uber from going down wind to go down Uber design path like they did it 1455, that\u2019s not many correctly how I am describing it, but resulted in you nevertheless is sort of restructure that arrangement. Is there anything embedded in this joint venture that will preclude that from having to happen again?","Steve Richardson","Rich, hi, it's Steve Richardson. Yes, we are under construction on that site, so the design is locked in. They are working on the interiors but from an exterior perspective fully improved fully entitled no changes to the exterior design and actually ground has been broken and under construction.","Rich Anderson","Another quick one for, Dean, and maybe I should noticed, but I don\u2019t so. When is the timing of that installment at $56 million for really to the Uber JV purchase?","Dean Shigenaga","Well, it's somewhat contingent on construction milestones, if I had to guess over the next call it six to eight months. I wouldn\u2019t suspect it will be spread over evenly over the timeframe, but it is contingent. So, if they don\u2019t hit the milestones we set out in the payment plan. But if I had to guess Rich, I think it will be paid this year. But I think it works to advantage, if we don't pay them, if they end up deferred it's just hard a modeling perspective for you guys.","Rich Anderson","Okay. Last question kind of bigger picture. Acknowledging that the cash to same-store number is more important one in midpoint of 6.5% still the gap number lag that pretty substantially in your gap lease role is spectacular still. I\u2019m curious what's one of the dots that connect that difference? And when do you start to see the gap same-store number actually catch-up and maybe even surpass the cash number from a total same-store NOI growth perspective?","Joel Marcus","I think the simplest way to think if it is long-term call it over a 10-year average. Our portfolio is generated about 5% cash same property net operating income growth and that\u2019s not unusual based and what we\u2019ve been doing lately. I think what may surprise most is that the gap 10-year average is closer to 2%. And I think there has more to do with the high and stable occupancy that we operate at slightly over 95% for 10 years. And that drives a very consistent same property pull and it leaves you with only leasing activity to mark-to-market. And the gap number, we do get significant growth, but you\u2019re only drawing 10% of that at best in any given year into the portfolio.","So, it\u2019s -- the cash increases are contractual, and so you\u2019ve got much stronger cash same property performance over the long haul. I think when you see occupancy declines or volatility, I should say in traditional sectors, you tend to see much stronger gap performance, because they\u2019re losing tremendous gap NOI just from occupancy and then they read down on the upside when occupancy is growing. You can gain same property performance faster on occupancy than you can on annual steps.","Rich Anderson","What your average escalator?","Joel Marcus","We\u2019re really close to 3% contractually today.","Rich Anderson","And that\u2019s set escalator on CPI escalator?","Joel Marcus","Yes, most of them are fixed steps. Most of the escalators are fixed contractually.","Operator","And we have our next question from Tom Catherwood with BTIG, LLC. Please go ahead.","Tom Catherwood","Steve, just, now you've partially addressed this in a previous answer by one of the drill down a bit. Last quarter, you referenced 2.4 million square feet of lab demand that you're tracking in San Francisco, about 2.9 million square feet of tech demand and then another 4.5 million square feet in the Peninsula. How does that kind of attract today?","Steve Richardson","Hi, Tom. It\u2019s Steve. Again, the markets are healthy across the Board from Mission Bay down to the Greater Stanford Cluster mostly seeing an uptake in activity. We\u2019re tracking 2.8 million square feet of lab demand today. A year ago with that 2.2 million square feet and I think you reference, it was 2.4 million square feet a quarter two ago. And a number of those are large investment grade, high quality tenants out there in the market.","Tech demand, we\u2019re tracking again and uptake there as well 4.1 million square feet versus 3.7 million square feet from Q1 2016 at San Francisco alone. And maybe a little flatter down in the Peninsula, we\u2019re not seeing Google and Apple in the market with quite the same large block apatite at least right at this very moment. But across the Board, it continues to be very, very healthy and in fact somewhat of an uptick from a few quarters ago.","Tom Catherwood","Appreciate that. And we take a look at new development site down at 960 Industrial Road. It looks like the surrounding areas heavily industrial kind of even by South San Francisco standard. What is it about the submarket and the specific site that you think makes it fit for your life science portfolio?","Steve Richardson","Yes, it\u2019s really a combination of things Tom and historically what we\u2019ve seen are the large tech tenants in the Standford Research Park, the Mountain View, Shoreline Business Park and now the Menlo Park area really drive out the life science tenants from those markets. Standford themselves are currently underway building a million square foot campus in Redwood City. Facebook continues to expand in Menlo Park, placing a lot of pressure for tenants there. And then ultimately Google controls nearly all of the Shoreline Business Park in Mountain View.","So, when you take a look at that the boundaries of the Greater Standford Cluster really being pushed further north and further south, and life science tenants that we continue to have discussions with do have a desire to be in that Greater Standford Cluster. So, we think that this is going to be a great opportunities. It is real served with the Caltrain Station within walking distance. We do have downtown San Carlos right there. So, we think it's actually a pretty unique location.","Tom Catherwood","And then one quick one for, Dean. You've addressed how the TIs jump this quarter partially because of the early lease renewals, but there was also note here just about some tenant funded improvements as well. Can you talk a little bit more on the making of those? And also in general how tenant concession packages are trending in your markets?","Dean Shigenaga","Well, responding to the CapEx disclosure specifically, I know one of the R&Ds talk about trends on incentive packages. But the CapEx alone I think the Novartis lease is a good example, not only did we have leasing commissions that drove a big step quarter-over-quarter, but I think they've been in the space well every sense we acquired the asset back in 2006. So, there was a little refreshing capital and the renewal in there. So, the comments we\u2019re just focused on specifically more than anything else.","Tom Catherwood","Got you. And then as far as overall?","Steve Richardson","Yes, Tom, it's Steve again. Maybe overall at least for San Francisco, I'll let Dean comment as well and Peter. If you take the two examples in the supplemental, the Genentech renewal there, they were looking to lock down space. So, we have note down time, minimal TIs, really no concessions. And then the Vir technology space in Mission Bay was actually very competitively sort after space. So, it was the complete office, there were really no concessions, it was a very competitively built space.","Dan Ryan","Yes, we\u2019ve seen similar -- it's Dan Ryan. For San Diego, we've seen a softening of the free rent concessions, so that's confirming us. I think TI allowances have been above the same as they have been since above the past 12 months.","Peter Moglia","This is Peter Moglia, just to add on what Dan has said about free rent, that\u2019s probably the biggest things that I've noticed. The lease underwrite about a month per year for a long-term lease deal in that turned into a half month. Otherwise, that\u2019s everything else is pretty been stable.","Operator","Next question comes from Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Jed Reagan","If I can just follow up on that question, curious if you could just go around the whole and talk about the magnitude of rent growth you're seeing in your markets at this point?","Steve Richardson","Jed, it's Steve Richardson. On a mark-to-market basis as well as a rent growth basis, we're at about 22.9% on a mark-to-market basis in the exiting portfolio. And Mission Bay for example now with the most recent lease, we saw probably in the mid teens rent growth over the past year. So, continued pricing pressure, I think we've said early in the year that we expected that rate of growth to moderate, but ultimately there is still very healthy growth in upside there in the market.","Dean Shigenaga","Yes, I think the most two most recent renewals that we\u2019ve had in new lease in our new lab corp went up significantly on their renewal that was probably a plus 20% increase. And similarly in our sounding locations, we're seeing pretty healthy increase of about mid teens percentage in cash yields.","Joel Marcus","Tom, you could comment on Cambridge?","Tom Andrews","I would say similar we have, we're still seeing rent growth here in Cambridge maybe a little moderated over the pace of last year and the year before but definitely still growing rent and concessions are flat to down in another more favorable to the land lord. It continues to be a tight market sub factors on availability rate and clearly that\u2019s positive for rent growth and concessions reductions.","Jed Reagan","And I think some of the number you guys recorded, sounds like you're more sort of mark-to-market on new leases, I guess I was looking at montages kind of base rent growth in a year-over-year basis just kind market trends.","Steve Richardson","This is Steve. I mean just to be clear that two examples I cited were actual deals in the market. They weren't mark-to-market adjustments. Sorry, if I confused that with the mark-to-market comment at the outside.","Peter Moglia","And Jed, it's Peter Moglia. One thing I just wanted to note because we're doing a lot of land acquisitions right now, as that when we underwrite these acquisitions, we're using un-trended rents based on today, even though we have significant rent growth we're not counting on that to make our numbers in the future. And when than when we do trend rents we typically hold it at a CPI level, we don\u2019t try to underwrite spike something like that. So, I just wanted everyone to be clear that when we're speculating on future returns, it's based on what we see in the market today.","Jed Reagan","And then something like the San Diego the 15%, would that be a current market rent trend?","Steve Richardson","Yes, that was with our renewal on the one case and new rent on the other. So, it's one of each in that case.","Jed Reagan","Just on the separate topic, you are recently in acquisitions I think you land banks about 7% or so of your operating asset base and just curious if you have feeling for how high you feel comfortable growing that number to?","Dean Shigenaga","Hey, Jed, it's Dean here. I think the numbers that we typically look at is the overall pipeline both active and future is actually about 11% of gross real estate as of march 31, by the end of this year it's expected to be just inside of 10% call it in that 10% range. So I think our pipeline is actually very modest for the size of our balance sheet and we are trying to be very disciplined in that area. So, it may move around from time-to-time, but it's more related to deliveries and construction of certain assets that grow that pipeline.","Jed Reagan","And then of the recent land acquisition I know you got the entitlements, you've got to work through at the tenant's club site. Is there entitlement you still have to achieve anything the other sites? And are those all lab sites on the stuff you acquired in last quarter or so?","Dean Shigenaga","So, if we go through -- just turning the page here-- sorry -- I got the long supplemental.","Peter Moglia","Jed, it's Peter Moglia, it\u2019s a 303 Binney Street. We are going through entitlements there. Obviously, we mentioned blocks some about that of course the Warriors project is already entitled at 916 Industrial Roads, we will be -- where we have commenced entitlement there. And then the Callan Road, Vista Wateridge acquisition in San Diego is undergoing entitlement and then the East Cornwallis Road in RTP is actually has existing entitlement. So, we don\u2019t need to do anything there.","Jed Reagan","And the first three you feel pretty good you being above to achieve those?","Steve Richardson","Absolutely, I think we have probably most seasoned entitlement team of any REIT.","Jed Reagan","And just last one if I may I can. Maybe a question for Joel, I think you guys talked about the congressional deal reversing the proposed budget cuts from spending on the '17 budget. I guess just looking ahead to the '18 budget. How do you see that playing out? I know that the President of the new administration is still calling for a significant cost to NIH funding is part of that budget?","Joel Marcus","Yes, I think the budget cuts are not really specific to the NIH per se. They were proposed to try to achieve a line of side on the deficit that with probably tax reform in line. So, I don\u2019t think most people are too worried about it. I think the members of the administration and certainly both parts of Congress, both the Democrats and the Republicans, I think for sure have bipartisan views of maintaining or increasing the NIH budget. I am not really particularly worried about that.","Operator","Our last question comes from Tony Paolone with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Tony Paolone","Thanks. On 303 Binney, if I just put your entitlements now against the purchase price like $380 a quarter something. And it looks like, if you do get more density there, you\u2019ll pay, there is earned out or you pay more. What would about look like do you think when it\u2019s done?","Joel Marcus","Tony, I would say that any additional density would obviously improve the yields, but the underwriting just as -- we based our decision to this transaction on what there is today. And as Dean alluded to, we are looking at our historic performance or to achieve our historic performance, which is around 7% yield based on whether today. If we\u2019re able to get more entitlements in the future, which we are fairly confident we will. It will level that up a bit.","Tony Paolone","But I mean, if I'm just reading a footnote and suggest that more entitlements you get there at to the purchase price. So, executive deal leverage on the 380 a quarter, is that correct?","Joel Marcus","Yes. The costs per foot goes down more that we -- for the more square footage that we\u2019re able to get, it will blend into a lower costs per foot.","Tony Paolone","Okay, got it. And just apologies for not knowing this Uber, Golden State deal and what\u2019s kind of going on there now? But at the -- again your price at about $600 a foot, what exactly does that get you? And what would be you think the all in when it\u2019s done?","Joel Marcus","That 35 million of our contribution at closing the joint venture is not just that you\u2019re talking about significant side work of parking structure. So call it, it\u2019s a land plus significant improvements and that skews the costs per square foot. I\u2019d say all-in, as I mentioned earlier in my prepared commentary. All the projects that we actually have queued up under marketing and pretty construction right now generally average of about a 7% cash yield and so that\u2019s where we\u2019re expecting to be in all-in on all these new projects.","Tony Paolone","And then in terms of proceeds from dispositions and equity this year for back up the equity, it looks like you have 200 million to 450 million left. And apologies, if you cover this, but where do you expect that to come from at this point?","Joel Marcus","Yes, what we have left saw on that line time in our guidance, which is still able to equity and dispositions. It\u2019s roughly 400 to solve 66 million, 67 million or so is from the sale with the condominium interest on the Longwood project. That lease is called at roughly 330 million to saw far beyond that and we\u2019re working through that over the remainder of the year.","Tony Paolone","Do you have any assets in the market right now?","Joel Marcus","Nothing too significant.","Tony Paolone","And then just last question for, Dean. The other income line is looking the last five quarters it\u2019s been anywhere through change 1 million to over 10 million. What\u2019s in the 2017 guidance for that line?","Dean Shigenaga","I think it\u2019s fairly modest on front half of the year and it might be a little more normal on the back half of the year. But I think every year it\u2019s averaged in aggregate at a fairly consistent level. The quarter-to-quarter, you may see some variations.","Tony Paolone","But full year total pretty comparable to say like the last couple of years?","Joel Marcus","Yes, except the last couple of years had some large one-off quarters, if I recall correctly. So, I think if you have ignored some of the larger volume, there may have been one or two quarters that were a little larger over the last two years and you got it almost ignore those.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks.","Joel Marcus","Thank you, operator, and thank you everybody for taking time to join us for the first quarter call. And we'll look forward to talking to you for the second quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

The Company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","I now would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus. Please go ahead, Joel.","Joel S. Marcus","Thank you, Paula, and welcome everybody to our fourth quarter and year-end 2017 call. With me today are Dean Shigenaga, Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia, Tom Andrews, and Dan Ryan. So, I started off last call with a Harvard Business Review quote and I'm going to do the same from the January-February 2018 issue about culture; 'Strategy offers the formal logic for a company's goals and orients people around them, but culture expresses the goals through shared values, beliefs and guides activity through shared assumptions and group norms. Culture fosters an organization's capacity to thrive.'","So, to the women and men of the Alexandria family whose idea meritocracy and mutual respect culture coupled with our solemn mission to build the future of life-changing innovation, thank you for an operationally excellent fourth quarter and year-end 2017 and thank you for the significant funds raised, funds contributed and countless hours of service to our philanthropic focus, the communities in which we live and do business, groundbreaking biomedical research and military families.","And also thank you for the treasure trove of sustainability awards highlighted on Page 42 of our supplemental, which are nothing but really kind of astounding Nareit's Most Innovative award, California's Highest Environmental Honor, World's first WELL Certified Laboratory, GRESB's #1 Health & Well-being company in the U.S., and the first REIT to be named Fitwel Champion. So, I congratulate the entire team on those amazing awards and accomplishments.","Alexandria, and Dean will talk more about the details, is positioned well for continued growth. We are projecting 9% growth for 2018 and we clearly have a very clear path, detailed on Investor Day, to potentially double the revenues of the Company over the next five years. The macro fundamentals stay strong, strong demand from highly innovative entities, limited supply, favorable rental rate trends, high occupancy levels, and continued asset valuation strength.","The five fundamental pillars positively impacting life science demand continue to remain positive, strong life science venture capital investment, robust NIH funding, favorable FDA regulatory environment, strong medical research philanthropy support, and high levels, very high, all-time high levels of commercial R&D funding.","For the first time, our revenues exceeded $1 billion for 2017 and our total market cap touched at the end of the year about $18 billion. So, starting with a $19 million [indiscernible] around 24 years ago, that's a wonderful accomplishment. Our total shareholder return exceeded 20% in 2017 and our total return from IPO through the end of the year was almost 1,350%. So, we're very proud of those accomplishments.","Our total asset base in North America approximates 30 million square feet and our high occupancy continues at about 96.8%, more about strong and stable cash flows and the demand for our space in our key markets. We have continued to maintain high operating margins, which are very important, and strong retention rates over the last five years, exceeding 80%.","Let me switch now to really focus on the continuing and consistent strong demand in our key life science cluster markets and highlight a little bit about leasing this year. It was our second highest yearly leasing volume ever, 4.6 million square feet, 39% in San Francisco, 26% in Greater Boston, and 18% in San Diego, and broken down about 55% were re-lease and renewals, about 20% previously vacant space, 20% development delivered space, and 5% redevelopment delivered space. We had 12.7% growth in cash rental rates and we expect to exceed that in the coming year.","Moving to life science industry itself for a moment, Bill Gates at his keynote at the J.P. Morgan Conference talked about research in biotech and pharma and concluded by saying that the industry is the most important factor for the skills, experience and capacity they have necessary to turn discoveries into commercially viable products, and that remains our critical mission.","The biotech index was up about 20-plus-percent in 2017, so another strong year. Venture capital reached a, really set some all-time highs, $20 billion in annual funding, exceeding $15 billion in 2016, which was a nice uptick. The IPO market remained open, 37 deals for about $3.5 billion, and we continue to see that this year will be another strong year for high-quality companies. And already in 2018 we've seen two large merger and acquisition deals announced, Celgene's acquisition of Juno, a tenant of ours in Seattle, and Sanofi's acquisition of Bioverativ, which was a spin-out out of Biogen, another tenant of ours in the Greater Boston area.","The FDA really had a banner year. There were 46 new entities who were approved, and if you added those two additional approvals, they marked the modern day record for the FDA, and of the 46 drugs approved, 43% were ARE tenants. In 2017, the FDA approved a record number of drugs with orphan indications and eliminated the entire backlog of pending orphan drug designation requests. The FDA continues to be a world-leading gate-keeping agency. In 2017, 36 of the 46 new molecular entities were in the U.S. before any other country and 15 or 33% were first-in-class drugs, very important.","Tax reform is I think going to be a significant boon to the industry. Certainly the reduced corporate tax rates for many of the biopharmaceutical companies will be very positive and the repatriation of earnings will also be very, very significant.","So, moving on to additional comments, I'm going to ask Dean to highlight a number of key accomplishments and to give a bit of a roadmap for 2018, then I would come back and do a little bit of a follow-on before we go to Q&A. Dean?","Dean A. Shigenaga","Thanks, Joel. Dean Shigenaga here and good afternoon everyone. The combination of solid execution of our unique business strategy and operational excellence led our highly experienced team to deliver on our expectations for a truly outstanding year of operating and financial performance in 2017. We reported FFO per share of $6.02, up 9.3%; really hit our expectations for strong growth for both the fourth quarter and the year; consensus NAV at the end of 2017 was up over 13%, capturing the significant high quality growth in cash flows; and common stock dividends for 2017 were $3.45, up 7%.","Internal growth was very strong in 2017 and above our 10-year average cash same property NOI growth of 5%, and I'll touch on this and the next few topics in more detail in a moment. External growth, primarily through ground-up development, was well executed by our team. They delivered a number of great collaborative, innovative spaces on time, under budget and at great returns on our total investment. Our strong multiyear growth engine, when combined with a very strong balance sheet, continues to drive strategic per share growth, and I'll also provide very important and brief comments on our strong outlook for 2018.","Touching on key comments on our high-quality, stable and increasing cash flows, as Joel mentioned, our total revenues exceeded $1.1 billion this year, up 22% over 2016. 55% of our annual rental revenue today is generated from tenants that are either investment-grade or have a market capitalization greater than $10 billion. This represents an industry-leading statistic and huge thanks to our science and technology team for their expertise underwriting key industry trends and leading life science and technology entities. Our technology-related tenants for the year, as of year-end represented 11% of our annual rental revenue, 74% of which is generated from either investment-grade or large-cap entities.","Cash NOI was up $90 million in 2017 or 15%, driven really roughly by equal contributions from three key areas of our business, strong cash same property net operating income growth of 6.8%, also significant contribution from our pipeline of development and redevelopment projects which included 1.3 million rentable square feet of new Class A buildings that were completed in 2017, and contributions from recent acquisitions primarily One Kendall Square that we acquired in late 2016. All but one acquisition in 2017 was primarily focused on development and redevelopment value-added opportunities.","EBITDA margins were very strong at 68%. As Joel mentioned, we had our second-highest year of leasing volume at 4.5 million rentable square feet. Rental rate growth was up 12.7% on lease renewals and re-leasing of space.","We continued to deliver solid growth in net effective rents, really highlighting the strength of our real estate and life science industry fundamentals. Importantly, rental rates continue to support a disciplined approach to strategic and selective ground-up development projects, one project at a time.","For NAV models, on Page 1 of our press release we continue to highlight significant contractual near-term growth in annual cash rents of $96 million, of which $78 million will commence through the fourth quarter of 2018. It's really important to recognize $26 million of this will commence in the first quarter, $31 million will commence in the second quarter. That's $57 million just in the first half of 2018. This $96 million in contractual rent growth is related to the development and redevelopment projects that were recently placed in the service and are currently generating GAAP revenue.","Let me briefly comment on an impairment recognized in the fourth quarter. As required under GAAP, we recognized an impairment of $3.8 million as a result of an unrealized loss position for 12 months related to an investment in a biotech company. It's important to also recognize that we remain optimistic that our investment will be fine over time. However, we were required to write down the book value of this investment.","Moving on to our disciplined management of our development pipeline, we are in a unique position today with very well-located land parcels in key centers of innovation that provides us with the option to meet the demand from highly innovative entities. We will carefully review each incremental opportunity before deciding to proceed.","Over the past 10 years, we have proven our disciplined approach and ability to generate strong returns from our development pipeline. Let me just highlight a few of the great statistics over the last decade. 5.5 million rentable square feet of new Class A properties with significant pre-leasing prior to the commencement of vertical construction, with one exception this quarter that will be meaningfully leased shortly after commencement of construction.","Investment-grade or large-cap tenants supported 81% of the annual rental revenue generated from ground-up development projects over the last decade. Our highly experienced team has on average beat our target delivery dates, completed projects under budget, and exceeded our original return expectations. In 2017 we completed six development projects on time, aggregating 1.3 million rentable square feet, at initial cash yields of 7.1%, including 645,000 rentable square feet that were completed in mid 4Q 2017.","These highly innovative and collaborative spaces were built for some of the leading life science and technology entities, including Bristol-Myers, Facebook, Stripe, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Pinterest, Illumina, Juno Therapeutics which Celgene is acquiring, and several very high quality venture-backed biotech entities. We are proud to be an important partner to some of the world's most innovative entities and through our unique business helping them improve the quality of life through the discovery of new therapies and technologies.","Today we have 2.3 million rentable square feet under construction, including one project undergoing pre-construction, that are on average highly leased at 80% and expected to generate very strong initial cash yields averaging 6.9% on our total investment.","Our balance sheet today is in excellent position of strength and flexibility. We exceeded our balance sheet leverage goals this year with net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 5.5x with a very strong commitment for continued improvement year-to-year. Our fixed-charge coverage ratio was greater than 4x, we had $2 billion of liquidity at the end of the year, and we continued our disciplined execution of long-term capital to fund strategic growth.","We executed an opportunistic second unsecured bond offering in November of 2017 and strategically repaid two construction loans and reduced unhedged variable rate debt to 1%. Pricing of long-term 10-year fixed-rate bonds for Alexandria remains very attractive at approximately 4% today. To put this into perspective, a 4% 10-year bond deal is about 35 basis points lower than the 10-year bond we issued a little over two years ago in November of 2015. This reflects the significant improvement in spread over the 10-year treasury for Alexandria, driven by the tremendous improvement in our credit profile over the last two years. Importantly, we are investing capital in the new Class A properties at very strong initial cash yields of about 7%.","We have completed a significant component of our capital needs for 2018 with the execution in early January of the issuance of common stock under forward sale equity agreements that will provide net proceeds of $817 million. Our goal with this offering was to continue our prudent approach toward management of our balance sheet while our team executes on a very well defined set of growth opportunities for 2018 and beyond. We expect to settle these forward sale agreements as we match our funding needs throughout the year.","As of the end of 2017, our balance sheet is the strongest it ever has been and will continue to improve year to year. A few additional key highlights include, we have no debt maturities in 2018, we have two loans maturing in 2019, and we expect to repay the outstanding $200 million 2019 unsecured term loan later in 2018, and we also look for an opportunity to repay a portion of our $325 million construction loan with an initial maturity in 2019, but it's important to note that we have extension options to extend the maturity to 2021.","Lastly, I just want to make a few key highlights on our strong outlook for 2018. As usual, our detailed underlying guidance assumptions for 2018 are included on Page 7 of our earnings release and supplemental package. We are off to a great start this year and our team continues to focus on execution of another strong year, with projected FFO per share growth of 8.8%. We are uniquely positioned in the real estate industry with continued high quality growth and cash flows from a high-quality tenant roster and strong growth from our unique internal and external growth platform.","In closing, in my closing comments before I turn it back to Joel, we are pleased with our strong results for 2017 and strong outlook for 2018 and our team continues to execute on a pipeline of new Class A properties. We have solid fundamentals and a strong balance sheet to support strategic goals and are led by an excellent team and senior leaders with key industry relationships that provide us access to some of the most important real estate and leasing transactions in the country. Joel?","Joel S. Marcus","Let me make a few more comments and I'll turn it over to the operator to go to Q&A. So, on November 29 at Investor Day, I told analysts we would be announcing new officer roles during the first quarter of 2018. I am sometimes told that area of the deep bench. In reality, we have no bench. Every single member of our executive team, all nine of us, are first team 24\/7 players. And since we are in the Super Bowl week, an analogy might be fitting.","The New England Patriots are the best franchise in football over the last decade, and even longer. Their system is the best and has now the talented individuals into a real powerhouse team where the franchise, the team and the individuals are all about greatness of the organization.","With respect to Alexandria, and as Jim Collins, renowned author and business strategist, was quoted on the cover of our annual report, Alexandria has achieved the three outputs that define a great company, superior results, distinctive impact, lasting endurance.","Our executive management team will stay on the field of play and all of us will remain starters 24\/7. We'll change positions in the second quarter, but all the players will remain starters and will continue to execute our five-year strategic growth plan with operational excellence in our system that is in idea meritocracy and a cornerstone is respect for each and every member of our 300-person strong first team.","We'll continue to build the future of life-changing innovation through our four pillars, and let me end with before I go to Q&A with a quote I actually sent to our team about a year ago. If you develop a pure and sincere motivation and if you are motivated by a wish to help on the basis of kindness, compassion and respect, then you can carry any kind of work in any field and function more effectively, written by the Dalai Lama himself.","So, with that, we'll go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jamie Feldman","For Joel, I guess I just want to go back to the comments you just made. So you said, switching positions in the second quarter. Just thoughts on timing and what the Street should be expecting here?","Joel S. Marcus","Announcement in the first quarter and position shifting in the second quarter.","Jamie Feldman","Okay, all right, thank you. That's helpful. Can you speak more broadly about we've seen some M&A news in this space, specifically Juno and Celgene, I know Dean mentioned it on the call, can you just talk through the implications for the leases you have in your portfolio with any of the deals that have been announced lately? And then I guess also bigger picture, if you go back through cycles, M&A cycles in life science, what have been the implications for demand and maybe vacancy and subleasing in your portfolio?","Joel S. Marcus","Sure. So, first things first, on Juno, as you know we built their corporate headquarters. They will be acquired by Celgene. Celgene actually already has an important presence in Seattle. This is really a pretty critical bolt-on to the business of Celgene. They already had a big investment in Juno, so they weren't strangers al all. I think Celgene had invested over $1 billion in the company previously.","And so this really opens up Celgene, which has a magnificent cancer franchise, to the area of immuno-oncology which is in a sense one of the pieces of the future of human healthcare. So, they will continue to maintain the Juno presence, probably strengthen it, and I think you'll see that franchise continue to grow pretty rapidly.","On the other side of the fence, I'll have Tom speak to, we had a company that spun out of Biogen, Bioverativ, which is a tenant of ours being acquired here over the last announcement over the last couple of weeks. And so, Tom, maybe speak to that.","Thomas J. Andrews","Sure. So, Bioverativ spun out of Biogen I think about two or three years ago, and we put them in above 120,000 square feet of space in Waltham, Massachusetts just outside of Boston, and we anticipate based on what we know about the acquisition that Bioverativ will remain in place there as a Sanofi unit in that location. It happens there's a couple of Sanofi buildings immediately adjacent to the building that we own that Bioverativ is in.","Joel S. Marcus","So we don't see any negative implications. Historically, M&A has really had really two flavors if you go back over the last decade or so. Where you see a strategic acquisition of a real franchise and a talent pool, the acquiring company tends to use that as a base, and most of those times those companies remain in the hubs of where they are located because the bigger company wants access to talent, hiring and retention.","There are occasions where companies are bought really for a product opportunity or a unique one-off technology, and sometimes those are folded in, but I think historically we haven't had any significant negative implications on rentals from M&A.","Peter M. Moglia","It's Peter Moglia. Just one anecdote would be Eli Lilly and Company. They entered San Diego, I can't remember the name of the company they had bought, but at the time they went into one of our buildings and they were in about 20,000 square feet. And they eventually grew to where they are today in San Diego at 300,000-plus square feet.","So, those are stories that we've seen before. We've also seen ImClone come into or be purchased by Eli Lilly in New York and more than double their anticipated size once they stabilize their occupancy at Alexandria Center for Life Science. So, there's a few other examples but probably we have to take those off-line.","Operator","The next question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi.","Emmanuel Korchman","Dean, if we go back to the $3.8 billion charge you mentioned in your comments that you have confidence that over time everything will work out fine, just wondering what gives you that confidence if you can give us some more details on the securities [indiscernible].","Joel S. Marcus","So, we won't disclose what security it is, but it is a publicly traded company, and as Dean said, the rule is writing down, taking an impairment when you've got a duration of decline in value of about 12 months or so. We know the company very intimately, we know the founders, we know the pipeline, and I think we have I would say a super high level of confidence that the write-down will be recovered and probably more than that. That's all I really want to say at this point.","Emmanuel Korchman","And Joel, maybe in a similar vein, if you can give us some more details on the Alexandria's chief capital platform and how much capital you are actually going to put up into that venture?","Joel S. Marcus","We announced that we have essentially collaborated with one other large venture operation together with several strategic pharma partners and will look to make strategic seed stage investments. There is no limit. It really is a balance sheet limit. Each of the other companies are probably 5 or 10-plus-times our size. So, there is no limit. So we'll do what we think is useful and appropriate and strategic case-by-case.","Operator","The next question comes from Nick Yulico with UBS.","Nick Yulico","Just had a question on your same-store NOI guidance, specifically difference between cash and GAAP, last year you had cash NOI growth, same-store NOI growth was nearly 7%, your GAAP was 3%, just about a 400 basis point differential this year. Your cash is 10% at the midpoint and GAAP is 3.5%. So that's over 600 basis point differential. So, I'm just wondering what's driving that widening spread between cash and GAAP and whether it's solely the benefit from developments delivered in 2016 now entering the same store pool where free rent is burning off.","Dean A. Shigenaga","Nick, it's Dean Shigenaga here. I'd say we probably commented historically that GAAP typically has averaged about 2% and cash has averaged about 5% over the last decade. So you've always had a differential in the performance, and I think our same property results are unique in the sense that occupancy never really has a meaningful impact.","Specifically to 2018, when we have guided to a midpoint of 10% cash same-property NOI growth, you do have the benefit as we've talked on, on previous calls, the burn off of some rent concessions from the recently delivered developments. It's important also to remember though, if we back those out, you still end up at a very strong cash same-property NOI run rate of roughly 5%.","I think going forward Alexandria along with a number of other REITs will continue to look at how to improve the same-property disclosures to facilitate a better understanding, but you still have really strong core growth after you back out the free rent concessions.","Nick Yulico","Okay, that's helpful. And then Joel, just going back to your comments on the tax plan benefiting this sector and your tenants, can you just elaborate a little bit on that, how you think this may play out?","Joel S. Marcus","Obviously reduced. I mean, if you take the past week [indiscernible] had a big pop and it was indicated that their internal plan provided for a 20% tax rate, and it turned out, they after-tax reform, it looked like it was going to be closer to 9%. So, the stock took a big jump. I mean that's on a simple immediate impact.","Another one is, the industry probably has somewhere between $100 billion and $200 billion of cash overseas, and as that is repatriated, and interestingly enough, Celgene only had about $9 billion overseas. Amgen and Gilead have the most. You could imagine more M&A or big strategic relationships that would kind of fuel additional investment into R&D.","Operator","The next question comes from Sheila McGrath of Evercore.","Sheila McGrath","Joel, it looks like you made a leasing progress at 399 Binney and 681 Gateway. I just wondered if you could give us an update on the leases, types of tenants and how the rental rates were versus your expectations.","Joel S. Marcus","So I'll ask Tom to do 399 Binney.","Thomas J. Andrews","Yes, we signed three leases with tenants at 399 Binney. They are all well-capitalized venture-financed companies with strong pedigree and management teams. I believe they were all minimum 8 year to 10 year leases and the rents were right in line with our expectations for the property. The remainder of the space that we have to lease a little bit more challenging in terms of window line but we have some interesting activity and we'll see if we can get that leased up. The building is just coming out of the ground fast now and we'll be ready to deliver those almost three leases late this year.","Joel S. Marcus","And current rental rates in [indiscernible]?","Thomas J. Andrews","So, very high 70s to low 80s per square foot for [indiscernible] in good locations, good buildings, low 80s per square foot.","Joel S. Marcus","Let me ask Steve to speak to 681 Gateway.","Stephen A. Richardson","We are really pleased there. That lease actually doesn't roll until the latter part of this year, September of 2018. And because we've been 100% leased for almost two or three years now, we have pent-up demand in the existing portfolio. So without really any marketing campaign, we do have competition for this space. We're advancing the lease document with one tenant and we are essentially oversubscribed for the balance of the space there. So, very healthy dynamic continues. More broadly tracking, 2.5 million square feet, demand slightly up, this time last year was about 2.4 million square feet. So, just very pleased with the progress of 681 Gateway.","Joel S. Marcus","Rental rates in the market?","Stephen A. Richardson","Rental rates in the market are $60 net and room to continue to climb there as well.","Sheila McGrath","Okay, great. And then, Joel, I think in the prepared remarks you've mentioned that doubling the revenues in the next five years. I just wanted to reconfirm that that's what you said and that also is that from just the existing pipeline in the supplemental or do you have some projects that are kind of in the works that we don't necessarily know about yet?","Joel S. Marcus","So, on Investor Day, Sheila, I think we took a kind of a trip through each of the regions and gave a vision of if we were able to build out what we own, which really are pretty prime location parcels that we could in fact come close to doubling the revenues of the Company, and that's kind of the broad game-plan of the Company. It's not a guidance number at the moment but it is a path to get there and we feel pretty comfortable with that. And I think we mentioned that San Francisco had the biggest growth trajectory based on what we own. So, that is just what we own on balance sheet today, nothing else.","Sheila McGrath","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors.","Jed Reagan","Maybe a question for Dean, can you just give a little bit more color on potential timing for when you guys expect to draw-down the new forward equity raise? I mean should we think of that as more a back half of the year type of event and then how you'll balance that against further issuance of the ATM?","Dean A. Shigenaga","It's Dean here. I think in 2018, maybe one way of thinking of it is, you look back to 2017, I think you would have found that we pretty much brought in our equity almost evenly through the year except the fourth quarter had tad a bit more, and that was primarily driven by uses through the year. We had a higher construction amount in the fourth quarter of 2017. We also had a handful of acquisitions that settled down in that period as well.","So I think when you take all that into consideration, roughly speaking the equity in 2017 was kind of taken down evenly, and that included occasional uses of the ATM program through the year to round out our overall capital needs.","I would add, in 2018, consistent with what we did in 2017, you will see us search for opportunities to continue to dispose off what I would call some non-core assets, and as we make our way through the first couple of quarters of the year, we hope to give you some additional color around dispositions.","Jed Reagan","Okay, that's helpful. I guess separately, job growth has been slowing in San Francisco recently in a number of industries. Are you feeling that on the ground for your tenant base in that market? And maybe specifically for life sciences, are you seeing any signs of job growth or demand growth slowing?","Stephen A. Richardson","It's Steve Richardson. No, we are not experiencing that at all. Conversely, just in the last 60 days, we've had three Bay Area IPOs raising over $500 million, Denali, Menlo Therapeutics and ARMO. So, we are seeing first-hand continued thriving market. I think it was very upbeat JP Morgan conference that was held in San Francisco at the beginning of January. And again, we are 100% leased and working to solve a high-class problem to continue to provide Class A facilities for our client tenants.","Jed Reagan","That's helpful I guess. Just maybe just last one if I may, Joel, you mentioned some of the thoughts related to tax reform. One thing you didn't touch on with respect to this state and local tax deductions, I mean that all represent less of a tax cut for folks in high tax states like California, New York, Massachusetts, and maybe a benefit for kind of low tax states like Washington. Are you concerned that takes the wind out of the sales? I mean many of these cluster markets like the Bay Area or Cambridge, does it make you any more constructive on say a Seattle or potentially even an Austin, Texas down the line?","Joel S. Marcus","I think the answer is, Silicon Valley is now moving to Texas or Nevada or Florida, and the state does, speaking about California, it does have I think need to get some of its financial act together but I think there are some people who have achieved fortunes who are moving to non-tax states. But the average person that's working and living, I think being in those markets and in those environments, I know when it was 2 degrees in New York, I think it was 89 here in Los Angeles, it's hard to imagine there would be huge numbers flocking to a lot of those states.","So, the honest truth is, I think people in very high tax brackets are very sensitive to that, but the average person or the professional person who make up the bulk of employees that work with our tenants aren't doing that. I do think though that places like Seattle and certainly Austin do represent very nice opportunities for the future. Certainly Austin may be a cluster over the next decade, partially because Texas is a low tax state and partially that got a very positive business climate.","Our original founding investor, Jacobs Engineering, actually amazingly we had throw-away space and we started this company in their basement, they just moved recently to Texas to take advantage of a no-tax environment, because they just did not want to pay the high taxes. But that's headquarters, their operations are worldwide, and so the bulk of their people stayed where they are.","Jed Reagan","Okay, appreciate those thoughts. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Richard Anderson with .","Richard Anderson","I apologize, I got knocked off the call. So if I'm repeating anything, just tell me. First one, Joel, do you have any concern at all or interest I guess, I guess we all have some interest about where Amazon's second headquarters end up and you guys now have 11% of your business in the tech business, just curious what your thought is on that or if it's not really occupying much of your mind at this point?","Joel S. Marcus","We are not involved in that, but I would say, if I had to guess, I guess two places, one would be just outside D.C. which is rumoured to be a logical place because of the desire to maybe be more active in policy, or Texas which is a thriving no-tax state. So, I don't know, I don't have any inside information. I have talked to a number of groups in both the South and the Midwest and a number of people have actually frankly said, we're kind of bidding on it or trying to qualify, but the reality is we hope we don't get it because if it comes to our neighborhood, it's going to change our culture dramatically, which I thought was pretty fascinating from the Midwest and the South. So, that's all I know, which isn't much.","Richard Anderson","Okay. A question maybe for Dean, again, stop me if it's been asked, but on the 10% same-store NOI growth forecasted for 2018, could you give me the roadmap just as a reminder? I know you have really sort of 9% mark-to-market, escalator is around 3% for a handful from older portfolio, occupancy up-ticking on an average, but how does that get you to 10%? Is there a free rent burn component, are there tenant recoveries that are embedded in that, how do we get all the way up to 10%, if you could help us with that?","Dean A. Shigenaga","Sure. I'll briefly cover it again, Rich. Bottom line, our 10 year average has been 5%. If you were to back out recently delivered development\/redevelopment projects that have free rent burning off, you'd get into that 5% to 6% range. If you recall, I think at Investor Day I highlighted that our average occupancy through the year, it might move around quarter to quarter, but when you compare 2018 quarter to quarter versus 2017, we're going to pick up about 1% benefit to the same property results in 2018. So, you still have very strong core, what I'll call core same property performance, and you really boost that to the 10% range in our guidance through free rent burn-off.","Richard Anderson","Okay [indiscernible]. And then lastly, one very minor change from your guidance issued at Investor Day was now you have a debt-to-EBITDA below 5.5x. Is that just a reflection of taking down some of the forward equity or how would you characterize that minor change?","Dean A. Shigenaga","I'd say, importantly we ended up ahead of our expectations. It's funny that we do pick up on the fact that it's 5.5 and it could have been 5.6 and that would have been outstanding as well. I would say, generally speaking, we've been moving leverage in the direction that it's headed and when you round out at a 10th of a turn better, it's just the way the things land.","Richard Anderson","Okay, so it's just rounding error type stuff?","Dean A. Shigenaga","Yes, and I think importantly, our objective going forward, Rich, is to continue to improve that. We got rid of the upper end of the range that was up to maybe 5.8 at Investor Day because it just didn't make any sense. We are not moving leverage up. It's only going down slightly from this point and that's why we cited, from this point forward it will be below 5.5.","Operator","The next question comes from Dave Rodgers with Baird.","David Rodgers","Maybe the first question on acquisitions or maybe a two-part question on acquisitions, first for Dean and then for Joel. Dean, can you tell us that the $720 million midpoint for acquisition, kind of what the plan is for cash flowing versus non-cash flowing or maybe average cap rate that you kind of anticipate as the year goes on? And second part for Joel, Joel, maybe talk about the competitive landscape for acquisitions right now? You guys have obviously closed some fairly high cap rate acquisitions just given where we are in the cycle and even this quarter. Looks like you're set to close on Summers Ridge [indiscernible] on a cash basis. So maybe just a little color on kind of what you're seeing, are you one of the few out there that's really still active in the market?","Dean A. Shigenaga","So, Dave, it's Dean here. Let me just answer the high level question about expectations for 2018 acquisitions. There is still a pretty significant value-add focus on that pipeline. As a result, day one returns or yields are roughly slightly positive to bottom line FFO, and then at a stabilized basis upon completion of development or redevelopment activities you are going to hit right down the middle of our fairway long term, it's still about 7% on average cash yields.","Peter M. Moglia","It's Peter Moglia. For what we have got in the pipeline, I would say it's definitely weighted to the development\/redevelopment side but probably more balanced than we've been historically the last few years, where there are some stabilized opportunities that we are trying to get into. There is a number of people out there that want to joint venture with us that have good projects that we can get into and that would deliver fairly quickly but would be at yields that are typical of our own development. So, those are the types of things we're seeing right now.","David Rodgers","On the competitive side, I don't know if Joel or any of the market heads had any commentary around that?","Joel S. Marcus","I'm not sure when you say 'competitive side', meaning\u2026","David Rodgers","I guess what are you seeing out in the market as you are bidding for these transactions? I mean, are you finding more people, more companies bidding on lab assets, is that a cluttered space or are you kind of finding yourselves somewhat alone and continuing to be very active in that space?","Peter M. Moglia","This is Peter again. So, on the redevelopment and development things that we are buying, I mean they are not necessarily exclusively laboratory. I mean they could be office product as well. So, we do see a lot more competition when we're looking at those types of opportunities. Obviously in the lab realm like Summers Ridge that we're doing in San Diego, there was competition there as well because it was a stabilized property and there is obviously more comfort for a lot of parts that would like to get into lab space to get into something that is cash line for a long period of time.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Carroll","[Indiscernible] bit off of Dave's questions, Peter, can you talk a little bit about I guess your acquisition stance right now? It seems like the Company has been a little bit more aggressive recently. Is that mainly due to a lot of large development projects being completed and your cost of capital being improved or are you seeing better opportunities out there?","Peter M. Moglia","Obviously our cost of capital has allowed us the flexibility to go after things that may have had whole periods that were longer than we are comfortable with before because we have got the lower costs enable to carry things longer. But overall, I don't really think things have really changed much. I mean we just have happened to get serendipity with a number of things that have fit our profile that have come along in the markets that we want to invest in. So, I don't know if it's really changed. It's just been by chance.","Joel S. Marcus","I think I mean, if you go back a year in time when we bought One Kendall Square, you could never imagine that it would come to market. I mean, a lot of these things, as Peter just said, are serendipitous. They come when a particular seller or money partner decides to part with an asset, they believe it is a good time and we try to respond. We look at everything and we certainly don't go after everything, but we try to be very disciplined in how we think about what we want to do and how we want to do it.","Michael Carroll","Okay, thanks. And then just a quick follow up, can you talk a little bit about the stabilized assets that you are interested in? Do they have to have some type of unique components, some location, or is that just a good opportunity that pops up that you are willing to pursue?","Peter M. Moglia","This is Peter again. For stabilized assets, if we were going to pay a low cap rate for something, it would definitely have to be just in a Class AAA location and preferably have some mark-to-market opportunities in the future. But overall we tend to buy things that could have very little cash flow upfront but we can get to a 6%, 7%, 8% through leasing or mark-to-market opportunities within two to three years.","Joel S. Marcus","And I would say on acquisitions, we are not interested in paying somebody else for their value, Peter always says. We'd like to help create the value. So, that kind of guides our acquisition philosophy.","Operator","The next question comes from Karin Ford with MUFJ Securities.","Karin Ford","A recent article said that the city of New York is soliciting proposals for a new life science campus and offering three city-owned sites. One of the sites I think is near the Alexandria Center and another is in Queens, close to Cornell's Tech Campus on Roosevelt Island and may have more expansion potential. Would Alexandria only be interested in expanding your existing site or do you think there is enough positive demand to drive a second cluster in New York?","Joel S. Marcus","[Red] [ph] RFP is pretty unusual because they don't want real estate developers bidding on it. They actually want users to come in and try to occupy spaces and then bring development expertise with them. So, I won't comment beyond that but that's the nature of the RFP.","Karin Ford","Okay. And second question, I saw that a large healthcare technology company, Royal Philips, had signed a large lease for about 60% of the space in the first building under construction at Cambridge Crossing. Do you have a sense for what the rent comparison is there versus Kendall Square and do you think it will provide some leasing momentum for that location?","Joel S. Marcus","Remember that that's office, but I'll have Tom comment.","Thomas J. Andrews","I think the rent there turned out to be pretty strong, not too much below Kendall Square level rents, maybe 5% to 10% below. And the balance of that building is available for lease. We're not certain if the developers are offering the balance of the building as potential lab space. I think they are in the middle of making that decision as the building is early in construction. But as Joel mentioned, the Philips lease is office space and a building that had been programmed for both lab and office.","Karin Ford","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","We'll take our last question today from Tom Catherwood of BTIG.","Tom Catherwood","Just one cleanup question, maybe for Steve. I know it's a small project but on 1655 and 1715 Third Street in San Francisco, the January 3 prospectus had listed this as under-construction with a closing I think it was January 5th for 39 million. The release yesterday indicated that it's more likely a February closing and a near-term start and only $31 million initial cost. What are the kind of moving parts and the pieces with this project that have kind of extended it out?","Stephen A. Richardson","It's Steve. The horizontal construction \u2013 this is the GSW\/Uber\/Alexandria joint venture. We are a 10% partner there. What really needed to be completed was the horizontal construction or enable the vertical construction to start for the office tower. So, there was just a little bit of movement there over a couple of week period of time. But all is on track. You can see both the arena and the building starting to take shape on the site. So it's pretty exciting for Mission Bay.","Tom Catherwood","Got it. Thanks guys.","Operator","As there are no more questions, I would like to return the call to Mr. Marcus for any closing comments.","Joel S. Marcus","Thank you very much everybody. Have a rest of a good day and we'll talk to you on first quarter. Thank you again.","Operator","Thank you. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

[Operator Instructions] Please note today\u2019s event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz with Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Paula Schwartz","Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company\u2019s actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company\u2019s periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel.","Joel Marcus","Thanks very much, Paula, and welcome, everybody, to our Alexandria\u2019s first quarter call. And with me today are actually much of our Executive Management team: including Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia, Dean Shigenaga, Tom Andrews, Jennifer Banks, Larry Diamond, Dan Ryan, and Vin Ciruzzi. Congratulations to the entire team on a really outstanding first quarter by all metrics and another quarter of truly operational excellence.","In the November and December 2017 issue of the Harvard Business Review, they had an article entitled Turning Potential Into Success, and the article and the research on which it was based focused on companies that are overwhelmingly failing on one key metric of success, which is leadership development.","In contrast, I\u2019m proud to say, Alexandria is not failing on this key metric for success. In fact, our intense focus on nurturing key chain training and developing unit leaders at each and every level has paid exceptional dividends in fostering our culture of mutual respect, idea of meritocracy, long-tenured and high-performance teams, dear friendships, all within a high \u2013 highly focused mission-driven culture.","In July 2016, we initiated world-class intense leadership and management training effort under the leadership of Jim Collins. A new succession planning strategy was also begun at all unit leader levels, as well at the executive management level. As you know, some of these efforts culminated in a series of press releases in March and April and there are some yet to come.","The same starting team remains on the field, as I\u2019ve said before, albeit at different position and not a single unit leader executive manager ever considered departing. When it came to the most senior executive leadership, the process was uniquely holistic and the outcome is evidence of the continuation of the Alexandria culture, vision and intended successful accomplishment of our five-year growth plan 2018 through 2022.","Let me turn to our ecosystem for a moment or two. The five fundamental drivers impacting the life science demand, first one being basic research funding, the new Omnibus Spending Bill allocated an additional $3 billion to the NIH, up 9%. So for the fiscal year ending 2018, it\u2019ll be about $37-plus billion.","On the regulatory side of the FDA, they\u2019re working very positively to expedite an increase drug approvals under the superb leadership of Scott Gottlieb and the Omnibus Spending Bill allocated almost a $0.5 billion, or up 10% in FDA funding. Medical research philanthropy sits at an all-time high north of $33 billion. Global commercial R&D funding sits at an all-time high approaching $200 billion.","And on a very unique note, I\u2019m proud to say the U.S. venture capital funding in life science for the first quarter hit $6.7 billion, the largest quarter on record for life science venture funding. And among the life science companies doing mega rounds, two were TCR2, which did a $125 million Series B and is in our 100 Binney project in Cambridge, next-gen immuno-oncology company and Rubio\u2019s, a $100 million Series C, they are going to be at 399 Binney next-generation cell therapy. Also, San Francisco and Boston continue to garner the largest venture funding amounts, San Francisco at $1.7 billion and Boston at $1.6 billion.","Venture funding is seeing a new wellspring in a diverse set of players that go well beyond the traditional venture firms, including public crossover investors, Asian venture fund, sovereign wealth funds and ultra high net worth family offices. Worldwide prescription drug therapy market is growing at about 6.5% compounded annually and will reach $1.06 trillion by the last year of our five-year growth and operational excellence plan in 2022.","Companies, which were startups now account for an amazing 63% of all new prescription drug approvals over the last five years and it\u2019s no wonder that pharma has now established venture arms and incubators to invest in these promising start-ups working on new drug technologies.","Finally, I want to make a comment about ARE investments and Dean will give you granular analysis of this. This effort and key pillar of our business was started when we were private in 1996. Our single best investment today was our Series A in Google in 1998. Today, this pillar continues to be strategically core to what we do at Alexandria. One recent investment focused on unlocking the secrets of ALS, a disease which killed which killed Lou Gehrig and remained shrouded in mystery even today.","As I stated before, there are about 10,000 known diseases to mankind today and only about 500, or 5% have addressable therapy. So we\u2019re in the real early innings of the biology revolution.","And with that, let me turn it over to our new Co-CEO, Steve Richardson.","Stephen Richardson","Good afternoon, everybody. Let me talk a little bit about the vision for 2018 and 2019. As we continue building our dominant franchise well into 2019, the path is clear and compelling. Alexandria\u2019s business model based upon Michael Porter\u2019s cluster theory of creating dynamic ecosystems upon its Class A science and tech urban campuses is providing exceptional value for our client tenants and our investors.","Let me take a step back and share a bit of the philosophy behind our strategy and exciting path forward as it\u2019s comprised of three essential elements; great people, a passion for excellence, and engaging with purposeful companies.","The first element great people. The entire team at Alexandria possesses unique skills and talents to acquire, entitle, design, construct, underwrite, lease and broadly operate these technical and complicated mission-critical facilities and the following sentiments from our clients speak volumes about their dedication and passion for our mission.","From a large pharma company, we\u2019re excited to be working with ARE. Integrated teams committed towards common goals and optimal design for our science and a high-quality facility. From an exciting high-growth life science company, ARE has been a great partner, as the company has grown from three founders to over 250 employees. And from a leading tech company, ARE has ensured our vision of a tasteful workplace environment was achieved as a wonderful partner.","We could not be more proud to serve the company\u2019s mission of advancing human health, overcoming hunger and improving the quality of people\u2019s lives alongside one another together. So for us, job number one is, ensuring we continually enhance our differentiated and proprietary products and delivering high-touch unparalleled service to our clients.","A passion for excellence. As we\u2019re building brick-by-brick, the ecosystems in our core clusters, it demands an intensity that can only be fueled by a passion for excellence in all realms. It\u2019s important to emphasize here that 2.3 million square feet in our urban campus development pipeline is 81% leased and the client tenants range from the best of the best tech tenants to investment-grade pharma companies to exciting emerging-stage life science companies.","Bit of a deep dive here. During 2018, these Class A facilities include 164,000 square foot facility fully leased to Takeda in San Diego, an inspiring and cutting-edge facility. The exceptional pre-leasing success, we\u2019re now at 75% at 399 Binney, also 164,000 square feet, providing a platform for a well-financed emerging-stage companies. And in the southeast region in RTP, 5 Laboratory Drive, our very unique 175,000 square foot flagship ag tech facility, featuring state-of-the-art greenhouses.","As we look forward well into 2019, the high-quality invisible growth continues and is well distribute across a number of key clusters. Menlo Gateway\u2019s Phase 2 comprised of 520,000 square feet fully leased long-term to Facebook, which just posted a strong earnings beat with $12 billion in quarterly revenue, up 50% year-over-year in a market cap of $510 billion.","In San Francisco, Uber\u2019s 590,000 square feet at the championship Golden State Warriors, go Warriors, Chase Center in Mission Bay, a transformational urban campus and transformational company, featuring a bright future with its new well-regarded CEO.","In South San Francisco 213 East Grand, cutting-edge innovation center totaling 300,000 square feet fully leased to Merck. And just down the road, a fourth building now totaling 211,000 square feet at 279 East Grand, anchored by Google\u2019s Verily division as part of their 600,000 square foot campus alongside East Grand Avenue in South San Francisco.","At 681 Gateway, 126,000 square feet anchored by an expansion with an existing client, Twist Bioscience, as they\u2019re at the intersection of science and technology with its creation of synthetic DNA. Further north in Seattle, our spectacular waterfront 205,000 square foot facility at 1818 Fairview and importantly, in Maryland, a 49,000 square foot facility at 9900 Medical Drive and the remaining 58,000 square feet at 704 Queens Road.","And finally, the essential ingredient engaging with purposeful companies. All of us here at Alexandria are honored to be a trusted partner and regarded as one to leading edge companies working to improve human health, including Juno Therapeutics, which was recently purchased by Celgene for $9 billion during the first quarter, our first \u2013 our anchor and full building tenant at the 290,000 square foot facility in Seattle, and our promising CAR T cancer treatment.","Joel just mentioned, QurAlis, a company launched by notable Harvard professors taking a precision approach to treat ALS. In fact, on the West Coast, Vir Biotechnology, seeking to transform the care of people with serious infectious diseases.","I can speak for our entire team, when I say that, we\u2019re energized by the absolutely clear and compelling vision of our future, as we continue to build dominant positions in these core clusters for the benefit of our clients, communities and investors.","I\u2019ll hand it over to Peter now.","Peter Moglia","Thanks, Steve. I\u2019m looking forward to working with you for another 20 years, really appreciate those comments. We\u2019d like to briefly touch on our acquisitions last quarter. And as a reminder, our investment philosophy has been and will continue to be a strong preference to add value rather than paying for another company\u2019s value creation.","For acquisitions, this quarter reflect this philosophy and our historical track record of building dynamic communities to urban campuses. Alexandria Park is a multiple building generic office project in Palo Alto, the heart of the Greater Stanford cluster that will undergo a transformation to a fully amenitized life science and tech campus creating a highly desirable collaborative destination.","704 Quince Orchard Road in Gaithersburg, Maryland will create a highly differentiated set of laboratory suites from a generic office building. Summers Ridge in San Diego is a rare opportunity for Alexandria as you acquire a multi-tenant life science campus that is stabilized with credit tenancy, providing immediately accretive income, plus the additional opportunity to create value with additional FAR for future campus expansion.","100 Tech Drive in the Greater Boston market is a 200,000 square foot facility, leased by a fast-growing, high-quality existing Alexandria tenant, and also provides for future value creation with an additional 300,000 square feet to create a fully integrated 500,000 square foot campus.","In addition to our acquisitions, it is important to note two recent laboratory office transactions that illustrate the property values and institutional demand for our product continued to be very strong. The Real Reporter in Boston reported last Monday that 4 black fan circle, a 270,000 square foot Life Science Research Facility in Boston\u2019s Longwood medical area sold to investment advisor Intercontinental Real Estate Corporation for $275 million.","We understand that the cap rate was in the high 4s, which is particularly impressive since the real estate is held in a somewhat complicated condominium structure. The article mentions that the asset was \u201caggressively pursued by investors from across the globe\u201d. This is the first time we\u2019ve heard of Intercontinental being a bidder for a life science asset. But it\u2019s further proof that strong returns and credit profile of life science assets continue to attract Global Institutional Capital.","We have also recently been made aware of a sizable laboratory office transactions in the Cambridge market that has recently closed at a mid-4 cap rate and expect details to come out shortly.","A metric we\u2019d like to highlight this quarter is the continued strength of our cash NOI in leasing spreads. Cash rental rate growth increased by 19% this quarter, primarily driven by the successful execution of our strategy to re-release below market rents at our Alexandria Center at One Kendall Square Campus, where the team continues to outperform the expectations we set at the time of acquisition.","To finish up, we\u2019d like to comment on the potential impacts of tariffs on the solid development pipeline Steve described earlier. With GMP contracts in place for all of our large projects to be delivered in 2018 and 2019, we will not have any exposure to increasing cost of tariffs, unless there is a scope change involving those materials, which is not anticipated.","And although we source all of our steel domestically, our contractors have reported cost creep of 6% to 10%, or $100 to $300 per ton, as domestic providers have raised prices. This would translate to an overall 1% increase in total project cost, if applied to our current projects. We also have adequate contingency to cover anything that comes along. We have not seen price increases in aluminum yet. We source most of it domestically and the rest comes from Canada, which is currently exempted from tariffs.","Overall, our conservative underwriting has historically factored in construction cost increases and we continue to monitor the trade policy closely.","And with that, I\u2019ll pass it over to Dean.","Dean Shigenaga","Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. I just want to cover four key topics today: first or one, first quarter results; second, review of the new accounting rule for equity investments; third, venture value creation pipeline in our balance sheet; and fourth, our 2018 guidance.","As you know, we are off to a great start this year on our strategic priorities, on track to achieve another solid year of FFO per share growth of approximately 9%, and our team continued to execute quickly and efficiently. FFO per share for 1Q was $1.62, up 9.5% over the first quarter of 2017.","Net operating income was up $34.6 million, or 17.8% over the first quarter of 2017. Comparing 1Q 2018 to 1Q 2017, the key drivers of the 17.8% growth in net operating income included almost 70% from development and redevelopment deliveries, about 20% from internal growth or same property performance, and the remaining 10% primarily from acquisitions.","Same property growth has been consistently strong and net operating income growth was up 4% and 14.6% on a GAAP and cash basis, and we\u2019re on track with our overall 2018 guidance of up 3.5% and 10% on a GAAP and cash basis, respectively. Continued constrained supply and strong demand drove solid rental rate growth of 16.3% and 19% on a GAAP and cash basis, respectively, on leasing activity for the first quarter.","As Peter had mentioned, our One Kendall Square Campus located in Kendall Square was a key driver of leasing activity for the quarter. Cash rental rate growth was ahead of expectations, as our team executed on lease renewals and re-leasing of space at One Kendall Square, capturing significant cash rental growth related to below market leases that were in place at acquisition.","However, GAAP rental rate growth was below cash rent growth this quarter since most of the GAAP rent growth was recognized in the initial purchase price of accounting at the acquisition date. As a reminder, at the beginning of 2018, we had very limited contractual lease expirations of approximately 5.8% of total leases in effect.","As anticipated, we adopted new accounting rules around financial instruments, which applies to our equity investments, primarily in life science and a handful of technology entities. The new rule requires that we measure investments at fair value, recognize changes in fair value in net income, and prior to 2018, we did not recognize unrealized gains or losses in net income.","As noted by Warren Buffett in his 2017 annual letter, this new accounting rule will likely generate $10 billion swings in net income that will swamp truly important numbers for Brookshire\u2019s operating performance. Buffett also stated that what counts most is their normalized per share earnings power. We agree and we will clearly disclose the impact of our equity investments on our financial statements and normalized operating performance.","We have three categories of investments from an accounting perspective. First, we\u2019ve got publicly traded securities that we reflect at fair value based upon the closing stock price, which changes in fair value recognized in net income. There are two categories of privately-held entities or investments in privately-held entities without readily determinable fair value.","First, there are investments in entities that report net asset value and are carried at approximately fair value based upon net asset value as a practical expedience required under GAAP, which changes in fair value recognized in net income. We also have investments in entities that do not report net asset value and are only adjusted upward or downward for observable price changes subsequent to 2017.","These upward and downward adjustments are recognized in net income as well. Reflected in net income for the first quarter is $85 million of investment income, $72.2 million represents changes in unrealized gains, which was excluded from FFO per shares as adjusted.","We also had a large realized gain of $8.3 million from an investment in the life science entity. And consistent with prior years, large and individual realized gains like this one have been excluded from FFO per share as adjusted. So only $5.1 million in realized gains in the first quarter was included in FFO per share as adjusted.","Looking forward, some of our investment gains are event-driven, and therefore, it\u2019s hard to forecast for gains for the future. However, I do recommend looking back over recent years in order to have some sense of the amount of potential gains for 2018 and beyond.","In most of the recent years, the run rate for investment gains and other income has generally been between $10 million and $25 million per year. In this quarter, the $5.1 million in ordinary course realized gains included in FFO per share as adjusted. When you look at it on an annualized basis falls within maybe on the upper-end of this historic range of investment gains and other income.","From a balance sheet perspective, it\u2019s important to note the following under the new accounting rule. We hold $724 million in investments on our balance sheet consisting of cost basis of $511.2 million and unrealized gains of $213.1 million. Importantly, only $250.5 million, or 49% of our cost basis has been reflected at approximately fair value with unrealized gains aggregating $213.1 million or really an amazing 85% of unrealized gains on our total investment.","Now the remaining $260.7 million, or the remaining 51% of total cost basis in our investments are still classified on our balance sheet at cost. So it\u2019s probably inappropriate to extrapolate the 85% in unrealized gains to this half of our equity investments. But we believe there is significant value embedded in these investments.","And please refer to footnote two and footnote six of our 10-Q that we will file shortly, and pages 43 and 50 of our first quarter supplemental package for additional information.","Now turning to our value creation pipeline in our balance sheet. Our pipeline for deliveries in 2018 and 2019 now consist of $2.6 million rentable square feet, including $2.1 million rentable square feet targeted for delivery in 2019. These are about 80% leased, represent about $1.8 billion in \u2013 at completion and $1 billion remaining to fund, and we\u2019ll generate very strong cash yields on our total investment approaching 7%. We also have a pipeline for potential delivery in 2020, approximating over 900,000 rentable square feet that our team is currently marketing for lease.","As for funding, keep in mind, that our \u2013 in the first quarter, we completed our $817 million forward equity offering, including $714 million that will settle over the next three quarters. Additionally, in April, we raised $94 million under our ATM program and now have addressed 75% of our equity needs anticipated in 2018.","Over the next three quarters, we will address the remaining $300 million of equity that we need for the year. Our approach with our ATM program is to remain disciplined, putting aside macro considerations for the moment, given the tremendous growth in cash flows, our stock price generally has grown on a relative basis to other REITs.","While we take this into consideration, we also remain disciplined in our approach with our ATM program and generally have used the program over time through each year allowing us to blend our cost of equity capital.","Turning briefly to credit metrics, we remain very committed to a continued improvement in our credit metrics each year, including net debt to adjust EBITDA, while we also focus on delivering solid FFO per share growth. Our goal remains focused on continued improvement in our relative long-term cost to capital.","As a reminder, a detailed assumptions for 2018 guidance are included on page 5 of our supplemental package. We updated our guidance for EPS to a range of $2.88 to $2.98 and FFO per share as adjusted to a range of $6.52 to $6.62. The range of our per share guidance for 2018 was narrowed from $0.20 to $0.10 per share. Importantly, the midpoint of our 2018 guidance for FFO per share as adjusted was increased $0.02 at the midpoint.","The key drivers for 2018 that we considered in our updated guidance included the continued strength of the real estate and life science industry fundamentals, which we expect to continue to drive strong internal growth in 2018 and then value creation opportunities for delivery beyond 2018.","Our outlook is reflected in our 2018 guidance for same-property NOI growth. However, due to the size of our same-property pool today, which generates $700 million to $800 million of net operating income, $0.02 growth in FFO per share only move same-property NOI growth by about 30 basis points. As a result, our outlook for same-property performance remains strong and within the prior range of guidance for 2018.","With that, let me turn it back to Joel Marcus.","Joel Marcus","Thank you, everybody. We\u2019ll open it up operator for Q&A, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer-session [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s first question comes from Manny Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead.","Manny Korchman","Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Peter and Steve as you sit there in a co-CEO role, how do you each think about the differentiation also overlapping your roles? And how you manage through those situations where it seems like there is an overlap and what the CEO should be deciding?","Joel Marcus","Okay. This is Joel, and I\u2019ll let each of them comment. But I think that the fact that the team has worked together for almost two decades. And the fact that we don\u2019t have an org chart and we aren\u2019t bureaucratically organized, make it very easy to move between issues and manage in a way that is highly effective. So I\u2019m not sure they can give you or want to give you any granular detail, but it\u2019s a pretty seamless operation. Steve, you could comment.","Stephen Richardson","Manny, hi, it\u2019s Steve. Yes, it is important for everybody to remember, Peter and I have worked together for 20 years. And frankly, that\u2019s the same across the executive team, as well as the number of people in the organization. In addition to that for seven, eight-plus years, Peter and I in the roles we\u2019ve had as COO and CIO have been involved with the breadth and depth of the company as we will be as Co-CEOs, and we\u2019ve actually been doing exactly this for a number of years.","So there\u2019s nothing substantially different. We\u2019ve worked through these issues and we\u2019ll continue to work through them with Joel and with the team and with each other.","Joel Marcus","I have nothing left to add. My distinguished colleague from San Francisco nailed it.","Manny Korchman","That\u2019s what the color all is all about, right? Peter, while I got you there, the pending acquisitions that you guys have show in the supplemental.","Joel Marcus","Yes.","Manny Korchman","Are those similar sort of flavor as the stuff you\u2019ve identified as closed or closer?","Joel Marcus","Yes, it\u2019s a combination of existing assets with value creation embedded in them and then development, redevelopment types of properties.","Manny Korchman","And just likelihood of close on a $268 million?","Joel Marcus","Highly likely to close all of that.","Manny Korchman","Okay, thanks, everyone.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Sheila McGrath of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Sheila McGrath","Yes. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could discuss the other investments and talk about the strategic value of that arm for Alexandria, just the competitive advantages that it gives Alexandria either in underwriting or discussions with tenants? And then, Dean, if you can just clarify the $5.1 million in that flowing through that\u2019s just the realized gains and that\u2019 that the determinant?","Joel Marcus","So let me have Dean address that for Sheila and then I\u2019ll talk about the strategy.","Dean Shigenaga","So, Sheila, the $5.1 million that we kept inside of FFO per share as adjusted is realized gains and it\u2019s the normal realized gains that we have any given year maybe slightly higher this quarter compared to the last couple of quarters. But on average right down the fair \u2013 right down what we normally have.","Joel Marcus","Yes. And the item that Dean mentioned the $8-plus million was the recognition on the sale of Juno to Celgene. So strategically, as I said in my comments, Sheila, going back to 1996, when the company was still private. We felt that it was important for us to do a couple of things in using our balance sheet to invest directly in entities that made a big difference and Steve alluded to these differentiators. And that is one to really understand maybe most importantly, where the science is going. And if you don\u2019t understand that, it\u2019s hard to even begin to think about the tenant base how you underwrite, who you underwrite. So that\u2019s number one.","And I think number two is to be able to develop relationships with big winners and companies you can grow with over time, and so that becomes very important. Knowledge of the industry is critical. And so that\u2019s another bedrock piece of the investment strategy. Clearly, financial gains is also paramount.","We don\u2019t do this as a hobby, we do it as a very serious financial, both I think, methodical and judicious approach that we always want to ensure we\u2019re making money on, on a net basis. And I think also importantly, it brings us a level of, I think, respect and knowledge in our ecosystem that we\u2019re not just a minor player. We are, in fact, one of the central players of the life science ecosystem.","Sheila McGrath","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And one quick follow-up. New York is now 100% leased. What\u2019s next for Alexandria New York? How far long is the option parcel? And are there any other locations or opportunities on the radar?","Joel Marcus","So we still have a little bit of space. We\u2019re moving people around there, but by and large, it\u2019s relatively fully leased. We are in late-stage negotiations with the city on the letter of intent for the North Tower. We hope to maybe make an announcement over coming period of time. And then, I think, we clearly are looking at expansion in New York City and I would say stay tuned on that.","Sheila McGrath","Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Yes. Thanks, Sheila.","Operator","And today\u2019s next question comes from Tom Catherwood of BTIG. Please go ahead.","Tom Catherwood","Excellent. Thank you, guys. Following up on Sheila\u2019s questions on the investment book, I know it\u2019s only 4% of total assets. But cost basis of this has increased roughly 40% over \u2013 each year over the past two years. What\u2019s the ultimate size of this book in your mind, Joel, or are there any restrictions on how large it can get as a percentage of total assets?","Joel Marcus","Yes, I think you\u2019ll see the cost basis, however, in about 4% to 6% of total assets. I think that\u2019s where it logically is and probably will remain and will certainly continue to recycle investments they naturally recycle themselves to some extent. As Dean said, that really isn\u2019t a quarterly run rate that we\u2019ve had for a long, long period of time. So I think that\u2019s kind of where you should think about it.","Tom Catherwood","Got it. Thank you. And then for Steven and Tom probably to you, thinking of Cambridge Kendall Square specifically in San Francisco, Mission Bay and probably even South San Francisco now. What are tenants doing in these tighter submarkets when they need to expand? And is there any material sublease space that can serve as a buffer for these companies?","Joel Marcus","Tom, hi. Steve go ahead.","Stephen Richardson","Hi, this is Steve. Why don\u2019t I grab Cambridge first?","Joel Marcus","Sure.","Stephen Richardson","Yes, in Cambridge, the companies are scrambling. I mean they are having some challenges there. There\u2019s not a lot of sublease space available. There\u2019s a little bit. And there are \u2013 there\u2019s not a lot of space under construction. We\u2019ve got a building 399 Binney, where we\u2019ve just finished negotiating a letter of intent for the balance of that building.","We\u2019ve had some tenant reconfiguration happening at Tech Square. And on the one Kendall Square campus, we benefited from the tightness Tom by the \u2013 verge in the case of one Kendall Square, where we\u2019ve had a number of spaces, where we\u2019ve been able to early terminate some tenants or reconfigure their leases.","So that we can access space for the many tenants who are looking for a space in the market right now. And there\u2019s been some movement to other submarkets as lease out space, Watertown, the Austin section of Boston and some under the 128 Beltway and a couple to the Seaport. But there continues to be very strong demand.","We continue to take meetings with groups that are looking out three and four years now, because that\u2019s when the next delivery opportunities for new construction are occurring. And people are cognizant of the tightness of the market and therefore, they\u2019re planning further and further ahead.","Joel Marcus","Yes, I would echo very much what Tom said. We see certainly a strong impetus for early renewals, that\u2019s just an imperative for these companies to lock down space oftentimes they\u2019ve invested significant capital into the space. We\u2019ve also seen that they are locking down adjacent blocks of space after the existing tenant lease expiration date.","So forward committing to space two and three years down the road. And then finally, for the tenants that are ultimately displaced, we\u2019ve been able to relocate a number of them in other facilities. South San Francisco is a good example at 681 Gateway to relocate and expand companies. So we\u2019re in daily contact with these tenants through our operating teams and it\u2019s a high-class problem. But it is something we work hard at every day. I hand it over to Peter.","Peter Moglia","Hey, Tom, it\u2019s Peter Moglia. Just anecdotally, when you ask that question, the Seattle life science market is super tight as well. And one thing that we\u2019ve seen is Juno continues to grow even after being acquired by Celgene and they actually have moved back into the building, they moved out of as a strategy to expand. So just another thing that you can do today with new product being delivered is reoccupy your old product.","Tom Catherwood","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Joel Marcus","Thank you.","Operator","And our question comes from Rich Anderson from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","Richard Anderson","Thanks. Good afternoon. So I might have missed this, but what precluded providing, at least, an estimate of return for a few of your first quarter acquisitions? If it was said, I apologize, but I missed the rationale there?","Peter Moglia","The disclosures in our incremental package on acquisitions are included on page four.","Richard Anderson","Yes.","Peter Moglia","Most of the returns that are available have been disclosed. I can tell you that we\u2019re working up the returns on the greater Stanford asset, as well as Quince Orchard. They are in process. And I think the\u2026","Richard Anderson","What about those specific investments make them a little bit less visible at this point in time?","Peter Moglia","We are looking at multiple scenarios in the Stanford asset, which could modify the returns just a tad\u2026","Joel Marcus","Lab or office\u2026","Richard Anderson","Okay.","Peter Moglia","You\u2019ll find that the return is going to be in line with what you would expect for that market and then 704 Quince Orchard same thing. We\u2019re working through different alternatives there, but I think you\u2019ll find that the returns are solid. And we will publish them at the right time, so stay tuned.","Richard Anderson","Okay. Dean you and I had a little conversation about this earlier in the week. But I thought I\u2019d just put on the record a little bit. In terms of the same-store pool, can you talk about how that that collection of assets is adjusted from one period to the next? And if you could provide any sort of data on how that might actually move the number around if it does at all by virtue of the fact that it\u2019s not a consistent pool from year-to-year?","Peter Moglia","Yes, I think, this goes back to Manny and Michael in the report that Citi issued probably about six months ago talking about\u2026","Richard Anderson","I did not read that report no offense to Manny and Michael, so I just can\u2019t.","Peter Moglia","Yes, so I just want to \u2013 it\u2019s\u2026","Joel Marcus","It wasn\u2019t that good actually. It was highlighting best practices around reporting and they did touch on the lot of great things we did. But what they did to highlight broadly for the REIT sectors that there is some disparity in same-property methodology.","I do want to first say that we\u2019ve been very consistent on how we report our same-property pool, including a full reconciliation of the properties that are included and excluded. In fact, we did that one step further for multiple years. We actually showed the same-property performance calculation on three different methods just to give the investment community some sense that there are alternatives. And we think we\u2019ve chosen the most conservative, meaning, the less \u2013 the least inflated type of methodology, meaning, that will drive the least amount of spikes upward in performance.","Now getting to your question those same-property pool, we\u2019ve looked at it consistently in the reporting period, Rich, and that period could be a quarter, or it could be a year-to-date or a full year period. And it\u2019s applied in a sense that the asset has to be operating consistently for the entirety of the full period.","Richard Anderson","Okay.","Joel Marcus","Now the way, I think, the investment community and Michael and Manny highlighted it in their report was there was \u2013 they were asking the question. If you take the sum of four quarters, if the quarterly pulls are slightly different than the annual pull, do you get the same results for the full-year? We looked back just out of curiosity to see that what would change. It turned out there would have been a slight difference to 2017 same-property performance, slight \u2013 very slight, directionally the same message. And coincidentally for 2016 and 2015, absolutely no change in the overall performance for cash and GAAP.","So long way of saying, I think, we\u2019re looking carefully at the question you\u2019ve posed, Rich, to be sure that not only do we develop best practices in our disclosure here, but it also that the market evolves to a methodology that just makes sense for same-property performance. So we\u2019re monitoring it and stay tuned is the best thing I could say.","Richard Anderson","Okay. Last question, Joel, you alluded to more announcements to come. I\u2019m not asking you to front run those announcements. But could you maybe give us a timeline and any kind of teaser on that at all?","Joel Marcus","Oh, they will be probably over the \u2013 and let\u2019s see, we\u2019re in the second quarter, so during the second quarter would be a fair timeframe.","Richard Anderson","Okay, great. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Yep, thank you.","Operator","And our next question come from Jamie Feldman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jamie Feldman","Great. Thank you. I know you had commented on the management changes and you guys have all worked as a team for a long time. But can you just give a little bit more clarity on the division of responsibility across the different levels in the C-suite?","Joel Marcus","So the \u2013 if what you\u2019re asking is and I think, we\u2019ve shared this with \u2013 probably we spoke to almost every analyst, I think, after the announcements came out. I think, we said that just generally speaking, Steve would take over the bulk of my responsibilities on the investor outreach and so forth. And team with Dean on that and he would be granular in certain specific regions beyond San Francisco, which he does now.","And Peter would be focused heavily as he is now in his role as CIO with all of the leasing and much of the internal growth, as well as acquisition and obviously, on the underwriting. And so I think, that\u2019s broadly and he would be focused on a set of separate regions. So if you look at those things that take up the bulk of our time, that\u2019s kind of where the allocation of responsibility is.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And what about at the President level? Has anything changed there?","Joel Marcus","Yes, I think we said that both Dean and Tom would broaden their responsibilities and spend additional time in other regions for Tom. And for Dean, who would be more granular with some of the regional teams than he has been strictly in his role as Chief Financial Officer.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then it sounds like there\u2019s more to come just as we think about this year and even next year just incremental cost from the plan by the time all the dust has settled and all the change certainly?","Joel Marcus","Yes. So I think \u2013 yes, so I think we\u2019ve said we\u2019ve shared with the analysts and we\u2019ve certainly shared with a number of investors who followed up with us. And I think Dean has been very, I thought pretty good in trying to explain it. There\u2019s virtually no change in G&A for 2018.","What I did was I reduced my long-term incentive stock comp by 50% and much of that was allocated between Steve and Peter. So that there would not be any direct increase or hit to G&A. And I think Dean has had a fair statement that literally there is no change. And I think G&A as a percentage of revenues today still remains in broadly the 8% range. So I think, Dean, you had something to comment?","Dean Shigenaga","Yes, it\u2019s \u2013 G&A has been pretty consistent, guys. It\u2019s roughly in the 60 basis point range as a percentage of total assets as an example. And no real significant G&A impact from the announcements of the executive changes.","So I think the way to think about it too is, if you have to go outside and bring in a CEO, that\u2019s where you actually load up and hire an additional executive to the team, which also somewhat suggest that compensation at the executive level for the front runners would be far off the mark for them even to step into that role. So we\u2019re uniquely situated here with highly experienced executives, as you guys well know. And so there wasn\u2019t a big step up on comp matters here across the Board.","Joel Marcus","Yes. And in my case, I thought Steve was probably worth it and Peter was not, but that\u2019s just the way it ends up.","Peter Moglia","The government already took mine.","Jamie Feldman","All right, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","You\u2019re welcome.","Jamie Feldman","And then just to focus on some of the 2018 deliveries and even the 2019 deliveries that when you look at lease plus negotiation, you\u2019re still looking at kind of less than 50%. So 5 Lab Drive, 9900 Medical Center and 279 East Grand. Can you just give us an update on leasing there, at least, tenant interest there?","Stephen Richardson","Yes, Jamie, it\u2019s Steve. Again, out of that 2.3 million square feet, 2018 and 2019, we are 81% leased. So may be drilling down on 279 East Grand, Verily has taken 49% of the project. We\u2019re fielding multiple offers for the property, so the demand is very high.","I would expect we\u2019ll be very selective and throughout the year have that fully resolved 681 Gateway in South San Francisco, similar situation, Twist Bioscience has anchored the project, fielding multiple offers as well. And it\u2019s a range of small tenants, as well as additional pharma companies looking to enter the market.","So overall, I\u2019d say, we\u2019re very bullish there. And then looking at 1818 Fairview up in Seattle, the negotiations are going well, as well as groups behind that kind of leading getting anchor there.","Joel Marcus","And on 5 Laboratory, I would say, there\u2019s a fair amount of interest. We don\u2019t deliver that till the end of the year. And we expect it is unique in that part of the world kind of the center of ag tech in the United States. And there\u2019s virtually no available first-class campus for office lab and greenhouse.","Peter Moglia","I\u2019ll finish up. 399 Binney has more demand than the space. We have that \u2013 the last 11% is highly competitive right now. So we\u2019re settling on who\u2019s going to take that. And then last one would be 9900 Medical Center Drive, a redevelopment that we have now 58% under negotiation. So we\u2019re progressing as we believe they would.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. All right, Thanks and congratulations to everyone.","Joel Marcus","Thank you.","Stephen Richardson","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Jed Reagan","Hey, good afternoon, guys. Just a follow-up on Sheila\u2019s question from earlier. One of your office REIT peers spoke this morning about their plans to target life science tenants for a development on Manhattan\u2019s Far West Side near Penn Station. Just curious if you think there\u2019s a legs to lab demand in that part of the city? And are you studying expansion into that part of town?","Dean Shigenaga","Yes, I think that you have to remember and the group probably is a very noteworthy developer. But I think the thing that you learn is, New York is really a \u2013 an early-stage life science cluster. It really originated out of academic and clinical expertise, but lacked really the \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have lots of management teams that have done this before. It\u2019s got much better risk capital, venture capital in the early-stage than it had when we started about a dozen years ago there, but still you can\u2019t compare it even in the world to San Francisco or Cambridge.","So primarily the New York market as it turns out and we\u2019ve been at it now eight years and to build a cluster like that, to be a secondary cluster, it will never be a primary cluster, it\u2019s about a generation, it\u2019s about a 25 year process and the real thrust there is really very early stage seed and Series A stage companies spinning out of academic medical centers, those are the companies where there is activity. You aren\u2019t going to bring a big pharma like you do in the Cambridge with hundreds of thousands of square feet, it just will not happen in Manhattan.","So I think that people may tell what they\u2019re trying to do, but unless they understand the market, unless they are able to handle the market, I think it\u2019s going be hard going for them, because it\u2019s just a very different market and a very different ecosystem in which it grows and that\u2019s why you find virtually no other places in the United States outside of the Seattle, San Francisco, San Diego, Cambridge, New York in its early-stage, the Maryland, North Carolina, a lot of places want to do this, but it\u2019s very, very difficulty, it\u2019s literally next to impossible and people want to be in clusters where they can actually ramp up and hire people and hiring in New York City is possible, but it\u2019s still hard.","Jed Reagan","That\u2019s very interesting, thank you for that. And there were media reports recently that Alexandria was bidding for Santa Monica Business Park before one of your peers acquired it. To the extend you are able to discuss it, was there a potential lab conversion play there or were you interested in that asset more from a creative office perspective sort of tech office perspective and maybe in general what\u2019s your appetite to grow in LA and do you see any momentum in that market from a life science perspective?","Peter Moglia","Hey Jed, it\u2019s Peter, look, that is a great asset and we definitely felt it was worth looking, and it\u2019s in our backyard, but to refute some of the press we were not in the best and final round. We dropped out and forgot that, but yes we were looking at it as a potential laboratory play for a portion of it. LA is an interesting market as Joel just said, it can take a decade to build something. We\u2019ve been working on LA actually since the 90s and we\u2019ve seen some positive signs that there could be something a foot. So just to be ahead of the game, we\u2019re going to look at things like that that especially in locations that we think our client tenants would like to be in.","Jed Reagan","Great, I appreciate the comments.","Joel Marcus","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Karin Ford of MUFG Securities. Please go ahead.","Karin Ford","Hi good afternoon. Can you update us on what the current space requirements are in the market in Cambridge, San Francisco and San Diego?","Joel Marcus","When you say space required, you mean just what the demand looks like?","Karin Ford","Yes.","Stephen Richardson","Karin, hi this is Steve Richardson. Yes, in San Francisco right now we\u2019re tracking about 2.3 million square feet of lab demand, Cambridge is somewhat similar at about 2.5 million square feet of lab demand. Down in San Diego we\u2019ve got a 1 million square feet, up in Seattle about 650,000 square feet. In Maryland, as we\u2019ve been talking about for a while now has been recovering strongly, we have about 500,000 square feet of demand there. So, overall a very consistent healthy demand with prior years.","Karin Ford","Great, thanks for that.","Joel Marcus","And we would throw a footnote, in New York City for example, there is really no waiting line for lab space. It really is you have to take the spin outs one by one and if you\u2019re going to go after any more established companies to put outposts in New York, you actually have to go after them and pitch them, but there\u2019s no really established waiting line.","Karin Ford","Great, thanks for that. Have you started to see any positive impact from the tax cuts on your tenants?","Joel Marcus","Well, I think that a number of the companies both pharma and biotech have obviously had favorable impacts from tax reduction and repatriations that I\u2019m sure has fueled some of the M&A we\u2019ve seen here in the first quarter and probably will continue to see that. So I think in a sense that the margins we don\u2019t see any big demand coming out of that per se, because I would say that big pharma through their normal course of going after products when they have a product that\u2019s going through the pipeline and it looks very promising that tends to be the spur for expansion and I think a lot of those companies will use \u2013 they\u2019ll invest in their R&D and we\u2019ll see some expansion in the markets they are already in, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see anything hugely dramatic from that, but it\u2019s all positive that\u2019s for darn sure.","Karin Ford","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Marcus for any closing remarks.","Joel Marcus","Okay, well thank you everybody. We did it within an hour and appreciate it and talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you sir, today\u2019s conference has now concluded and we thank you all for attending today\u2019s presentation.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Rhonda Chiger. Please go proceed.","Rhonda Chiger","Good afternoon. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company\u2019s Form 10-K Annual Report and other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","And now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Joel Marcus. Please go ahead.","Joel Marcus","Thanks, Rhonda, and good afternoon everybody. Happy New Year and thank you for joining us today for the fourth quarter and 2011 year end call. With me today are Dean Shigenaga and Krupal Raval. We hope that you like the new format and content of our press release and supplement. Hopefully, it will be very informative as well as a more user-friendly and simpler to follow document.","As we look forward to 2012, it appears promising as the Dow reached 12,878 yesterday at the close, the highest since pre-Lehman in May 2008. 2012 will be an important year for Alexandria. We will begin the transition of our balance sheet from the bank debt \u2013 the long-term unsecured bank debt \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, long-term unsecured bond debt having received our investment grade ratings in mid-2011 from Moody\u2019s and S&P.","And as many of you remember, the keys to the ratings by the two agencies were the size and leadership vary within our life science sector and our markets, a well diversified asset base by geography and tenant, modest leverage, and the size and quality of our unencumbered asset pool, our ability to manage liquidity, our ability to handle higher funding costs and the health of our operations and leasing all of which I think have proved true in this reporting period.","We will continue our expansion domination of our key urban and CBD adjacency cluster markets with our unique and important first-in-class and first mover advantage. And I think this was clearly demonstrated by the breadth and depth of our fourth quarter of 2011 and 2011 full year leasing success. We look forward to on-boarding significant cash flows later in 2012, as we move strategic non-income producing assets to cash flowing operating assets.","From fourth quarter 2010 to fourth quarter 2011, we increased the \u2013 the board increased the dividend approximately 40%. It\u2019s likely the board will continue that approach of sharing increasing cash flows with our shareholders. As we proceed through 2012, it appears the fundamental drivers are in place to enable the continued expansion of the life science industry in our key cluster markets and for us to take advantage of that and certainly for Alexandria to continue to dominate and capture the plum requirements which we\u2019ve done in San Diego, Greater Boston, and South San Francisco this past year. We have more requirements today in some of our key cluster markets than we can actually handle, however, as we reduce our non-income producing assets, this will enable us to pursue more of these key opportunities.","We hope investors focus on the fundamentals of ARE as a very high quality, innovative company with uniquely built-in platform for growth in net operating income, earnings are best-in-class assets in irreplaceable locations with solid tenant demand for our unique lab space.","For 2011, again, we are very pleased and proud to report the highest leasing quarter and year in the history of the company. And again, it confirms I think the meaning and the impact of our leading franchise in the life science industry. For the fourth quarter, we leased over 1.1 million square feet and for the year about 3.4 million square feet, and almost 1 million square feet out of development and redevelopment.","We have a solid flow of requirements. This past year, the three biggest leases for development and redevelopment space were two in San Diego and one in Cambridge, of the 650,000 square feet of renewals and re-lease space, San Diego where we clearly dominate contribute about 50% and Greater Boston about 23%. For the 492,000 square feet of redevelopment and development space, San Diego contributed 51% and 21% for Greater Boston.","Some of the, I think, most notable leasing accomplishments certainly during the last quarter was the leasing of our new 43,000 square foot University Town Center Drive property. Our \u2013 the initiation, the leasing, and the initiation of our build-to-suit for Biogen Idec in East Cambridge are 100% pre-leasing of small build-to-suit for a top pharma, which we were really compelled to do in Canada. And the lease-up of from 43% to 91% of our flagship Campus Pointe asset in UTC, San Diego with an existing credit tenant in another market, but now one of our dominant tenants in San Diego is Celgene.","We like to address the fundamentals in three of our key life science cluster markets and our expectations for 2012. Going to San Francisco, Mission Bay remains tight with Nektar and Bayer exercising their options for a total of 30,000 square feet at our 455 Mission Bay property. Bayer\u2019s expansion was especially noteworthy as it again marks an overwhelming trend for big pharma to establish tight networks and close physical proximity to leading intellectual centers. As you remember, they exited the East Bay to move to Mission \u2013 their R&D to Mission Bay.","Mission Bay life science rates remain strong in the low 40s with about $125 square foot of generic infrastructure allowance over a shell and tenants contributing significant capital to complete their mission critical fit-ups.","2012 lease rollers are minimal with about \u2013 almost about 13,000 square feet of space and we\u2019re in discussions for 9,000 about. Regarding our flagship 499 Illinois project, we\u2019re engaged with some serious discussions and negotiations with a variety of technology companies and life science institutions, both seeking large blocks of space. I\u2019m hopeful we\u2019ll be able to beat both the time and the returns of our acquisition pro forma.","South San Francisco is growing a little bit stronger incrementally. We\u2019ve captured the majority of the market demand in the fourth quarter, including in a lawn expansion at the Gateway project. And a new cleantech company is leasing a block of space at our East Jamie Court project. We\u2019re also engaged in negotiations with two \u2013 final negotiations with two tenants that will stabilize the West building of the East Jamie and early negotiations with an existing tenant to take another floor in the East building, putting us on track to overall stabilize that building in the second half of 2012.","South San Francisco lease rates remain in the low 30s. Our lease rollovers in the sub market are about 100,000 square feet and we are working on negotiations and discussions about 75% of that space. The Stanford, Palo Alto, Mountain View market remains very tight and the overwhelming technology demand has really made that market \u2013 those markets pretty hot these days.","If we move to the Cambridge market, Cambridge market has been relatively steady and stable all year. Vacancy down to about 10% Class A. Although, Class A second-generation space is pretty scarce. Our major recent deals as you may know were Pfizer committing to MIT we had \u2013 we couldn\u2019t accommodate their size. We didn\u2019t have the space available and we did sign an important requirement for Mass General, a 15-year lease, 75,000 square feet, 400 Tech Square, and hopefully we are on our way to stabilizing that building before we deliver it.","Some other significant leases have been signed and tech demand in that market again strong. Right now we\u2019re tracking over 2.4 million square feet of demand both in the lab and in the office sector in Cambridge. Cambridge office market low 40s to mid 50s, on a gross basis East Cambridge Class A mid 50s to mid 60s and East Cambridge Class B and C low 40s to high 40s, so \u2013 and the suburbs kind of in the low 20s to mid 30s. So that market stays healthy and the continuing flight to the core cluster markets with Cambridge being benefited certainly continues with the larger tenants.","And then finally in San Diego, as we indicated Celgene more than doubled in size their San Diego footprint and we successfully leased 172,000 square feet to them at Campus Pointe. At the end of 2011, Alexandria was responsible for well over half of San Diego\u2019s annual lab space leasing activity. If we look at Torrey Pines today, our almost 0.75 million square feet, we\u2019ve got a vacancy rate of 10% and headed down, rental rates are in the mid to high 30%s; in the University Town Center, our 1.3 million square feet, we\u2019ve got a vacancy rate of about 3.4%, and again a very strong and solid market.","So with that kind of color on a little bit of a preview of 2012 and a little bit of hindsight review of 2011, let me turn it over to Dean to give you pretty detailed color on the quarter as well.","Dean Shigenaga","Thanks, Joel. Let me just open up with results. FFO per share diluted was reported at $1.10 for the fourth quarter and overall in line with our expectations. Earnings per share diluted was $0.44. Total revenues were up $14 million over the fourth quarter of 2010 and almost $88 million over 2010. NOI for the fourth quarter was $101.8 million. It was up about $7.3 million over the fourth quarter of 2010 and about $0.01 over the third quarter of 2011, and really was reflected of the expected decline in NOI related to the completed rollover and start of the full redevelopment of two assets, 1551 Eastlake in Seattle and 400 Technology Square in Cambridge.","Looking forward into the first quarter of 2012, NOI is expected to be flat when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 for the following reasons. Overall, we\u2019re expecting 100 basis point to 150 basis point decline in overall occupancy by March 31, primarily driven by occupancy dips in South San Francisco, Boston and Suburban Washington D.C. Occupancy in South San Francisco and Boston are expected to recover by 3Q, with occupancy gains in Maryland requiring a little bit more time. Overall, we anticipate our total occupancy by December 31, 2012 to be in the range of 94% to 95%.","In summary, NOI is expected to be flat from 4Q into 1Q, up slightly into the second quarter and into the third quarter, and up significantly in the fourth quarter of 2012 as we\u2019ve expected.","G&A was about $10.6 million and above our expectations for the fourth quarter. The higher G&A was really related to professional fees and consulting, some of which related to training for new systems placed into service related to paperless invoice processing software, GO and property management and ADP payroll related software implementations. We also had a small amount of dead deal costs in the quarter, some domestic and some international.","Moving to the balance sheet briefly with some comments on our overall balance sheet strategy and capital strategy. Starting with bank debt, over the next few years we remain focused on the transition from variable rate medium term bank debt to longer term fixed rate unsecured bonds. However, long term, some bank debt will be a component of our capital structure, primarily consisting of our unsecured line of credit for liquidity and flexibility and bank term loans when appropriate.","Variable rate debt from our unsecured line of credit will be used to fund construction activity short-term, and ultimately financed with longer term capital. Construction loans may be utilized from time to time. And in the interim, like we did in December, interest rate hedge agreements will be used to mitigate interest rate risk. Near and medium term, we will transition variable rate bank debt to fixed rate debt.","A small amount of secured debt will always be part of our long-term capital structure. Pricing today remains very attractive and will remain part of our sources of capital when appropriate. With our investment grade ratings, we can tap an important new source of longer term fixed rate capital, and accordingly we expect to be a periodic issuer of unsecured notes.","Perpetual preferred stock will remain a key component of our long-term capital structure. However, we also believe that our 8.375% Series E preferred stock can ultimately be refinanced with lower cost long-term capital.","JV capital has not been a significant component of our capital structure, but remains a real opportunity for the right transaction. However, we do not expect this to become a significant component of our capital structure. Asset dispositions will continue to provide capital for reinvestment. Common equity, whether traditional follow-on or through an ATM type program, will be considered as necessary to balance our use of incremental capital over time.","We remain committed to lower leverage. Our debt-to-EBITDA is projected to be slightly plus or minus seven times for the fourth quarter of 2012. This leverage metric will benefit from the significant amount of NOI and EBITDA contribution beginning in the third quarter of 2012 and ramping up significantly in the fourth quarter from the delivery of our significantly leased redevelopment and development projects. We expect over time to improve debt-to-EBITDA to a target of 6.5 times.","Our goal is to maintain greater than 50% availability under our $1.5 billion unsecured line of credit. Over the long term, we expect our outstanding balance under our line of credit to move closer toward 25% or less, similar to most investment grade rates. Our goal is also to maintain a laddered maturity profile. Our current debt maturities over the next four years are very manageable.","Additionally, our goal is to lower non-income producing assets to 15% or less of our gross investment in real estate. Our current active development and redevelopment projects aggregate about 7% of our gross investment in real estate. And the completion and delivery of these projects, again a significant amount of which is scheduled for delivery in the fourth quarter, will transition these into income-producing assets.","Briefly let me comment on the bond market. As we all know, 2012 to-date has shown several positive trends in the investment grade unsecured bond market. The fed recently announced their commitment to low interest rates into 2014. The European headlines have not spooked the market as frequently as the second half of 2011. And Treasuries has rallied and dropped meaningfully. REIT bond spreads have also tightened meaningfully. As a result, a few REITs had very successful bond deals this year.","We remain optimistic with recent market trends and would like our bond offering to occur sooner than later. We are also cautious that the market is still subject to volatility from the European crisis and other major headline news.","Our guidance for FFO per share and EPS does not include a bond offering since it\u2019s difficult to predict the timing and pricing for a debut issuer. All indications support a meaningful tightening of pricing for ARE, but ultimately pricing will be determined based on market conditions when the event occurs.","In December, we executed interest rate swaps lowering our unhedged variable rate debt from 51% as of 9\/30 to 21%. Our goal was to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk in the interim, while also leaving an appropriate amount of unhedged variable rate debt in our projections in order to allow for the transition of bank debt to longer term fixed rate debt.","The $1 billion of additional swaps in effect for 2012 fixed one month LIBOR at approximately 48 basis points to 49 basis points. When combined with the existing $450 million of swaps in effect, the aggregate $1.45 billion of notional amount of swaps in effect for 2012 fixed one month LIBOR at 1.5% through September 30, at which point certain swap contracts terminate.","Going forward, our unhedged variable rate debt may hover around 20%, and occasionally approaching the high 20% range. This will provide us flexibility to transition from variable rate bank debt to longer term fixed rate debt. Subsequent to December, in January we retired about $84 million of our 3.7% convertible notes, leaving us with approximately $1 million outstanding today.","Moving next to our value-added opportunities, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noted that our revised supplemental presents value-added development and redevelopment projects and provides significant detail on key projects making up the majority of our projected construction spend for 2012.","As shown in our supplemental, approximately 80% of our 2012 projected redevelopment and development construction cost is related to certain developments and certain urban redevelopment projects with an estimated stabilized yield of approximately 7.5% on a cash basis and 8.2% on a GAAP basis. The remaining 20% is related to suburban and other redevelopment projects, and projects in this category will generate stabilized yields ranging up to 8% on a cash basis.","Our total estimate of construction cost to complete related to our construction projects increased about $15 million since our Investor Day in December 7. We also updated the timing of certain payments between 2012 and thereafter, resulting in a shift of approximately $25 million of anticipated cost from thereafter into 2012. Additionally, the amounts presented at Investor Day separately presented indirect project costs like capped interest from our estimates of construction cost to complete.","In our supplemental package, we added these indirect costs to our estimate of total construction cost to complete. And keep in mind, this update only impacted our projected spend in aggregate. In putting the numbers together, our estimates of stabilized yields for active redevelopment and development projects included indirect project cost and have not changed since our Investor Day presentation.","Lastly, let me cover our guidance for 2012. We updated FFO per share diluted to $4.50 and $4.54, no change since our previous guidance. Earnings per share diluted was updated to $1.73 to $1.77.","Our guidance included the following assumptions, all of which are highlighted on page 16. Same property NOI performance, cash, is expected to be up 3% to 5%; GAAP up 0% to 2%. Rental rate steps on lease renewals and re-leasing of space, cash, slightly negative to slightly positive; GAAP up 0 \u2013 up to 5%. Straight-line rents are averaging $6.5 million per quarter with amounts each quarter declining from the $9.6 million run rate in the fourth quarter of 2011.","The largest single property decline in straight-line rent from fourth quarter to the first quarter is related to the East Tower in New York. And that property generates about $1.2 million decline in straight-line rent, obviously with a corresponding increase in cash rents really related to the burn-off of free rent there on that project. FAS 141 amortization is projected to be about $800,000 per quarter. G&A expenses overall for 2012, compared to 2011, will be up about 5% to 8%. Capped interest is expected to be in a range between $54 million and $60 million and is dependent on timing of construction activities. And interest expense, net of capped interest, will range between $68 million and $75 million.","Again, due to the significant amount of rentable square feet under redevelopment and development that is leased \u2013 projected to be leased, placed in service and contributing to NOI and EBITDA by the fourth quarter of 2012, we have also provided a range of guidance for certain items for the fourth quarter.","Our guidance is as follows: NOI in the range of $111 million to $113 million, up from the $101.8 million as of the fourth quarter; G&A in the range of $10 million to $11 million; net interest cost in the range of $20.1 million to $23.1 million; aggregate FFO in the range of $71.7 million to $74.1 million; and an FFO per share diluted in the range of $1.16 to $1.20.","In closing, I just want to clearly remind everybody that our projected NOI is flat into the first quarter of 2012, a nominal increase into the second quarter and then into the third quarter as well, with most of the increase in NOI occurring in the fourth quarter of 2012.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Joel.","Joel Marcus","Thanks, Dean. And operator, we\u2019ll be happy to open up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Sure, no problem. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Sheila McGrath from KBW. Please proceed.","Sheila McGrath \u2013 KBW","Yes, good afternoon. Joel, you did give a lot of detail on the markets, but I was wondering if you could characterize the demand picture, how you see it now versus a year ago and which markets you would categorize as strongest and which weakest.","Joel Marcus","Yeah, Sheila, will be happy to try to do that. So I think just kind of going around the country quickly, in Seattle and I \u2013 boy, a year ago is a little hard to remember, but I think the demand there has been I think quiet, it\u2019s been selective, more focused on the institutional side and I think it has been a pretty busy time for tech there with Amazon leading the way. I would indicate that market is \u2013 they\u2019ve held rental rates, but I would say demand is kind of average. In the San Francisco Bay Area, again a little hard to remember exactly a year ago, but I think Mission Bay we\u2019re seeing more on the tech demand and institutional demand.","At this point, South San Francisco, we\u2019re seeing more on the biotech demand. I think we\u2019ve been pleased that although that market has been slower and more lethargic because of Roche\u2019s really re-evaluation of the integration of Genentech, so previously Genentech was really growing like crazy, Roche has really rationalized that. They\u2019ve moved a lot of people into their campus in South San Francisco, but we haven\u2019t seen any real new requirements from them. But we\u2019re seeing activity in biotech and cleantech and we\u2019ve managed to capture most of those requirements. The Palo Alto area, we\u2019re full. And Mountain View has been strong heavily in the tech area and also a number of life science.","Down in San Diego, I think we\u2019ve indicated that market has really come back pretty dramatically over the last 12 months, not only due to the market itself, but I think the integration of the Veralliance team has really benefited us greatly, and they\u2019ve executed in a marvelous fashion. We\u2019re seeing requirements down there institutionally biotech, cleantech product and service companies, not so much pharma, and that market remains very strong for us.","Cambridge has been I think continually followed all year. No dramatic change. As I said, we\u2019re tracking some pretty big tech and life science demands today and so that market has held well. New York, we\u2019re full up there. We\u2019re literally 100% occupied and talking to a number of folks for a potential West Tower kick-off as we look into the future, not sure what the timing of that might be at this point, but we\u2019re having some very serious discussions.","I\u2019d say Suburban D.C. that market has been challenging. I think with the cutback in the NIA or cut back I should say in the overall budget. NIH is flat for the year and that\u2019s good. There\u2019s no cut for this year. We still see less requirements obviously out of the government side. We just see a number of tenants really looking at current and future requirements, but nothing new dramatic entering that particular market.","And then I think Research Triangle Park, we\u2019re seeing a number of small tenants, nothing dramatic there. So I\u2019d say that market remains quiet, but promising on the institutional side. So if that\u2019s helpful, that\u2019s kind of a quick (inaudible).","Sheila McGrath \u2013 KBW","Yeah, that\u2019s great. One other question for Dean, I guess. Same-store expenses in the quarter were pretty high and I was just wondering if you could give us more detail on what was driving that and your outlook for 2012?","Dean Shigenaga","Well, OpEx, I think has been up primarily from utilities and some winter-related matters, whether it was the storm on the East Coast or snow removal matters. Most of those costs because of our triple net nature of our portfolio are passed through to our tenants, so it\u2019s recovered. Although OpEx may highlight in the same-store pool as fairly meaningful increase on year-over-year, those costs are borne by the tenants substantially. And that would be true for 2012. Hard to predict how summer or winter weather patterns impact utility cost, but again the same thing would occur. Any increase or decrease in those operating expenses are absorbed by our tenants.","Sheila McGrath \u2013 KBW","Okay. Thank you.","Dean Shigenaga","Thank you, Sheila.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Habermann from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Jay Habermann \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Good afternoon. Dean, maybe just starting with the occupancy and sort of the outline that you gave, you mentioned the decline going into the start of the year. Can you talk about the pickup? I guess should we assume that it recovers evenly throughout the year, or do you think this will be much more back-end weighted as you pick up occupancy?","Dean Shigenaga","I think you\u2019ll see some occupancy improvement in those three submarkets going into the second quarter and that\u2019s really between South San Francisco and Boston. Both of those markets, I think being substantially recovered as we get into the third quarter. Maryland just given the dynamic in the Maryland market being much quieter market than Cambridge as an example. I think that might take a little bit more time. But again, by the end of the year, overall, we expect to be relatively in the range of where we are, again, in the 94% to 95% range.","Joel Marcus","Yeah. And part of that\u2019s driven, Jay, by \u2013 we\u2019ve got two significant roles in the Maryland market coming up in the second quarter, one tenant that\u2019s exiting and another tenant that we\u2019re still unsure of, and then we\u2019ve have got one roll in South San Francisco we\u2019re working on. So, there are a number of rolls that have figured into how Dean has kind of given that guidance and kind of the flow from early in the year to late in the year. But, we\u2019re pretty confident outside of the Maryland market that we will be able to either re-lease or backfill space pretty successfully. We certainly have done it over the past few years.","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah. And I think in my \u2013 our last call comments, last quarter also highlighted that in Boston, we have temporary downtime on some space that rolled and was re-leased. So it is subject to a lease today and that will be delivered in September I believe and it\u2019s about 25,000 square feet.","Jay Habermann \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And maybe just following on that, in terms of your outlook for CapEx, can you talk about tenant improvement and leasing costs for the year? I mean clearly the rate for 2011 increased versus 2010, but help put into perspective I guess the fourth quarter run rate?","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah, I think if you look \u2013 I think you are referring to generally speaking page 23 of our supplemental, which highlights our leasing activity for the year. And on the renewals, we\u2019re averaging just under $6 a foot both on TIs and leasing commissions and then closer to $13 on previously vacant space, whether that was inclusive of redevelopment or development. I would generally expect the dollars to remain in the range. And I think in our 10-K, we gave a pretty good summary of CapEx in TIs leasing cost related to the renewals and re-leasing the space and they generally over five-year average stay within a fairly narrow, fairly small bandwidth. I don\u2019t expect 2012 to be meaningfully different from our historical averages.","Jay Habermann \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And maybe just to dig a bit deeper on 499 Illinois, you mentioned the activity and I guess the tech tenants there, do you expect this to be something you could announce in the first half of the year, I guess, in our tenants looking at the full space or is this just a portion of the space?","Joel Marcus","The answer to the first question is that would be our hope. We don\u2019t know for sure, in this our initial tenant would be a three floor tenant. And then, potentially a follow-on would take up the rest of the buildings. So, we\u2019re potentially looking at two tenants.","Jay Habermann \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Yeah, thanks J.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Feldman from Bank of America. Please proceed.","Jamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America","Great. Thank you. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about what you\u2019ve seen recently in terms of tech demand versus life sciences demand and how you guys are thinking about in your main markets maybe tipping the portfolio exposure more towards tech, given the demand prospects for that sector? And how you guys are just kind of thinking about it internally?","Joel Marcus","Yeah. That\u2019s actually a pretty great question. I think that we are a life science niche focused REIT obviously. So we\u2019re not trying to change what we are and who we are. But I think as you have significant projects in a number of markets, for example, the Binney Street development, we are looking at \u2013 I\u2019m just looking right now there outside of lab there is over 1 million square feet of today demand for tech.","So, for us to look at in learning our return hurdles, how we might lease to a tech user if there is 1.1 million square feet of demand that\u2019s real, and we are looking at that, how that might work from a rental rate that would obviously be somewhat lower than the lab rate, but at a tenant improvement allowance \u2013 infrastructure allowance that would be considerably less versus a lab tenant. I think we have to just look at it on a case-by-case basis.","We have no real desire to change the tenant base in the portfolio. I think as we look at 499 Illinois, we are mindful that with sales force taking down 2.1 million square feet there that has created a new kind of hotbed of tech tenant interest, south of market is pretty much on fire as you know certainly from other calls, I\u2019m sure.","So, we just have to pay attention. Our goal is obviously to have a highest quality tenants with the strongest cash flow in place. And if at any given point in time, we\u2019ve got a tenant that it makes sense then we are likely to consider that as opposed to just hold out for the right lab tenants. But I don\u2019t think you see any big fundamental strategic shift, it really is a building-by-building basis. We\u2019re in a kind of a tech bubble of sorts, I\u2019m sure when the Facebook IPO comes to market, it will be even be even more poignant.","But these are as you remember many years ago from the Internet boom we saw, I remember when Speaker reported I think something like rates going from $1 or $2 to maybe as highest $10 or $12 bucks a foot and then a year or two later they collapse. So, we are mindful that that\u2019s a pretty up and down market, but we\u2019ll take advantage of it selectively in the best way we know how.","Jamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America","Are you \u2013 I mean to your last point, my understanding is the biggest difference now, you\u2019ve got companies that are cash flowing. I mean, do you really believe that we are getting close to a bubble in terms of the fundamentals and the economics of leases?","Joel Marcus","Well, I think from a valuation standpoint, I kind of believe that. We were talking this morning when you look at Facebook that maybe a 100 times earnings that probably when you compare that to Google or other companies that are out there, Apple and so forth, that have had stellar operating histories, it seems to strike, U.S. being a little bit unusual but that\u2019s kind of the further of the unknown.","But I think again, our view is the tech is \u2013 the intersection of tech and pharma and bio is important, because these are all core knowledge markets. And I think we\u2019ll remain in these markets and we\u2019ll take advantage of that sector as best we can, but we\u2019re not focused on diversifying into the tech sector as a major strategic change.","Jamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America","And when you think about your most active tech markets, I mean is there a material delta between the kind of yield you can have based on where tech rents are and the kind of build-out you would need to do versus biotech, or life sciences?","Joel Marcus","Yeah. I mean I think it\u2019s pretty fair to say that in Mission Bay and in Cambridge, those numbers penciled pretty favorably. We haven\u2019t really been faced with it up in Seattle, nor in San Diego, nor in Maryland, or New York, or Research Triangle Park. But I\u2019d say in the Bay Area and in Cambridge those are compelling opportunities. I remember when we did Google\u2019s first campus, we had a redevelopment, a sale leaseback we did with FIOS-NOVA that ultimately got bought, but we bought their campus.","Google came in and paid us, this is back in 1997, 1998 kind of an obscene amount, because they wanted that campus in Mountain View that was our first foothold. They ended up getting all of the infrastructure, and it turned out to be great deal for them and for us. So again, we just have to be opportunistic and play our cards the best we can, but we\u2019re not focused on creating a tech sector portfolio.","Jamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America","Okay, thanks. And then just for Dean. I\u2019m curious what \u2013 I noticed there was an increase in the straight-line rent assumption in the 2012 guidance, but the FFO outlook is flat from the prior guidance. I\u2019m just curious what that was? And I apologize if you already said it.","Dean Shigenaga","It was \u2013 Jamie, I think you\u2019re picking up on a change from $6 million to $6.5 million. It was really rounding more than anything. Nothing really drove the difference significantly.","Jamie Feldman \u2013 Bank of America","Okay. All right, thank you.","Joel Marcus","Yep. Thank you, Jamie.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Martin from Morningstar. Please proceed.","Philip Martin \u2013 Morningstar","Good afternoon.","Joel Marcus","Hi there.","Philip Martin \u2013 Morningstar","I wanted to just talk a little bit about leasing terms. Has there been any meaningful changes in leasing terms given what appears to be still a rather challenging environment out there? Are you seeing any meaningful changes?","Joel Marcus","Well, I think what is striking is in a number of the build-to-suits or redevelopments that we\u2019re working on, I think you\u2019re seeing substantially long lease terms. We\u2019re able to achieve 10, 15 and even 20 years, these are from bigger well-capitalized entities, whether they\u2019d be big biotech, obviously pharma or institutional. I think some of the meat and potatoes leases that run from small-to-medium still are three, five, seven years. So that hasn\u2019t substantially changed based on the size of the space and based on the size of the entity.","Philip Martin \u2013 Morningstar","Okay. And you\u2019re not giving more \u2013 I mean you\u2019re negotiating leverages still more or less the same as it was, before challenging times?","Joel Marcus","Well, I would say if we\u2019re talking about 2006, 2007, I would say, no I think today is tougher. And I think occasionally there are landlords in the market that are willing to do things that we normally wouldn\u2019t consider rational, so we have to be mindful of that. And \u2013 but I would say, although we had a spectacular quarter and really year from a leasing standpoint, it\u2019s never easy and it\u2019s always challenging. And I think boards of entities, whether they be big pharma, big biotech, institutional boards, smaller company boards are all mindful. We\u2019re in a \u2013 we are still in a tough macro environment and people aren\u2019t making dumb decisions. So, I think, we just have to be very, very careful, very competitive and focused. But we have on occasion decided if a tenant wanted a certain opportunity or wanted a certain situation and we just felt it wasn\u2019t worth it or our underwriting of the tenant that\u2019s happened recently didn\u2019t justify economics that a tenant wanted, we just passed on the deal.","Philip Martin \u2013 Morningstar","Okay, okay. Okay.","Joel Marcus","But I say it\u2019s tougher today than it was in 2007 for sure.","Philip Martin \u2013 Morningstar","Yeah. I mean it dovetails a bit to that CapEx question or your CapEx went up a bit. I know there were a tenant or two there from the dot-com era, et cetera, but just looking at trends generally and again, just trying to...","Joel Marcus","Yeah. It\u2019s hard to know because, again a lot of bigger tenants tend to want to put their own capital in but it varies actually lease \u2013 it truly varies lease-by-lease.","Philip Martin \u2013 Morningstar","And lastly, how has the confidence among your tenants changed if at all even in the last six months, are you having any incremental discussions with tenants on more redevelopment or expansion opportunities? I mean, obviously from what you said in your opening remarks, it sounds like you have almost it\u2019s a high-grade problem, more internal growth opportunities than you can almost handle?","Joel Marcus","Right. I think the difference is and Phillip, you know the sector well, let me just break it down by groups. In the pharma area, you have specific requirements, a specific requirement like Pfizer had coming out Groton or Pearl River and they\u2019re looking for 250,000 square feet for that specific requirement. So, we see specific requirements in pharma generally moving a group or starting up a group into a clustered location. So, that\u2019s a dynamic.","In the biotech sector, when you have a clinical milestone or a regulatory approval made, obviously the need to them take down whether it be additional space or shift what they may be doing becomes very milestone driven and so we\u2019ve seen that. And then, in the smaller companies, it really is just milestone driven as they begin to grow up and their funding is tied to milestones whether it would be on the private side or the public side, we see those just develop again based on a milestone-related situation.","So, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fundamentally changed in the institutional side. It usually is again a specific requirement funded by whether it would be bond funds or a particular gift. A deal we signed in the New York happened to be endowed and so when the endowment was made for the long-term that requirement then got generated and we were able to secure it. So, I think those things fundamentally haven\u2019t changed so much, maybe the pharma situation has changed more over the past couple of years than anything else.","Philip Martin \u2013 Morningstar","How about from universities? Certainly this economy has caused a lot of groups to rethink strategies. Is Alexandria having \u2013 are you being approached by universities to help them manage a growth platform in biotech or life sciences or something similar?","Joel Marcus","Yes, unequivocally, yes.","Philip Martin \u2013 Morningstar","Okay, okay. Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you very much.","Joel Marcus","Yeah. No, thanks, Phil.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum from UBS. Please proceed.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","Hi, good afternoon guys.","Joel Marcus","Hi, Ross.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","Just a couple of questions here. First, in the supplement we appreciate all the new disclosure. On page 33, on the development \u2013 redevelopment schedule, you\u2019ve got a sort of all the way to the bottom about $215 million worth of suburban and other redevelopment projects. But there is notably no stabilized yield listed there. Can you give us a sense of what\u2019s the return on that capital?","Joel Marcus","Yeah. I think, Dean suggested that\u2019s about 20% of the total I believe of the redevelopment and returns range. Generally, I\u2019d say mid-single digit to high-single digit. That\u2019s kind of where those are there a number of smaller projects, but that\u2019s kind of typical.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","Was there a specific reason that that was left all stable?","Joel Marcus","It\u2019s just a lot of detail for a lot \u2013 we\u2019re trying to kind of highlight the principle matters. And then, I think, over time, our view is we probably will be doing a lot less suburban work.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","Okay. The other question I have is on the page before. And I know it\u2019s minor, but with respect to India and China, the square footage from September down to December went down by 100,000 square feet. So that\u2019s question one is why the square feet change? And then, number two, just can you give us a sense of what the $41.3 million that will take you to expect to invest in 2012 is going towards?","Dean Shigenaga","So the first question relates to just the transition of some of the basis into land. So, we completed what we needed to complete on that particular project. Broadly, the other question you asked about the $41 million to spend, that\u2019s really on construction related to laboratory facilities in India. A little bit of the final interior improvements for China as well, but the majority of those dollars are focused in India.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","And if I think about the $148 million plus because there\u2019s still a TBD there that you\u2019re investing in those two countries. What should we be thinking about for the returns on those because I don\u2019t see those listed on page 3?","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah, I think I\u2019ve said and I think over time as we get to some more critical mass, we will try to be pretty detailed about this. But I think our goal is in India. China remains to be seen. We don\u2019t have a lot going on there at the moment in the sense we clearly aren\u2019t doing any expansion. We really are test running a project. But I think in India, our goal is to try to achieve 500 basis point return over what we would achieve in the U.S. on a net after-tax basis. And that\u2019s I think what I\u2019ve pretty much said and I think it turns out to be pretty true.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","So, that\u2019s the anticipation on those current projects as well?","Dean Shigenaga","More or less, yes.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","Thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Dean Shigenaga","Yes. Thanks, Ross.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Quentin Velleley from Citi. Please proceed.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","Yeah. It\u2019s Michael Bilerman with Quentin. Yeah, I agree with Ross also, on page 33, I think to present a whole picture of your billing one of completed investment having the complete total return at the end would be helpful. I think Joel you said mid-single digits to high-single digits. Do you just have the weighted average stabilize cash and GAAP yield so that we know on 20% of the pipeline, most of the stuff is coming in late this year and early next year. What yield we should be using for that capital?","Joel Marcus","Yeah. We can probably give that. I don\u2019t have that at hand, but we can probably give that to you.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","Okay. And then, thinking about sort of sources and uses of capital into \u2013 for this year, and this is in reference to the guidance that you provided, it\u2019s on page...","Joel Marcus","16.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","16, correct. The thing about \u2013 I mean, your uses are pretty identified and rigid and I recognize you have full availability of that\u2019s remaining in the line of credit to fund that. But if you think about this line item of $700 million for debt, equity and joint venture capital, obviously each of those has a different cost.","Each of those have different ramifications in terms of when it\u2019s raised, how it\u2019s raised, and so maybe just talk about how are you thinking about raising that $700 million both in terms of time but obviously debts very different than common equity, very different than preferred equity and joint venture capital of obviously effectively sale of interest and assets which would be very different. So what are you progressing down the road with to raise that money?","Joel Marcus","Well, a little bit will come off of our line, but I think our hopes, Michael, as we mentioned in our prepared comments is that the bond market has shown some significant improvement in 2012 and we\u2019re optimistic that we have the opportunity to have our bond issuance sooner than later and that would allow us to fill a large chunk of that $700 million of incremental capital.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","So, you would view the unsecured bond in terms of say $500 million as a debut as part of that $700 million, if you were to execute it?","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah, I\u2019m sorry. Yeah, I\u2019m sorry, that was confusing. That would not be incremental to generate our total sources to \u2013 if you add \u2013 if you assumed it was $500 million, it wouldn\u2019t be additive to the $899 million resulting in roughly $1.4 billion of sources. It would fill that $700 million requirement.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","But if I just take it for one step further, I mean, one of the things you talked about at Investor Day was buying back the preferred \u2013 the $140 million of preferred which obviously you have a very high coupon on them as a way to offset the dilution from doing the bond deal. So that would obviously chew up some capital. But if you were to swap out $500 million out of $700 million, you\u2019re also not making a lot of goals towards your sort of reducing your floating rate. I know you have hedges in place, but eventually those will roll off. Part of the bond issuance was to elongate the maturity schedule and fix it, but you are spending $900 million of capital, so wouldn\u2019t you need to raise some form of equity for that?","Dean Shigenaga","Actually to maybe clarify a little bit what will likely happen from a bond perspective, because we do have a specific use to retire our 2012 term loan. If a bond event was to occur before the maturity date of the bank term loan for $250 million, we would likely concurrently retire that $250 million term loan and part of that has to do with the legal structuring of that transaction where we need to \u2013 I think it\u2019s the only bank agreement that has provisions that were not modified to release our borrowers.","And so, it was always contemplated that one of the key chunks of bank debt that would retired was the 2012 term loan. So part of the answer to your question, Michael is, yes. Some of the proceeds will be used to retire bank debt at a minimum the $250 million term loan. The remainder will obviously depend on the size of the transaction and how much incremental capital we have.","But ultimately we are going to work on retiring bank debt, replacing with longer-term fixed-rate debt over several years. I think it\u2019s difficult for us to \u2013 it was much more difficult for us to sit here and think about this 60 days ago, probably relatively difficult for us to contemplate much on this 30 days ago. The recent short trends in the last four weeks in the bond market, for six weeks in the bond market have been pretty spectacular to say the least. So we\u2019re a little more optimistic.","We are set on that transition, Michael. This is just the first start of it.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","Okay.","Joel Marcus","And I\u2019d say, the other thing that factors in and we\u2019ve said this without being particularly specific and I mentioned in my comments, we do are sitting on and you\u2019ve been one of the proponents of this, a fair amount of non-income producing assets and we clearly are focused pretty laser like on the movement of some of that to aid in our funding of both the retirement of variable rate debt as well as the reinvestment in development and redevelopment. So that is likely to be an important part of this line item as well.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","Great. That\u2019s helpful. Just sticking on this page in terms of the guidance, when you look at the fourth quarter, you\u2019d also provided guidance at Investor Day for the line items listed here and it would appear that NOI came out about $1.7 million higher, but G&A was commensurately $1.7 million higher than the mid points of the ranges of guidance that you gave then. Can you just talk about what sort of drove the higher NOI? Was the timing of commencement higher? Was it something happened in the core? And also what happened with G&A at the end of the year?","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah, I think he was \u2013 really the contributions came in stronger as a result of, I think OpEx being inside of where we thought it was going to be, because I don\u2019t think there was much change in top line. And we do have some OpEx numbers, as you know from our recovery ratios, that don\u2019t necessarily move hand-in-hand with recoveries. And there\u2019s about 15% of that. So I think we had a favorable non-recoverable component of our OpEx that dropped down. I would say, a little bit of the contribution at the rental income level, but nothing significant stood out in my review. So I think you had a little bit of contribution from all areas and it definitely wasn\u2019t another income, because other income was down.","Joel Marcus","And then on the G&A, it was primarily the systems (inaudible).","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah. And most of the G&A stuff \u2013 a good chunk of that, I think is non-recurring. So we had unfortunately not anticipated some of the cost coming in.","Joel Marcus","Yeah, pretty big systems conversion as Dean mentioned on a number of particular areas of the operation of the business.","Quentin Velleley \u2013 Citi","Hi, it\u2019s Quentin here, just going back to the sources of capital in guidance is $112 million of assets sales, would you mind to comment that you got to be more aggressive on asset disposition and Joel, you kind of alluded to this, but I\u2019m curious sort of how many assets you\u2019re looking at \u2013 what volume of assets you\u2019re looking at marketing and what the split between land and actual income-producing assets might be?","Joel Marcus","Yeah. I think we have to tread carefully there, because we have to \u2013 we don\u2019t have specific transactions at this point in time obviously teed up. But, as I said, we have \u2013 you look at the supplement, we\u2019ve got 24% non-income producing assets to GAV. And so we\u2019ve got a pool of assets on the non-income-producing side that we\u2019re pretty laser focused on that we hope over, as the quarters unfold through the year, we can do some things with that would help us supplement the sources of capital.","And so that\u2019s probably going to be one of the dominant factors and features. And we\u2019ll keep you posted obviously over the coming months and quarters. So that\u2019s pretty important. On the $112 million, Dean can give you the ratio of asset to just kind of our rough estimate of land income producing. I don\u2019t recall exactly what that number is, but it\u2019s probably maybe 50:50, 60:40.","Dean Shigenaga","It\u2019s in that general range and I think we\u2019ve got three assets I believe under contract in that number. They\u2019re relatively small, but I think they aggregate somewhere just under $20 million in proceeds.","Quentin Velleley \u2013 Citi","Thank you.","Dean Shigenaga","Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Stewart from Green Street Advisors. Please proceed.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Thank you. Dean, hope you can help us understand, I mean, I fully take your points about the evolution in the state of the corporate bond market over the past 60 days, but given the improvement just to put it bluntly, why aren\u2019t you just jumping through the window?","Joel Marcus","Well, maybe let me pre-empt, Dean, the answer is we have to report earnings and get things done. But I think the fair statement is, if you listen to Dean\u2019s words carefully, he said sooner rather than later. So we\u2019re very mindful of that, John and I would say stay tuned.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And, Dean if I could come back to you, just you\u2019ve alluded to the ramp up in NOI as projects come online throughout the year and also kind of gave us a sense that one through 3Q should be relatively flat, but so if you assume $100 million NOI run rate, what\u2019s the step function in the fourth quarter?","Dean Shigenaga","As a percent of the incremental NOI, it\u2019s probably somewhere close to 60% of it coming in in the fourth quarter versus 40% being spread over two and three.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","60% of \u2013 can you remind us what the number was?","Dean Shigenaga","(Inaudible) a little bit higher than 60%, but it\u2019s in that 60% to 65% range.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","And what was the base and what\u2019s the improvement?","Dean Shigenaga","I\u2019m not following you, John. I\u2019m sorry.","Joel Marcus","If you look at Page 16 John, NOI goes from the actual which is $102 million and then our projection for fourth quarter 2012 is $111 million, $113 million. So, it\u2019s about probably $10 million of improvement.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Got it. Thank you. And lastly, Joel could I ask you to just touch on the of course, I guess Illumina is out today rejecting Roche\u2019s bid, but given the Genentech example that you cited in South San Francisco, could you touch on the potential for redundancy in San Diego and then just perhaps more broadly consolidation in the big pharma sector?","Joel Marcus","Yeah, that\u2019s a good and timely question. I think, if you look at what Roche has said the \u2013 and what commentators have said, there has been a lot written recently both street commentators and then people from the industry believe that the Roche \u2013 if anybody would buy Illumina, the Roche and whether they stay independent or not, I don\u2019t know, and that\u2019s obviously for their board and shareholders to determine, but that the Roche integration might be the most seamless and the best with Roche\u2019s Applied Science Group.","We have seen public pronouncements by Roche that they were going to move their headquarters of Roche\u2019s Applied Science Group. I forgot it may be in Europe to San Diego build around Illumina as the flagship piece of its whole focus in the diagnostics and tools area. Obviously, this is a huge growth area given the personalized medicine and it gives them a \u2013 how they view moving whole genome sequencing as a routine clinical practices would give them a huge advantage. Roche is a huge leader in that area.","So we \u2013 if we believe what comes from Roche directly, this would not be a consolidation and some kind of a movement out of San Diego, would rather be a movement into San Diego and build around Illumina as kind of the flagship piece of their whole DX effort.","With respect to pharma M&A, I mean, all we can say is, it has gone on, I mean Wyeth and Pfizer being one notable part. Pharma has really kind of moved on from that world and there still may be more, but they\u2019re really in the rationalization of their own R&D and the \u2013 really measuring the productivity and moving much more of their R&D to the touch points of innovation. I mean, that\u2019s where they are today.","They get a lot of capital, cash on the balance sheet. Yeah, there are patent expirations. Yeah, there are a whole range of different issues that all the pharmas face, but fundamentally many of them and most of them have successfully transitioned to kind of the new model. And again, we\u2019ve seen that in spades in the requirements that have come to New York, come to Cambridge, come to Mission Bay. So we\u2019re pretty comfortable with the state of pharma affairs today.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay. Thank you.","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Ren from Morningstar. Please proceed.","Jason Ren \u2013 Morningstar","Hi, thanks for taking my question. In the third quarter call, Dean you made a comment that Alexandria was committed not to raise equity at the price of the stock at that time, which I believe was around $66 or so. Since then, you guys raised \u2013 funded out the maturities, scheduled, raised lot of debt, but \u2013 and the stocks also moved up. And I just wanted to see whether you are sentiment on issuing equity at current levels would be similar to your sentiment that was expressed in the third quarter call?","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah. Well, I would say, I don\u2019t want to get in the role of trying to handicap what we may or may not do on conference calls, but I would say we\u2019ve really set out our strategy on the capital plan. And as we see it today, certainly now and here and where we are in time and space, equity \u2013 common equity capital is really not our priority at this point.","Getting to the bond market clearly is potentially at some point when the market is appropriate refinancing, but perpetual preferred obviously to the extent that we look at any other situation trying to match source with use. I think that\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re thinking about it, but we \u2013 we don\u2019t \u2013 that at the moment is not a priority of ours. And obviously, probably the other top priority in addition to getting the bond market is really moving that non-income producing asset base down a few notches and thereby freeing up capital to both to pay down variable rate debt and to reinvest in what we\u2019re doing. So I\u2019d say those are the two dominant priorities at the moment, Jason.","Jason Ren \u2013 Morningstar","Okay, great. Thanks for taking my question.","Dean Shigenaga","Yeah, always a pleasure.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, there are no more questions in queue. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Joel Marcus for any closing remarks.","Joel Marcus","Just want to thank everybody for their time today during earnings season. And look forward to talking to you likely early May on first quarter. Thanks again.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"1557":["Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz with Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Paula Schwartz","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel.","Joel Marcus","Thank you, Paula, and welcome everybody to our second quarter call. And with me today are Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia, Dean Shigenaga, Dan Ryan, Tom Andrews, John Cunningham. Once again, I have the distinct pleasure and honor to thank our first-in-class team for delivering a truly outstanding second quarter with superb operational excellence and really, really outstanding.","Life science tenants in each and every one of our clusters and submarkets recognize the Alexandria brand for highest quality, highest reliability, best-in-class service and best collaborative partnering. These qualities substantially enhance our pricing power in each of our markets and the statistics bear that out.","We're also in the first year 2018 of the 5-year growth plan we announced at Investor Day 2017 to double the revenues of the company. As Steve will talk about, we've had -- we have and continue to expect to have strong per share FFO performance during 2018 and have great visibility for growth into 2019.","As all of you know, our urban clustering strategy is based on the belief that clustering similar businesses together boost productivity, operating efficiency, and innovation, a concept promoted by Harvard economist, Michael Porter. About a year after we became public and read his -- one of his many works, but the one on competition and a particular chapter entitled, Clusters and the New Economics of Competition, he noted successful businesses are typically found within close proximity of one another or in clusters despite technological advances allowing companies to operate really from anywhere. And that clustering approach, which we adopted has been a smart strategy that's paid off in great locations in clusters like Cambridge, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, New York City and so forth.","I think underpinning the growth, as I\u2019ve said a number of times is we're still in the early innings of discovery of diagnostics therapeutics whether they'd be cures or really effective treatments. We\u2019ve only addressed about 5% of the diseases that are known to mankind.","I think it's also good to note as we did last quarter, the five key reasons why this industry is working on all cylinders right now as we've seen now a historic growth in the funding for the National Institutes of Health, a very strong and innovative Food and Drug Administration, more research spending on medical philanthropy than ever.","We're really experiencing record years in venture capital and we continue to see robust spending on R&D by commercial stage biopharma companies. And in fact, I think, Ian Read of Pfizer this morning announced an increase in their R&D spending, which is a good news.","Want to comment briefly before I turn it over to Steve on our New York City life science cluster, which I was proud to lead the launch with an amazing and talented team, and that team has built, leased, and operated our flagship campus at the Alexandria Center for Life Science, New York City in a truly outstanding fashion, and has helped start and\/or recruit its world-class tenant base. And keep in mind, we\u2019ve had to truly create a commercial life science tenant base there where none has existed.","With the recently announced acquisition of 219 East 42nd Street, one of Pfizer's current headquarters buildings within a short 13 blocks of our ACLS campus close to Grand Central and ensconced in the middle of Manhattan's dense East Side Medical Corridor, we made an outstanding purchase at $500 -- $580 a square foot with a strong current yield and a medium-term lease back to Pfizer.","And what's particularly of interest to us is the future 350,000-square-foot of ideal lab\/office redevelopment. So East Side Medical Corridor is in proximity to Grand Central, proximity to our own anchor campus, medium-term leaseback with Pfizer's strong yields, excellent cost per square foot, and difficult to locate Manhattan buildings with convertibility.","And then finally I want to address something that is I think is near and dear to all our hearts, what really matters to employees and team members, in general, and here at Alexandria. And recently there was a study by Harvard Business Review that spoke about a single word, Repsect.","There is old respect, which we accord equally to all members of our team. There is earned respect, which recognizes individuals who display valued qualities or behaviors and acknowledges that each member has specific strengths and talents, and there is identity development, self respect in a sense of unique self. So, just as instability can spiral as we witness daily on social media, so too can a culture of respect and that is why we at Alexandria deeply care about respect in our work life.","So Steve, take it away.","Stephen Richardson","Thank you, Joel. I'll be covering the markets this afternoon. But before I do that, I'd like to build on Joel's comments and underscore the profound shift in the sciences that is driving the success of Alexandria's highly differentiated strategy.","We had the pleasure of listening to George Demetri, a world-renowned Doctor and Director for one of the key oncology centers at the Dana-Farber in Cambridge, expressing his strong enthusiasm for the shift in a compelling interview with one of his patients who has survived cancer for several years due to these new therapies. These breakthroughs underpin our stellar results and a defining strategy.","Several highlights include: We have an industry-leading investment grade large market cap tenant quality comprising 55% of ARR, and 83% of top 20 tenant's ARR is from this class of investment grade or large market cap companies. 78% of our ARR is from Class A facilities in key gateway markets on the East and West Coast with AAA locations adjacent to the country's leading research universities and institutions.","The product type we work with day-in and day-out is mission-critical. The tenants absolutely demand sophistication and deep expertise in design, construction, leasing, and operations and a long-term partnership approach. Our science and technology teams' unique expertise underwriting cutting edge companies provides unmatched insight into the life science industry.","And finally, as Peter will touch on later in the call, the clearly visible pipeline driving growth through 2018 and 2019 totaling 2.6 million square feet is 84% leased at great yields generating significant NAV.","Let's take a look at the market. We're really seeing robust and high-quality demand evident across all of our core clusters. As you can see from the supplemental, 65% of leasing this quarter is early renewals and 58% year-to-date are early renewals, clearly indicating a strong sense of urgency in the market.","As we look at market-to-market, Cambridge had a 1.6 vacancy rate at our Investor Day during November of 2017; todayit's 0.7%. Demand was at 1.8 million square feet then, it's 2.2 million square feet today. San Francisco at that time had a 5.5 vacancy rate, now it's 3.3%. There was 2.5 million square feet of demand then, and now we have 2.8 million square feet of demand.","San Diego had a 7% vacancy rate during November of '17, it's now at 5.2% and demand remains solid with about 859,000 square feet. Maryland's vacancy rate has remained about the same at 3%, but demand has increased from 379,000 feet to 511,000 feet, and it's important to note that VC funding has more than doubled to $370 million, and 52 life science companies have been started in the past 18 months providing important diversification from NIH-related entities. And finally, Seattle's vacancy rate has stayed strong at just 1%, and demand is healthy as well at about 575,000 square feet.","Our 1818 Fairview development has 169,000 feet of active life science demand in addition to the lease negotiating spaces referenced in the supplemental, and so we expect to substantially resolve the balance of the leasing during the second half of 2018 well ahead of pro forma.","Just a couple notable leases to highlight, and this one in particular, I think, really speaks to the differentiated strategy here at Alexandria. The 106,000 square feet in Seattle with the Fred Hutch at our flagship of waterfront stream plant, sports a 35% GAAP increase, a perfect example of the breakthroughs and therapies noted above and the virtuous cycle in our clusters.","Fred Hutch had licensed key CAR-T technology to Juno Therapeutics. Juno in turn delivered groundbreaking clinical outcomes with these novel therapies. Celgene then acquired in Juno for $9 billion and a portion of the proceeds flow to the Fred Hutch as a shareholder and the Hutch in turn is now expanding its research efforts at 1201, truly an excellent outcome.","Seattle is quickly becoming a center of innovation for immunology, especially immuno-oncology and has a longstanding reputation as a center for global health and infectious disease research. A 50,000-square-foot lease with AstraZeneca, in Gaithersburg, Maryland is a clear indication of the health of that market as we referenced about.","And finally, one of the especially notable leases this quarter was in Cambridge at 152,000 square feet with Sarepta at 215 First Street with a huge 53% GAAP increase. So the markets are very, very strong in all of our key clusters.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Peter.","Peter Moglia","Thanks, Steve. Those are outstanding fundamentals, and the reason probably driving what I'm going to say right now as I update everybody on our near-term pipeline. After that I'm going to touch on cap rates, and then I'm going to address CapEx since it's become a top of my topic since the Green Street July 19 report on this subject.","With the cost to complete of $868 million should deliver another 2.6 million square feet of Class A facilities in AAA locations of gateway markets, we are well-positioned to continue to driving significant NAV growth well into 2019. The projects that we'll deliver through the balance of '18 and '19 are a combined 84% leased, giving investors clear visibility of the value creation ahead.","In the second half of '18, we're going to deliver a 0.5 million square feet, including 399 Binney Street in Cambridge, which is 75% leased with all but the retail space under negotiation. This wonderful addition to our One Kendall Square campus is expected to stabilize at a 6.7% cash yield in a market that is at least 4% cap rate.","9625 Towne Centre Drive and University Town Center submarket of San Diego will be delivered to investment-grade tenant Takeda in the fourth quarter at a 7% stabilized cash yield, and our 5 Laboratory Drive project in the Research Triangle Park is quickly becoming a focal point of the AgTech community with 38% of the project leased and serious prospects for another 30% of that space. Yields on this project are expected to be in the high 7s.","In 2019, we'll be delivering over 2.1 million square feet, including the first phase of our Alexandria Park redevelopment in Palo Alto, which has already been fully leased to a tenant that was subsequently purchased by a $27 billion publicly traded company, enhancing our credit before the paint was even dry.","681 Gateway in South San Francisco, that is essentially a 100% leased or under negotiation with strong initial cash and GAAP yields of 7.9% and 8.5%, respectively. 279 East Grand also in South San Francisco anchored by Alphabet subsidiary Verily and in various stages of negotiation for all of the remaining space is expected to deliver spectacular 8.1% cash and 7.8% GAAP yields.","And finally, 1818 Fairview in Seattle, which is making excellent progress with 24% under lease or negotiation and another 115,000 square feet of serious prospects actively engaged. All the activity there is life science-related, and it's confirming that Seattle's life science market is certainly gaining momentum. Initial stabilized yields for this project are projected to be 6.7% on both the cash and GAAP basis in a sub-5 cap rate investment market.","Speaking of cap rates. As you recall, on the last earnings call, we described a sizable deal that was pending in Cambridge. Since that time, it's been disclosed that Forest City and its partners bought out MIT's 50% interest in a portion of lab\/office product at University Park in East Cambridge. We understand with the purchase price applies a low 4% cap rate.","In addition, we wanted to add to the Seattle commentary by mentioning 2 new sales comps in South Lake Union, both 404 Fairview Avenue North, a 350,000-square-foot office building and 202 Westlake Avenue North, 130,000-square-foot office building recently sold to institutional investors at 4.2% cap rates at prices in the high $900-per-square-foot range, illustrating that Seattle is indeed one of the most desirable investment markets in the country and that investors are still willing to pay healthy prices for core assets in gateway markets.","To wrap up our comments, we wanted to touch briefly on Green Street's CapEx report of July 19. One of the differentiating factors of our business model is the reusability of our building improvements. Green Street's analysis of our office peers revealed annual CapEx in the range of 26% to 31%. Those of you, who attended our Investor Day may recall our 5-year average being approximately half the lower end of that range.","So with that, I'm going to go ahead and pass it on to Dean.","Dean Shigenaga","All right. Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. I want to briefly cover first, our inaugural Corporate Responsibility Report, for the third time NAREIT Gold Award for Communications & Reporting Excellence, second quarter results and significant revenue and cash NOI growth, our continued strong internal growth, provide a brief overview of our highly leased value-creation pipeline, cover our balance sheet and improving credit metrics, and I'll close out with comments on our updated guidance, importantly on our $0.03 increase in the midpoint of our FFO per share growth.","Corporate responsibility, just wanted to thank Jennifer Banks, our co-CEO and General Counsel, Vince Ciruzzi, our Chief Development Officer, Ari Frankel, AVP of Sustainability & High Performance buildings and his team, and Katie O'Brien our Executive Director of Corporate Communications for their excellent work on our inaugural Corporate Responsibility Report that we issued in June.","This report captures our efforts focused on important environmental, social and governance matters, and our goal of making a positive and meaningful impact on the health, safety and wellbeing of our tenants, stockholders, employees and the communities in which we live and work.","This report also includes our 2025 sustainability goals for ground up development, environmental impact, reduction of the energy, carbon, water and waste and healthy building certifications. We are again very honored to have been selected for the third time as NAREIT's Gold Award winner as the #1 in the large cap category by an independent panel of judges for Communications & Reporting Excellence to the investment community. So a huge congrats to our entire team. Thank you, guys.","We reported very strong second quarter results that highlight excellent and efficient execution by our team on our strategic and operational goals. Total revenues for the quarter were $325 million, up 19% over the first quarter of '17.","Cash NOI for the second quarter annualized was $818 million, up $125 million or 18.1% over cash net operating income for the fourth quarter annualized. FFO per share diluted as adjusted was reported at $1.64, and up 9.3% over second quarter of 2017.","We reported continued and strong internal growth that reflects the strength of our real estate and life science industry fundamentals, and our unique and differentiated business strategy. Occupancy remains very strong. It was up 50 basis points to 97.1%. Briefly on One Kendall Square, our team is well ahead of timing for capturing the mark-to-market opportunity for below market leases.","To-date, our team has executed 280,000 rentable square feet of lease renewals and releasing of space for approximately 3x the leasing that we had originally anticipated by June 30. However, this accelerated leasing did result in temporary vacancy at One Kendall Square with occupancy dipping to 80% for a couple of months before rebounding to about 88% as of June 30.","Rental rate growth on leasing activity continues to remain very strong. Over the past 4 years, rental rate growth on leasing activity has ranged from 20% to 28% on a GAAP basis and 10% to 14% on a cash basis. Rental rate growth for the second quarter was 24% and 12.8% on a cash basis in line with this trend and puts us on track for updated full year guidance on rental rate growth.","On our early renewals, Steve touched on this briefly, but roughly 2\/3 of our lease renewals and releasing of space in the first half of the year really related to early lease renewals. 1\/3 of these related to expirations in '21, '22 and '23. Now that we're about halfway through 2018, we really have better visibility on the portion of early renewals, including the renewals that were executed in the second quarter and have increased our full year guidance for rental rate growth.","Additionally, as we look back at value-creation leasing by our team in the first half of '18 that really highlights truly amazing execution, over 1 million rentable square feet related to new Class A properties undergoing development and redevelopment, including 594,000 with Uber in Mission Bay, 133 rentable square feet with several very high-quality venture-backed biotechs at 399 Binney Street in Cambridge, 104,000 rentable square feet with Verily, that is a subsidiary of Alphabet at 279 East Grand, 61,000 rentable square feet with a really exciting DNA synthesis company at 681 Gateway in San Francisco, 34,000 square feet with several Ag biotech entities at 5 Laboratory Drive and Research Triangle Park, and then very recently 26,000 rentable square feet with Lonza at 9900 Medical Center Drive and Shady Grove.","The first half same-property NOI growth was very strong and in line with our guidance for the full year of 2018. Our second quarter same-property cash NOI growth was also solid, but also reflected the temporary vacancy at One Kendall Square that we mentioned earlier, and also reflects no cash growth benefit from our recently completed development project at 75\/125 Binney Street since full cash rents commenced on April 1, 2017. Importantly, we remain on track with all the same-property performance for both the 6 and 12 months ending December 31, 2018.","Peter had briefly covered our pipeline in detail, just to provide a brief overview of summary. 3.5 million square feet targeted for delivery in '18, '19 and '20. 2.6 million of that is really targeted for '18 and '19, that's 1.8 billion at completion, 84% leased that will generate very strong yields of 7.3% and 6.8% on a cash basis. And right behind that, we have about 908,000 rentable square feet undergoing marketing, while we execute on preconstruction activities to reduce the time to deliver these projects.","Turning to our balance sheet. We completed the issuance of $900 million of unsecured senior notes at a weighted average rate of 4.35% and a weighted average term of 8.8 years. $450 million of the notes were related to our sustainability initiatives with proceeds allocated to fund certain eligible green development and redevelopment projects that either have or expected to receive LEED Gold or Platinum certification.","In July, we also partially repaid $150 million of our outstanding construction loans. And then later this year, we anticipate repaying the remaining $200 million outstanding under our 2019 unsecured term loan. So as you look back over 2017 and including the full year of 2018, we will have refinanced over $940 million of variable rate level based debt further strengthening our balance sheet and our credit profile.","We have just recently commenced an amendment process to our line of credit and our 2021 term loan, which is really focused primarily on extending the maturity date to 2024 with an opportunity to slightly improve pricing and increase the overall capacity under our line of credit. We expect to close this amendment in the third quarter and will provide more details shortly after closing.","We also remain on track to achieve our key credit metric goals and remain committed to continued improvement in our credit metrics each year, including fourth quarter annualized net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA as our goal for 2019 and 2020 is to move closer to 5 times. Unhedged variable rate debt is targeted to be less than 5% at the end of this year, and we are reviewing our options to cover our remaining equity capital for 2018 from additional real estate sales. And additionally, we do expect to file a new aftermarket offering program at some point over the next 1 to 3 quarters.","So in closing on guidance, we did update our guidance for earnings per share to a range of $2.87 to $2.93 and FFO per share as adjusted to a range of $6.57 to $6.63. This represents a $0.03 increase at the midpoint for FFO per share as adjusted, and the key drivers of the increase really is a combination, continued strength of our core operations combined with growth from our recently announced acquisitions. And I should point out that this $0.03 increase follows the $0.02 increase in our midpoint from last quarter.","We also increased the midpoint of our guidance for occupancy up 20 basis points to a range of 97.1% to 97.7%, and rental rate growth of 400 basis points and 200 basis points on a GAAP and cash basis for each range. So our range for GAAP and cash rental growth is now 17% to 20% and 9.5% to 12.5%, respectively.","And just as a reminder everybody, we have a large pool of same-property assets that drive growth in net operating income. $0.01 in bottom line FFO per share growth only increases same-property NOI growth by about 15 basis points.","So as a result of the improvement in our outlook for occupancy and rental rate growth on leasing activity, it is really reflected in the strength of our range of guidance for a strong same-property growth for 2018.","So with that, I'll close it out and turn it back over to Joel Marcus.","Joel Marcus","Okay. Operator, can we go to Q&A, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question will be from Manny Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead.","Manny Korchman","Hi, everyone. Good afternoon. Joel, you opened the call talking about cluster markets and both sort of your entry barrier success there. I was hoping you could help us frame New York in a more specific way with the cluster markets as a focus, the building you're acquiring is, I guess, near your East River campus, but I wouldn't call it a cluster per se.","And then you also have the risk of new developments that are already going on and will be going on near the new projects. So how do you sort of put all that together and connect it back to your cluster theory?","Joel Marcus","Well, Manny, thanks for asking the question. Well, first of all, a cluster, if you look at the 2 leading established clusters both kind of the Greater Boston cluster and the San Francisco Bay cluster, those really evolved in the late '70s and early '80s and took literally a generation to really grow and become what they are today. And so New York is really in the first decade of a 25-year process.","So what you may see in other clusters, you won't necessarily see today in New York and Manhattan just given its limited geography and the density of buildings and people there is going to evolve somewhat differently, but we do believe and we've said this for a long time, the East Side Medical Corridor is really where people want to be with, relatively if there is such a thing, easy access or at least fairly good access to the institutions and to the ecosystem. So that's kind of how we think about the shape of the Manhattan market.","And over time, I think, you will see it evolve in ways that even today we can't actually necessarily predict. But our focus has been the East Side corridor, and this is a, in my view, a bull's-eye and a home run in that sweet spot.","Manny Korchman","Thanks, Joel. And maybe one for Dean, the acquisitions you've done to-date are right at the midpoint of your guidance range, but you only have $50 million left to hit the high end. Is that just guiding right now to what you see in the pipe and that number is likely to move upwards or is the acquisition environment just sort of more difficult than that $50 million is probably about accurate?","Dean Shigenaga","Yes Manny, I think it's indicative of our view at the moment, but it's probably also just to put that into perspective a little bit. At the beginning of every year, at Investor Day, we do give an outlook on acquisitions, and typically it's fairly nominal as it exists at all, and that really has to do with the fact that we don't really know what will hit the market, Manny, that actually makes sense to acquire.","Peter and the team keeps a pretty good pulse on activities in the market, and if something makes sense, we may bid on it, but ultimately winning the project is a whole different conclusion. We really need to make sense of the deal. So right now, we don't see a lot remaining on the horizon, but something could come up, Manny. And if it does, we'll keep the market informed.","Manny Korchman","Thanks.","Operator","The next question will be from Jamie Feldman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jamie Feldman","Great, thank you. I guess, sticking with Dean here. So you had a decent amount of recognized gains from the investment portfolio in the quarter. Can you just talk about how you've included those in guidance for the year? Whether -- how much is in your guidance for the quarter or just as you think about the year overall, how much you include or have you included?","Dean Shigenaga","Manny, I think, that question may have come -- sorry, Jamie, that question may have come up last quarter or the quarter before. And I think my reference was that just look back historically where we've been, every year it does vary a little bit. I think over the last 3, 4, 5 years, its' probably been in the $10 million to $20 million range. Currently, it's on a path to probably get to the upper end of that.","And I would say that much of our activity is really event-driven. We do from time-to-time sell some of the public securities as a result of a company reaching its IPO or being acquired by a public company.","But as an example in the second quarter, this gain was really event-driven. It was related to an acquisition of a biotech company, and that resulted in the majority of that gain that was recognized this quarter.","So leading into the quarter, we had no idea that, that particular transaction would have occurred. And so I think that's the most important thing to keep in mind. We don't necessarily control the gains that are being realized. They do occur because of great events that are occurring in the marketplace.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. But you typically assumed that $10 million to $20 million per year is the right way to think about?","Dean Shigenaga","That's where it's been for the last 3, 4, 5 years, if I recall it correctly, Jamie. ","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then I guess, just thinking more about the Pfizer acquisition and redevelopment. I mean, clearly, this is an investment in the infill market with a redevelopment components in kind of older building, older market. Do you think -- as you think about your business going forward and where you do see these cluster markets, you are supposed to see more of that rather than kind of Greenfield ground up from Alexandria? ","Joel Marcus","Well, I think again it depends on the market, but we've done some of that all along in a number of markets, and we still have obviously in other markets or even in some of those same markets, a robust development pipeline. So I think you'll see some of both. This was an unusual situation.","I'm sure we could -- one knew that Pfizer was looking over time to do something. But as Dean said early on, when things come to the market, you react to them. You don't necessarily know a year or 2 out or even sometimes quarters out exactly what's going on. But I think you will see us to do a combination of those two. That's been our bread-and-butter.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then last one from me is, just any thoughts on the tenant credit watch list. Are there any tenants you're concerned about right now?","Dean Shigenaga","Jamie, it's Dean here. If you look at the top 20 tenants that we got disclosed, they're all in really great position today. 83% of that top 20 list is either investment-grade or $10 billion or greater in valuation. So really no significant concerns out there.","Joel Marcus","Yes. And I think our number 1 tenant Illumina had a good day today. I think they are up about 10% or so, that's very good. So our underwriting is very thorough, very in-depth ongoing and at the moment, as Dean said, I think we feel very comfortable with our tenants.","And very frankly, we've avoided, I can think of one case in the Bay area, in fact, I think I was interviewed on this at CNBC Power Lunch a couple of months ago, we decided not to take on the Theranos building. It went for sale up in the Stanford Research Park because of the belief that the business was going to fail, and there would be repercussions from that both financially and reputationally. So we thought it was good real estate, but it was something we just didn't feel appropriate in pursuing. So we're pretty careful about what we do.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. Thank you.","Joel Marcus","Thank you, Jim.","Operator","The next question will be from Sheila McGrath of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead ","Sheila McGrath","Hi. Yes. Another question on the New York Pfizer acquisition. Just to clarify, the current cap rate on that is 6.7%, and what kind of returns do you expect on the redevelopment? And is there any excess development rates given rezoning changes in that area?","Joel Marcus","Yes. So John Cunningham is on. So John want to maybe highlight, at least initially. Not in too much depth there.","John Cunningham","Yes. As far as the additional density, the nice thing about the asset is that we bordered at 9.6 FAR by rate, it's currently at 15 FAR. So there is an additional 230,000 square feet of additional density available.","And then given the additional changes at the -- based on the Midtowny's rezoning, it could go up to about 21 FAR, 21.4. We have not really considered and utilizing that level of FAR for this site, but are confident that we'll keep our options open going forward in the future.","Peter Moglia","Hey Sheila, it's Peter Moglia. I guess, just I confirm the cap rate is 6, 7. So I think -- and I think Joel touched on it, I think one of the key things to this is the $580-per-square-foot value. If you sit down and break the numbers, and you take, okay, you're getting a big leaseback from Pfizer for 6 years, if you just value that leaseback and subtracted it from what we paid, you're essentially getting it for the land value.","And I think -- so we're paying for the land value, but we're getting a building that we're going to able to leverage off of. So in 6 to 7 years when we start planning for the redevelopment, we're really going to have a great basis from which to price the next-generation of Alexandria in New York life science real estate.","Sheila McGrath","Okay, great. And then on acquisitions, I guess, Peter, the stabilized yield in the supplemental on 100 Tech Drive and the Maryland life science portfolio, those yields go up to like 8.7 and 9.1. I'm just wondering are those yields just rolling in place leases to market? Or are you redeveloping those buildings?","Peter Moglia","The 100 Tech Drive is actually already delivered. So that's set, and so is the Maryland portfolio. It's a 100% leased portfolio. There is a little bit of rollover coming at the next couple of years, but we fully expect to reach those numbers and potentially be a little bit better.","Sheila McGrath","Okay. And last question, you were active on ATM this quarter, it doesn't look like you need that much additional equity capital based on the plan. Just if you could touch on what assets are for sale? Is it non-core? Or do you look -- are you looking to do a joint venture of a stabilized asset?","Dean Shigenaga","Sheila, it's Dean here. Yes, we have $230 million remaining of equity capital sought for the rest of this year, excluding the forward that we can settle by the end of the year. So the goal is, as I mentioned in my commentary is to look at dispositions. We do have some, what I call non-strategic assets that we're selling. But importantly, I think, we do want to look at something of high value that would be attractive cost of capital and a disposition here.","Joel Marcus","A partial interest disposition.","Dean Shigenaga","So we're working through the details of that, and we'll provide more color over the next -- maybe by the next call, we'll give a little more detail around our plans there.","Sheila McGrath","Okay, great. Thank you.","Dean Shigenaga","Thanks, Sheila.","Operator","The next question will be from Tom Catherwood of BTIG. Please go ahead.","Tom Catherwood","Thank you. And good afternoon, everybody. So Steve and Dean, just on the forward leasing that you mentioned, I think, you mentioned roughly 2\/3 of leasing has been forward. Of that, 1\/3 is on leases that '21, '22, '23.","What are the mechanics as far as when you recognize the same-store NOI growth, are those leases blends and extends? Does the kind of growth kick in once the natural lease term expires? How does that kind of flow-through to your earnings?","Dean Shigenaga","So Tom, it's Dean here. It depends on the transaction, an extension of the lease will usually trigger 3 straight lining GAAP revenue. The actual commencement of the cash rents, which in this environment is generally upward, will depend on the negotiation, probably more frequently that occurs at the initial expiration date and then steps as opposed to bringing that all the way forward.","And I think the other thing to think about is part of the early renewals were in one case, in Cambridge as an example, was connected to an expansion. So you have an early renewal and expansion all combined together. And the expansion component would commence upon and delivery of the expansion space. So hopefully that gives you a sense for what to expect.","Stephen Richardson","Tom, this is Steve. Maybe add to that, just to be very clear, blend and extend implies some type of concession, that's absolutely not what is happening here. These are early renewals with a sense of urgency in the market and people are coming to us to lock down space. When you look at these vacancy rates of 1%, 2%, 3%, the tenants are acutely aware of the competition for space.","Tom Catherwood","Got it. So just to clarify, if it was just kind of the first scenario, Dean, that you laid out where it's an extension, so the GAAP store same-store NOI change would be recognized now, and then the cash would kick in the later years whenever that natural exploration was, correct?","Dean Shigenaga","Correct. And then to remind, some of these early renewals is also One Kendall Square. I shouldn't say early, some of it's releasing. So one of the expirations was, I believe, 2023 expiration related to re-tenanting with the new tenant, which allows us to capture the cash rents much sooner.","Tom Catherwood","Got it. And switching over to developments, Page 5, you guys lists 493,000 square feet of development rights that you acquired this quarter. If you go back to your kind of landholdings, it looks like these development rates are spread amongst Greater Stanford, San Diego, RTP and an undisclosed bucket of other value-creation projects. Can you walk through these additional opportunities? And kind of how they came to fruition this quarter?","Joel Marcus","I think we don't want to get into, because there are some assemblage and some other key strategy. So I'd say, Tom, kind of hold your question for a couple of quarters, and we'll lay that out.","Tom Catherwood","Very fair. Then maybe I'll try one development, one hopefully that you can talk on. The development rates did seem to jump up for the third phase of the New York City Alexandria center, is that something you could talk about?","Joel Marcus","Right. So we have signed a letter of intent on May 31 with the city. We're working -- John and the team are working on the ground lease negotiations. We expect to have a building that will be enhanced in size from what we believe, but I would say stay tuned, the announcement will be forthcoming fairly shortly.","Tom Catherwood","Got it. Thanks, Joel.","Joel Marcus","Thank you. ","Operator","The next question will be from Rich Anderson of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","Rich Anderson","Thanks. Getting back to the ATM comment earlier. Is to fair to say you fast-track that may be quicker than at least we were assuming in our model? Was that driven by the Pfizer deal? Or was that always kind of assumed to be kind of a chunky issuance this quarter?","Dean Shigenaga","I'd say, broadly, the ATM usage this quarter, in the second quarter was driven by acquisitions broadly, Rich. And when we see the deal flow, that was under contract, we did go forward into the ATM program. The timing may not be matched perfectly in all circumstances, but I think at the price point that we did raised the capital, it was fairly attractive to do so at the time we did.","Rich Anderson","Okay. And then Joel mentioned, Illumina having a good day today, Pfizer indicating more R&D spend, Biogen, I suppose, we're reading that as a good news with their Alzheimer's activity. I'm looking at your top 20 list, do you -- are there any that you could peg there or having similar but may be quieter good moments where they are expressing to you that they need more space? I don't know, if you could be company-specific, but are you getting that with the regular kind of a flow of information from your top 20 tenants because of certain things that are going on within the organizations?","Joel Marcus","Yes, I don't want to broadcast their pipeline of leasing. But I would say that Lilly had certainly a positive quarter. Celgene's kind of on the turnaround doing better, it had -- stock had lagged for a while; bluebird is still in a very strong position, but doing the same thing.","So I would say, in general, almost all of these have, I think strengths of businesses that -- they have been slow, I mean, it's hard to say on any given quarter, but I think in general, there is positive absorption from some of these, not necessarily all at this point, but some of these tenants for sure.","Rich Anderson","And when you look at them as also competitors like MIT, is there any -- or I should say -- I shouldn't say like them, but MIT is a competitor, do others kind of fit that mold too at all?Or they're generally lassies?","Joel Marcus","Well, I think because MIT has a gigantic endowment and they have a pretty huge real estate strategy, they're pretty unique in that regard.","Rich Anderson","Okay. And then lastly on the Pfizer deal, $580 a square foot going in. I hear you on getting a lot of NOI back over the next couple of years, and may be seeing that land value as a basis. But is this -- when you think about redevelopment, is it too soon to talk about what that could be in terms of a per pound type of investment? Or should we just be thinking about this as an acquisition in and of itself and we'll worry about that 7 years from now?","Peter Moglia","Yes Tom, it's Peter Moglia. I'd say it's the latter. We're going to collect rent for 6 years, and we'll see where it goes from there. But I think of it this way, one of the most efficient ways for us to provide space to the market is through redevelopment of an existing building that we can get at below replacement costs, and we are very below replacement cost. So we'll be in a price per pound that should be very competitive, if not extremely competitive versus new product when that comes to the market.","Rich Anderson","Okay. And no chance that it -- I mean could it exist as just this asset? Or it absolutely would need to be redevelopment, I don't know the building, so?","Peter Moglia","It would absolutely -- it's expired. I think it would be a missed opportunity if we just decided to take some lease and keep it running the way it is now. But yes, I think, we're going to add a lot of value.","Rich Anderson","Okay, sounds good. Thanks.","Peter Moglia","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Michael Carroll","Yeah, thanks. A little bit off of Rich's question, you guys go out there and acquire some of these acquisitions, I guess, particularly the land sites, and I'm looking at 701 Dexter, specifically. How long do you kind of underwrite before you'll start breaking ground on those projects? And do you think you will start breaking ground on Dexter sometime soon?","Peter Moglia","Well, it's Peter Moglia. That submarket is very hot right now. And as Steve laid out in his comments and I in mine, the momentum of the life science market there is gaining steam. There is no doubt that the tech market there has been on fire for quite a bit. So there is still a great need for product there.","We're going to focus ours towards the life science side, but we're pretty confident given what we're doing at 1818 East like right now that we're going to be able to follow up with other projects soon after that. So we bought that with the intent of designing and entitling it fairly quickly.","Michael Carroll","Okay, great. And then how long does that entitlement process take? Is it something like 2019 start?","Peter Moglia","We're constrained by the city's Master Use Permit process. I think in the quickest month we ever got was about 9 months. So we probably wouldn't be in a position to even pull a permit for another call it 12. So yes, so that would be sometime in the end of '19 would be at the earliest we could even address that.","Okay, great. And then Steve, can you give us a quick update on the San Francisco market? And what's your expectations of receiving any (inaudible) allocation with the Times Square side?","Stephen Richardson","The market as we've talked about is extremely healthy. There is no availability of life science space in Mission Bay. You have a very small vacancy rate, 2%, 3%, 4% in kind of Mission Bay and SoMa on the tech side. The city is moving forward. They've passed one stage of the political process. Therefore, the central SoMa adoption, they do have a recess in August. They've received a number of comments. They do have a few filings against the plan.","Our understanding is that those are being actively worked on and resolved. And when they come back in September, they are going to move expeditiously. And I think as we maintain now for several quarters the thought is that each of the projects will be receiving an allocation so that they can move forward on a phase basis thereby providing the city with all of the community benefits front-loaded. So we expect that, that will be the outcome by the end of the year.","Peter Moglia","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Joel Marcus for his closing remarks.","Joel Marcus","Thank you, everybody, for listening. We look forward to talking to you on the third quarter call. Thank you everybody.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines."]}}
