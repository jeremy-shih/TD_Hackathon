This is Michael Partridge, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Tonight, we will review with you Vertex's business progress and provide our First Quarter Financial Results.","Making prepared remarks on the call tonight, we have Dr. Jeff Leiden, Chairman and CEO; Stuart Arbuckle, Chief Commercial Officer; and I would like to welcome to the call Charlie Wagner, Vertex's new Chief Financial Officer. Dr. Reshma Kewalramani, Chief Medical Officer; and Paul Silva, our Corporate Controller and Chief Accounting Officer, will join us for Q&A.","We recommend that you access the webcast slides on our website as you listen to this call. This conference call is being recorded, and a replay will be on our website.","We will make forward-looking statements on this call that are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in today's press release and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These statements, including, without limitation, those regarding Vertex's marketed CF medicines, the ongoing development and potential commercialization of our triple combination regimens for cystic fibrosis, Vertex's other programs and Vertex's future financial performance are based on management's current assumptions. Actual outcomes and events could differ materially.","I will now turn the call over to Dr. Jeff Leiden. ","Jeffrey Leiden","Thanks, Michael. Good evening, everyone. During the last several years, Vertex has continued to pursue its strategy of investing in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for serious diseases and then bringing these medicines to more patients around the world to drive significant revenue and operating income growth. In 2019, our success in executing against this strategy can be measured by the many important clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones that we expect to achieve this year in both CF and in our non-CF pipeline.","As we look forward to the next several years, we are more confident than ever that the continued execution of this strategy will allow us to create more new medicines that change patients' lives and in so doing deliver outstanding value to our shareholders.","In CF, we're bringing our approved medicines to more patients globally through recent label expansions for KALYDECO and ORKAMBI and the approval and successful launch of SYMDEKO.","Approximately half of all people with CF are today eligible for a Vertex CF medicine. Our goal in CF is to develop medicines for all people with this disease, and we've made significant progress toward that goal with our triple combination regimens that we believe could treat up to 90% of all people with CF in the future, providing many patients with the first medicine to treat the underlying cause of their disease and also providing enhanced benefit for the vast majority of patients currently eligible for our 3 approved medicines.","With both of our triple combination regimens, we have now reported Phase III data that showed potentially transformative clinical benefit for CF patients with 2 F508del mutations as well as for those with 1 F508del mutation and 1 minimal function mutation.","In the second quarter, we expect to obtain the final 24-week data from our Phase III triple combination programs, which will allow us to choose the best regimen to submit for regulatory approvals globally.","We remain on track to submit an NDA in the U.S. in the third quarter followed by an MAA in Europe later this year. We look forward to updating you on our plans and to sharing additional data for our chosen triple combination regimen later this quarter.","I want to also highlight our recent progress outside the CF, where we are advancing potentially transformative medicines for pain, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, sickle cell disease, beta-thalassemia, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and other serious diseases. Our discovery efforts are focused on validated targets in diseases in which we have a deep understanding of the underlying biology and genetics.","By using early clinical markers to predict the potential for these medicines to have transformative benefit, we believe we will significantly increase our probability of success in early proof-of-concept trials, enabling rapid development time lines.","In our AAT program, we initiated clinical development of our first small molecule corrector, VX-814, in late 2018 and are now moving this molecule through Phase I development. Today, we announced that we have received Fast Track Designation from the FDA for this molecule.","We're also advancing other small molecule correctors of AAT through late preclinical development and expect to begin clinical development of a second small molecule AAT corrector in 2019.","In pain, we've established proof-of-concept for NaV1.8 inhibition across multiple Phase II studies of VX-150 in acute, neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain conditions. Data from these studies together with data from a Phase II dose-ranging study of VX-150 will inform our potential development paths in pain.","In addition to our lead molecule VX-150, we have the portfolio of multiple additional NaV1.8 inhibitors in late preclinical development and expect to advance the first of these molecules into the clinic in 2019.","In sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia, we are making rapid progress with our partner, CRISPR Therapeutics, on the development of the gene editing therapy, CTX001. Earlier this year, the first patient with beta-thalassemia was infused with CTX001, marking a significant scientific milestone for the field of gene editing and also a remarkable milestone for our collaboration with CRISPR. We remain on track to dose the first patient with sickle cell disease with CTX001 in the middle of the year.","In addition to our internal R&D efforts, we are focused on gaining access to new technologies, platforms and development assets through external partnerships that fit our strategy of developing transformative medicines for serious specialty diseases. Toward that end, we have entered into multiple collaborations over recent months, including those with Arbor Biotechnologies, Merck KGaA, Genomics plc and X-Chem, which together provide us with access to a broad range of new scientific capabilities. And with our growing free cash flow, we have increased flexibility to enter into additional collaborations to further bolster our pipeline and provide access to new technologies.","Before I close, I'd like to welcome Charlie Wagner to Vertex as our new Chief Financial Officer. Charlie joins us from Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, where he served as CFO and Executive Vice President of Finance. Charlie has served as CFO for public and private companies for more than 10 years, including roles as CFO for Bruker, Progress Software and Millipore. Charlie brings to Vertex significant financial and operational expertise that will help guide us over the coming years as our business becomes more complex through continued global expansion, the treatment of many more patients and the future launches of new medicines.","In welcoming Charlie, I'd also like to thank Paul Silva for his leadership over the last 3 months as our Interim CFO. Paul will continue to play an integral role within the finance organization just as he has since joining the company in 2007.","I'll now turn the call over to Stuart to review our commercial progress. ","Stuart Arbuckle","Thanks, Jeff. Tonight, I'll review our commercial performance for the first quarter driven by the strong underlying demand from our medicines in the U.S. and internationally.","In the first quarter, we continued to increase the number of patients being treated with our CF medicines globally, resulting in product revenues of $857 million. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, our first quarter 2019 revenues were negatively impacted by channel inventory build that occurred at the end of 2018 and by higher gross to net adjustments that we typically experienced early in the year as we highlighted on our call in January.","The first quarter included $320 million of SYMDEKO revenues, including $32 million of SYMKEVI revenues from outside the U.S., primarily from Germany.","SYMKEVI launch in Germany is off to a strong start, with demand coming from patients who never initiated treatment with ORKAMBI as well as patients who discontinued or have switched from ORKAMBI. Throughout 2019, we anticipated additional patients will initiate treatment with SYMDEKO in the U.S. and EU, including younger patients, ages 6 to 11 in the U.S., following potential FDA approval later this year.","With KALYDECO and ORKAMBI, we continue to see new patients initiating treatment as we've secured new reimbursement agreements and received new regulatory approvals for young children around the globe.","Based on our performance in the first quarter, we remain on track to deliver total CF product revenues of $3.45 billion to $3.55 billion for the full year.","Outside the U.S., we continue to make progress achieving reimbursement for our CF medicines. We are focused on obtaining long-term agreements that provide access to all eligible patients. We are seeking agreements that appropriately value our scientific innovation and enable us to continue to invest in the discovery of future CF medicines and medicines for other serious diseases.","I'm pleased in the first quarter of this year, we've achieved multiple pricing agreements and reimbursement milestones. In Germany, we successfully expanded our pricing agreement for ORKAMBI prompted by the EMA approval of the product in children ages 6 to 11 years. We've seen strong demand for ORKAMBI in Germany since the medicine was approved for these younger patients in January of last year. And this recent pricing agreement is further validation of the value that ORKAMBI provides.","In Ireland, as part of our previously reached portfolio agreement, our medicines have now become available to children as young as 1 year old for KALYDECO, children as young as 2 years old for ORKAMBI and patients ages 12 and older for SYMKEVI, including those with a residual function mutation.","We've also reached multiple new reimbursement agreements in smaller countries like Israel and Sweden, reflecting our commitment to bringing our CF medicines to all eligible patients around the world. And in Australia, we recently received a positive recommendation for SYMDEKO from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, an important first step toward formal reimbursement in patients ages 12 and older.","The positive recommendation of SYMDEKO comes as a result of our prior agreement in Australia for ORKAMBI, where we also defined a pathway for rapid access to SYMDEKO.","In summary, I'm pleased that we are bringing our medicines to more patients around the globe and with the resulting strong revenue performance in the first quarter of the year.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Charlie to further review our financial results. ","Charles Wagner","Thanks, Stuart, and good evening, everyone. I'm excited to join Vertex at such an important time in the company's growth, and I look forward to meeting many of you in the coming months.","In addition to Stuart's comments on the performance of our CF products, tonight, I'll review our first quarter financial results and our 2019 financial guidance. All of the results and guidance I will discuss are non-GAAP.","2019 is off to a strong start. Product revenues of $857 million represent an increase of 34% compared to the first quarter of 2018. This increase was driven primarily by the launch of SYMDEKO in the U.S. in 2018 and the recent launch of SYMKEVI in Germany.","Our first quarter 2019 combined R&D and SG&A expenses were $388 million compared to $360 million in the first quarter of 2018. This increase was primarily due to the incremental investment to support the global use of Vertex's medicines and the expansion of Vertex's pipeline in CF and other new disease areas.","A significant growth in revenues and disciplined spending in the first quarter resulted in operating income of $377 million, an 81% increase compared to the first quarter of 2018.","Net income for the first quarter of 2019 was $296 million compared to $196 million in the first quarter of 2018.","We also continue to strengthen our balance sheet, ending the first quarter with approximately $3.48 billion in cash and marketable securities compared to $3.17 billion at the end of 2018. We expect to continue to generate significant cash flow throughout 2019 and beyond as more patients are treated with our medicines, which will enable us to continue our significant investment in internal R&D and in external innovation through business development activities.","Now on to our 2019 guidance. Today, we are reiterating our financial guidance for total product revenues, combined R&D and SG&A expenses and our non-GAAP anticipated effective tax rate. As Stuart mentioned, we continue to expect total CF product revenues in the range of $3.45 billion to $3.55 billion. Our revenue guidance reflects anticipated revenues from countries where our medicines are currently reimbursed. Achieving additional significant reimbursement agreements in 2019 may provide upside to our revenues, and we would update our guidance as appropriate at that time.","We also continue to expect combined R&D and SG&A expenses of $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion. The key investment drivers are ongoing CF development efforts supporting the potential launch of a triple combination regimen and expanding our pipeline into additional diseases.","Our full year 2019 non-GAAP tax rate guidance of 21% to 22% is also unchanged. The vast majority of our tax provision will be a noncash expense until we fully use our net operating losses.","The financial profile of our business is strong and getting stronger. We continue to execute across all aspects of our business, enabling significant revenue and operating income growth, advancement of our pipeline and investment in external innovation. I look forward to updating you on our progress going forward.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Jeff. ","Jeffrey Leiden","Thanks, Charlie. I'm pleased that Vertex is on track to achieve the key goals we established at the start of this year and that we remain well positioned to bring our medicines to more patients, thereby driving significant continued growth in revenue and operating income in 2019 and beyond. Our strategy of creating transformative medicines through serial innovation is working and continues to drive all parts of our business. And I look forward to updating you on our progress over the coming year.","With that, I will open the line to questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Geoff Meacham of Barclays.","Geoff Meacham","Afternoon, guys. Thanks for the question. I have a commercial and a clinical one. From the commercial side, when I compare the time needed to gain full reimbursement broadly across the EU for you guys versus others in this space, it seems substantially longer for Vertex. I guess it's, obviously, pretty important, given the upcoming filing of the triple.","So the question is, what do you think is a tipping point from here to change the conversation with payers across the EU? And what is the plan B? And then I'll follow up on the clinical question.","Stuart Arbuckle","Yes. Thanks for the question, Geoff. It's Stuart here. Yes, it's certainly taken longer than we would have liked to gain reimbursement, but I would like to remind you we've got reimbursement in many, many countries around the world, including in Europe. There are certainly some countries where we don't yet have access and certainly we're not going to give up for the patients who are waiting there until we do have access.","As you know, every market is different and so it's hard to generalize about the time. It's -- the time that it's taken. Certainly, I think the individual tipping point is really very hard to say market-by-market because all of those markets are very different. Certainly, I think we've seen a significant increase in patient advocacy since triple results were released because, clearly, with a medicine which has that kind of level of benefit-risk profile, clearly, there are patients who are going to want those medicines, and I find it very hard to believe that there's going to be government sitting around to deny patients access to such an important medicine that can treat the underlying cause of their disease. ","Geoff Meacham","Okay. And then on the clinical side, in CF, you guys have been able to very quickly develop a whole series of compounds, next-gen correctors and pretty rapidly, and they look very effective. But I'm just curious if - and I know you have a pipeline that's non-CF, but in other pulmonology diseases, COPD and IPF or something like that, is there a way to leverage what you have had success with in San Diego to look at the same assays and the like to come to the same kind of concept in other diseases where you have multiple shots on goal in a whole series of compounds? ","Jeffrey Leiden","Yes, Geoff, thanks for the question. This is Jeff Leiden. I'll take it in a couple of different pieces. First of all, we are really pleased with the speed at which we've been able to develop a whole portfolio of molecules in CF. Just to remind you, molecules like VX-659 and 445 were first synthesized in the laboratory less than 3 years ago. So we are not only through preclinical development, but through Phase III development 3 years in synthesis, which at least in my 30 or 40 years in the industry I haven't seen before. And we've taken a lot of learnings from that.","And when I say we, I mean both David Altshuler in research and Reshma in development. The first thing is that we work on validated targets. With cell markers and biomarkers in preclinical development, they can predict clinical success, and that both increases the probability of success when we get into the clinic, but also speeds the work forward. Don't spend a lot of time in animal models. We move more rapidly into humans.","And in all cases, and we'll talk about our pipeline, we have biomarkers in the clinic that predict early success with small clinical trials in CF. As you remember, 18- or 20-patient phase II trials pretty much tells us the answer. And as you'll see, that's true also of diseases like AAT and sickle cell and pain. And so we're certainly taking that lesson forward as well.","You also asked about leveraging knowledge, and I do want to comment on one distinction. The way that we believe in leveraging knowledge is by leveraging scientific knowledge and not therapeutic area knowledge. In other words, you asked about COPD as an example. We don't have COPD programs even given what we've done in CF because we don't see the same scientific opportunity in COPD than we see in CF. And so we really pick by disease, not by therapeutic area. Disease is where we see large unmet need and scientific opportunity.","And then we do leverage that experience and knowledge into those. AAT is probably the best example because it looks and smells so much like CF. But obviously, it's a genetic disease like CF. It's protein folding disorder like CF. We have a cell system and an animal system that we believe will predict clinical efficacy, and we have a simple biomarker and small trials that will tell us whether we're going to succeed or not.","And so I think you can expect to see very rapid progress in the disease like AAT for the same reasons as in CF. And then maybe the final thing I would say is we do believe very strongly in this portfolio approach, and so you won't see us take rifle shots in these diseases. You'll see us create multiple molecules, and we have that in pain, we have it in AAT, we have it in FSGS, and we'll take multiple molecules into the clinic, which I think is a very important way to reduce risk.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Phil Nadeau of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Phil Nadeau","Thanks for taking the question. A commercial one and a clinical one for me, too. First, on the commercial side, could you give us an update on where the negotiations that have been going on in France over reimbursement stand and whether there's any milestones that we externally could look for through the remainder of 2019 for progress in those negotiations?","Then secondly, on the clinical side, I'm curious about VX-121 and VX-561. You mentioned that has moved into Phase II. When could we see that Phase II data? And is that combo now the most likely route to registration for VX-561? Thanks.","Stuart Arbuckle","Phil, it's Stuart here. I'll take your commercial question and then Reshma will take the clinical question. So as I said previously, we've reached multiple reimbursement agreements around the world over the last couple of years, and I'm pleased to say, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've continued to make a good progress in the first quarter.","But we are certainly fully committed to securing access where we don't, so that all eligible patients can have access to our approved medicines. Every country is different, so I'll talk about England, and then I'll talk about France. As you know, we participated in the Health Select Committee inquiry in England in March that allowed us to explain our position on our company, the value of our medicines and the approach that we were taking to those negotiations.","And I think one of the most positive things out of that inquiry was that we are now back at the table with the NHS and NICE, and I see that as a very positive impact from the Health Select Committee inquiry.","In France, we continue to be in productive discussions with the French authorities and, likewise, we're fully committed there to securing access for any patients that don't have access. I would remind you in France, approximately 1,100 or so of the 1,700 ORKAMBI-eligible patients above 12 were initiated on ORKAMBI and continue to be on ORKAMBI through our early-access programs. And we are being kind of paid for those patients, but we won't recognize revenue for those patients till a final reimbursement agreement is secured. So what I can tell you is we are fully committed to getting access for those patients who've been waiting too long in England and those patients who are still waiting in France as well. I wish I could tell you exactly when we're going to reach a successful conclusion. Unfortunately, that's just not within our ability to predict that. So unfortunately, I can't point you to any specific milestones because there really aren't any along the way that would be externally visible. ","Reshma Kewalramani","Phil, it's Reshma. With regard to VX-121, this is our next-generation corrector, and we have initiated these trials, and this is now in its Phase II proof-of-concept stage. It's a little too early to tell you when we're going to have the results, but I think from the speed that you can see us moving, I expect that we're going to continue to move with that kind of pace as VX-121 makes it through Phase II.","With regard to VX-561, that's the deuterated ivacaftor molecule, and you'll remember the FDA asked us to take that through full-dose ranging in monotherapy, and that's the study that we're initiating now. You are right that VX-561 is in combination with VX-121 in the proof-of-concept study.","But I will say that because we're doing the monotherapy full-dose ranging, actually, we compare VX-561 with any next-generation corrector pair that we think is most appropriate. 121 is certainly one of those opportunities. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Yee of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Michael Yee","Thanks. Question on the CF triple program. I know that you -- or it appears that you're filing in the het\/min and homozygous population together, if I heard that correct. Can you just maybe walk through what you're comparing and what you're looking at to figure out at what point you're going to pick one of those for both het\/min and homozygous?","And then my second question was on the AAT program. You've made some comments about that. Could you just confirm what you might see in Phase I, if anything, from a PK\/PD standpoint that could be helpful. Or you really need to see Phase II data? I think you need to get to like 11 micromolar of AAT. Maybe just talk about Phase I and Phase II a bit. Thanks so much.","Reshma Kewalramani","Sure. This is Reshma. Let me take the first question first and then we'll get to AAT. So as we've discussed on our calls in the past, we are marching down the strategy that we laid out with regard to asset selection. And really, if I break that down, what that means is that we are going to be looking at 24-week data for both FS and FMS for both assets, VX-659 and VX-445. The 445 study went even faster than the 659 study, and that's really what set us up to have this opportunity to look at both sets of 24-week data. And you've actually gleaned exactly the right point. Because we can look at both 24-week data sets, we're going to be filing for both, FS and FMS, regardless of which asset we choose.","With regard to how we're going to make the asset decision, you know who would have ever guessed that the efficacy would be at this level and literally superimposable. And that means we're going to be looking at the full totality of evidence. And of course, it means ppFEV1, but it also means things like pulmonary exacerbation, all the other secondary endpoints and, importantly, the full package of safety information. We're on track to make this decision in Q2 of this year and, importantly, file in Q3 of this year, regardless of whether the asset selection is 445 or 659.","An important thing to share with you is with regard to VX-445. That study has achieved its last patient last visit as of very recently, and so we're really in very good shape and a lot of progress since the last call.","With regard to the AAT program, I'm going to step back a little bit just to make sure everyone has all the information. So that molecule is VX-814, and we just announced today, and I'm delighted to reiterate that, that molecule has received fast track status from the FDA. That's important because I think it gives you an indication of the high unmet need as well as the recognition that therapies are needed to improve the condition of these patients who have a very serious illness.","That study started the SAD, single ascending dose, multiple ascending dose in December of last year. We're going to have the PK results from that study. And then well, I don't know the exact size. It's going to be efficient, as Jeff described in his prepared remarks.","This is very much like CF, and we anticipate that 30, 40, 50 patients, something like that, is what we're going to need to examine, and the readout is very straightforward. It's AAT levels, and we know how to do that. So I anticipate that, that's kind of what you're going to expect to see as this program comes to fruition. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Alethia Young of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","Alethia Young","I was just curious a little bit more about the alpha-1 antitrypsin program, your second molecule. Are you guys thinking that over time it will kind of be a combination game? Or are you just kind of developing this molecule as a backup molecule? And if I may, on pain, can you just discuss some of the rate-limiting steps around making a strategic decision there? ","Reshma Kewalramani","Sure. With regard to alpha-1 antitrypsin, we have a approach here that is very, very similar to CF, and that is to say to have a portfolio of molecules, as we like to say internally once you crack the biology, it's all about pouring on the chemistry. And so portfolio of molecules, including the one that's in the preclinical development, is there to allow us to choose the very best molecules to bring forward. Unlike CF, just to comment very specifically on your question about is it going to be a combination of monotherapy approach, that's why it's not like CF. A single molecule, we believe, will be sufficient to treat the underlying cause of disease here. So that's AAT.","With regard to pain, what we're really looking at here is positive studies with VX-150 in a model of acute pain, that was bunionectomy; musculoskeletal pain, that was the osteoarthritis study; and small fiber neuropathy, that's the model of neuropathic pain. And then we went on to do a dose-ranging study in bunionectomy because that was a good model for us to use.","We're going to look at all of that data and look at our portfolio of molecules, again, same strategy, once we crack the biology, and I really do believe we've cracked the biology of 1.8, which is no easy task. You know many, many people have worked on this over a long period of time, including ourselves. We're going to have that all together, and in the second half of this year, I anticipate we'll have all the information we need to decide on which molecule or molecules and exactly what the next step is. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ying Huang of BoA Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Ying Huang","First one is on U.K. reimbursement. I believe Jeff mentioned previously that even with the clinical benefit of the triple combination you observed, still the nice methodology may not come out with the pricing that's close to what you think is the value of this medication. So do you think, based on your interaction with NICE recently, is there any change in the NICE thought process of how to evaluate this? And then secondly, I think you previously also disclosed that the average blended revenue per patient was about $150,000 in 2018. Can you comment on the trend for that number going forward? ","Jeffrey Leiden","Yes. This is Jeff, Ying. Thanks for the 2 questions and, obviously, they're related. So just to be clear on the triple, the NICE methodology has, as you know, a number of different components to it, major one is the value of medicine to patients as described by the clinical results and, clearly, there the triple is significantly better than the other 2 existing medicines that they've already evaluated. They haven't yet evaluated the triple in their system, so it's a little early to tell, but we certainly know from the clinical data that there is a major benefit.","With respect to the more general question of the NICE methodology and how well it applies to these kinds of precision medicines, I think you know that there's been quite a bit of discussion in the U.K. and in Parliament about the fact that it's probably time to take another look at that NICE methodology, not for community medicines and not for the ultra-orphans, where it seems to work well, but for exactly this kind of precision medicine for the patient populations that fall in between. And we do anticipate and hope over the next couple of years that, that methodology may be revised as per the current discussions to better evaluate the value of these medicines. Obviously, that's going to help, too.","With respect to the average blended price, I think you can -- we, obviously, don't give long-term guidance on price. Certainly, it's too early for triple price. We don't give long-term guidance on revenue either, but I think one way to think about this is we're currently treating about 18,000 patients, generating about $3 billion in revenue.","As we go to a triple world, where the benefit to patients is greater, we certainly don't anticipate major decrease as in the price of our triple versus our other medicines, given its value. And so you can begin to sort of do some rough math around as we move from 18,000 to potentially 65,000 or 68,000 eligible patients what that might look like across the world. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of SVB Leerink. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey Porges","Jeff, just a follow-up on a prior question. Wondering if you could just confirm the year-over-year and sequential treated patient number trend so that we can see what the underlying dynamics are across all the different products? And could you give us a sense of what the sequential trend in the gross to net in the U.S. was?","And then lastly, just wondering if you could give us an update on alpha-1? Is it your belief that a serum alpha-1 antitrypsin level will be sufficient for approval? Or is that just for the next study that you plan? Is there any obligation to show a pulmonary outcome benefit the way you do in CF? ","Jeffrey Leiden","Yes. Thanks for the questions, Geoff. Maybe we'll do them in a reverse order. Reshma will do the AAT question with respect to endpoints. Paul will do a bit on gross to net and how we're seeing that going forward for the year. And I'll give you some color on how we think patient penetration will go over the next several years. ","Reshma Kewalramani","So Geoff, this is Reshma. With regard to exactly what the regulatory enabling endpoint will be for our program, it's a bit too early to call that because we haven't engaged in all of those regulatory discussions. But what I can tell you is a little bit about the context of the currently available medicines, and then you could start to think about how this might all work. So there are about 4 companies out there that make augmentation therapies.","This is a therapy that you go into center once a week and you get an infusion of the protein. And this, as you know, has its own limitations in that it only really has the opportunities to treat the lung disease part of it. It really doesn't do anything for the liver disease, which is different than our approach, which is going to be able to target both liver and lung. So with that approach, all the companies have been able to secure U.S. FDA approval based on AAT level. So that's a data point, and we have to go through our process to determine exactly how it's going to work for us. Stuart -- sorry, that's Paul. Over to you. ","Paul Silva","Yes. Geoff, thanks for the question. So when we exited 2018, the gross to net in the U.S. was approximately 10%. And I think we said in Q1 call and [it's been] now that we expect 2019 to be between 10% and 12%. And that's driven by 2 things: one is increased purchases by 340B entities, which have a statutory rate discounts similar to Medicaid; and then the second one would be the anticipated spend on our cost sharing program. So those 2 things are kind of bringing that number up a little bit over the course of 2019. ","Jeffrey Leiden","And then Geoff, maybe for your final question, which is really how do we see the penetration going with our medicines as we go forward, I think there's going to be 2 phases. You can think about 2019 as being a continuation of some of the things that you've heard about plus the new label expansion. So SYMKEVI, I think, as Stuart mentioned, is off to a very nice start in Germany, and we expect to see continued growth there. There's still a bit of growth with SYMDEKO here in the U.S., although we've probably seen most of that.","And then these new label indications for younger ages for KALYDECO, for SYMDEKO in the U.S. for the younger age, et cetera, will provide more growth this year. And all of that is accounted for in our guidance for the year. What is not accounted for in our guidance for the year is, if we were able to obtain reimbursement in one of the major countries, for instance, in England or France, the 2 big companies, obviously, that would have a positive effect on this year's growth rate.","Obviously, any early approvals for some of these label indications also might have a positive effect. And then we're really into the world of triple. As we get approval in triple, which as we've said we believe can ultimately treat 90% of all patients, we do see significant penetration into that, that group going from 30,000 eligible patients to 65,000 or 68,000 and penetration of that age group that looks a lot like KALYDECO because of the efficacy of the drug. So I think that's the way to think about the growth ramp going forward. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Abrahams of RBC Capital Markets. ","Brian Abrahams","Congrats on all the progress. Two questions for me. On the AAT program, what gives you the most confidence that the AAT produced will be functional and that the liver outflow will reverse damage from the prior accumulation of toxic polymers to the same degree in humans who may have the disease long term as you saw in the transgenic mouse model? And then just a second question, commercially, I was wondering if you could help quantify the quarter-over-quarter impact of inventory draw-downs across the CF portfolio? ","Jeffrey Leiden","Yes. Maybe I'll take the AAT question and Stuart will like the inventory question, I think. So on AAT, those -- you're asking the most important questions. And one of the things we really like about the program is that we're able to test our correctors in both cells and in a transgenic animal that are actually expressing the mutant human protein, not a mutant mouse protein.","So they're engineered with the human protein. And we can measure not only the levels, but we can actually measure functional levels. So we're not simply measuring by immunoassay the levels of this protein, we're actually measuring the functional levels. And that's how we had great confidence that we're actually producing functional protein and, in fact, we're clearing both the cells, and as you've seen -- if you saw my JPMorgan presentation, we're clearing the liver in these animals of the misfolded human mutant protein.","And that gives us a high level of confidence that we are actually able to produce -- not only to correct the folding, but produce functional protein once we do it, and that's a very, very important piece of the data package, which has encouraged us to move rapidly with humans.","Now humans, as Reshma said, we're going to be able to measure the same thing. We'll not only measure the serum levels of protein, which we can obviously do, but we'll actually measure the functional levels of protein in the serum. And we know from essentially an experimentative nature from the heterozygous parents of these patients, who are normal, by the way, and they express anywhere from 11 micromolar on probably 17 micromolar is really -- a functional protein is really fully protective. And so we can simply measure the levels of functional protein in these treated patients and, again, with rather small trials, like the CF trials, know exactly where we are. But the cell data and the mouse data used in the human protein gives us the high level of confidence. Did that answer your question? ","Brian Abrahams","That's really helpful. ","Jeffrey Leiden","And in the liver, as I said, we're looking directly at the livers of the mice, and we're seeing clearing. And at some point in this clinical program, we will also look at the livers of patients to confirm if that's true. Stuart... ","Stuart Arbuckle","Yes. And Brian, on inventory. So at the end of 2018, we had about $10 million worth of inventory build here in the U.S. This is typical towards the end of the calendar year. That excess inventory was more than burnt off during the course of the first quarter. ","Operator","And the next question comes from Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. ","Cory Kasimov","A couple of quick CF ones for you. First of all, with SYMDEKO, at this stage of launch, roughly what percent of patients are still switching to SYMDEKO from other regimens versus those that are new to therapy altogether? And secondly, thinking about VX-561, how important do you believe a once-a-day regimen is for CF patients? Do you hear much pushback on the twice-a-day administration you have out there now? ","Stuart Arbuckle","Yes. So Corey, I'll take those. So in terms of the switching and where are we versus uptake in na\u00efve, we really only got data around that for a substantial period of time here in the U.S., obviously, because we launched SYMDEKO here in February of 2018. What I'll tell you is we've actually seen really high levels of uptake in whole of the populations you might expect, those patients who are na\u00efve to ORKAMBI, those who've never been exposed to a CFTR modulator before, those who were on ORKAMBI and those who had tried ORKAMBI and discontinued.","So all of those groups we saw very substantial uptake. We're on the flatter path of the launch curve, I would say, here in the U.S., but we're certainly not flat. There are still patients being added in all of those categories just about every day. And the other one, I think, I would say that we are able to be much more confident about now in the real world is we had always thought that given the profile of SYMDEKO that we would expect to see high levels of persistence and compliance, higher than we had seen with ORKAMBI. And I'm pleased to say that's exactly what's playing out in the real world.","In terms of deuterated ivacaftor 561, certainly, given the uptake rates we see with our medicines, clearly, a twice-a-day regimen for medicines, which are as important as this, treating the underlying course of the disease is not something which is inhibiting people from taking our medicines. And then indeed, as you know, these patients are taking many, many different types and forms of medicines every day. And so twice-a-day medicine is not difficult for them. However, our goal is to get to carrier levels of status and provide as much convenience as we possibly can for the patients. And so we do see once-a-day being something that would be an advantage for our medicines, and that's why we want to bring 561 to patients as soon as we possibly can. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Matteis with Stifel. ","Paul Matteis","Just continuing the trend on alpha-1 antitrypsin. I was wondering if there are any biomarkers you can look at in early studies that can detect whether or not your compound is having the benefit in the liver that you hope anything related to inflammation or liver enzyme elevations? And then secondarily, I was wondering if you can just clarify when or the current thinking on specific study design for NaV1.8 in Phase III and whether or not the next compound might go after any other pain indications outside of the ones you pursued thus far. ","Reshma Kewalramani","Sure. Let me take the NaV1.8 first and then I'll go backwards to AAT. So with regard to Phase III design, I think the 3 models that we've talked about are a good way to think about it, the musculoskeletal pain and osteoarthritis, but there are, obviously, a number of other pain conditions in musculoskeletal that we could pursue. And in the small fiber neuropathy, which is what we did in the VX-150 example, there is, of course, trigeminal neuralgia and other pain conditions that one would pursue to get the full breadth of neuropathic pain.","And bunionectomy as a model of acute pain, I think the kind of studies you could imagine are bunionectomy, which would be the hard tissue, something like an abdominoplasty or a hernia repair as some of the soft tissue example. And the guidance is actually fairly straightforward with regard to what kind of studies you need to do and the approximate sample size for any one of these conditions. So I think what you'll see us do is bring the best molecule forward and then use the fairly typical Phase III development path to get these approved.","With regard to AAT, I think the question was around how we're going to figure out whether or not there is liver impact. So this is kind of interesting. There is a paper from the Brantly Lab down in Florida, and it was out maybe 2 years ago, November or something like that, and what you can tell is that perhaps AAT is best known clinically as a disease that looks like COPD, just COPD in younger people. There's actually a substantial burden of liver disease, and that liver disease is manifest when you do something like a liver biopsy, which is what that Brantly series did. It actually looked at about 100-or-so patients over time.","Now with regard to inflammatory markers, the markers of liver disease, AST, ALT, that actually doesn't give you a very good idea. GGT is said to be very best, but it's not very sensitive nor is it particularly specific. But I think what something that Jeff said is really the important point. In our animal models, what we're doing is actually looking at liver tissue. So there's no guesswork here, and it's not a question of whether we see enzymes moving. We're actually looking at the liver cells with the misfolded protein and then the clearance of that with VX-814. And I anticipate that as we go to clinical studies, biopsies are going to be an important part of that. I hope that answers the question. ","Paul Matteis","Yes, it does. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Ravi Mehrotra of Evercore ISI. ","Ravi Mehrotra","Thank you for taking my question, which is around possible pharmacoeconomic arguments for broader utilization of your CF franchise. You've got over a decade now of real-world clinical experience with your agents. So in the setting that P is an art form rather than science per se, can you give us some color on some of the P data points you can or have taken to resistant payers. ","Stuart Arbuckle","Yes. Ravi, this is Stuart. Thanks verry much for the question. Yes, as you say, pulmonary exacerbation themselves are very, very important endpoints certainly for patients and physicians, but also they are of interest too to payers as well. The kinds of things that we've looked at on pulmonary exacerbations, both actually in our clinical trials, but also in our longer-term follow-up studies include dissecting the pulmonary exacerbations into those that lead to things like IV antibiotics, those that lead to hospitalizations, what the length of those hospitalization stays are and things like that because, obviously, those are of interest to payers. As you say, we have the benefit of being on the market for a while now.","And with KALYDECO, we have the longest experience, but we've got increasingly large volumes of data on ORKAMBI as well. And so we're able to take not only data on pulmonary exacerbations, but increasingly being able to take data on perhaps even the most important outcomes, which are things like survival rates, things like avoidance of lung transplants and things like that. And so that data base continues to increase.","We certainly utilize that with payers around the world are building that into our pharmacoeconomic arguments. Obviously, it requires a bit of a leap of faith for some of our newer medicines because it's asking them to extrapolate from KALYDECO and ORKAMBI to right now SYMKEVI and eventually to the triple combinations, but I don't think it's too much of a leap of faith for them to translate the benefits of 1 CFTR modulator to other CFTR modulator. ","Jeffrey Leiden","And, Ravi, this is Jeff. Just to give you some of the data around that if you're not familiar with it. The results that we're seeing with KALYDECO and some of these long-term registry studies are things like 50%-plus decreases in mortality, 50% decrease in the slope of decline of lung function, 70% decrease in transplantation. So these are not subtle kinds of results, these are true disease-modifying kinds of results. And when those are plugged into these pharmacoeconomic models, they have real impact. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Hartaj Singh of Oppenheimer & Company. ","Hartaj Sing","I just had a question on the SYMDEKO launch, it's been going very well. And I think you've got a [indiscernible] with ORKAMBI with payer uptake both in the United States and ex U.S. And my sense is that the pace of uptake for SYMDEKO, which had better data than ORKAMBI, has been broader and quicker in the United States than in Europe and the rest of the world. Maybe you can just talk to that a little bit. Or maybe I'm mistaken. I would really appreciate it. ","Stuart Arbuckle","Yes. So I would say, in the U.S., we have always managed to get very broad access to our CFTR moderators, starting with KALYDECO and through ORKAMBI and now to SYMDEKO and even for each of the individual label expansions that we've had over time. So I don't think there's really a very substantial time difference. Certainly, I think payers are getting more accustomed to these agents and to the disease, and I think that's helping. So I think we are seeing some acceleration here in the U.S., but it's not huge. What I think you're seeing play out outside the U.S. actually is the -- is a couple of things.","Firstly, you're seeing the benefit of our portfolio agreements, and this was exactly what they were designed to do. They were designed to reduce the time lag between regulatory approval and reimbursement approval so the patients and physicians could access to our newest and best medicines as soon as they possibly can. And so that I think is what's leading to the acceleration in patients being able to access SYMDEKO or SYMKEVI outside the U.S. versus what we saw with ORKAMBI.","And then separately, in Germany, what you're seeing is actually the launch of SYMKEVI is going substantially better than the launch of ORKAMBI. I think the team has done a terrific job there. Certainly, the benefit-risk profile of the agent helps, but certainly, the team has done an excellent job executing there in Germany, and the SYMKEVI launch is tracking substantially above the ORKAMBI launch at the same time point. We're seeing initiations in na\u00efve patients. We're seeing initiations in patients who had discontinuations. And we're also seeing some switching as well. And so I think that's really an example of the team executing really well. ","Michael Partridge","Operator, we'll take 2 more questions. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Skorney of Baird. ","Brian Skorney","Jeff, I know we've kind of talked around this a little before, but I just wanted to kind of push you again on the consideration of 659 and 445 and which one you'll ultimately move forward with. I mean in chronic therapy, whether it's NRTIs in HIV or TNF-alphas, we really don't get kind of the full picture of efficacy and safety until you have tens of thousands of patient years behind you. So I guess my question is why not just submit both for approval and start to build that database and let patients and physicians ultimately decide which is the better triple combination when we have -- there's enough information out there to decide if there are subtle differences? ","Jeffrey Leiden","Yes. It's a good question, Brian. We have talked about it a little bit before. And what we're balancing is our level of confidence in the information versus the potential confusion of patients and physicians when we're trying to launch 2 drugs simultaneously into the same population. And I think the good news here, and this is what Reshma has said before, is just how good the efficacy data that we're seeing is. And so, so far what we're seeing is it's a hard choice because they're so similar.","And if that turns out to be true when we look at the 24-week data, and we're seeing this kind of superior efficacy not only across primary endpoint, but across all the secondary endpoints, I think we're going to have a very high level of confidence that whichever asset we choose as the best one is going to be very, very good for these patients.","And then on the other side of the equation, as you know, as I know from being around for a while, trying to launch 2 drugs simultaneously into 1 patient population and explain that to doctors and patients can be very, very confusing. And once you do that, the ability to ultimately make your decision and withdraw 1 drug is virtually impossible.","And so you're committed to, long term, having 2 drugs on the market that look identical and in different patient populations. And I think that's probably not the best thing to do for patients. So at the end of the day, the decision is it's best for patients to make the decision on the best asset and bring it to them. And we feel like we have enough data now in hundreds of patients so that we're going to be confident of what we're going to see. ","Operator","And our last question comes from Alan Carr of Needham and Company. ","Alan Carr","I was wondering if you can elaborate a bit more about what's different with VX-121, what you're hoping to see there. And then with the pain program, maybe a little more detail around this too in terms of what you're looking for, for these next-generation compounds that you have in relation to VX-150. Why are you waiting to move forward with that? And what's involved in decision process here? ","Reshma Kewalramani","Sure thing. This is Reshma. I'm going to tackle the first question, and I'm going to toss it over to Jeff to talk about pain. So as you know, our long-stated goal, and it remains today, is to bring therapies for all patients with CF. And in there, what we're trying to do is bring patients to carrier level. That's really, really important. And that also ties back to a point that Stuart made, we want to bring the most convenient regimen that brings all patients to carrier level.","And so what we're doing is in our labs in San Diego is we have assays and many of you have seen them are our HBE cells that we now have a plethora of data of how these assays translate to the Phase II and Phase III results. And so we pick the best of the best molecules that come out of our labs. And when they meet these thresholds -- and I admit it, we have set an extremely high bar. When there are molecules like VX-121 that meet this high bar, we advance them to the clinic to meet this ultimate goal. Jeff? ","Jeffrey Leiden","Yes. With respect to the pain question, it's a bit similar to what Reshma was talking about before in terms of portfolio modules. First thing I would say is we have, I think, convinced ourselves and others that we have very high efficacy molecules here with 150 and the approach we've taken. I think we've convinced ourselves with a reasonable number of patients that VX-150 is highly tolerable, and we're also very convinced that there's not addictive potential of these drugs. Those were the high things -- high bar we were trying to match for a new pain compound.","Now we're in the process of picking the best drug, and that involves a lot of other things. So for example, is it formulatable both IV and p.o., whether any manufacturing issues, cost of goods issues, dosing, dose scheduling. So in pain, what we'd like to have is the best molecule that combines efficacy, tolerability, lack of addictive potential, but also the right dose, the right dosing regimen, the IV to p.o. transition in the hospital. It's a pretty high bar, but because we have a whole portfolio of molecules, we believe we will find that molecule, and that's the one that we really want to take through Phase III and to commercialize. ","Alan Carr","You're not running any efficacy studies with the earlier stage NaV1.8 compounds. It's just Phase I or... ","Jeffrey Leiden","Well, they're earlier, right? So they will enter -- we hope to enter the clinic this year with them. We again have learned a lot from our VX-150 experience and so we hope that as we get through to Phase I, we'll be able to pretty quickly go through Phase II programs and compare them to VX-150 and make decisions about which is the best molecule to take forward. And that doesn't mean, by the way, that it's not VX-150, but I just want to make it clear that we're taking a portfolio approach.

And a replay of tonight\u2019s call will also be available on the website once we have concluded.","Dr. Jeff Leiden, Chairman and CEO; Stuart Arbuckle, Chief Commercial Officer; and Ian Smith, Chief Financial Officer, will provide prepared remarks this evening. They will be joined by Dr. Jeff Chodakewitz, Chief Medical Officer for the Q&A portion of the conference call.","We will make forward-looking statements on this call. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in today's press release and our 10-K, which has been filed with the SEC. These statements, including without limitation those regarding the ongoing development and potential commercialization of our drug candidates, our expectations regarding our improved medicines and Vertex's future financial performance are based on management's current assumptions.

I would also refer you to Slide 4 of tonight\u2019s webcast.","I will now turn the call over to Dr. Jeff Leiden.","Jeffrey Leiden","Thanks, Michael. Good evening, everyone. Over the last four year\u2019s Vertex has delivered two transformative medicines to people with cystic fibrosis. Today there are approximately 27,000 people eligible for one of our approved CF medicines and we have a clear path toward our goal of helping potentially all people with this rare and life-shortening disease in the future.","We\u2019re confident that our experience with ORKAMBI and KALYDECO and our scientific leadership and progress and targeting the underlying biology of this disease positions us well to increase the number of people treated with our approved medicines and to develop new medicines in the years ahead that may provide even greater benefit for all people with CF.","Tonight, I will provide brief comments on three key areas which serve as markers of our progress toward treating all people with CF, including first the performance of our approved medicines ORKAMBI and KALYDECO and our roadmap toward treating more patients with these medicines that will drive revenue growth in 2016 and beyond.","Second, the role of VX-661 in helping to achieve our long-term goal in CF and third, our pipeline of additional CFTR modulators and other mechanisms we are advancing as part of collaborations. These approaches include ENaC inhibition and in the longer-term gene editing CRISPR-Cas9 and may position us to help all people with CF.","We are approximately nine months into the launch of ORKAMBI in the U.S. For people with two copies of the F508del CFTR mutation ages 12 and older. As of the end of March approximately 65% or 5,500 of the 8,500 currently eligible patients in the U.S. have intimated treatment with ORKAMBI.","We expect the number of patients who\u2019ve initiated treatment with ORKAMBI will continue to grow during 2016 and we continue to expect that by the end of the year the vast majority of all eligible patients ages 12 and older in the U.S. will have initiated treatment. We\u2019ve seen excellent reimbursement and access for ORKAMBI from public and private payers in the U.S. And the feedback from the CF community continues to be very positive.","Importantly patients across the U.S. have broad access to the medicine through public and private insurance and we have assistance programs in place for eligible patients who need additional help. All major commercial insurers and all 50 state Medicaid programs are currently covering ORKAMBI reflecting the important advance and value this medicine represents in the treatment of CF.","We are now moving forward toward bringing ORKAMBI to younger patients and at the end of March we submitted a supplemental new drug application to the FDA requesting approval of ORKAMBI for children age of six to 11 with two copies of the F508del mutation. We requested priority review, which if granted, would provide us with a decision on the application in the second half of this year.","If approved approximately 2,400 additional patients in the U.S. would be eligible for treatment. Outside the U.S. we have commenced discussions with reimbursement agencies in various European and other countries. Given the clinical benefits of ORKAMBI and the severity of the disease for people with two copies of the F508del mutation, we believe that we will achieve reimbursement from key European and other government payers just as we\u2019ve seen in the U.S.","ORKAMBI is already commercially available in Germany and through early access programs in France. In the near-term, the progress and our understanding of treating eligible patients with ORKAMBI gives us clarity on a revenue expectation for 2016. Later in the call Stuart and Ian will talk about the ORKAMBI launch in detail, our guidance, and how we think about revenue trends from 2015 and growth into 2016 and further into the future.","For KALYDECO we are increasing our revenue guidance for 2016 which Stuart will discuss in his remarks. As we think about the future opportunities for ORKAMBI and KALYDECO I want to emphasize that revenue growth in 2016 and beyond is largely a function of additional patients who are currently eligible for ORKAMBI or KALYDECO initiating treatment with these medicines. On that basis alone we believe there is significant growth ahead for both medicines.","Consider that today ORKAMBI and KALYDECO are approved for approximately 27,000 people worldwide, but we are only currently treating approximately one-third of these patients. As we see additional uptake of ORKAMBI in the U.S. and achieve reimbursement for eligible patients outside the U.S. growth will continue as additional patients continue to initiate treatment.","In addition, there are many more patients not currently eligible for treatment, who may benefit from either ORKAMBI or KALYDECO. In total, we believe there are approximately 44,000 people an additional 17,000 people beyond those eligible today who could benefit from one of these two medicines.","This additional group of patients was largely comprised of the following: First, approximately 12,000 people less than 12 years of age, who have two copies of the F508del mutation and who may be helped by ORKAMBI. And second, approximately 5,000 patients who may be helped by KALYDECO comprised mostly of patients who have residual function mutation.","Treating a substantial portion of this additional group of 17,000 patients would further drive ORKAMBI and KALYDECO growth if we obtain future approvals for these additional groups of patients. We have ongoing studies, regulatory submissions, and development plans to support these efforts including ongoing discussions with the FDA regarding our application for approval of KALYDECO and approximately 1,500 people ages two and older with one of 23 residual function mutations, as well as our recent sNDA submission to the FDA for approval of ORKAMBI in children ages six to 11 with two copies of the F508del mutation.","While we are focused on getting ORKAMBI and KALYDECO to as many patients as soon as possible, we also recognize that there are many patients who are still waiting for a treatment for the underlying cause of their disease. We hear from these patients often, so I am particularly pleased to report that our CF pipeline is advancing. This gives us great confidence that we will ultimately be able to treat the vast majority of people with CF and potentially enhance the benefit for those people currently taking our approved medicines.","I will start with VX-661, which could play an important role in the treatment of people with CF and it\u2019s currently in Phase III development. In combination with ivacaftor our Phase II data suggests that VX-661 may have an improved benefit risk profile compared to ORKAMBI in people with two copies of the F508del mutation and may provide enhanced clinical benefits over ivacaftor monotherapy for other patients with gating mutations.","We are on track to obtain the first data from the ongoing Phase III program for VX-661 in early 2017 from the study in people with two copies of the F508del mutation. Additionally, VX-661 is positioned to play a key role in the development of a triple combination with a next-generation corrector and ivacaftor.","We believe that this triple combination approach will be fundamental for two reasons. First, triple combinations may allow us to treat a very large group of patients who are not helped today by either ORKAMBI or KALYDECO, including those with one F508del mutation and a second mutation that causes minimal CFTR function. And second, these regimens could provide even greater benefit to patients currently eligible for our approved medicines who have at least one F508del mutation.","Today, we have two next-gen correctors in clinical development VX-152 and VX-440. These potential medicines are currently being evaluated in Phase I studies in healthy volunteers. Successful completion of these studies would enable us to move rapidly into Phase II studies in the second half of 2016 to evaluate one or more next-generation correctors with VX-661 and ivacaftor and people with CF.","I\u2019ll now turn to our pipeline of other potential CF medicines that could be complementary to our portfolio of CFTR modulator and it may enable us to treat more patients and provide greater clinical benefit in the years to come. The most advanced example of this is our lead ENaC inhibitor VX-371.","Today, we announced data from our Phase II 14-day study of VX-371 in 142 people with CF, who are not receiving ORKAMBI or KALYDECO. The study met its primary endpoint of safety, 96% of the patients who enrolled in the study completed all treatment and the treatment regimens consisting of VX-371 were generally well tolerated. There were no statistically significant changes from baseline in FEV1 for those patients who received VX-371 compared to placebo.","The data announced today are consistent with our in vitro data that did not show a meaningful change in cilia beat frequency when VX-371 was used alone in human bronchial epithelial cells with two copies of the F508del mutation. In contrast, these in vitro data did show a meaningful change in cilia beat frequency when VX-371 was used in combination with ORKAMBI.","Together, the in vitro on clinical safety data generated to date provide further support for our ongoing study of VX-371 in combination with ORKAMBI. This ongoing study began enrolling people with two copies of the F508del mutation ages 12 and older in the first quarter of this year. And the primary endpoints are safety and mean absolute change from baseline in lung function at a 28 of treatment as compared to placebo. Additional information on these studies can be found in our first quarter press release issued today.","Additionally, last year we entered into a collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics with a longer-term goal of discovering gene editing approaches for the treatment of genetic diseases including CF. The use of this technology in people with CF maybe many year\u2019s away, but it is strategically important as we think about future advances that could fundamentally change the treatment of this disease in the years to come.","Tonight, I have summarized how we think about our opportunity in CF. An opportunity that is unique both in terms of the potential benefits that ORKAMBI and KALYDECO provides the people with CF today. And also for the long-term potential of our development stage medicines to treat the vast majority of people with CF in the future.","In conclusion, I\u2019ll make just a few comments about the type of company we will become as we achieve the success in CF that I have just outlined. Vertex is on a path toward sustained earnings and revenue growth driven by an increasing number of people being treated with KALYDECO and ORKAMBI.","We believe our business model when focused on significant investment to create value through innovation, research and development positions us to consistently discover and deliver transformative new medicines for patients and to reinvest in scientific opportunities to create future medicines.","With that, I will turn the call over to Stuart to make more specific comments on the ORKAMBI launch.","Stuart Arbuckle","Thanks, Jeff and hello everyone. Tonight, I will review our progress with the launch of ORKAMBI, the basis of our 2016 guidance for ORKAMBI product revenues and our ongoing efforts to obtain reimbursement outside the U.S. to drive further growth of ORKAMBI in 2017 and beyond. We are now just over nine months into the launch and we are pleased that approximately 65% of eligible patients in the U.S. have initiated treatment with ORKAMBI to date.","Global sales of ORKAMBI in the first quarter were $223 million comprised of U.S. sales of approximately $214 million, and ex-U.S. sales of approximately $9 million, which were mainly from Germany. At the beginning of the year, our intention was to provide financial guidance for 2016 ORKAMBI revenues, once we had gained sufficient understanding of the dynamics of the launch in the U.S.","Today, we have a deeper understanding of how doctors and their patients are using the medicine. Based on the real world treatment patterns we've observed in more than 4500 patients who initiated treatment in the U.S. in 2015.","I'll now share with you our understanding of the launched dynamics that informed our guidance. First, uptake defined as the total proportion of the 8500 eligible patients in the U.S. who will begin treatment with ORKAMBI by the end of 2016 and also the rate at which these patients initiate treatment.","Second the persistence rate, defined as the proportion of patients who start and remain on treatment. And third, the compliance rate which reflects the number of pills actually taken by a patient in a given month.","First to uptake, to date approximately 65% of the 8500 eligible patients in the U.S. have initiated treatment with ORKAMBI comprised of more than 3000 patients who initiated treatment in the third quarter of 2015 more than 1500 in the fourth quarter, and approximately 800 in the first quarter of 2016.","We have seen further initiations in April and expect that patient initiations will continue throughout 2016 albeit the lower rate than in the first three quarters post launch. We continue to expect the vast majority of the eligible patients ages 12 and older in the U.S. will initiate treatment with ORKAMBI by the end of this year.","Second, persistence among patients who have initiated ORKAMBI since launch, we\u2019ve seen that approximately 15% of patients discontinued treatment within three months of starting treatment. Our clinical trial and market research data indicate that these discontinuations are largely related to respiratory adverse events.","After the first three months of treatment, the discontinuation rate then slows considerably. Based on what we've observed to date from all patients taking ORKAMBI including those who have been on commercial drug for up to nine months and those who continue to receive ORKAMBI as part of our Phase III long-term extension study. We expect that the proportion of all patients who initiate and remain on treatment will stabilize at approximately 70% to 80%.","It is also important to point out that the pattern of patient initiations and discontinuations had an offsetting effect on our first quarter ORKAMBI revenues. Specifically because more than 4,500 patients began treatment with ORKAMBI in 2015 the impact of approximately 15% of these patients discontinuing ORKAMBI was highly evident in the first quarter.","Therefore while approximately 800 new patients initiated treatments in the first quarter. This growth was largely offset by the bolus of patients who discontinued treatment. This bolus of discontinuations began in the fourth quarter, but had a larger impact on the first quarter of 2016, where there were also fewer patient initiations to offset these discontinuations.","And finally compliance. Based on what we've observed to date from the launch we expect the compliance rate with ORKAMBI to be between 70% and 80%. In summary, based on our understanding of the launch dynamics for ORKAMBI and the fact that we have continued to see additional patients initiating treatment with ORKAMBI in April. We expect to deliver quarter-to-quarter revenue growth for ORKAMBI beginning in the second quarter and continuing through the end of 2016 and into 2017.","I will now turn to the use of ORKAMBI to date outside the U.S. We are now well into the reimbursement process in all key European countries Canada and Australia. Specifically the clinical and cost-effectiveness assessment portions of the reimbursement process. These discussions are going as expected and have been productive. We believe that government payers across Europe recognize both the severity of this disease and the broad clinical benefits of ORKAMBI. These discussions will take time to complete.","However, as Jeff mentioned earlier we believe that we will achieve broad reimbursement from key European and other government payers just as we've seen in the United States. ORKAMBI is already available commercially in Germany and through early access programs in France. We are only three months into the launch of ORKAMBI in Germany and the uptake has been slower than we observed in the U.S.","We attribute this to a number of factors, including that CF care in Germany is not concentrated in large centers as we\u2019ve seen in other countries. Meaning there are many smaller centers and also many centers and physicians who have not yet had personal experience with CFTR modulators.","In Germany, there are approximately 2,500 patients eligible for treatment. As of March 31, 2016 approximately 230 patients had initiated treatment. However, we expect the number of patients initiating treatment in Germany will grow through 2016 and into 2017. We do not expect what we are seeing in Germany will be representative of the uptake in other European countries.","In fact in France where early access programs provide the opportunity for physicians to begin treating patients with ORKAMBI prior to formal reimbursement approval. We have already seen approximately 400 of the 1,500 eligible patients initiate treatment with ORKAMBI in 2016.","We took all of this information into account when we set 2016 revenue guidance for ORKAMBI of $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion. Our guidance reflects our understanding of the ongoing U.S. launch as I just discussed. As well as expectations that we will receive both approval for ORKAMBI in the U.S. for patients ages 6 to 11 in the second half of 2016 and certain revenues from sales of ORKAMBI outside the U.S., primarily from Germany.","Taking a longer-term view we expect significant further growth for ORKAMBI revenues in 2017 driven primarily by patients initiating treatment following the completion of reimbursement discussions outside the U.S.","And now to KALYDECO. Today we are increasing our financial guidance for 2016 revenues. We now expect KALYDECO net revenues of $685 million to $705 million. The prior guidance provided on January 10, 2016 was for KALYDECO net revenues of $670 million to $690 million. We increased our KALYDECO guidance based primarily on an increasing number of patients initiating treatment with KALYDECO globally and on expectations of a reduced impact this year from the VX-661 Phase III program. Our guidance for KALYDECO excludes any potential revenues from the approval of KALYDECO for people with residual function mutations.","I'll now hand the call over to Ian.","Ian Smith","Thank you Stuart and good evening to everyone. With the closing of the first quarter of 2016 and nine months into the launch of ORKAMBI, we are seeing significant progress across our business. Notably, we are seeing increasing number of patients being treated with our approved medicines resulting in a growing revenue base that we expect to drive earnings growth.","I will now review our first quarter financial results and provide some specific comments about the long-term financial trajectory of our business. Financial results first, in the first quarter of 2016 we reported total CF product revenues of approximately $394 million, a significant increase compared to a $130 million in the first quarter of 2015.","With ORKAMBI, we reported sales of $223 million for the first quarter 2016. We have recorded approximately $574 million of ORKAMBI revenues in the first nine months since the U.S. launch in July 2015. The first quarter KALYDECO sales of $171 million were up $41 million versus the first quarter of last year.","Now to the operating expenses, our first quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were $306 million compared to non-GAAP operating expenses of $246 million for 2015. The increased operating expenses were primarily due to increased costs related to the progression of our CF pipeline and to increased investments in global commercial support for the launch of ORKAMBI.","Our non-GAAP net profit for the first quarter of 2016 was $22 million or $0.09 per diluted share, compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $148 million or $0.62 per share for 2015. From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the first quarter with approximately $1.03 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Vertex also has $300 million outstanding from a credit agreement repayable by the end of the third quarter of 2017. The agreement also allows for the facility to increase to $500 million.","Now to financial trends, Stuart provided 2016 ORKAMBI and KALYDECO revenue guidance and the assumptions that drive our projections and therefore I will focus my comments on the longer-term growth opportunities that may come with treating more patients with our currently approved medicines.","We expect ORKAMBI revenues will continue to grow as we treat more patients in the U.S., achieved reimbursement outside the U.S. and expand the ORKAMBI label to younger patients. KALYDECO\u2019s growth is based on gaining reimbursement for certain groups of patients outside the U.S. including those with R117H mutation and the people age\u2019s two to five with gating mutations.","In summary, as Jeff noted earlier, approximately 27,000 people are eligible for our CF medicines, yet we are only treating approximately one-third of these patients. As additional patients in the U.S. started treatment, we complete reimbursement discussions outside the U.S., we expect the number of patients treated with our medicines to increase significantly and we expect revenue growth will follow.","I will note that in 2015 we reported total CF revenues of $983 million. Based on 2016 guidance provided for ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, we anticipate the total CF revenues of approximately $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, an approximate 75% increase over the prior year. As our revenues grow over future year\u2019s we are committed to managing our operating expenses to drive earnings growth and we expect to deliver financial profile similar to many of our large-cap biotech peers.","With that, I open the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Michael Yee","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for all the details, really appreciated. I think it\u2019s very helpful for everyone. Two-part question, one is you gave all these discontinuation and persistent rates and compliance rates, which is in your guidance. Is there anything out there that you can do to either improve these things, education, getting people to just get patients to take more drug? And can you apply any of this learnings to Europe, are you seeing the same stuff in Germany, are there any ways to improve it there.","And then the second question is a pipeline question on the 661 you mentioned in the press release that you are changing the enrollment to do 200 instead of 300, but is that assuming you actually passed the futility? Can you just verify that a little bit? Why are we talking about changing enrollment if we haven\u2019t passed the futility? Thanks.","Stuart Arbuckle","Hey Mike, it\u2019s Stuart here. I\u2019ll take the first part of your question around discontinuations and compliance rates and then I\u2019ll have Jeff Chodakewitz to answer the pipeline question. So on discontinuations and compliance and what might be able to do need to improve those much as we did with KALYDECO, we will be continuing to generate data on the long-term benefits and even broader benefits of ORKAMBI when used in the real world. And I suspect that data if it\u2019s compelling mainly positions in patients to reconsider, restarting ORKAMBI. So we will continue to develop the overall clinical profile of ORKAMBI as we have more experience in the market.","In terms of compliance, really many of the same things that we did with KALYDECO will be doing with ORKAMBI and that's really providing both providers and physicians with the educational materials to be able to understand how this is a product which is treating the underlying cause of their disease and so is a product that they want to try and stay compliant with as much as they possibly can and we will certainly be leveraging all the learnings we have from KALYDECO with ORKAMBI and those programs are already in place.","And lastly to your point about to Germany, clearly one of the things we are going to be doing is transferring all of the learnings from our launch experience in the U.S. that all of the other markets that we are launching into and that\u2019s in many ways the benefits of those markets coming on stream a little bit later that they can learn from our experiences here in the U.S. With that I\u2019ll hand over to Jeff to answer the question on the pipeline.","Jeffrey Chodakewitz","Hi, Mike, this is Jeff. Maybe just to clarify, we did provide some information about the timing of the interim analysis in the admin study, but there has been no other changes for that trial. The change in sample size comes from one of our other Phase III trials looking at successful [ivacaftor] in patients who have more of a residual function mutation on one [of the earlier]. We did look at that and saw that there was some opportunity to maintain good power, but simplified and reduced the sample size and that's what that was about.","Michael Yee","Okay. Still that admin interim in Q3 have changed that, okay.","Jeffrey Chodakewitz","That\u2019s the interim, that\u2019s correct.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Terence Flynn","Hi, thanks for taking the questions, maybe just a follow-up on the discontinuation rate. I know you mentioned it's mainly due to respiratory events, but the 15% I think over three months is significantly higher than what you saw in the trials. I know you mentioned previously it could be higher, but any more color there on the drivers behind that that you can expand on a little bit. And then on the ORKAMBI guidance, just wondering if you can provide a little bit more clearly there on the contributions from U.S., rest of world and then the patients 6 to 11 in terms of relative contribution? Thank you.","Jeffrey Leiden","Sure, Terence. So on the respiratory events I think what I\u2019d say there is, now what we are reporting today is what we are seeing in the real world usage of ORKAMBI in the broad population, obviously the clinical trial population that we studied in traffic and transported is a very controlled situation, that was patients with and have to be one between 40 and 90.","So really as we try to extrapolate from the clinical trial experience, the real world experience that\u2019s one of the reasons - that uncertainty is one of the reasons why we wanted to make sure we had sufficient time in market before we gave guidance, because we really wanted to see how the product would get used in the real world.","In terms of the contribution of various different parts of the world to ORKAMBI revenue guidance that you might expect the vast majority of the revenues is going to come from here in the U.S. That will be a contribution ex-US, but it\u2019s going to be relatively small and then incorporate within our guidance as we said is also an expectation that we will see an approval in 6 to 11-year-olds in the latter part of 2016, which would give us access to an eligible population where about 2500 and that\u2019s also incorporate within our guidance, but that approval is not anticipated until the back end of 2016.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Geoff Meacham","Hey, guys thanks for taking my question. I got a couple - I am trying to get sense as to when you guys realize that compliance or persistent or discons were different for ORKAMBI versus KALYDECO or commercial ORKAMBI versus Phase III I mean you guys had a chance you know 3Q call JPM 4Q call to be crystal clear on this and it's 10 months almost into the launch and now we are getting some detail. And I just have a couple of follow-ups.","Jeffrey Leiden","So Geoff thanks for the question. So I just want to take us back a few months which as went into JP Morgan and also year-end conference call at the end of January. We are very clear with what we wanted to do regarding ORKAMBI guidance and for us at that point in time it was earlier in the launch. Yes, we\u2019ve recruited a number of patients onto ORAKMBI but we\u2019re still early in the launch to understand treatment patents.","We stated that very clearly what we\u2019ve been able to do now as we sit here as you point out just over nine months into the launch. We\u2019ve been able to take significant bolus of patients for example 3,000 patients that initiated in the first three months since approval. And we\u2019ve been able to track those six to nine months. What that allowed us to do was to understand compliance rates and helped us understand discontinuation rates and also the plan of discontinuation, as Stuart mentioned that\u2019s been an important feature for us.","So this was the - we feel as though we\u2019re in this position at this point in time while we\u2019ve been to track a substantial amount of patients over a good period of time to have the confidence to provide guidance for 2016. The comparison to KALYDECO was less relevant for us it was more about the treatment patents for ORKAMBI. ORKAMBI is a different medicine than KALYDECO based on its clinical data and the patient population, but we now have enough confidence to provide you with the ORKAMBI guidance.","Geoff Meacham","Okay. And just a follow-up to some earlier questions I guess just to ask it in different ways. For patients that are at low FEV1 at baseline and do experience bronchoconstriction, is there a treatment protocol in place? I mean we've obviously heard of things like half dose than uptitrate or dose skipping. Is there something that you guys can recommend to pulmonologist, a strategy for those that do experience bronchoconstriction? Thank you.","Jeffrey Chodakewitz","Geoff this is Jeff Chodakewitz, maybe just to give you a couple of comments about that, we don't have anything in terms of very concrete specific guidance that we can give. But we make a couple of observations. First of all what\u2019s clear from speaking to our investigators and also to physicians in the field, that clearly the support for the patients about setting expectations for the patient and for the physician and helping patients in those early weeks manage any symptoms, we think is very important and something that goes back to some of the education questions that we\u2019ve heard about earlier.","We are also collecting information in our own study for patients whose FEV1s were less than 40 and we\u2019re in the process of summarizing that. We did in that study give patients the option to start on a lower dose and we\u2019ll get that data together and summarize it. But it\u2019s not going to be kind of data that says here's a specific recommendation. We know that that is being used but it's really still about physicians and their patients working together to manage.","Geoff Meacham","Okay thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore. Your line is now open.","Mark Schoenebaum","Hey guys I really appreciate for taking my question. Number one, I just like to know have you\u2019ve been surprised by the way the launch has unfolded? I\u2019m sure you had some projections a year-ago for persistence. And have you been surprised? And number two; I know you can\u2019t comment specifically on peak numbers, but the sellside consensus around $4 billion at peak for ORKAMBI. I am just wondering can you just talk about that. And then finally, is there any opportunity for reinitiation in these patients that dropout early? Thank you very much.","Ian Smith","We have a list of questions, so we don\u2019t get to all of them.","Mark Schoenebaum","Sorry about that.","Ian Smith","Yes, so we\u2019re all scribbling down. But if we don\u2019t get to them please say them again.","Jeffrey Leiden","So Mark in terms of how we feel about the launch I would say we are very pleased with the way the launch is progressed here in the U.S. from how we were able to work with payers to get access and reimbursement from ORKAMBI from early on in the launch to the rate of uptake that we\u2019ve seen I mean to get close to 65% of eligible patients initiated within the first nine months is a fairly steep ramp. So we are pleased with it. So I think overall, we are pleased and the launch has played out much as we anticipated.","In terms of the potential re-initiations, we have heard anecdotally from physicians that they have tried reinitiating patients on ORKAMBI. We don't have much in the way of clinical data to be able to support that. We are certainly aware that there are physicians who done that successfully for some of their patients, so that\u2019s certainly is something that will continue to watch in the marketplace.","Jeffrey Leiden","Mark, this is Jeff Leiden. Maybe just to add a little bit more of 10,000 foot view on both KALYDECO and ORKAMBI like you have been involved with many, many drug launches. And I think it\u2019s worth just putting those in perspective a little bit, from the standpoint an example in ORKAMBI of getting to 65% of the patients in nine months and of course with KALYDECO close to 90%. That\u2019s a fairly unusually fast ramp.","And from the standpoint of persistence the kinds of number Stuart was talking about, let\u2019s say 70% to 80% is the number that we said loud and it\u2019s still a very, very high number compared to most chronic medicines. And we believe that we represent the correct perception of both physicians and patients have about the value of these medicines in treating the underlying cause of the disease for long period of time. And that really underlies our - thinking about the pipeline as well because as we develop this next set of medicines including next-gens and hopefully ultimately things like CRISPR.","We are talking about progressively increasing the benefit risk profile of our portfolio of drugs that these patients can take. And that will only of course increase both persistence and compliance rates. So overall very pleased with where we are. We know we have more work to do to get to more patients and improve therapy, but these two drugs have really performed quite well so far.","Mark Schoenebaum","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges of Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey Porges","Thanks very much. Just a few questions, first could you help us out just give us the breakdown between U.S. and ex-U.S. sales of KALYDECO, so we are all in the same page. And then I just want to go back to Jeff's comments. Jeff could you really clarify this residual function changing and what has altered in terms of your statistical analysis or your assumptions about the activity as a drug or the combination. And give us a sense of what the hurdle there is for ORKAMBI effect.","And then lastly, on this issue of persistence, is it reasonable to assume that about 50% of patients of the eligible pool are on drug right now, because we keep going round and round about initiations and discontinuations, but surely what's important is the number of patients who remain on drug at the end of the quarter and it\u2019s 50% roughly the right number or perhaps slightly below that 45% to 50% of the eligible. Is that the right way to think about it? Thanks.","Stuart Arbuckle","Geoff, it\u2019s Stuart here. I\u2019ll take your first question around KALYDECO revenues then I will hand over to Jeff Chodakewitz. So within the total KALYDECO revenues of a $171 million for the first quarter of 2016, $95 million of that was in the U.S. and the balance of about $76 million was in international.","Geoffrey Porges","Thank you.","Jeffrey Chodakewitz","Geoff, in terms of the residual function study, we really step back and said is there an opportunity to reduce the end of the study somewhat without sacrificing the integrity of the trial. We really looked at that two-ways that we saw opportunity; one is that we really focused our statistical analyses on key parameters. And that really allows us to take care of that.","The other thing is that we also looked at the aligned data and so that the discontinuation rate for the trial was actually lower than what we had left room for and that also was an opportunity to reduce the end.","Geoffrey Porges","Great. Thanks very much.","Jeffrey Chodakewitz","And finally Geoff, to your question on ORKAMBI, your back of envelope math is approximately right at the end of the third quarter. And you are right about 50% of the eligible population were on. Clearly, that\u2019s a moving target because it\u2019s a mix of the discontinuation and the initiation.","The important thing I would add to that number is that moving forward in Q2 and beyond, we do expect patient initiation which we continue to see in April in the U.S., obviously we continue to see internationally in places like Germany, we expect to outpace discontinuations which is why we are predicting quarter-on-quarter growth for the remainder of 2016 and beyond.","Geoffrey Porges","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brian Abrahams","Hey, guys. Thanks very much for all the granularity and appreciate you taking the question. I guess my first question, I\u2019m wondering if you are seeing any trends towards maybe less sick higher FEV1 patients going on to therapy over time with ORKAMBI would theoretically improve persistence and compliance. And then on 661, if 661 looks better tolerated, but perhaps less efficacious than lumacaftor. I\u2019m just wondering how you weigh which potential backbone to combine for the next generation corrector in two triple combos? Thanks.","Stuart Arbuckle","So in terms of any trends to where the products being used in either sick of patients or less sick patients, to be honest with you Brian with 65% of eligible patients being initiated is being used across the board, obviously we\u2019ve got a range of different physicians incenses here some started using it in the more severe patients and start using is the less severe patients, but we really are seeing usage across the whole range of FEV1 patients as you'd imagine with 65% of eligible patients having been initiated. And on the backbone, for the triple combination I\u2019ll pass it over to Jeff Leiden.","Jeffrey Leiden","Yes, just on the triple combination, obviously we can\u2019t speculate that exactly what will happen, but I would remind you that there were a number of reasons but 661 is the preferable partner, most of those have to do with drug interactions and making it simpler to combine that into a triple regimen. So I guess what I would say is all things being equal if 661 and lumacaftor had equal efficacy in combination with KALYDECO we are certainly can go with 661, because of those pharmacokinetic. I think that answer the question.","Brian Abrahams","Yes, not exactly. I guess I was sort of wondering whether I mean we know 661 has less 384 interactions and I guess I was sort of wondering whether some of the real world ORKAMBI side effects that you are seeing are perhaps driven by not only the respiratory, but driven by 384, which we know is going to look better with 661 and sort of how you weigh that if efficacy is perhaps not as good?","Jeffrey Leiden","Yes, that\u2019s not the reason just to be clear, so those AEs are not driven by set interaction, we feel as we said before by off target construction is unique to lumacaftor, we don\u2019t see or haven\u2019t seen the 661.","Brian Abrahams","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Walsh of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Adam Walsh","Hey, thanks for taking my question. A few weeks ago, we published 47 physician ORKAMBI survey and if you think jumped out at us I want to [indiscernible]. Most notably our survey showed that a patient discontinue ORKAMBI due to drug related side effects, 70% of doctors encourage these patients to restart the drug and then a very meaningful percentage of those patients not only successfully restart the drug, but also subsequently remain on the drug long-term. So my questions are as this consistent with your own internal research or patient restarts factored into your guidance and if so to what extent? Thank you.","Stuart Arbuckle","So Adam, it\u2019s Stuart here. Thanks for the question. In terms of restarts, yes, your survey is consistent with what we heard - in that we have heard from the physician that they are trying to restart ORKAMBI in some of that patients who they have previously had to discontinue the product largely because as that they are - believe it treating the underline diseases is clearly a good thing for those patients if they can tolerate the medicine.","In terms of the absolute volume of that at the minute that\u2019s hard to quantify, we certainly heard it anecdotally, we heard and even certainly heard success stories. It\u2019s fair to say that within our guidance we\u2019ve assumed relatively minimal impact for restarts, because at this time we really don't have evidence that it\u2019s happening in quite the numbers that perhaps people have said that they might do it in. So at the moment within our guidance relatively minimal amount of restarting patient resume to happen in 2016 here in the U.S.","Adam Walsh","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Phil Nadeau","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Two on commercial then a quick one on the pipeline. On the commercial can you give us some sense of how many lives outside the U.S. could gain reimbursement for ORKAMBI in 2017? Sure you have internal estimates and ranges I am curious what those are. And then similarly in the younger kids do you expect any different penetration of ORKAMBI into the population than you've seen in the older kids and adults.","Then last on the triple [indiscernible] combined all three drugs in healthy volunteers yet and what your disclosure strategy will be when you move in Phase II? How much data from the Phase I while we get? Thanks.","Stuart Arbuckle","So, Phil, it\u2019s Stuart here. I will take those two first commercial questions. In terms of the number of why that might be eligible. So the number of patients with the F508del homozygous mutation 12 and above in Europe and somewhere around 12,000. Within our 2016 guidance the only country that we are assuming, we are going to be able to recognize revenues for us in Germany.","Yes, we\u2019re not in a position to be able to give 2017 guidance at this point and trying to predict exactly when these reimbursement discussions is going to conclude is frankly impossible to do because clearly it\u2019s a negotiation and the vast majority of countries don\u2019t have a formal time clock. And so at this point we\u2019re really not in a position to be able to speculate on when those might be concluded.","In terms of what we would be anticipating in the six to 11 year old population, if we are successful in gaining approval for that here in the U.S. then our anticipation would be much as we\u2019ve seen with KALYDECO that the uptick there is likely to be similarly robust as we\u2019ve seen in adults although I would remind you that the 2016 perspective that\u2019s likely to come in the second half or in the second half of the second half of 2016.","Jeffrey Chodakewitz","And Phil I will take the last question. So the Phase I study in healthy volunteers still ongoing so we can\u2019t make a comment on that. But as terms of disclosure and timeline still as we discussed before we expect to be in patients with triple combination in the second half of the year. The disclosure of the Phase I around that will be relevant information that supports the Phase II study design at this point that is too difficult to describe and we\u2019ll let you know when we have that information and we\u2019re initiating the Phase II study.","Phil Nadeau","Great. Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Cory Kasimov","Hey good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I have two left for you. So realize it\u2019s early but wanted to ask about the potential impact of payer reauthorizations on ORKAMBI. How common is it and how does it compare with the process you saw with KALYDECO. And then capital allocation question for you. Now that you are profitable in growing and sitting on a billion dollars in cash on your balance sheet, at what point would you consider buying back some of your stock? Thanks.","Jeffrey Leiden","So Cory on the payer reauthorizations not all payers have published policies that include that reauthorization criteria. So that\u2019s the first thing I would say. Of the ones you have most have a time clock at six to 12 months. So we are really only now beginning to get to the point of patients getting to the time point when they are having to go through the reauthorization process.","Having said that, the payers that have published policies or where their reauthorization criteria are known, the vast majority of them either in line with the label or reflect these systemic benefits of ORKAMBI and by that I mean they recognize that this product can have benefits across multiple endpoints and either improvements or stabilization in those endpoints, qualified as a successful outcome.","So whilst we are only now beginning to get into the period of seeing those reauthorizations, I feel good about the reauthorization criteria that we\u2019ve seen today and to your last part of your question, they are not dissimilar at all to what we saw with KALYDECO.","Jeffrey Chodakewitz","And to the last question we have thought about stock buybacks in terms of capital allocation, but as we think about the priority of capital allocation for our business I will just give you a broader thought, which is we are still in this transitional period of moving into profitability and cash generation and watching the revenue curve.","As we go up the revenue curve and we drive revenue growth and therefore earnings growth, which translates to more cash generation. We look to apply that capital to reinvest back in the business. First, internally into our pipeline, but then potentially outside of the company to diversify and expand our pipeline.","We\u2019ve already done activities in that area, as you know, with CRISPR and ENaC inhibitor. So those continue to be the priorities. It\u2019s the internal investments, it\u2019s the external investment, because we go up that revenue growth curve and have greater capital to allocate.","We will get consideration to capital strategies such as share buyback, but at this point of time, it\u2019s a little early for us. And if we were to move into something in the near future it would be of a smaller scale to stop the shares outstanding creep that occurs each year through option exercises.","Cory Kasimov","All right. Thanks, appreciated.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alicia Young of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Alicia Young","Hey, guys thanks for taking my question. The three of them are kind of around compliance. And I guess when I look at the math that we get over the quarter. It seems like the first two quarters, the compliance was potentially higher like 95%. And maybe in this quarter based on our math it would have gotten to about 80%. So I guess, one, is that analysis fair? Two, can you give us any color on if the scripts are written in one or three month increment.","And then third just when you think about 70% to 80% range on compliance which actually does move the model quite a bit. What kind of qualitatively do you think about that kind of get you in the 70% versus 80% range? Should we think about like amount of days the people are taking so there's a delta in the days they miss and just kind of adding that up and thinking about or is there some other way we should think about quantifying compliance.","Stuart Arbuckle","So, yes, let me try and answer those sequentially. In terms of the compliance trend, compliance is the metric that you need the longest period of time to measure, because clearly this is a chronic medicine. And so in the first prescription to get you kind of assumption is that you are a 100% compliant. You have to wait until they get the second prescription to work out, exactly what it is.","So this is the one that really takes the longest period of time for us to get a good handle on. I don\u2019t know obviously the intricacies of your model and I'll just reiterate that we are based on the trends that we\u2019ve seen to date and the experience we\u2019ve got with the patients who have been treated to date.","Our expectation for the year and the assumption on which our guidance is built is that it will be somewhere between 70% and 80% for ORKAMBI this year. In the terms of the one or three month\u2019s script, the vast majority I\u2019ve written for one month there are some three-month prescriptions written. But the vast majority of prescriptions are written for - on a monthly basis.","And in terms of kind of qualitatively what would lead you to one end versus the other, to me this is all about education and our ability to help providers to give to their patient information, which educates them on the nature of the disease, the underlying defect, the fact that ORKAMBI is designed to treat those underlying defects into the extent they believe in the science, believe in the long-term benefit that ORKAMBI could provide to them.","Then I think that\u2019s only likely to lead to patients having a higher compliance rate, where we are focused on that. We are certainly taking all the learnings we can from our experience with KALYDECO to support patients to take the prescriptions in line with their physician\u2019s recommendations.","Alicia Young","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Matthew Harrison","Great, thanks for taking the question. I have two which are somewhat follow-ups on Phil\u2019s questions. Just on next-generation correctors and those studies. Can you just tell us if you saw a safety event, what kind of safety event would be discloseable versus not discloseable.","And then is there a point in time that we\u2019re going to see PK data from healthy volunteers which might help us better understand how the drug levels that we saw on the HB data might compare in patients? And then a separate commercial question just in the six to 12 pool for ORKAMBI, are your assumptions for persistence and discontinuation rate the same as what you're seeing now on the overpopulation. And if they're not the same, can you just explain why? Thanks.","Jeffrey Leiden","So maybe I\u2019ll take the first couple of questions. So with the next gen disclosure, what would be required to disclosure since Reg FD and if there was a material adverse event we would have to disclose that, if we want to need to give you an example that would be discontinuation of the trial for example, and we would have to disclose that.","Other than that is an ongoing trial, we need to complete the trial, gather the date that will inform as I said earlier for the Phase II trial in patients with triple combination and we will provide relative information in that point in time that supports the design of that trial. Can you just remind me your second question?","Matthew Harrison","Yes, I was just wondering where we see PK data so that we can compare sort of the drug levels that you can achieve in healthy volunteers versus the drug levels that you are achieving in the HB assets, so we have some point of comparison on relative drug levels?","Jeffrey Leiden","So we will provide you the relative information that obviously understand the design of the Phase II study. However, it is not our practice to provide that kind of detail on a Phase I study. And there is a number of reasons for that and I would just give you one that there is a specific competitive reason that we would prefer not to provide that information on the Phase I study.","Ian Smith","And Matt, in 6 to 11 I mean really the contribution of the 6 to 11 population if we are successful in getting approvable. As I said it\u2019s really going to be - likely to be in the fourth quarter. So really the contribution there within our overall guidance is more about uptake than it is around persistence and compliance and much as we did with the 12 and above population I think we\u2019ll obviously be watching that very, very closely just as we have done since the launch in July and that'll give us an ability to learn how the product performance with those patients in the real world again.","One of the things that we have seen with the younger population with KALYDECO they tend to be slightly more compliance and the average is not surprisingly because they have got a lot of [indiscernible] and care giver supervision, but really those assumptions that we have given you really much more likely to the 12 and above population, we\u2019ll see how this 6 to 11 patients plan in the real world in the course of the time after the approval.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Ying Huang","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Number one, I want to know if you guys have seen an uptick in discontinuation due to lack of efficacy or I thought due to the - I guess the chest tightness. And then secondly for the ATU price that you get in France, how does that compare to the German pricing of \u20ac159,000 per year per patient. And lastly I have a question on your growth net, is that consistent would you guys have guided before which is like mid-teens in 1Q 2016? Thank you.","Ian Smith","So Ying, in terms of discontinuations the - based on our clinical trial experience and also what we are seeing in the market, the vast majority of those discontinuations are for adverse events and most commonly that\u2019s the chest tightness.","In terms of the ATU, we haven\u2019t disclosed the price within the ATU program and in terms of the gross to net, the gross to net that we\u2019ve seen and our predating is potentially slightly lower than we originally thought that\u2019s largely due to the fact that the Medicaid for the patient population that we\u2019re seeing is slightly lower that we anticipated.","This is really as a result of many of those Medicaid patients, so we thought would be covered by Medicaid are actually qualifying for disability benefit under Medicare, as a result of that we are seeing a lower Medicaid population and the result we are seeing we are predicting a slightly lower growth to net of somewhere around 12% for the year.","Jeffrey Leiden","Yes, I might just add to that which is coming into 2016 and 2015 was the gross to net was closed to 7% as we moved into the Q1 of 2016 is increased to 9%. So it is moving up slightly as we expected, but as we plan out and we look at the patients that are coming on to drug, we anticipate that it could end the year around 12% and sequentially creeps on to that 12% level and that\u2019s also placed into our guidance.","Ying Huang","Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Liisa Bayko of JMP Securities. Your line is now open.","Liisa Bayko","Hi. Just a couple of technical questions. Were there any inventory changes in the quarter?","Jeffrey Leiden","No.","Liisa Bayko","Okay.","Jeffrey Leiden","ORKAMBI inventory at the end of March was, to all intents and purposes, identical to that which it was at December 31, so there were really no inventory change for ORKAMBI at all.","Liisa Bayko","Okay, great. And then can you comment on gross to net, sort of where were you for the quarter and you know would that be relatively consistent for the rest of the year? Will it change in some way?","Ian Smith","Are you referring to ORKAMBI Liisa?","Liisa Bayko","Yes, sorry thank you.","Ian Smith","So as you just mentioned - that\u2019s in Q1 we were approximately 9% gross to net discount. In Q4 of last year we were at 7% we actually expect the Q1 level of 9% to trend up to be something closer to 12% by the end of the year.","Liisa Bayko","Okay. Great that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then when you say 15% of 65% have discontinued that\u2019s like a 10% discontinuation rate roughly? Is that the right way to think about that?","Ian Smith","No Liisa so and it\u2019s really important so thanks for asking the question. It is of the patients you\u2019ve initiated 15% of them have discontinued ORKAMBI within approximately the first three months. And so if you think about 4,500 patients who initiated between July and December, 15% of those patients would have discontinued within the first three months and then that rate of discontinuations that slows considerably the 65% is the number of patients who initiated therapy by the end of March. So the 15% you need to apply to all of the patients who initiated some - it\u2019s not 15% of 65% it\u2019s 10%, it\u2019s 15% of the 65% who have initiated they will discontinue therapy is our believe.","Liisa Bayko","Right. But that\u2019s gets you 10%, doesn\u2019t it? If you multiply 65 by 15.","Jeffrey Leiden","Liisa, we\u2019ll jump on the phone with you after the call and we'll do the math.","Liisa Bayko","All right. Thank you. And then I just had a question about the Rowe inhibitor. Can you just give us a little detail on that trial what are the endpoints you are looking at? What\u2019s the timing for data? That\u2019s my final question. Thank you.","Jeffrey Chodakewitz","Hi, Liisa this is Jeff. So the Rowe inhibitors trial is really specifically in patients who had a catastrophic injury to their cervical spine and then really have very core function of immediately following that injury in the study then we follow those patients at the time of surgery they have either placebo or one of two doses of active drug and it\u2019s about 150 patients total.","And then we follow them for six months looking at particularly how their upper extremities function because that\u2019s so important to how patients, the quality of life of patients and then we do some other measures of disability. And it\u2019s very hard right now. We just started the study as we\u2019ve said so I think it\u2019s very hard to predict in that kind of population in particular exactly when we are going to get results.","Liisa Bayko","Thank you.","Jeffrey Leiden","Operator, we have time for two more questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tony Butler of Guggenheim. Your line is now open.","Tony Butler","Yes, thanks very much. Briefly, Stuart, in France again the early access patients which receive ORKAMB I think you mentioned 400. I understand reimbursement has not occurred, but given the uptake being fairly strong if one assumes that the majority of that 1500 will be treated by year end and you do get reimbursement let\u2019s say next year. Does that come in a bolus payment for that which has occurred or is that payment then amortized assuming those patients stay on drug for 2017 and beyond? Thanks very much.","Stuart Arbuckle","Yes, thanks for the question, Tony. So the way the accounting works in France is that for the cash that we get for those patients before we get reimburse those recognized as cash not as revenue.","At the point that we have certainty about the selling price or very close to certainty about the selling price in France then we will be able to a long-term adjustment, convert that cash to revenues and then from that point forward all of those will be counted as revenues going forward. And that\u2019s because the - whatever rebate you agree with the French government is retroactive to the sales that you had from the point that you launch the product.","Tony Butler","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And finally you would call that out as an item in the quarter in which it occurs, I assume?","Jeffrey Leiden","So maybe I'll follow on from Stuart. So I'll just validate Stuart's answer as kind of a CPA, so nice job Stuart. In terms of revenue recognition, many of you that are on this call probably have seen other companies go through this with the ATU in France. And then absolutely, at the point that we get to a point where we\u2019re comfortable with the price in France, yes, we would call it out in the quarter specifically and in that same of time we\u2019d recognize all the revenue in that very quarter.","Tony Butler","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Katherine Xu of William Blair. Your line is now open.","Katherine Xu","Hi, good evening. Thanks for squeezing me in. So I just have one question on the CRISPR program based on the research that you have ongoing right now, what kind of mutations are the most amenable for the technology first. And how difficult is it to eventually correct those FFA which is a deletion [indiscernible].","Jeffrey Leiden","Yes. This is Jeff Leiden. Thanks for the question. I think as you know - if you look today CRISPR is most amenable to actually inactivating treatment, making cleavages, because that's what it does most efficiently and obviously that\u2019s not what we would want to do in the dose by the case and then you move to making corrections and then you move to more complex solution and insertion.","So there is no doubt that there are still challenges to concur both in terms of how we correct solutions like in those by the way, but also in how we deliver this, because obviously this has to be delivered efficiently to a large numbers cells and the lungs and we don\u2019t know how to do that yet.","So that\u2019s why we said and we think CRISPR is incredibly powerful technology for the future, it\u2019s going to take a number of years to concur mostly some of the editing challenges, but also in protecting the delivery challenges that\u2019s what we are working no in CS.","Now, we are also - I just remind you just because nine collaboration, we have right settle targets, fixed targets and some of those would be in other disease where some of these issues like delivery and editing are much more straight forward. So I think you can\u2019t expect to hear from us over the next couple of years on our progress to some of those other disease.","Katherine Xu","So at this point are there any limitations that are easier than others to edit, should we know that?","Jeffrey Leiden","Yes, as I said I think single based payer corrections are going to be a lot easier than complex solutions and insertions to correct, but nevertheless I mean there are some pretty significant challenge in the diseases like CL. When you move to ex-vivo therapy and you move to inactivation in ex-vivo therapy you are in a whole different world in terms of efficiency and so you will see some of those I think from us and others as being the first application.","Katherine Xu","Thanks.","Ian Smith","So I will turn it back over to Jeff maybe for some final comments.","Jeffrey Leiden","Yes, first of all thank you for your questions, thanks for your patience I know it was a long call, but we did want to give you not only our guidance, but detailed rational for the guidance, so that you understand our model. And we appreciate the questions on that. As I look at our progress with the company over the last year, I guess I will call out three things that I think are important.","First, the continuous increase in the number of patients that we treat, that actually have dramatic increase in the number of patients that we can treat with KALYDECO, ORKAMBI. And as we look forward, the increasing number of patients we can treat with today\u2019s approvals, so as I mentioned $27,000, but we are still only treating the third of those and I think we have a clear path to get to the majority of those patients both in the U.S. and Europe over 2016, 2017 and beyond.","Second thing I would say is the pipeline progression, we are pleased with 661 progressing well into Phase III of multiple trials and multiple patient population, but equally important with next gen correctors which are progressing through Phase I with our - and still on a timeline to get into patients as triple combination made this year. We think that\u2019s going to be very important. Those were the patients we treated potentially for additional subsets of patients.","And then finally the progression of science, we didn\u2019t talk about that a lot today, but the science CF I think as progressed significantly and we have a much better understanding of the folding correction process and the science that David Altshuler was driving the rest of research group in some of the new diseases, we touched on those a little bit with CRISPR-cas9, but also other, but I hope we will be able have a chance to talk to you about over the rest of 2016 and 2017. It is an important long-term growth engine for the Company.","So with that maybe I will close the call and thank you again for joining us.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference.

Good evening, everyone. It's just over one year ago that we received FDA approval for ORKAMBI, marking the most significant step to date in our journey to develop new medicines for people with cystic fibrosis. Tonight I'm pleased to report on our significant and steady progress in CF and I'll review three key phases in our efforts to bring all people with CF a medicine to treat the underlying cause of their disease. If we're successful in these efforts, we believe significant and sustained revenue and earnings growth will follow.","Today there're approximately 27,000 people eligible for treatment with ORKAMBI or KALYDECO. However, we're only treating approximately 9,000 or one-third of these patients. The first and most significant near-term step to increase the number of eligible patients being treated with our medicines is to gain reimbursement of ORKAMBI in key European and other country. Progress with reimbursement for ORKAMBI would enable the vast majority of currently eligible patients to be treatment with one of our CF medicines.","The second step to treat more people with CF is to further expand the labels for both ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, which could increase the total number of eligible patients from 27,000 to approximately 44,000.","And the third step is to potentially treat all people with CF with new combinations of CFTR modulators as well as other approaches to treatment such as ENaC inhibition, gene editing and mRNA therapies.","First, to reimbursement for ORKAMBI; outside the U.S. the reimbursement process is ongoing. And these discussions are progressing as anticipated across Europe, Canada and Australia. We're encouraged that many reimbursement authorities have acknowledged the significant clinical benefits that ORKAMBI provides. We believe that we will achieve reimbursement from European and other government payers, just as we've seen in the U.S. We look forward to updating you as we obtain reimbursement in key countries going forward.","Second, to our label expansion efforts for both ORKAMBI and KALYDECO. Specifically there're some 12,000 additional patients younger than age 12 with two copies of the delta 508 mutation who we believe could be helped by ORKAMBI. In the second quarter, the FDA accepted for review our supplemental new drug application for the use of ORKAMBI in children ages six to 11 years and granted our request for priority review, setting a target review date, or PDUFA date, September 30, 2016. If approved, we expect to be ready to bring ORKAMBI to these patients immediately following approval.","In parallel, we're also progressing with our efforts to bring ORKAMBI to children ages six to 11 years in Europe where we plan to submit our application for approval in the first half of next year following the conclusion of our fully enrolled Phase 3 efficacy and safety study in this group of patients. We estimate that there are approximately 2,400 children ages six to 11 years in the U.S. and 3,400 in Europe who would be eligible for ORKAMBI.","There're approximately 5,000 additional patients in North America, Europe and Australia; largely those with residual function mutations who could be helped by KALYDECO. While we received a complete response letter from the FDA earlier this year regarding our application for approval of KALYDECO, in people with CF ages two and older who have one of 23 residual function mutations, I believe the KALYDECO will be beneficial to these patients is unchanged and we continue to pursue FDA approval for these patients as soon as possible. There're approximately 1,500 people with CF in the U.S. who have the mutations included in our residual function sNDA.","And third, to our expanding pipeline of investigational CF medicines; the most advanced pipeline program in CF is our broad Phase 3 program for VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor. VX-661 plus ivacaftor may have an improved benefit risk profile compared to ORKAMBI in people with two copies of the delta 508 mutation, and may provide enhanced clinical benefits over ivacaftor monotherapy for other patients with gating mutations.","Enrollment in the study of VX-661 plus ivacaftor in people ages 12 and older with two copies of the delta 508 mutation, is expected to complete in August. Data from this six-month study are expected in first half of 2017. The other three Phase 3 studies of VX-661 are also progressing as planned. We plan to submit a new drug application to the U.S. FDA for VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor in the second half of 2017.","Importantly, VX-661 is also positioned to play a key role in the triple combination regimen with a next-generation corrector and ivacaftor. We believe that this triple combination approach may allow us to treat an additional large group of patients. Specifically, those with one delta 508 mutation and one mutation that results in minimal CFTR function. These patients do not currently have a medicine to treat the cause of their disease.","Our two next-generation correctors VX-152 and VX-440 are being evaluated in Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers. Pending data from these studies, we expect to move into Phase 2 clinical development in the second half of 2016 in people with CF. These studies would evaluate one or both for our next-generation correctors with VX-661 and ivacaftor. Beyond the CFTR modulators, we've entered into multiple strategic collaborations that broaden our ability to evaluate additional approaches to CF treatment that may be complimentary to CFTR modulation in the future.","While the underlying technology and science of each approach differs, the collaborations have a shared goal to develop the best possible future treatments for all people with CF. Earlier this month we entered into collaboration with Moderna Therapeutics aimed at using messenger RNA to potentially enable cells in the lungs of the people with CF to produce functional CFTR protein.","This is the second platform technology collaboration we have entered into, following our agreement with CRISPR Therapeutics focused on the use of CRISPR\/Cas9 for gene editing that we began in late 2015. These platform technologies add to our development stage collaboration with Parion Sciences focused on the use of ENaC inhibition to treat CF. As we enter the second half of 2016, I'm pleased with both the near-term and long-term growth opportunities for our business. Our goal is to consistently discover and deliver transformative new medicines for patients and to reinvest in scientific opportunities to create future medicine. We believe our business model, which is focused on significant investment to create value through innovation, research and development, will position us to achieve this goal over the coming years.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Ian.","Ian F. Smith - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Jeff and hello, everyone. Through the second quarter of the year we've created a growing revenue base with ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, which we expect to drive future earnings growth. Tonight I will discuss our second quarter revenues for ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, review our 2016 financial guidance and discuss our anticipated financial trajectory for the coming years. In the second quarter of 2016, we reported total CF product revenues of approximately $426 million, a significant increase compared to $155 million for the second quarter of last year.","Turning to the revenues for each of our CF medicines; global sales of ORKAMBI in the second quarter were $245 million comprised of U.S. sales of approximately $229 million and ex-U.S. sales of approximately $16 million, which were mainly from Germany. As of June 30, approximately 6,000 patients have initiated treatment with ORKAMBI in the U.S. Outside the U.S.; ORKAMBI is already available commercially in Germany and also through early access programs in France.","In Germany, uptake continues to be slow than we observed in the U.S. As of June 30, approximately 380 of the 2,500 eligible patients in Germany had initiated treatment. In contrast, in France, we've continued to see strong and rapid uptake, approximately 700 of 1,500 eligible patients in France have already initiated treatment with ORKAMBI as of June 30 as part of the country's early access programs. These programs provided the opportunity for physicians in France to begin treating patients prior to their formal reimbursement approval. We are pleased the ORKAMBI launch has continued to progress consistent with what we discussed on our first quarter call, and today we are reiterating our expectation for 2016 ORKAMBI revenues of $1 billion to $1.1 billion.","Given the slower than expected launch in Germany and that we are approaching peak penetration for ORKAMBI in patients age 12 years and older in the U.S., we expect that further revenue growth for ORKAMBI will occur primarily in the fourth quarter following the potential approval and launch of ORKAMBI for children ages six to 11 years.","Now to KALYDECO. Second quarter KALYDECO sales were $180 million, up $25 million compared to the second quarter of last year. We continue to see small number of additional eligible patients beginning treatment in the U.S. and Europe. As with ORKAMBI, we are reiterating our 2016 revenue guidance for KALYDECO of $685 million to $705 million. Our 2016 guidance exclude any potential revenues for the approval of KALYDECO in residual function mutations where we continued to pursue the FDA approval for patients ages two and older in the U.S.","Now to the operating expenses. Our second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were $306 million compared to non-GAAP operating expenses of $254 million in 2015. The increased operating expenses were mainly due to increased cost related to the progression of our CF pipeline and to increased investment in global commercial support for the launch of ORKAMBI.","Our non-GAAP net profit for the second quarter of 2016 was $58 million or $0.24 per diluted share as compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $131 million or $0.54 per share for 2015.","From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the second quarter with approximately $1.07 billion in cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities. Vertex also has $300 million outstanding from a credit agreement, repayable by the end of the third quarter 2017.","I'll conclude tonight's call with a few brief comments on financial trends including revenue and earnings growth. Our goal is to discover and develop new medicines for all people with CF. And as Jeff has discussed, there are three important phases to support these efforts; obtaining reimbursement for ORKAMBI outside the U.S., expanding labels for both ORKAMBI and KALYDECO; and developing new medicines to treat potentially all people with CF. As we progress towards this goal, significant and sustainable revenue growth will follow.","Importantly, as our revenues grow over future years, we are committed to managing our operating expenses to drive earnings growth and we expect to deliver a financial profile that is similar to many of our large cap biotech peers.","With that, I open the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Afternoon and thanks for taking the question. I have a few commercial ones and one clinical. Want to ask you guys either, Ian or Stuart, any changes to the persistence rates in the U.S. What are the new strategies to improve it? And then, can you just go into a little bit more detail on the EU outlook, so from what I'm understanding flattish in 3Q from Germany and then maybe what's driving the fourth quarter bump?","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Yeah. Geoff, it's Stuart here. So on persistence rates what we're seeing in the U.S. is very consistent with what we outlined on our Q1 call. In fact, all of the trends really in initiations. Persistence and compliance are entirely in line with what we said then. And just to remind you and others on the phone of persistence, we said that our expectation was it would track towards about 70% to 80% \u2013 between 70% and 80% by the end of this year and the same core compliance. And we continue to believe in those estimates and those estimates are what underpins our revenue guidance that we reiterated today.","In terms of Europe, as you noted, Germany, the pace is relatively slow and Ian mentioned that in his prepared remarks. Incorporated within our guidance, really we're only expecting significant contributions ex-U.S. from Germany. In terms of how we see things playing out in the rest of Europe, really as you know that's going to be very dependent on us proceeding through the country-by-country reimbursement negotiation processes. And what I can tell you is that those are progressing as we planned as expected, but given our learnings and the analogy to KALYDECO and the time it took there, we're really not anticipating to conclude many of those reimbursement negotiations until 2017.","Having said that, we recently concluded our first formal reimbursement negotiation in Austria and that'll go into effect from September 1st, but we continue to believe that most of the major markets we're not likely to see any major contributions in terms of revenue growth until 2017 and beyond.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And just real quick on the clinical side. I know it's less interesting, but the PK for VX-152 and VX-440, will we see any of that in any CF? Then any more thoughts on kind of what the size and scope of the clinical development for the triple could entail? Thanks.","Ian F. Smith - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","It's a little difficult to answer that, to be honest, Geoff, to say the size of the triple \u2013 I mean if I comment more broadly on the operating expense for the remainder of the year and then maybe kind of a trajectory in 2017, I think that's an easier way for me to comment on it. We always plan and provide guidance based on assuming success and that's why we're investing behind the programs. So our OpEx guidance for the year is at $1.18 billion to $1.23 billion, and we reiterated that with the number in the press release tonight and that's a non-GAAP number by the way, excludes primarily stock compensation.","And then as we look into next year, we actually see \u2013 we hope and expect the programs to progress. And as we look into next year as we think about OpEx more broadly, we see that maybe some marginal increases in marketing investments is for the launch of ORKAMBI more broadly and particularly in Europe as we gain reimbursement approval. And as we look at the development investment, maybe there is \u2013 it's more consistent to 2015 to 2016 as programs cycle in and out with the expectation that the VX-661 Phase 3 program comes to closure and we're filing next year and the progression of the triple into a larger Phase 2 study. So hopefully that gives you an understanding of the trajectory of our investment profiles through this year and then into next year.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Geoff, this is Jeff Leiden. With respect to your question on the PK data and in CF, what we've said before is that we'll let you know as we conclude the Phase 1 studies and plan the Phase 2 studies for the next-gen correctors, what those Phase 2 studies will look like and we'll provide you with some relevant data so you understand the design of those studies.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And those (17:46) are on track for the second half of this year.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Two questions as well. On the commercial side, are you based on long-term data for ORKAMBI? And are you starting to see any patients perhaps thinking about coming back, are there discussions out there in the field about bringing some patients back on, and what do you think about that standpoint? And then a follow-up question on the triple. Is it safe to say that you've gone well into Phase 1 and the longer the better? And is there something specific in terms of exposure levels that you're looking for relative to assays that would get you some comfort in terms of what you want to see in terms of exposure decreasing. Thanks so much.","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz - Executive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Officer","Hi. This is Jeff Chodakewitz. Maybe let me just touch on both of those for you. I think from the long-term data perspective, we think that is very meaningful to patients and to prescribers. And I think the reason for that are several-fold. As you know that that information really has a couple of chunks to it. One is about the long-term safety of the drug; very important, and that continues to look very favorable consistent with what we've seen before. And then we had several for efficacy kind of measures. Some of that came from the study itself are following patients for a long time and we saw that their FEV1s were maintained, their BMI continued to improve. And although there's no active comparison there, the vent rate in terms of pulmonary exacerbation really remained low and consistent with what we saw during the trial. So that was all very impactful, we think, for physicians and for patients.","The other thing we did was take the information from a matched cohort of historical patients. And what that allows you to do over that kind of timeframe is to compare the rate of decline of patients FEV 1s who are on our study versus what we think the historical expectation would be. And that's really then, as we did with KALYDECO, helps us understand if we're shifting that curve and slowing the rate of decline, really modifying the disease and we were very pleased to see that approximately 40% reduction in the rate of decline. So overall, we think that data is very impactful and useful.","In terms of triple combination, really can't give you a lot of details as Jeff Leiden said actually already that that both drugs do continue in Phase 1 studies, and our expectation of course pending data is that one or both of those will start in-patient the second half of this year.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much. A question for Stuart, perhaps, I think about the PDUFA date and the pediatric indication for ORKAMBI. Could you talk about what sort of pace you expect to reimbursement to be available to the pediatric patients; the homozygous double deltas. And then secondly, as you are out in the community and talking to physicians, do you think that the adoption, compliance and persistence rates in the pediatric population will be similar to the adult population or greater or less than you've observed so far? Thanks.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Geoff, thanks for those questions. So yeah, the PDUFA date is September the 30. Obviously we're deep into the planning for that launch because it's only just a couple of months away. In terms of what we might anticipate for access, on to the first part of your question, my expectation is that access is going to be very good just as that was for ORKAMBI when we first introduced it for the 12 years and over population. And in some ways, this is a somewhat simpler review for the payers. This is a labeled extension, just extending it down to a younger age. And so my expectation is that we'll secure broad access very quickly.","In terms of rate of uptake, similarly I would anticipate the demand to be robust just as it was for 12 year-plus. And in terms of persistence and compliance, again it's difficult to say exactly how it's going to play out in the real world as opposed to what we saw in the clinical trial setting. Certainly a couple of things that I think give us some encouragement. We certainly saw in the study that we did that forms the basis of our application that the adverse event rate, in particular the rate of respiratory adverse events was much lower and none of the patients discontinued for that adverse event. And as you know, that's being one of the primary reasons for discontinuations on ORKAMBI in the 12 years and over population.","And then again one thing that could help us, the six year to 11 year population certainly with KALYDECO, we do tend to see compliance rates being much higher in the younger population, not surprisingly they tend to be very heavily managed by their parents. And so whilst I don't know exactly how it's going to play out in the real world, I'd certainly expect access to be very good and us to secure that quickly and I'd also expect the uptakes to be very rapid as well.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much.","Ian F. Smith - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Geoff, I'll just add on to Stuart to reiterate something I said in my comments, which is that the Q4 is where we anticipate to see the growth in ORKAMBI for the remainder of the year. Obviously, that is driven by the six years to 11 years that Stuart was just discussing.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, great. Thanks, Ian.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. As you guys see more uptake in Germany and more patients going on treatment in France. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about persistence and compliance patterns that you're starting to see in Europe. You expect to be able to leverage your learnings from the U.S. launch, plus the availability of the long-term data now to improve that patient retention in the European launches compared to U.S.?","And then separately, just wondering if you could give us a little bit more granularity on the next steps in your level of confidence on residual function mutation, sort of where you stand there with respect to the next regulatory steps? Thanks.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Okay, Brian. So I'll start off on the persistence and compliance and how things are playing out in Europe. I mean one of the benefits of launching in Europe after launching here in the U.S., is clearly we've been able to learn a lot from our experiences here in the U.S. And I think one of the things that we've been able to do is certainly sensitize people through the fact that some patients may have these respiratory adverse events. And so to be on the lookout for them, to be cancelling patients in advance and that certainly has been one of the many learnings that we took from our experiences here in the U.S. through the introduction of the product in Europe.","The data sources are not quite as robust as we have here in the U.S. in terms of tracking at a non-miles level individual patient data in Europe. And I would say it is relatively early-stage. The persistence rates are certainly in line in the same kind of ballpark as we saw with the ORKAMBI here in the U.S. And as that data matures over time, we'll be able to give you kind of more detail on exactly how it's playing out. But the minute the data is relatively mature, I would say it's pretty much in the same kind of ballpark for the systems and the compliance.","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz - Executive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Officer","And Brian, it's Jeff Chodakewitz. Just to comment on residual function. We really can't comment on what we have ongoing discussions with regulatory agencies. The only thing I can say that we do really think all the data, both the pre-clinical data and the clinical data really tell us that this drug is beneficial to those patients and our goal is to figure out the way we get access for those patients.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just two from me. First on ORKAMBI in the U.S. It looks like new patient adds have moderated somewhat this quarter. And I know you were talking about nearing peak. So is 6,000 or 6,000-ish patients kind of what you're expecting now, or you think you can get to the rest of the 8,500 patients total? And then in Germany versus France, obviously a difference in uptake. Just wondering what you think is driving that and which other countries you could think about those patterns playing out. Are they going to be more like Germany or more like France? Thank you.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Terence, I'll start with the U.S. So, as you said with ORKAMBI we've now initiated over 6,000 patients here in the U.S. which is about 70% of the eligible patient population. And as you might expect with the launch where we're getting to a steeper part of the curve, adding new patients becomes a little bit more tricky. Having said that, we are continuing to add new patients on a weekly and a daily basis. But as Ian said in his prepared remarks in terms of U.S. growth, obviously the next phase in growth in the U.S. is likely to be from the approval in six years to 11 years, which we hope will come in the next couple of months.","So moving on to how things are panning out in Europe. And you're right. There is a contrast in uptake between Germany and France. Germany is slower than we anticipated and much of that I attribute to the fact that the German market is more fragmented than many of the other markets that we operate in. And what I mean by that is there's many more centers treating CF patients. And as a result, they've had less experience with CFTR modulators, and, therefore, (28:39) educational need is higher there. And also, we did see a slightly slower uptake for KALYDECO in Germany than we saw in other EU markets.","In contrast that with France, where through early access programs we have, 700 patients have already been initiated on ORKAMBI and that uptake in six months is much more U.S.-like. So, based on that, based on all the other research we've done, we do anticipate that Germany is more likely to be an outlier in terms of rate of uptake. Although I continue to believe that we will get to the vast majority of the patients in Germany over time. And in terms of rate of uptake, I would expect it to be more like France in the rest of Europe, pending reimbursement than we've seen in Germany, which I continue to believe is likely to be more of the outlier based on our previous experience with KALYDECO and current experience with ORKAMBI.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi guys. This is John Miller on for Mark. And I just wanted to ask a question about these 6,000 patients that have started on ORKAMBI. You said there's a start \u2013 what's the current number of patients on therapy? I'd love know that. And my other question I suppose would be your thoughts on pricing pressure, especially in an orphan disease like this where pricing ability has typically been very high. How do you look at that going forward as that's obviously an issue?","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, I'll just reiterate what Ian said. In terms of the actual number of patients being treated, that's clearly a very dynamic number and changes constantly. So what we have said is that we've to-date initiated 6,000 patients. We continue to see more initiations and we continue to believe as we do at the end of Q1, but the persistence rate for that patient population is going to be somewhere in the 70% to 80% range. As indeed we believe the compliance rate will be somewhere in the 70% to 80% range.","And so that's what we believed at the end of Q1. We continue to perform against those expectations, and that is in 12 year and above patients in the U.S. is what underlies our revenue guidance that we reiterated today. So in terms of pricing, clearly that's a very hot topic across the industry. We continue to believe that we're developing very high value medicines, medicines that treat the underlying cause of what is a horrible, life shortening disease. It's for a very small patient population and we believe and I think that's reinforced by the discussions we've had with the governments through the reimbursement in KALYDECO and the ongoing discussions we're having with ORKAMBI. This is exactly the sort of medicine that they want to be able to provide to their patient population. So whilst there will be pricing pressures because of the overall macroeconomics on every farmer and biotech company, I continue to believe that the sorts of agents we're bringing to bear are the sorts of products that the governments are going to want to pay for.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you very much guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is Cyrus on for Matt. Couple of questions. First, are there any efforts to improve the persistence or compliance rates in the United States?","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Yeah. We have a number of programs which are provided either through materials that we provide to healthcare providers to provide to their patients. Or where appropriate to provide directly to the patients to educate them on the product, the mechanism of action, the fact that they treat the underlying nature of the disease, and so those programs are ongoing. And I think understanding and an educated patient is likely to be a more persistent and more compliant patient. And also, we continue to try and build the evidence base for ORKAMBI, which increases the benefit risk profile, and to the extent the providers and patients continue to believe in the benefit risk profile. Then I think they're going to want to try and maintain their time on the product because of the both short-term and long-term benefit to the treatment with ORKAMBI gives them.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. The second question is when we would be able to recognize the revenues in France and will they come as a lump sum or how will it be dealt with?","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for that question. Just kind of help everybody else who is behind that question. We actually are providing access to ORKAMBI in France through early access programs and other programs. And we are actually being paid for that drug. And in my remarks, I did comment that that launch in France is going very well and that we're accessing a lot of patients. We do get a payment for that drug that might be similar to how the ultimate price of the drug plays out in France. However, from a GAAP perspective, we are unable to record those \u2013 let's say, access to those medicine as revenue until we haven't agreed price in France.","So I appreciate your question. We'd anticipate that that would be a 2017 event. As a point that we do get approval on the price which provides a certainty to recording of those revenues, we actually record the revenues as one big catch-up. So as we've been selling drug, since let's say January 1, 2016 all the way through to the point of reimbursement approval, we will record that cash that we will ultimately have received as part of revenues in the quarter that we received reimbursement approval. We do think that would be a 2017 event.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Great. Thank you. And then last question. Is there any update to the VX-661's utility analysis timing for the heterozygous?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz - Executive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Officer","Hi, Cyrus, it's Jeff Chodakewitz. I can tell you that as we talked about previously that is on track to occur during the third quarter. And then based upon that recommendation from the DMC remember that we won't be seeing that information. We will either stop the study or restart enrollment and go to completion.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Adam Walsh with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Adam Walsh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Great. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. My first one is you talked about a large bolus of discontinuations in the first quarter because 15% of patients I believe decided to come off in the first three months. I just wondered if there was any residual bolus kind of tail end into the second quarter. That's my first question. And then my second question is also on discontinuations. You talk about the 15% in the first three months and 20% to 30% longer-term. Can you help us, after the 15% dropout in the first three months, help us understand the discontinuation dynamics from that point to the 25% long-term discontinuation rate which is the midpoint of your guidance?","Ian F. Smith - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So, yeah, thanks for the questions. So, yes, we did describe there's kind of bolus of discontinuations and that was largely a function of two things. One, the very, very rapid uptake we saw of ORKAMBI post the initial launch and then we did see about 15% of patients discontinue within the first three months of therapy largely as a result of respiratory adverse events. And then what we saw was that the rate of discontinuations ameliorated substantially; didn't stop, didn't flatten but it certainly ameliorated substantially. And as a result of that, that's why we gave guidance that we see the discontinuations or the persistence rate which is the opposite of discontinuations being in that 70% to 80% range by the end of 2016. And everything we've seen through Q2 continues to reinforce our belief because that's where we will end the year somewhere in that 70% to 80% range. If I understand your question correctly, there wasn't really a second bolus that negatively impacted Q2.","Adam Walsh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Right. I guess the question was, was there any tail end residual? You had the large number of patients start in the first nine months and you cited that in that in the first quarter. As we moved into this quarter, was the bolus still moving through in terms of 15% discontinuations or do that really end in the first quarter?","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Maybe a better way to answer this is that when somebody asked this on the call earlier, was that are we continuing to see the dynamics of the launch and let's say the compliance rates and persistence rates, these being maintained. And yes, they are. So when we talked about the profile of compliance with the medicine being between 70% and 80%, we're still seeing that. When we look at the persistence rates ending up at 70% to 80%, we're still seeing that which means that we \u2013 every time there is a bolus of patients that is initiating therapy, we still continue to see discontinuations early on. However, because there is a lower initiation of patients in, let's say Q1 or even the beginning of Q2, the impact of discontinuations in Q2 is much less than it has ever been.","Adam Walsh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","Definitely. And thanks for taking my questions. Just couple on the pipeline. So, I guess first on VX-661's het-min futility analysis. Never disclosed exactly what the futility hurdle was. I was wondering whether you could give us some sense of the criteria or at least how you're going to interpret a dose signal in particular. And then a similar question on the Phase 1 for the second generation correctors. Can you give us some idea of what criteria you're going to look at to decide which will move forward and do you have any plans to move other second generation correctors into the clinic?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz - Executive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Officer","Hi. This is Jeff Chodakewitz. So, in terms of VX-661 futility, I think first of all we really can't go into the details of exactly what the decision tree is, but let me help you think about it a little bit perhaps. There's a certain tension as you make a decision based on partial information. We want to try if the drug is not benefiting patients to stop the trial. Conversely, there is uncertainty and we also want to be careful about not missing a positive result. Therefore, there always is a certain overlap. And what we tend to do is then say it's clearly not working. We stop. The consequence of that is, even if it goes forward, there is still uncertainty. It does not mean that it's working, it just means that it may be working. And therefore, until we get to the end of the study, we really would not have any confidence in what the result is going to be.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And Jeff maybe before you go on to the next question, I would just comment from a disclosure perspective we get after the question a number of times. I want to be very clear on our disclosure around that. Consistent with that Jeff is saying, if there is a discontinuation of this study due to the futility, we'll announce that the study is discontinuing and that would be an appropriate announcement at the time that we get that information. If we pass no guarantees that it's working and therefore this information is submissible for approval. But the only way we communicate around that is on clinicaltrial.gov, we will reopen the recruitment for that study and would expand the recruitment into the study but there wouldn't be announcement to say that we have passed the futility rule.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","That's very helpful. Thanks.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz - Executive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Officer","And just in terms of your other question. I think what we've always said is that what we wanted to do is bring these medicines \u2013 these compounds forward, but we want them to be medicines. And so we try as much as possible to have drugs that we think can have a favorable profile in patients so that the patients continue. We're going to look at all the information, safety exposure, all the things you'd expect. There's really no one thing that I can say we're going to focus in on is really the totality of the profile of the drugs.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Do you have any plans to move in any other second generation characters into the clinic, or does that really depend on what you're seeing in Phase 1?","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. This is Jeff Leiden. Thanks for the question. As we've said before, this is a large program here. We've discovered a series of second generation correctors and they have different \u2013 or next generation correctors. They have different flavors which is interesting. And our strategy here is very straightforward. We can develop a portfolio of products and bring some of those forward into the clinic and compare them that gives us the best probability of success. So our plan is to continue that program in the research and pre-clinical phase. And if we see compounds that are interesting, good, better than the ones we have, we certainly will bring them forward to the clinic.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just one on VX-661 and the other study. Can you give us a flavor around like, maybe kind of what the progress in enrollment, not the homozygous but the other three studies like, kind of what sequence we might expect through the timelines? Second one is just, when you look at some of the long-term data that you generate on exacerbation like at the medical meetings mid-year, do you think that doctors are receiving that, patients are receiving that, that there is like a very kind of profound benefit of staying on ORKAMBI even with somewhat similar to KALYDECO? Thanks.","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz - Executive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Officer","Sure. So it's Jeff Chodakewitz. Let me first comment on the VX-661 sequence. First of all, as we indicated for the homozygous study, we have a lot of confidence in that finishing enrollment. In August in fact we've actually already stopped screening patients for that study. So it's just having the last patients of completing the screening process and if they qualify going into the trial. We've already talked about the timing of the study of het-min patients and the futility analysis that's going to be done. We expect that the next trial that's going to be completed will be the study of patients with 508 (44:30) residual function mutation on the other early on.","As we've indicated, we expect that to complete in the second half of this year; very much as we indicated earlier this year. It's really right on track and then the last study with 508 and gating on the other allele. Again as we've indicated previously, we think in the second half of this year or early next year and as we get the datas and that will allow us to evaluate our best sufficient strategy and file pending data in the second half of 2017.","In terms of the long-term data, I want to be sure that I understand your question. We do think that the results from that long-term data are quite compelling. You asked specifically about pulmonary exacerbations and so we do look at what basically we use an assessment of how many events are happening for the patients that we're following and think about it as an event rate. And what we do see is that as we've gone out further, a time that remains quite low compared to what we had as our initial comparison. We think that is quite meaningful to patient and physicians. And actually \u2013 and that linked up with the other information like bodyweight and particularly the change is slope of FEV1 and evidence of disease modification. We think that is driving considerations like starting therapy earlier and considering whether patients who discontinued may want to think about of restarting therapy.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you talk about maybe the ATU pricing you're getting in France. And how does that compare to the German pricing for ORKAMBI. And then secondly, also again on Europe, what's your thought on the Brexit, on the UK, and also broadly speaking, European reinvestment for ORKAMBI? Thanks.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","So the ATU pricing in France has not been properly disclosed, but it is very similar to the list price that we have established in Germany. In terms of the thoughts on the Brexit impact, certainly from a financial point of view in the short-term, the really most tangible impact that you can see is really one around the impact on FX. And because of the nature of our business and the natural hedges we have, we're not expecting that to have a meaningful impact on our business. There's obviously a range of other legal, regulatory, employment and other aspects that could be impacted by Brexit as the negotiations are ongoing, we're clearly going to be tracking those very closely, and making all the appropriate moves and responses as the situation becomes clear. But as with many things Brexit, I think they speculate on too many other aspects on what the impact would be, would be crystal ball gazing at best.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Stu. And then maybe another one for Jeff. Can you tell us, when might we see CRISPR and also the Moderna program getting into clinic as it's released?","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So thanks for that question. I appreciate you acknowledging the two very important collaborations that we actually done in the last year. Kind of expanding of such scientific modalities is getting to other diseases, but unfortunately they are early-stage, as you're probably aware. And we will anticipate getting anything to the clinic in the next couple of years. There's probably three years or more from now. And we'd love to update you on that, but those have been important transactions for the company.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Liisa Bayko with JMP Securities. Your line is now open.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I thought you had a pretty good KALYDECO quarter. I'm just wondering if you could comment on where \u2013 what's driving growth there? Is it from particular region or rolling out in a new mutation in that?","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Liisa, I'm thrilled with the question. It's nice to be able to talk about KALYDECO and thanks for noticing. Yeah, KALYDECO had a very strong quarter, about $180 million. Most of the growth over Q2 came from the U.S. and essentially what we've continued to see is increasing new patient initiations in some of the newer indications like the two year old to five year old kids and also in the R117H mutation. So we continued to see strong patient initiations. And as you know, the persistence rates and the compliance rates with KALYDECO are about as good as I've ever seen. So really is that combination of adding new patients and great persistence compliance rates, particularly here in the U.S.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you for that. And then in terms of ex-U.S., is it just to make sure we're all on the same page, the only countries you're selling any drug \u2013 distributing drug to patients, but I know you're not really selling in France, per se, like France, Germany and the U.S. Are those the totality of the countries?","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","So outside of the U.S., France and Germany are different to many of the other markets. The way, the structure of those markets work is that there are access programs that you can take advantage of where patients can get access to the products prior to formal reimbursement approval being secured on a relatively broad basis and that's happening in both Germany and France. And Ian talked about the fact that with France we don't recognize those patients from a revenue perspective. In Germany, we do. There are other countries where on a named patient basis, there are literally handfuls of patients through exceptional programs are getting access to the product, where we are getting paid. But the vast majority of our revenues outside of the U.S. are coming from Germany. We expect that to continue in 2016 and we don't expect to get really meaningful revenue contributions from markets outside of Germany and outside of the U.S. until 2017.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. I think that's it from me. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Two quick ones, I guess. First, can you just go over anything you said about the differences between the VX-152 and VX-440. Are they distinct corrective mechanisms. I know you've always said that the intent is to move forward with both, but I was just wondering if there's a potential for these two drugs to actually be complementary to each other, or like VX-661 and lumacaftor they're just overlapping. And then when we think about the (52:16) approval later this year, do you think there's any meaningful numbers of (52:20) patients currently on ORKAMBI off-label or do you think there's really completely on (52:24) patient pool right now?","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey Brian. This is Jeff Leiden. I'll take the first part and then Stuart can take the second part. We haven't actually talked a lot in detail about the mechanisms of action or the differences or similarities between VX-152 and VX-440. And they're clearly different molecules. And so that's why we brought them both forward into the clinic. What we have said is that we as part of our discovery programs have discovered a portfolio of next-gen correctors, which do have distinct mechanisms of action as well as distinct drug life properties. And that's why we're excited about the portfolio, that's why we plan to take multiple molecules into the clinic, because at least in my experience that's the way to maximize your chances of success.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Yeah. Brian on the subject of off-label usage in the six years to 11 years population, we don't track off-label usage, but my expectation is that it would be very, very low. The reason why I say that is the prior authorization criteria that's seen for ORKAMBI, which have enabled us to get very good access for ORKAMBI are very simple, but very clear and they would tend to say the person has to have a CF diagnosis, they have to have the right mutation type and they check the date of birth so they check the patient is 12 years and above. And so my expectation would be that the number of people receiving commercial products off-label at this point would be very, very low.","Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks, guys.","Michael Partridge - Vice President-Investor Relations","So operator, we'll take two more questions before concluding the call.","Operator","Okay. And our next question comes from the line of Katherine Xu with William Blair. Your line is now open.","Katherine Xu - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you. Thank you for taking my questions. I'm just wondering with ORKAMBI versus KALYDECO, do you see a little bit lower compliance or persistence for ORKAMBI as compared to KALYDECO. And if that's the case, do you think it's mostly because of safety or lower efficacy or both, any sense on that at all?","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Yeah, Katherine. So with KALYDECO, we see very, very high levels of both persistence and compliance and we've said that our persistence with KALYDECO is 90%-plus and overall compliance, both here in the U.S. and internationally, is around 85%. And as we said at Q1 and is baked into our revenue guidance, we expect persistence for ORKAMBI to be between 70% and 80% and for compliance to be in the same 70% to 80% range. So we do see both of those criteria being lower for ORKAMBI than they are for KALYDECO. And you're trying to attribute exactly why that is. I'm not sure. I would be able to tease that out for you. I'm sure it's got to do with the benefit, risk and tolerability profile of ORKAMBI versus KALYDECO, but exactly which factor is weighting it one way or the other, I think that would be impossible to differentiate.","Katherine Xu - William Blair & Co. LLC","And could you give us a quick update on your oncology and pain pipeline candidates?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz - Executive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Officer","So maybe \u2013 this is Jeff Chodakewitz \u2013 just to give you a quick comment and then maybe a comment I think in terms of our oncology program. I think very much consistent with where we were discussing it previously that we do have of our lead molecule, VX-970, is really in focused clinical trials in very specific populations, in non-comparative trials to understand what the potential for that drug really can be. And so those are ongoing. On the pain side, our VX-150 actually just has finished enrolling a Phase 2 POC study in osteoarthritis patients and we expect to have some information later this year.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So Jeff, thanks for that. I'd just pick up on that and say as many people ask this, are we going to be an oncology company? And I think that's a little early to suggest that given that we have one lead molecule at the moment in early stage settings in oncology. We're going to continue to progress those studies as Jeff Chodakewitz said. And based on that data, we will make a choice at that time of whether we provide further investment or we actually love to see whether the mechanism is better served working with other companies. And therefore, looking more of a portfolio approach to drive forward, let's say, our oncology opportunities. We do have other mechanisms. One of that is in the clinic and then a couple of that are just late pre-clinical right now. So we have a late pre-clinical, couple of compounds and then also early clinical compounds. And that's what I term as our oncology portfolio and we'll make the decision of how to progress that best for greatest value once we receive the data from VX-970 the lead program.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alan Carr with Needham & Company. Your line is now open.","Alan Carr - Needham & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess a couple of them here, one of them it looks like the only program you haven't touched on is VX-210. Wondering if you can give us an update on that in the spinal cord? And then also, with respect to your sNDA around residual mutations for KALYDECO, what sort of options do you have available here in your discussions with the FDA?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz - Executive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Officer","Jeff Chodakewitz. So Alan, I'd say first of all in terms of VX-210, that study is up and enrolling like we have had enrollment now in the trial, but these are acutely injured people. And so we have always expected that enrollment will be slow. And so we are really pretty much on track. In terms of the residual function, as we talked about earlier, there's really just nothing in terms of ongoing discussions with the regulatory agencies that I can talk about further.","Alan Carr - Needham & Co. LLC","I'm wondering if you can comment on what the outcomes might be here as there's something that might be resolved this year or does this potentially involve more studies, what can you comment from that perspective?","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's Jeff Leiden. So as you know, we just don't comment on ongoing regulatory discussions, probably because they are not predictable than they are not totally within our control. I think the important point is, we do believe that KALYDECO is active in the set of patients based on both preclinical and clinical data and that we're having ongoing discussions with the regulators about how to get access to these patients with KALYDECO. When we have an answer, we'll certainly disclose that for you.","Alan Carr - Needham & Co. LLC","Fair enough. Thanks very much.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time.

This is Michael Partridge, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for Vertex. Tonight, we will review our continued efforts to develop new medicines for all people with cystic fibrosis, recent advances in our research and development pipeline, and our 2018 financial results and 2019 guidance. Making prepared remarks on the call tonight, we have Dr. Jeff Leiden, Chairman and CEO; Stuart Arbuckle, Chief Commercial Officer and I would like to welcome to the call Paul Silva, Vertex\u2019s Interim Chief Financial Officer. Paul has been Vertex\u2019s Corporate Controller and Chief Accounting Officer since 2008. And he and his team have worked closely with the Investor Relations Group since that time. Following prepared remarks from Jeff, Stewart and Paul, Dr. Reshma Kewalramani, Chief Medical Officer will join us for Q&A. We recommend that you access the webcast slides on our website as you listen to this call. The conference call is being recorded and a replay will be on our website.","We will make forward-looking statements on this call that are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in today\u2019s press release and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These statements, including, without limitation, those regarding Vertex\u2019s marketed CF medicines, the ongoing development and potential commercialization of our triple combination regimens for cystic fibrosis, Vertex\u2019s other programs and Vertex\u2019s future financial performance are based on management\u2019s current assumptions. Actual outcomes and events could differ materially.","I will now turn the call over to Dr. Jeff Leiden.","Jeff Leiden","Thanks, Michael. Good evening, everyone. Over the past several years, I have shared with you Vertex\u2019s strategy to create multiple transformative medicines for different serious diseases by continuing to leverage our long track record of serial innovation. I am pleased to review with you this evening the significant progress we made in 2018 on executing the strategy and to discuss the important growth drivers that we expect in 2019, which will include many important clinical, reimbursement and commercial milestones and CF as well as clinical data from across our research and development pipeline.","In CF, we expect to obtain the Phase 3 data for the VX-445 triple combination this quarter and remain on track to submit a new drug application for a triple combination regimen no later than midyear. We also expect to see more patients initiating treatment with our medicines throughout 2019. As a result of global label expansions and from key reimbursement agreements reaching 2018, which will drive further revenue growth this year. In our non-CF pipeline, data expected in the first half of 2019 from our Phase 2b dose ranging study of VX-150 will inform our plans for potential Phase 3 development in pain.","In our AAT program, we are advancing a portfolio of small molecule correctors, including our first molecule and entered Phase 1 development in late 2018 and a second that is expected to enter clinical development this year. And in sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia, we have now initiated enrollment of both of our Phase 1\/2 studies of the gene editing treatment of CTX001. I will briefly review each of these pipeline programs with you this evening. First to cystic fibrosis, today approximately half of all people with CF are eligible for a Vertex CF medicine. And we stand on the verge of yet another dramatic advance in the treatment of this disease with our triple combination regimens that hold the potential to treat up to 90% of all people with the disease.","Our progress in CF in 2018 was marked by two important achievements. First, we saw a significant increase in the number of patients being treated with our approved medicines. This was the result of the successful SYMDEKO launch in the U.S., multiple label expansions for KALYDECO and ORKAMBI, and the completion of key reimbursement agreements around the world, which Stewart will review in a moment. And second, we made excellent progress in advancing our two triple combination regimens through Phase 3 development. It was on this call 1 year ago that we announced our plans to initiate Phase 3 development for two different triple combination regimens that include a next-generation corrector either VX-659 or VX-445. In just 1 year, we completed enrollment of approximately 1,000 patients across the 4 Phase 3 studies and obtained the first Phase 3 data for the VX-659 studies. These data showed clear and compelling evidence of the dramatic benefit that this regimen may offer patients with one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation as well as the significantly enhanced benefit that a triple combination regimen may provide for those with two F508del mutations who are already being treated with SYMDEKO or ORKAMBI. We will obtain data for the VX-445 triple combination regimen in the first quarter of this year, which will enable us to choose the best regimen to submit for regulatory approval. We remain on track to submit a new drug application for a triple combination regimen no later than mid 2019. We have set a high bar with the triple combination data, but we are also committed to creating even better CF medicines for the future, including once daily triple combination regimens and regimens that contain other next generation correctors that may have enhanced profiles. We have multiple molecules in preclinical and clinical development that may provide future improvements for the treatment of CF.","Now to our recent progress outside of CF where we are rapidly advancing a portfolio of potential new medicines through late preclinical and early clinical development across a range of serious diseases with large unmet medical need. I will start with our AAT program where we recently initiated clinical development of our first small molecule corrector. The similarities between our AAT and CF programs are striking and we believe that we will be able to apply many of the lessons learned in our CF discovery and development efforts to accelerate and de-risk our activities targeting AAT. We believe that measurements of the circulating functional AAT protein and people with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency will provide us with an early and important marker for the potential of our medicines to treat the cause of this disease just as the biomarker of sweat chloride did for us in CF.","Turning to our research and development program in pain, we recently announced positive Phase 2 results for VX-150 showing a significant reduction of pain in people with small fiber neuropathy. These data marks the third positive proof-of-concept study for VX-150 in three different pain conditions and further validate the potential role of NaV1.8 inhibition in the treatment of pain. A Phase 2b dose-ranging study of VX-150 in acute pain following bunionectomy surgery is now fully enrolled and we expect data from this study in the first half of this year. Positive data from this study could support pivotal development of VX-150 in pain. We have a portfolio of multiple additional NaV1.8 inhibitors in late preclinical development and expect to advance the first of these molecules into clinical development in 2019. We are also continuing to invest in the discovery of additional potential pain molecules targeting other new mechanisms given the significant need for new pain medicines.","Moving on to the sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia programs where with our partner CRISPR Therapeutics, we have now initiated clinical studies of CTX001 for both of these important diseases. These studies represent the first clinical trials to evaluate a gene-editing treatment using the CRISPR\/Cas9 technology in these two serious diseases. As we advanced these R&D efforts we are constantly evaluating new external opportunities that could provide access to new technologies, platforms or development assets. We have entered into multiple agreements in recent years that are aligned with our strategy, including our collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics as well as recently announced collaborations with Arbor Biotechnologies, Merck KGaA, Genomics Plc and X-Chem. We entered 2019 with increased flexibility to do more deals that would further broaden our pipeline and enable us to continue to explore serious diseases with multiple modalities and technologies. As we look toward future years, Vertex has the potential for significant revenue and earnings growth through the mid 2020s based solely on treating more patients with our approved and future CF medicines. Importantly, we also have a rapidly advancing portfolio of potentially transformative medicines for other serious diseases and ability to enhance our internal R&D efforts with external innovation to drive long-term future growth. If Vertex, we believe that real value for patients and shareholders is created through scientific innovation. And I am pleased that Vertex continues to be at the forefront of transforming the treatment of CF and other serious diseases.","I will now turn the call over to Stuart to review our commercial progress.","Stuart Arbuckle","Thanks, Jeff. I am pleased to review with you this evening, our strong commercial performance for 2018 driven by the launch of SYMDEKO in the U.S., and also our revenue guidance for 2019, which shows continued revenue growth as we treat more patients with our approved medicines globally. Approximately, 18,000 patients are currently being treated with our CF medicines and this resulted in CF product revenues of $868 million in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter included $294 million in revenues from SYMDEKO in the U.S., which was the primary driver of the significant growth in CF revenues in the quarter and throughout 2018.","Our full year 2018 CF revenues were $3.04 billion, a 40% increase compared to the $2.17 billion for 2017, which is a direct result of treating many more patients globally. In the U.S., we saw a large number of patients initiate and remain on treatment with SYMDEKO in 2018. Demand for SYMDEKO has come from all eligible groups of patients including those who previously discontinued or never initiated ORKAMBI and those who switched from ORKAMBI or KALYDECO to SYMDEKO. Given the profile of SYMDEKO, we had expected that persistence and compliance rates might be greater than those seen previously with ORKAMBI. And we are pleased to see this play out in the real world. While we are now well into the launch of SYMDEKO, we do anticipate additional patients will initiate treatment throughout 2019, including patients\u2019 ages 12 years and older as well as younger patients following potential approval in children ages 6 to 11, which we anticipate during 2019 and is reflected in the guidance I will discuss in a moment.","KALYDECO revenues for 2018 were $1.01 billion, an increase of 19% compared to 2017. The increasing KALYDECO revenues, is a direct result of treating more patients in U.S. based on label expansions received in 2017. Outside the U.S., we reached important reimbursement agreements for our CF medicines in Australia, Sweden and Denmark in 2018 adding to the multiple agreements previously reached in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Ireland and other countries. These new reimbursement agreements allowed patients to have access to medicines that treat the underlying cause of their disease for the first time and provided a contribution to revenue growth for 2018. These agreements will also contribute to revenue growth in 2019 and beyond.","Given the recent EU approval of SYMKEVI known as SYMDEKO in the U.S. and our rapid progress in developing triple combination regimens, our ongoing reimbursement efforts remained focused on obtaining the long-term portfolio agreements that not only provide immediate access to our approved medicines, but also a pathway to access in rapid reimbursement for future CF medicines. We have reached these types of agreements in multiple countries and view these agreements as win-wins for patients and governments as they provide certainty to patients that they will have immediate access to current and future innovations in CF from Vertex and budget certainty to governments for the foreseeable future.","Our progress in 2018 in launching SYMDEKO expanding the labels for KALYDECO and ORKAMBI and achieving important reimbursement agreements for our medicines outside the U.S. has positioned us for continued revenue growth in 2019. Our 2019 guidance for CF product revenues is $3.45 billion to $3.55 billion, which at the midpoint reflects approximately 15% growth over 2018. As the timing of when we achieve future reimbursement agreements is not entirely in our gift, our 2019 revenue guidance only reflects anticipated revenues from regions where our medicines are currently reimbursed. Achieving additional reimbursement agreements in 2019 could provide upside to our revenues and thus we would update our guidance as appropriate at that time.","I would note that we expect to see a negative impact in the first quarter of this year from channel inventory build of approximately $10 million that occurred at the end of 2018 and from higher gross to net adjustments, which we typically experienced in the first quarter. We expect that these dynamics may more than offset revenue growth from new patients and that first quarter CF product revenues could be sequentially lower than the fourth quarter of 2018 despite our expectation for continued revenue growth for the full year as noted in our guidance. I am pleased with the continued progress we have made in bringing our CF medicines to many more patients globally, which has resulted in strong revenue growth to support our investment in the creation of new medicines for CF and other diseases. I look forward to talking further with you throughout the coming year.","And we will now turn the call over to Paul to further review our financial results and guidance.","Paul Silva","Thanks, Stuart and good evening everyone. Vertex\u2019s financial performance in 2018 was marked by 40% growth in CF revenues coupled with disciplined investment into our business, which drove significant increases in our operating margins, operating income and cash flow. In addition to Stuart\u2019s comments on 2018 revenues and 2019 revenue guidance, I will provide additional remarks this evening regarding our 2018 financial results. I will also discuss our 2019 financial guidance for R&D and SG&A expenses and for our effective tax rate. All of the results and guidance that I will discuss are non-GAAP.","As Stuart noted, we saw a significant increase in CF product revenues driven primarily by the launch of SYMDEKO in the U.S. KALYDECO label expansions also contributed to the revenue growth in 2018, where KALYDECO revenues reached $1 billion for the first time since its approval in 2012. This underscores both the important role that KALYDECO plays in the lives of thousands of patients around the globe and the continued strong demand for the medicine as we expand its label to new and younger patients.","Our fourth quarter 2018 combined R&D and SG&A expenses were $400 million compared to $355 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our full year 2018 R&D and SG&A expenses were $1.53 billion compared to $1.33 billion for 2017. The increase in these expenses was primarily due to the advancement of our portfolio of triple combination regimens and investment to support the use of our medicines globally. The significant growth in CF revenues in 2018 resulted in fully year operating margins of 37% compared to 26% for 2017 as well as operating income of $1.11 billion, a 97% increase compared to 2017.","Net income for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $337 million compared to $158 million in 2017. Our full year 2018 net income was $1.06 billion compared to $495 million in 2017. The significant increase in our quarterly and full year net income was a result of the strong growth in CF product revenues. We also ended the year with approximately $3.17 billion in cash and marketable securities compared to $2.09 billion at the end of 2017. We expect to continue to generate significant cash in 2019 and beyond,","Now, to our 2019 guidance, today, we are providing financial guidance for CF product revenues as Stuart discussed as well as for combined R&D and SG&A expenses and our anticipated effective tax rate. We expect combined R&D and SG&A expenses of $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion. The increase compared to 2017 primarily reflects CF development efforts, incremental investments to support the potential launch of a triple combination regimen and investment to support the expansion of our pipeline into additional diseases.","Now to tax guidance, on a GAAP basis, we recorded a $1.5 billion non-cash benefit in the fourth quarter of 2018 based on the reversal of the valuation allowance related to our net operating losses. Following the release of this valuation allowance, we will also begin recording a tax provision in 2019 and expect our full year GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be 21% to 22%. The tax rate will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter this year with the highest rate occurring in the fourth quarter. The vast majority of our tax provision will be non-cash expense until we fully use our net operating losses. As Jeff noted, Vertex has a unique long-term growth outlook that is based on continued revenue growth in CF resulting in expanding operating margins and increases in earnings and cash flow. I look forward to updating you on our progress.","With that, I will turn the call back to Jeff.","Jeff Leiden","Thanks, Paul. In closing, 2018 was a highly successful year of commercial and clinical execution across our business. Our achievements over recent months have positioned us for continued growth in revenue and operating income in 2019 and beyond and for important near-term milestones across our R&D portfolio both in CF and in other diseases. Our strategy of creating transformative medicines through serial innovation is working exceptionally well as evidenced by the rapid progress seen across our business. And I look forward to updating you over the coming year.","With that, I will open the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Yee of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Michael Yee","Hey, thanks for the question and congrats on a great quarter. Two topics I thought you could address. One is giving the Street some comfort about obviously what\u2019s been in the news recently that UK and more broadly speaking the confidence that, that region will work itself out and to be specific whether to say safe better pharmacoeconomic value drug will help solve that equation? And the second question is a pipeline question you talk very nicely about AAT you did say there is a second one coming in. Are those combinable, are they similar, just more potent, maybe talk to how having two connections better than one or maybe I am getting ahead of myself? Thanks so much.","Stuart Arbuckle","Hey, Mike. It\u2019s Stuart. I will take the first question on the UK. I mean, before I go on to the UK, I do want to reference we made great progress from a reimbursement point of view in 2018 and that\u2019s reflected in the results we were able to share with you today, important agreements in places like Australia and Sweden and Denmark. Last year and we have continued that momentum into 2019 where we have secured new agreements in places like Israel and Luxembourg and the pricing agreement for ORKAMBI for 6 to 11 year old kids in Germany. So, we continue to make great progress getting access for patients around the world. Where we have been successful in large part is due to those countries using what we would consider to be appropriate methodologies to assess the value of these unique and transformative medicines and because our goal is to get access for real eligible patients we are continuing to pursue that with every bit of energy we can in the UK. I think it\u2019s important to split the UK up as you have probably known Mike from a healthcare perspective, the UK is managed and a developed country, so each country had its own process. So in Scotland, we have made great progress. We have reached an agreement with them about how they are going to assess our medicines and we have submitted on the verge of submitting ORKAMBI and SYMKEVI to the Scottish government and we are optimistic we will get access there hopefully in 2019. In England unfortunately, we are yet to reach an agreement with them on what we would consider to be an appropriate methodology, but we are certainly not going to give up on that. We are going to continue to fight to get access for patients in England as we have for patients around the rest of the world. The last thing I will say to you is that we know what the results will look like even if we put the triple combination regimen through the existing nice methodology, even if the results are as good as we saw with 659 in the Phase 3 study that we released in November. And even those results when put into the nice model don\u2019t come out with a valuation which we think in anyway gets close to valuing the transformative nature of these medicines. So even for the triple, we are going to continue to need to work with England to change the assessment methodology for all medicines.","Michael Yee","Okay.","Stuart Arbuckle","On the AAT question, I think I will hand over to Jeff.","Jeff Leiden","Hi, Mike, it\u2019s Jeff. Thanks for the question on AAT. In many ways, I think you can think of this as a very important lesson that we learned from our CFTR next-gen program right and we sort of had the saying Vertex crack the biology then pour on the chemistry. We believe we have cracked the biology of AAT. We have multiple correctors that can reform the protein and causes to be secreted from liver cells in a functional form. And so we started following on the chemistry about a year and a half ago and to create multiple molecules. And the reasoning is just that our experience as with the CFTR next-gen Vertex\u2019s as they get better and better and we like to take more than one molecule into the clinic because it\u2019s a portfolio risk mitigation strategy if you will. And obviously these molecules have are predominantly efficacious, they have that the right [indiscernible] and just the right drug protein and action that can be tolerable. And so, our strategy with AAT and frankly with most of the programs, CF is going forward is going to be the pour the chemistry on create multiple molecules. Bring those forward in the clinic and compare them in early small cells and we\u2019ve get a pretty quick idea of which are the best molecules. And so, these 280 molecules we don\u2019t think of them, added and we really think of them as different molecules that we\u2019re going to compare and by the way we shouldn\u2019t be surprised to see us putting a third one forward as well because as I said, we just continue to get sort of better and better properties.","Michael Yee","Got it. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of Leerink. Your lines are open.","Geoffrey Porges","Thank you very much for taking my question and congratulations also on the great results. First, of the 18,000 patients, could you give us a sense of how many come from the U.S. and ideally, how many come from Europe? And secondly could you give us the breakdown for KALYDECO, ORKAMBI and SYMDEKO by the main geographies. And then just a question for you Paul, are you comfortable that we should model that 21% to 22% tax rate in our models going forward beyond 2019. I think that\u2019s what you suggest. I want to be clear about that.","Stuart Arbuckle","Yes, it\u2019s Stuart. I will take the first couple of questions there of the 18,000 patients who are actually being treated now it\u2019s about two-thirds in the U.S. and about one-third ex-U.S. In terms of the breakout of the geographies in terms of the products for Q4 for our Q4 revenues the KALYDECO of the U.S. was a $160.0 million, ex-US was $95 million. For ORKAMBI, the U.S. was $225 million and ex-U.S. was $90 million. And SYMDEKO in U.S., it was $286 million and ex-U.S. was $8 million largely reflecting the launch that we just began to execute in Germany. So that\u2019s the breakout for the quarter, if you want to have that annual ones, I\u2019d be happy to catch up with you after the call.","Geoffrey Porges","Thanks very much.","Paul Silva","Hi, Jeff, it\u2019s Paul. Thanks for the question. And I\u2019m going to give a little bit more detailed in your specific question, just to kind of let you know how we\u2019re thinking about taxes. So, in 2019, we expect the effective tax rate to be 21% or 22% for the full year. And it\u2019s primarily driven by a non-cash U.S. federal tax provision. And in future years, we expect that the rate could actually go lower due to geographic mix of income as our revenues continue to grow and our business advances globally. I\u2019m not going to actually be able to give you what that rate is until we kind of get visibility of reimbursement in Europe. And then the other point I just want to make for everyone is that the majority of the guidance on the effective tax rate is non-cash and we expect to pay only approximately $25 million of cash taxes in 2019 compared to the $16 million that we\u2019re going to pay in 2018.","Geoffrey Porges","Great. Thanks very much, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Nadeau from Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Phil Nadeau","Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple on revenue growth drivers, so in 2019 guidance, could you give us some sense of how much of the revenue growth is coming from existing geographies with existing labels and versus how much is coming from label expansions that you expect to get in 2019? And then second question on the portfolio agreements that you referenced. Can you remind us which country is currently have portfolio agreements and how you go about negotiating portfolio agreements in the additional territories? Do you have to wait for an approval or is it something you can do proactively before for example the triples are approved? Thanks.","Stuart Arbuckle","Yes, so I\u2019ll take both of those. So in terms of the 2019 guidance that reflects really three things. One is, the sort of analyzing of the SYMDEKO launch in the U.S. into \u201919 also the annualized effect of the label expansions we saw that both KALYDECO and ORKAMBI in 2018 and a contribution from countries where we were able to achieve new reimbursement agreements in 2018. In 2019, we are not expecting a large contribution from new launches because we don\u2019t have as many of those in 2019, probably the most notable that we are assuming within our guidance is to be SYMDEKO in patients ages six to 11 and so that would be a new label expansion there. But the vast majority of it is coming from patients for whom we are label to get today. Just like to reiterate as well, it also assumes only revenues in geographies where we have reimbursement agreements today. If we were able to get significant new reimbursement agreements in 2019 and if they were material, then we would potentially have an upside to our revenue with update our guidance at that time. Until, the rich companies have portfolio agreements, if you see long portfolio agreement, you\u2019ve seen one portfolio agreement Phil. So, it would be difficult to describe the more, but we have them for instance in places like Ireland, we have an agreement in Australia where we have a path to getting SYMDEKO reimbursed, when it\u2019s approved by the TGA. Denmark, the Netherlands and so there is a number of different portfolio agreements that they are all slightly different. In terms of do we need to have regulatory approvals to get portfolio agreements again that varies country by country. But actually many countries are well aware of how quickly our portfolio is advancing and how impressive the results look for our triple combination regimens and so there is a significant interest from governments to be looking at these portfolio agreements even in advance of regulatory approval. Indeed, one of the countries, we are talking about early on, England has been one of those markets that\u2019s expressed an interest in those portfolio agreements. And remember that, the key to those is that win, win, win for us, but patients and for the government. The win for us is, that we would like to be able to have reimbursement agreements which kick in as soon as regulatory approval has been agreed. There are wins that physicians and patients who could get to choose the best Vertex medicine as sooner they approved and there is a win for governments because they give them a level of budgets during treating in CF patients.","Phil Nadeau","That\u2019s helpful. Maybe just one follow-up on the portfolio agreements, you mentioned Ireland, Australia, Denmark and Netherlands. So, as we model 2019 SYMKEVI sales, would it be reasonable to expect revenue from those four territories as well as Germany?","Stuart Arbuckle","So, in countries in the EU where we have a regulatory approval for 12 plus where those portfolio agreements are in place, we will be able to get access relatively quickly. I would remind you that in large parts, SYMKEVI is indicated for the same population as ORKAMBI and in places like Ireland for instance. On the Netherlands, we have seen very impressive uptake of ORKAMBI and very high persistence rate. And so whilst patients and physicians will have a choice essentially they will be trading up, which they think is the best medicine.","Phil Nadeau","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alethia Young of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","Stuart Arbuckle","Hi, Alethia, you are on mute?","Alethia Young","Can you hear me?","Stuart Arbuckle","We hear you now.","Alethia Young","Yes. Okay, cool. Maybe that\u2019s wrong with my headset. Sorry I apologize. I just wondered if you could talk a little bit about kind of your thoughts on M&A I mean you have a pipeline is coming together obviously internally, but I just wanted to talk a little bit about what you might think it\u2019s supplemental and interesting around doing external M&A or anything like that? And then also is that kind of delayed until you kind of figure out the CFO position as well? Thanks.","Jeff Leiden","Yes, Alethia, this is Jeff. I will take those. As you know, for the last couple of years, we\u2019ve been talking about a consistent, what I call external innovation strategy, not just M&A with licensing collaboration etcetera. it\u2019s really focused around three areas. The first is obviously yes, where anything that we feel would be complementary or additive to our current regimens would be of great interest to us. Honestly, we\u2019re seeing less and less in that particular bucket simply because we\u2019ve set such a high bar now with the triple combination data. The second area is what I call technology and tools had a very concerted effort to build a complete tool box of technologies that we think would allow us to address the kind of serious diseases and to some extent genetic diseases that we\u2019re interested in and our pipeline. And you\u2019ve seen us do a number of those deals, so CRISPR, Arbor, X-Chem, and Genomics Plc. Those are all deals and you should think of it\u2019s acquiring different tools that will the let us optimally address the diseases that we\u2019re interested in. You should expect to see us continue to do that in areas of interest, nucleic acid therapies, gene therapies etcetera. And then the third area would obviously be pipeline assets. And those pipeline assets would be consistent with our overall strategy of transformative medicines for serious diseases and specialty markets. And you should expect to see us do some of those as we find them in general, but the earlier stage development assets where we think we can add value through our clinical development regulatory and commercial groups. What you won\u2019t see us doing is deals for on-market or late-stage products that are essentially led by revenue growth over the next 5 years to 7 years simply because we don\u2019t need that revenue growth, CF is going to provide that. And so you can expect to see us continue to do deals around those three focus areas. I would say that we are obviously building substantial financial firepower to do more of those deals and we\u2019ve ramped up our external innovation group to allow us to do that. And so I do think it\u2019s fair for you to expect to see us complement our very rapidly advancing internal pipeline with some external innovation as well.","Alethia Young","Thanks a lot. Very thorough.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Geoff Meacham","Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. I know the plan is still obviously to select the NDA for the triple coming up in the first half. I just want to ask if your points of differentiation between the two or the metrics have changed at all. In other words, like is it still about FEV1 and maybe less about pulmonary exacerbations or the like? And then also when you look at the part of the package, is there anything that has yet to be done in terms of non-clinical or that could be perhaps or getting factor or something that could push you to the second half of the year versus the end of 2Q your guidance? And I have one follow-up.","Jeff Leiden","Thanks, Geoff. This is Jeff. I\u2019ll take the first part and Reshma maybe you can take the second part. With respect to how we\u2019re going to compare the two assets, again, just I know you this, but just a quick review, we \u2013 not that the 445 drivers fully enrolled, we have a very good line of sight to the timing of when we expect to see the top-line data there, which is in the first quarter. And so we\u2019re very confident that we\u2019ll have that kind of data that we can compare to the data that we\u2019ve already reported for 659. As I said before, the way we\u2019re going to look at these two assets is the complete profile, if you will of both programs and that goes all the way back to preclinical work. It includes things like PK, PD, tolerability, drug-drug interactions, as well as of course the efficacy measurements, that you talked about with FEV1, but also things like sweat chloride. So, this will be a very complete review of both assets. We\u2019re in a nice position of having a nice complete file on both assets once we get the 445 data and I think we\u2019ll be able to then pick the best asset to move forward. And again, we\u2019re very much on track to do that in the first quarter. We\u2019re confident that we will be able to make that decision on schedule in the first quarter, which would allow that mid-year NDA filing. But I\u2019ll let Reshma address the second part of the question with respect to the package and what\u2019s there.","Reshma Kewalramani","Sure. Thanks, Jeff. So, regardless of whether the selection is for VX-659 or for VX-445, we\u2019re going to have all of the data that we need in Q1, you know that we already shared the data for VX-659 late last year, the exact same package, the same amount of the data and the same kind of data we\u2019re going to get very shortly for 445. And with regard to packaging, we\u2019re making sure that we have the CTD complete in the NDA file, that\u2019s going to happen by mid of this year. That is something that we are very much on track for and I have high confidence that\u2019s going to happen.","Geoff Meacham","Okay. And then just a follow-up, I know this was asked about the reimbursement, oh you asked, I know in the past, you guys have had a pretty defined strategy of allowing kind of the patient community to sort of escalate and maybe to put some pressure on the payers and this obviously has been the case in the UK and in France. But I wanted to ask you for the triple, is there a different methodology or just something you can do differently maybe to help accelerate reimbursement looking OUS, maybe just do things a little bit differently that could help speed up a process?","Stuart Arbuckle","Yes, Geoff, it\u2019s Stuart here. I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s our strategy to get patients to put pressure on people as you know, our development plans in cystic fibrosis, there\u2019re no secret to anybody that the community is very well aware of the progress we\u2019re making, very well aware of the clinical benefits, these products look like they are delivering and so I think quite rightly they are calling on their elected officials to get access to these medicines. I really refer back to what I said earlier, the key here from a kind of health technology assessment point of view is that the methodology needs to be appropriate for these types of medicines, which are going to be used very early in people\u2019s lives, hoping to restore them to normal levels of chloride transport and deliver benefits over the very, very long-term. And frankly, the assessment methodologies are not really fit for purpose to assess those types of medicines. So, from a health technology assessment point of view, that is what we are continuing to work on and where we\u2019ve done that which is in many, many countries around the world, we\u2019ve been successful. And then the other thing that I think is an important component of this is, where we\u2019ve been successful. I think a substantial portion of the time, it\u2019s because senior government ministers have taken an interest in this issue being able to see our portfolio and how fast it\u2019s developing and the kind of benefits it could bring to their populations. And so to me those are two of the most important success factors in the UK and everywhere else around the world.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Matteis of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Paul Matteis","Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. Two-part question on VX-150. I guess first of all, can you guys talk about the logic of doing more stringent work here. Given that you have a few positive Phase 2, a low AE rate, and there\u2019s a big unmet need for an opioid alternative, we were just wondering why \u2013 why not move faster into Phase 3? And then secondarily, I was wondering if all strategic options with VX-150 still on the table and have you confirmed that you\u2019ve picked as far as yourself at least to a targeted subset or it\u2019s an out-licensing still a possibility? Thanks so much.","Reshma Kewalramani","Sure, thanks. This is Reshma. Let me take the first half of your question and then I\u2019ll pass it on to Jeff for the second half of your question. So, with regard to VX-150 which is our NaV1.8 inhibitor that you pointed out we\u2019ve had now three out three successful studies in osteoarthritis in small fiber neuropathy as well as in bunionectomy. The reason that we are doing dose-ranging is really two very simple points. One is regulatory. Regulators expect us to do dose-ranging and really what they\u2019re looking for us to do is to find the lowest efficacious dose and so one is just a very practical point around the regulators. The second point is around just a drug development. What we did in order to get a proof of mechanism read-out is we chose a high dose. Now what we need to do is to figure out what is the exposure response relationship, of course, that has important implications for picking not only the lowest efficacious dose, but also what the dose will be which informs pill size and that informs COGS and other such things. So that\u2019s really what we\u2019re doing. I do want to let you know that the update on that one is that the Phase 2b is now fully enrolled. So, we\u2019re going to be in a good spot to understand all of those pieces of information in the near future.","Jeff Leiden","And maybe I\u2019ll take the second part. The question is really a commercial strategy question, I think. As I said before, we don\u2019t think of pain as a single commercial market. We think of it as multiple markets, as an example acute pain, which is essentially post-surgical, post procedural pain, mostly in hospitals, outpatient surgery centers or dentist office is in itself a multi-billion dollar opportunity, typically you\u2019d like to have both NaV and an oral form of a new LNG like in that market. That\u2019s very much a specialty market because we can address large parts of that market ourselves and it would be our plan assuming we have the data supports it to pursue development and commercialization of that market ourselves, small fiber neuropathy, similarly a market that\u2019s typically in a set of pain specialists offices. It\u2019s a market that can be addressed as a specialty market and it\u2019s one that again with appropriate data, we feel that we could develop and commercialize ourselves. You know very, very different from the chronic inflammatory pain that\u2019s OA, low back pain et cetera, that\u2019s predominantly a primary care market. And then from our perspective, it\u2019s not a market that we would want to build a commercial presence and develop and that\u2019s one where you might see us go with the partner. We have had a fair amount of interest as you might imagine given due to, first, we won the class of analgesics from partners who have a lot of experience in these community pain markets. Does that answer your question about our commercial strategy?","Paul Matteis","Yes. It does. Thank you very much.","Jeff Leiden","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Terence Flynn","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering, if you can at all help us quantify the impact of improved persistence on SYMDEKO relative to ORKAMBI. And maybe how this compares to KALYDECO recognizing you have a lot more data on KALYDECO now, I think even now 5 years plus? Thank you.","Stuart Arbuckle","Yes, Terence, without getting into the exact specifics and kind of the exact numbers because these things fluctuate over time and obviously SYMDEKO were 12 months into the launch, ORKAMBI is a lot longer, KALYDECO is more like 6 years. But certainly, the persistence we\u2019ve seen on SYMDEKO is as we anticipated higher than we saw with ORKAMBI, it\u2019s not quite at the level that we saw with KALYDECO, which were the highest personally I\u2019ve ever seen for any mentioned in the many years I\u2019ve been doing this, so it\u2019s somewhere between ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, but SYMDEKO certainly is above ORKAMBI.","Terence Flynn","Okay. And then any more details you can give us on the patient mix for SYMDEKO and if you guys seen any warehousing in the U.S. ahead of the triple combo potential launch? Thanks.","Jeff Leiden","So, in terms of the uptake, we\u2019ve actually seen broader uptake for SYMDEKO across all of the patient groups that you would expect. It\u2019s been taken up rapidly in naive patients, patients who\u2019ve never been on ORKAMBI, those who were discontinued from ORKAMBI, and then we\u2019ve also seen a fair number of patients switch from either ORKAMBI to KALYDECO. So, we\u2019ve really seen uptake broadly across all of the eligible patient populations.","Terence Flynn","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas of Citi. Your line is now open.","Robyn Karnauskas","Hi. Thank you guys for taking my questions. So actually, so first of all, for switching to SYMDEKO, what are you learning about ORKAMBI patients or KALYDECO patients that are switching on the SYMDEKO given that there is longer part like the SYMDEKO and the triple going forward, are you seeing switching in mind with these patients, do you think it\u2019ll be captive to point? Second question is just a follow-up and a [indiscernible] question. It seems like a change from JPMorgan that you might look externally for a pipeline asset, if you remember at JPMorgan, you discussed looking more for a platform to develop your \u2013 to get the science and help make [ph] drug. Are you just seeing something in the market, are things looking cheaper, what might have changed or how are you thinking about it differently? Thanks.","Stuart Arbuckle","Hey, Robyn, it\u2019s Stuart here. I\u2019ll take the first question and then Jeff can take the pipeline next to your innovation question. So, in terms of what we\u2019re seeing with patients who switch from KALYDECO to SYMDEKO or ORKAMBI to SYMDEKO, I mean, generally we\u2019re seeing those patients have a great experience. We aren\u2019t seeing many of those patients either discontinue or kind of go back to their original medication. As you know from the data or in the RF population, we saw [indiscernible] add substantial clinical benefit on top of either capital, and so that\u2019s I think is what\u2019s driving the majority of people who are making that transition. Obviously, with SYMDEKO and ORKAMBI, we don\u2019t have as much in the way of direct comparative data, but I think it\u2019s the overall benefit risk profile of SYMDEKO that I think people are finding attractive and that transition is going in line with our expectations. And then in terms of the external innovation, I\u2019ll hand that back to Jeff.","Jeff Leiden","Hey Robyn, it\u2019s Jeff. Maybe just one other point on your question to Stuart about the switching, because obviously this is relevant as well to the triples, and just going to depend on the data and the label and lots of other things. But I do think the strategy here is to continue to provide better and better medicines for more and more patients, including the patients who are not on drugs. And so assuming that the data that we\u2019re seeing now with 659, which is significantly better as you know than SYMDEKO even in performance valuation, we do expect over the long-term the vast majority of these patients will switch over to triple. So that\u2019s just a sort of sideline for the future. With respect to the pipeline and the BD strategy, I apologize if I miscommunicated that to you JPMorgan obviously did our strategy is the same all along. So, the three buckets of CF as you point out technology and tools and certainly, we\u2019ve done a lot of those deals and we\u2019ll continue to do them. But we\u2019ve always been interested in early stage pipeline assets that meet our strategy meaning they\u2019re potentially transformative drugs for serious diseases. As you know, they\u2019re not that easy to find. But we continue to look for them and certainly if we find them in diseases register then you should expect us to see to do in licensing or acquisition deals on those early stage assets.","Robyn Karnauskas","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Brian Abraham","Hi. Thanks very much for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on the contribution of uptake in 2 to 5-year-olds to ORKAMBI revenues maybe relative to background the background dynamic of adult switching to SYMDEKO. And then separately on the triple, as you get more data in hand, I am curious what type of translational or maybe educational work you\u2019ll need to do to bridge the shorter term functional benefits from Phase 3 to the long term outcomes that you\u2019ve seen with other treatments like KALYDECO that have been dosed over the course of years and whether you\u2019ve had any preliminary pay or discussions or feedback on that front? Thanks.","Stuart Arbuckle","So, Brian I will take the first question on ORKAMBI, so we have seen a strong uptake with ORKAMBI in the two to five-year old patient groups and as you might imagine that kind of helps to lead to a very strong quarter for ORKAMBI and if you like kind of compensate for the fact that there are a number of patients who are switching from ORKAMBI to SYMDEKO as you know because of these dynamics with patient populations and the same medicines being approved and in those same patient populations that\u2019s why we\u2019ve really gone to getting triple CF product guidance now because it\u2019s hard to be specific about each and every one of these patient population and exactly how many people are going to be on each medicine and so that\u2019s why we\u2019ve gone to triple CF revenues now. And then in terms of the triple data all that I will hand it over to Reshma.","Reshma Kewalramani","Sure. So with regard to triple combination, as you know the primary endpoint in both the 445 and 659 programs for the FX studies or ppFEV1 have four weeks and in the FMS study, it\u2019s the interim analysis at 4 weeks ppFEV1. Now it\u2019s very interesting in that is the reason we decided to go forward with a ppFEV1 in four weeks is because, as you can imagine, we have a treasure trove of data looking at ppFEV1 over time through our KALYDECO experience, ORKAMBI, and SYMDEKO, and what you see is that there is a very consistent relationship with what you see with CFTR modulators at week four and what you see later on for example at week 24 or week 52. And so I think that relationship is actually reasonably well understood amongst physicians as well as patients. The other interesting thing to note is of course in the SMS studies for both 659 and 445, we\u2019re going to have the 24-week ppFEV1, so we can start to do some analysis of rate of decline and such. And we are also going to have pulmonary exacerbations, BMI, CFTR. So, it\u2019s actually quite a bit of data that\u2019s coming and I\u2019ve been very impressed with how well the studies have been understood by the community, not just the physicians but the patients as well.","Brian Abraham","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Matthew Harrison","Great. Thanks very much. I guess Paul I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the operating margin progression. You\u2019ve obviously moved up 7 or 8 points this year. How should we think about that relative to the revenue growth you\u2019re talking about in 2019 and beyond thanks very much?","Jeff Leiden","Yes, I highlight. It\u2019s Jeff actually. Maybe I will take a little more of a strategic question since we\u2019ve given you the guidance for 2019. So, as we look forward and that as you\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years there\u2019s a pretty consistent trends here of growing revenues considerably faster than operating expenses, which obviously results in operating margin expansion and increases in operating income. And I think as Paul mentioned as we look forward to next year, we expect to see our current guidance of 15% top line revenue growth, but a 21% growth in operating margin reflecting exactly the same pattern going forward in 2019. Obviously, as we get to triples, that only accelerates because revenue grows even faster after the triple launches and operating expenses. We have maintained a pretty disciplined approach. So, I think if you think about this long term, without giving you long term guidance, you should think about continued operating margin expansion and operating income increases, which also results in the cash flows, that Paul mentioned, does that give you enough detail on sort of how we think that going forward.","Matthew Harrison","Yes, that\u2019s very helpful. And then if I can just ask one pop. I mean other people have asked about ex-U.S. reimbursement on the call. I was wondering if you could just specifically address some of the news around compulsory with licensing in some active countries and what you see as the path forward there the likelihood of anything happening there?","Stuart Arbuckle","Yes, Matthew. It\u2019s Stuart here. I mean the compulsory license issue is probably most recently been discussed in the UK yesterday. There was a debate on crown uses as they call it in the UK I think it\u2019s fair to say that the government itself in that debate recognized that this is a very complicated issue. It\u2019s not entirely a viable option for multiple reasons including that it\u2019s inconsistent with their desire to foster a vibrant life sciences ecosystem. We certainly agree with their perspective on that. I would say, we\u2019re not really focused or particularly concerned frankly about compulsory licensing what we\u2019re focused on is finding a solution in the short term for patients that provides access to ORKAMBI as soon as we can and our pipeline of future medicines as soon as they\u2019re approved.","Matthew Harrison","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Cory Kasimov","Hi, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about AAT and wondering if you can talk about the potential cadence of initial clinical data and what you might expect to learn from healthy volunteers. And then I realize this is putting in the cart before the horse a little here, but assuming the early clinical stage work goes well what might a registrational pathway for this indication potentially look like I\u2019m curious would you expect it to be biomarker outcome driven just trying to broadly understand what this program may encompass? Thanks.","Reshma Kewalramani","Sure. This is Reshma. Let me take those parts of that question. With regard to the cadence of the trial, so let me quantify this fairly small molecule approach that we are taking here, that similar extending those powered by multiple ascending dose that\u2019s going to be done in healthy volunteers and as soon as we get through that we\u2019re going to be ready to go into patients. The good news on this program is that it\u2019s going to be a reasonably efficient program I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s 30, 40 people but a reasonably efficient program for us to be able to see whether our molecules going to have the intended effect, which is elevation in AAT level and in activity. This is a fairly standard readout and so we expect to have that in hand in the near future as soon as we get through our healthy volunteer studies. With regard to the registration path that we were early in here that, what I can tell you is that the existing therapies, which you know are [indiscernible] therapy so it\u2019s an infusion of the protein. Those were approved at about four of them available on the market and those were approved based on AAT levels. So that\u2019s one data point that you have to start with. We have to go through our conversations with regulators to see what the Phase 3 registration enabling end points are going to be here. But I do think that\u2019s an important data point to look at.","Cory Kasimov","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question from Hartaj Singh of Oppenheimer and Company. Your line is now open.","Hartaj Singh","Great. Thank you for my question. Just a question on the two triple X I know that in November you\u2019d also indicated you had 12-week data and 26-week data that 659 had gone through. Can you just give us an update as to how you report that the safety data also for both the projects as the efficacy readouts are coming up? Thank you.","Reshma Kewalramani","Sure. If I go back to our 659 release from late last year, I think that gives you a very good template for how you can expect to hear our share of the data for 445 which will be coming this quarter in terms of both safety and efficacy. So, on the efficacy side, you\u2019re going to hear us tell you about the ppFEV1 at four weeks from both the FX and the FMX trial. And with regard to safety, now on this one, we\u2019re going to give you the top line with regard to discontinuations overall tolerability. But we\u2019re going to be very, very thoughtful about maintaining study integrity and we\u2019re not going to go very far beyond that, just like you thought to do with 659.","Operator","Thank you.","Michael Partridge","Operator, we are now at the 1 hour mark. So, we will have time for one more question.","Operator","And our last question comes from Liisa Bayko of JMP Securities. Your line is now open.","Liisa Bayko","Hi. Well a lot of my question\u2019s been asked but I did want to ask about the triple and sort of if you could describe the patent life around the triple, that\u2019d be helpful. Thank you.","Stuart Arbuckle","Liisa, thank you so much for asking that. Since you get to that, so as you know, our plan is to co-formulate these into a single pill in which case the patent life around the medicine is actually determined by the longest patent life of the ingredients single ingredients. And in the case of the VX-659 and VX-445 which folks have pending pattern applications, the patent expiry if granted would be 2,037 in both the U.S. and Europe.","Liisa Bayko","And any extension of that or that would be a query that\u2019s it.","Stuart Arbuckle","By 2030 is there, I\u2019m going to be way too early to think about it. We\u2019re obviously, we\u2019re pleased with that pattern ways and we really can\u2019t speculate on any extensions at this point.","Liisa Bayko","Alright. Thanks very much. Congratulations on a good quarter.","Michael Partridge","Thanks, Lisa. Thank you for joining us tonight.

As a reminder, this call may be recorded.","I would now like introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Michael Partridge. You may begin.","Michael Partridge","Thank you operator and good evening everyone. Joining me on tonight\u2019s call are Dr. Jeff Leiden, Chairman and CEO, Dr. Peter Mueller, Head of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, Stuart Arbuckle, Chief Commercial Officer and Ian Smith, Chief Financial Officer.","Our agenda tonight is as follows: Jeff will begin with Vertex\u2019s strategy and key business priorities heading into 2013. After that, Peter will update our progress with our clinical development programs. Then Stuart will discuss INCIVEK and hepatitis C market trends and provide some commentary on the outlook for KALYDECO in the U.S. and Europe. And to close, Ian will review the fourth quarter and full 2012 results and our 2013 financial guidance.

These statements including without limitation those regarding the market launch of INCIVEK and KALYDECO, our development plans and expectations, and our guidance are based on management's current assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and events to differ materially.","GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this call. Information regarding our use of these measures and a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP is available in our fourth quarter 2012 financial Press Release, which is on our website. And I would also refer you to the information on Slide 5 of tonight's webcast.","Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Leiden","Thank you, Michael. Good evening. I had the opportunity to speak with many investors at the JPMorgan Conference earlier this month. What I spoke about then and what I\u2019d like to reiterate is that during the last two years, Vertex has undergone a rapid and profound evolution. We launched two transformative medicines at that time; one for people with hepatitis C and one for patients with cystic fibrosis. ","The successful launch of these medicines allowed us to significantly strengthen our financial position over this period. We finished 2012 with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and equivalents.","During the same period we also progressed multiple potential transformative medicines into late stage development and we are now poised to expand our presence in the importance of these areas of hepatitis c and CF.","Our evolution has positioned us with the future with a clear focus; using innovative science to develop new transformative medicines for people with serious diseases in specialty markets.","Let me now take a moment to discuss the four strategic priorities that we believe will enable us to achieve this goal. Priority one, we are focusing investment on key development programs on cystic fibrosis, hepatitis c and autoimmune diseases.","In cystic fibrosis, Vertex has a long term strategy just to provide benefit to as many CF patients as possible and to maximize the benefit for these patients with our approved and investigational medicines. KALYDECO has already approved for people with the G551 D mutation and CFTR gene. There are approximately 2000 such patients worldwide age six and older that we hope to treat.","In 2013, we are conducting multiple Phase 3 and other proof of concept label expansion studies of Ivacaftor monotherapy. Ivacaftor is the generic name for KALYDECO. If successful, these studies would allow us to treat up to 7000 patients worldwide with Ivacaftor.","We also expect to initiate a pivotal phase 3 development program this quarter for combination regimen of VX-809 and Ivacaftor and people with CF who have two copies of the Delta F508 mutation. These patients represented approximately 50% of the worldwide CF population or about 35,000 people.","In hepatitis c, our long term strategy is to develop simple all-oral regimens with durations of 12 weeks or less that provide a high viral cure rate. In 2013, we plan to conduct multiple phase 2 studies of 12 week all-oral treatment regimens that include our nucleotide analog VX-135. Our goal is to generate both safety and viral cure data in the second half of 2013 to support the start of pivotal development of one or more all-oral regimens in 2014.","In autoimmune diseases, our strategy is to maximize the value of our JAK3 inhibitor VX-509 across multiple autoimmune diseases globally. We continue to progress our phase 2 B study of VX-509 in people with rheumatoid arthritis and we have initiated a small phase 2 MRI study in RA as well and we expect data later this year. To broaden and accelerate the global development of VX-509, we will evaluate collaborative opportunities that could provide both funding and capabilities.","Priority number two, we will continue to invest in innovative research programs to support development of new specialty medicine for serious diseases. Vertex\u2019s research efforts are concentrated on additional advancements in CF and other genetic diseases, such as Huntington disease as well as serious diseases in specialty market such as progressive multiple sclerosis and cancer. Innovative research is what creates our transformative medicines and we will continue to support these productive efforts.","Priority three, we plan to maximize revenues and cash flow from our marketed products INCIVEK and KALYDECO. In particular we see the potential for increase uptake of KALYDECO for patients in Europe and other countries outside the U.S. And finally priority four, maintaining our financial strength to support future long term growth and shareholder return. Ian will discuss this in a few moments.","There are important milestones in 2013 that will allow both you and us to measure our business progress. We described these milestones to you on January 7th and are showing here again on slide 7. In many ways these milestones position us to provide more certainty around the market opportunities for our clinical stage medicines throughout 2013.","In summary, as we enter 2013 we are executing on a clear strategy and set of goals and we look forward to keeping you informed of our progress throughout the year. I will now turn it over to Peter.","Peter Mueller","Thank you Jeff and good evening everyone. My comments this evening will focus on the priority development areas that we have identified for investment in 2013 those of cystic fibrosis, all-oral hepatitis C therapies, and autoimmune diseases.","Beginning with cystic fibrosis, we are pleased that both KALYDECO and the VX-809 plus Ivacaftor combination regimen received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA.","While the specific implications of this new designation are not yet clear, we are committed to working with regulators to explore novel and potentially more rapid development strategies for both the KALYDECO label expansion and VX-809 plus Ivacaftor combination regimens.","Finding the outcome of our discussions, we hope that this will enable us to reach more patients as soon as possible. Currently, we are working toward agreement with regulators on phase 3 trails signs for our combination regimen to treat CF patients, homozygous for the Delta-F508 CFTR mutation. We expect to complete these discussions and initiate a phase 3 program this quarter.","As for the KALYDECO label expansion studies, all of these trials are currently ongoing and we anticipate having the first data from these trials in the second half of 2013. Vertex expects to discuss with the FFDA and European Regularity Authorities any potential implications of breakthrough therapy designation on the timing and content of regulatory submissions in the U.S. and EMEA to support the expansion of the KALYDECO label.","Also in CF we are on track to report data from the VX-661 plus Ivacaftor Phase 2 combination study in 508 homozygous patients. We plan to report safety and efficacy data from this trial including FEV 1 and sweat chloride on each of four cohorts in the first half of this year.","Turning now to hepatitis C, in the first half of 2013 we expect to get three 12 week Phase 2 studies underway, VF 135 in combination with ribavirin, VX-135 in combination with GSK's NS5A inhibitor GSK 805 and VX-135 in combination with the protease inhibitor TMC 435.","We expect to have 12 week safety and first SVR data from these regimens in the second half of 2013 and our goal is to choose one or more regimens to move into pivotal development in 2014.","Now moving to our immune diseases and our selective check 3 inhibitor VX 509. We expect to have data from the Phase 2B study in rheumatoid arthritis in the second half of 2013. Additionally we recently initiated a 40 patient MRI study to evaluate the potential for VX-509 to improve joint health and structure in rheumatoid arthritis patients. We also expect results from this trial in the second half of 2013.","Finally I note that we are in the process of analyzing and reviewing the VX 787 data from our Phase 2 challenge study in influenza and we expect to report the results in the coming weeks.","In summary, our clinical pipeline is advancing its plans and I really look forward to updating you as we progress, I will now turn over to Stuart.","Stuart Arbuckle","Good evening everyone. Tonight I'd like to give you some background on our performance with INCIVEK and KALYDECO in 2012 and what we foresee as we head into 2013.","In hepatitis C, we remain the market leader with approximately three out of four new patients in the U.S. initiating therapy with INCIVEK, a measure unchanged since launch.","As we've said previously, in 2012 we saw treatment rates change in anticipation of the potential for new more convenient regimens that may treat hepatitis C. This led to a reduced number of HCV patients initiating treatment, beginning in the second quarter and continuing through the, rest of 2012. As a result of these dynamics INCIVEK revenues in 2012 were $1.16 billion, with $223 million of revenues in the fourth quarter.","In 2013 we anticipate maintaining our market leading position. However, we do expect a further decline in patients initiating treatment. We expect continued demand for INCIVEK for motivated patients who don\u2019t want to wait for treatment, as well as patients who are too advanced with their disease and can't wait for treatment. Therefore we expect INCIVEK will continue to be an important revenue contributor to our total revenues in 2013.","In the EU and other areas outside the U.S., the use of INCIVO to treat hepatitis C patients increased in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter 2012, resulting in an increased royalty to Vertex.","INCIVO is now available in 40 countries, and we expect modest growth in the INCIVO royalty in 2013, resulting from the expansion of INCIVO into new geographies and a slow anticipated rate of patient warehousing in advance of potential new therapies compared to that in the U.S.","Now turning to KALYDECO; we achieved a $172 million in revenues for KALYDECO in 2012 following the U.S. launch in February. Specifically in Q4, total revenues were $58.6 million, with a majority of those revenues derived from the U.S. We are treating the vast majority of G551D patients aged six and older in the U.S. and we expect to maintain the level of our current U.S. quarterly revenues.","We anticipate growth of KALYDECO in 2013 will come from Europe, beginning in the second quarter as a result of the previously announced access and reimbursement decisions from Scotland and England.","Reimbursement discussions are progressing well in the other markets, and we expect to have completed them across the major EU markets, that is the UK, Ireland, Germany and France in 2013. Combined, these markets represent approximately 80% of the G551D population in Europe.","In summary, I am pleased with the performance of the commercial organization in 2012 and as we begin 2013, we have two important medicines for patients that contribute significant revenues for our company. ","With that I will turn it over to Ian.","Ian Smith","","Thanks Stuart and good evening to everyone. Tonight I would like to discuss our financial position and the strategies that support funds for 2013; specifically, our focus on 2013 financial guidance and the basis for such guidance. A detailed discussion our 2012 financial results was provided in the press release we issued earlier today and I\u2019m happy address any aspect of those results during Q&A.","Firstly to our financial position how we may expect to progress through 2013? As Jeff mentioned, INCIVEK is been incredibly successful for Vertex, generating more than $2 billion of revenue since launch and we expect it to continue to contribute significant revenues in 2013.","We expect INCIVEK revenues, combined with the expected growth in KALYDECO revenues and other revenue sources will enable us to complete 2013 in a strong financial position, while also supporting investment into the company.","This investment will provide important data throughout 2013 to guide our future business opportunities. We are in an investment period for our business and we expect to return to revenue in earnings growth based on the successful advancement of our life state medicines.","Now, for the 2013 financial guidance and the basis for such guidance. We expect 2013 total revenues to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.25 billion. These revenues will enable investment into our business while maintaining our strong financial position.","Our 2013 non-GAAP operating expenses will be in the range of $1.09 billion to $1.15 billion and principally consist on our R&D and SG&A expenses. Our non-GAAP OpEx guidance excludes cost of revenues, charges to stock base compensation and expenses related to accounting for our Alios collaboration. ","Now for the components about total revenue guidance. We expect growth wide KALYDECO revenues to be in the range of $280 million to $320 million. These projected revenues are based on maintaining our currently, quarterly revenue rates of approximately $50 million in the U.S and EU revenues that would grow in 2013.","The two main factors that will impact growth are one, the time to complete reimbursement negotiation processes with each of the remaining major European countries Germany, Ireland, France and rest of the UK and two, the rate of adoption by G551D patients outside of the U.S.","Because of this the growth will likely not be lineal. We anticipate that the first quarter 2013 KALYDECO revenues will be similar to that of the fourth quarter 2012 and that growth in revenues should commence in the second quarter of 2013.","For combination in INCIVEK revenues, INCIVO royalties and collaborative and other royalty revenues, we expect a of range revenues of $820 million to $930 million. We anticipate significant revenues from INCIVEK, although we do expect the continuing decline in the HCV patient treatment rates and reduced quarterly revenues, compared to $223 million in Q4 2012.","With respect to INCIVO royalties, in Q4 2012 we realized $36.8 million of royalties, compared to a third quarter of $20 million of royalties and we expect INCIVO royalty to show modest growth in 2013, compared to a $118 million in 2012, consistent with the reasons mentioned earlier.","Finally, we have collaborated other royalty revenues in 2012 of $76 million and we anticipate a similar level in 2013. These revenue assumptions are based on existing relationships and do not include any potential collaborative and other royalty revenues. To reiterate, we are providing 2013 total revenue guidance of $1.1 billion to $1.25 billion. ","Now to the operating expenses, we are providing 2013, non-GAAP operating expenses, guidance of $1.09 billion to $1.15 billion. The operating expense will vary quarter-to-quarter; however we anticipate that the first quarter 2013 will be similar to that to the fourth quarter 2012, given the timing and initiation of planned clinical trial and certain marketing expenses as well as the realization of identified cost reductions.","The main components of our operating expense are R&D and SG&A expenses and our 2013 guidance for these expenses is $750 million to $790 million and $340 million to $360 million respectively.","I'd now like to take a few moments to provide a better understanding of this R&D investment. Essentially something to do in three categories. First, we plan to invest approximately $200 million in basic research to support the creation of future medicines. This is consistent with our 2012 levels.","Second, we expect to spend between $400 million and $440 million on life stage development programs. Over 80% of this development amount is in to support cystic fibrosis and Hepatitis C and also includes significant supply chain investments to protect commercial supply for the potential clinical success of the X-809. ","And finally, we expect to spend approximately a $150 million on the variety of essential activities and obligations relating to our commercial products. These include safety, pharmacovigilance, medical affairs, quality and post-marketing commitments for INCIVEK and KALYDECO.","Turning now to 2013 SG&A guidance of $340 million to $360 million; we are anticipating a reduction in SG&A compared with the $390 million in 2012. This is a result of reduced U.S. marketing expenses for INCIVEK and KALYDECO and a broad review of our business while we made cost reductions for which we expect to see the full effect in 2013.","In summary, we are committed to managing our operating expense at a level to 2012, while increasing our R&D investment to support our late-stage medicines and reducing our SG&A expenses.","We believe our 2013 guidance reflects our ability to maintain financial strength while we continue to invest in our pipeline of medicines to drive future growth. We are carefully balancing these prioritize.","With that, I\u2019ll ask the operator to please open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator instructions). Our first question is from Geoffrey Porges, of Bernstein. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Porges - Bernstein","So just a follow up on Peter\u2019s comments about the CF combination programs, could you confirm that the 400 mg BID information has been provided to the FDA and that you are just waiting for them to come back before starting at phase 3 and then, and by implication that you have applied to add that on to the study. And then secondly on 661 you have mentioned the Cohort 3. Could you give us a little bit more color on where you are in the recruitment of the Cohorts, specifically as the first 120 patients being recruited and being studied at the 28 days of the end of the treatment so that you are starting to get that PK\/PD data in now?","Bob Kauffman","So Jeff, this is Bob. I will take the first part of the question and if you remember the Cohort 3 was designed really to provide PK\/PD data to fit into our PK\/PD model as well as safety data at the dose level of 400 mg BID. Data has been provided to the FDA along with our plan for the phase 3 program and yes we\u2019re in active discussions with them at this point to finalize that program and obviously we will provide further feedback once we get that information.","Geoffrey Porges - Bernstein","And 661?","Bob Kauffman","With respect to 661, yes the study is well along and recruited and we are waiting for the data to come in and as we said before, we will be providing for that study in the first half of the year.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is from Geoff Meacham of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Geoff Meacham - JPMorgan","","So for the KALYDECO, the ongoing monotherapy trial, can you give us any updates you have on the enrollment status for the different studies and then maybe speak to the review timeline, given your interpretation for the breakthrough designation? I have one follow up?","Bob Kauffman","","This is a Bob. I\u2019ll maybe take the last part first. Yes, obviously we have breakthrough designation although we are working with the FDA now to determine exactly what impact that will have on those programs and with respect to the review time, I can\u2019t really give you any further update at this point. Those discussions are ongoing. The studies are moving along very well. Particularly the mutations, other gating mutations aside from G551D is fully enrolled and moving along, R117H doing very well as well, and the N1 (ph) study again also doing well. So, no issues with recruitment.","Geoff Meacham - JPMorgan","And then for KALYDECO commercially in Europe, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible to get a little bit more granular with kind of what you think the pace of reimbursement discussions will be. That will be helpful, but maybe you could also address other region such as Australia that may be also similar to the review cycle and maybe any other sort of gaining factors that you feel like, when it comes your European reimbursement that you can give us some clarity on the next quarter.","Stuart Arbuckle","","Sure Geoff. It\u2019s Stuart. So, I have to say we are pleased with the speed with which the discussions have gone and frankly I\u2019m delighted that, already we are able to come to a satisfactory and positive conclusion with England and as we said, we\u2019re expecting that to really pick up from Q2.","As you\u2019ll know, in Scotland they created a special orphan drug fund and have said that all patients with G551D mutation in Scotland will be eligible for that fund which begins in March. And all I can really tell you about the other discussions is that they are very active. They are ongoing, they are very productive.","Nobody has any doubts about the clinical benefit that KALYDECO brings and we\u2019re working as quickly as we can to bring them to a successful conclusion across the major markets in Europe.","In terms of Australia, we filed and we\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019ll see an approval but the product this year, as you know the process for reimbursement in Australia is as rigorous and lengthy as anywhere else the rest of the world and I wouldn\u2019t necessarily be optimistic that we\u2019ll be able to conclude that within 2013.","Bob Kauffman","And Geoff, let me just add in to Stuart\u2019s comment with in my prepared remarks, how this translates to revenue expectation in 2013, I do want reiterate that we anticipate in Q1 the KALYDECO revenues to be similar to that of Q4 2012 and based on Stuart\u2019s outlining of the timing of approval for reimbursements in these markets and specifically those four major markets in Europe, we would anticipate growth starting to be seen the second quarter of 2013.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Schoenebaum of ISI Group. Your line is open.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI group","First one is, why would the FDA not allow you to include the 400 mg BID dose in a pivotal trial hypothetically; and number two, what should our investor expectations be for 661 trial? Small number of patients, no run in, should we be expecting that to be changed or not in your opinion?","Jeff Leiden","Thanks Mark. I\u2019ll have Bob answer the first question and as you talked about investor expectations, always want to set expectations, but I will take the second question.","Bob Kauffman","So for the first one, we\u2019ve submitted data to them and we\u2019re in discussions; I can\u2019t comment on the nature of those discussions, but obviously in every case they will be looking at the data we sent in to verify for themselves that they believe the risk benefit is favorable for the inclusion of that dose and I think we\u2019ll see how that goes.","Jeff Leiden","And Mark to your second question, so the VX-661 study in combination with KALYDECO or Ivacaftor is it is a different study design than the VX-809 and Ivacaftor study and so give me an opportunity just to describe the study design with them, in terms of what that means of (inaudible). It is a dose escalation study, so low-dose monotherapy moves into that low-dose combination therapy and then as you move through that you move into higher doses monotherapy and then in combination therapy. It is sequential dose escalating study.","We are moving through it, as Bob mentioned earlier and we would anticipate in the first half of this year providing you a topline result of that FEV, sweat chloride and safety and so we look forward to providing that data at a later point in time.","Peter Mueller","The only comment I want to make on top of that is, it is a different set of patients in the monotherapy versus in the combo and it's not like what it was in 809. So there's no lead in phase or any of those things going on.","","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI group","Is that a risk Peter, and then I'll drop off; that there is no lead in phase or am I over thinking it, thanks.","Peter Mueller","No, there's no risk as much as we can see it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rachel McMinn of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Rachel McMinn - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just, I guess to go back to the question that's been asked a couple of times on the high dose of VX-809 inclusion in the Phase 3, do you view that as a potential sticking point in the conversations or is really focused on the actual end points. I think you guys have talked about the potential to have a six months efficacy end point as opposed to 12 months.","And then just separately on KALYDECO 4Q sales, was all of the gross in the fourth quarter Europe, so U.S. was flat, so I just want to make sure I understand that. And then finally can you just give us a little bit more color on your 135 ribavirin study. It says in clinical trials you're enrolling 150 patients as a target but I think you've talked about initially being a much smaller cohort. So I wanted to get a sense of how many patients are really being enrolled initially in that study.","Bob Kauffman","This is Bob. I'll take the first and the third and I'll leave the middle for Ian. So in terms of the 809-770 combo trial, no, we don't see any sticking points here and I think the only thing I\u2019ll say about some of the other points you mentioned is that obviously we have breakthrough status for this program as well, and clearly the discussions we're having with the FDA may be colored by the discussions regarding breakthrough status and what impact that might have on the study. Right now I just don't have anything to report about that so I think I'll just have to leave it that way.","And for the third point about the 135 and ribavirin, yes the study is, we have a clear way forward to begin that trial. We have been asked to go slowly with some exploratory number of patients, initially with very careful monitoring. We\u2019ve included the monitoring in the protocol and we're about to get that underway.","The exact patients numbers yes, I know what's listed there, we'll be going a little bit slowly to begin with and then we expect that that will accelerate once we have some initial data and we are quite cognizant of the need for safety data in that program to progress into Phase 3 and so we\u2019ll be looking at that very carefully as we go along.","Ian Smith","And on KALYDECO, Rachel, yes the majority of the growth between Q4 and Q3 was a result of Europe as we said on the Q3 call. Back then we had already had the vast majority of G551D patients in the U.S. who were already being treated. We added a few through Q4 as they rolled off some of the long terms extension studies and things like that. But the vast majority of the growth Q4 was due to Europe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets","","On the Cohort 3 of the combo study, can you perhaps describe qualitatively what you were looking for in your PK\/PD analysis, and whether today these are that generally supported what you were looking for? And then on 661, I know you sort of described the design of the study, but what is your stopping criteria? How do you define when you would actually stop and report results? Thanks.","Bob Kauffman","So in terms of Cohort 3, we have a PK\/PD model for the combination and really what we are looking for is consistency with the model and we always look for whether we are getting more bank for the bug with higher doses and that\u2019s really part of the assessment. And actually I would say that is the same philosophy regarding the stopping criteria in the 661 trial.","Again, we always look for PK\/PD relationship, whether we are getting plateauing of the PK and PD responses and obviously safety factors into the decision about whether they continue to dose escalate or not. So it\u2019s just a combination of things. It\u2019s pretty hard to give a hard and fast rule.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Lisa Bayko of JMP Securities, your line is open.","Lisa Bayko - JMP Securities","","Can you give us a little more color, this may have been asked already, but just on the discussions, let\u2019s say in the key European countries, France, Spain, Italy; just it\u2019s really important for timing and modeling, kind of where we might expect those to roll out.","Jeff Leiden","Yes, so with France, I will say the discussions are ongoing, and our next important time point with them is likely to be around February, is when they said that they would get back to us and they have been public about that being the date when they would kind of next have reached a decision.","In Italy, Italy really isn\u2019t a major market for patients with G551D. So, I won\u2019t comment more on that and in Germany, the product is available currently and is reimbursed and we\u2019re in discussions as is the normal cost of things in Germany to establish the kind of ongoing price that the product will be reimbursed at. Those discussions are ongoing. Again tough to predict exactly when they\u2019ll come to a conclusion.","So, I wish I could be more precise but just the nature of these things is that they are difficult to predict in any event. I think they are particularly difficult when you\u2019re dealing with such a breakthrough medicine where they have a real desire to try and get them available for their patient and so it\u2019s just tough be to be most specific, I\u2019m afraid. ","Bob Kauffman","Lisa, it\u2019s something that sometimes happens and recite a discussions with investors that ask me about this expectation, it helps to frame the market for people. It\u2019s not always clearly understood but approximately 80% of the G551D patients in Europe are actually in France, Germany and UK and Ireland and then 80% of that 80% is actually in UK and Ireland. So, as you try and triangulate the timing in let\u2019s say the revenues, that might give you a little more understanding but to this point, we\u2019re engaged in discussions with all those countries. ","Lisa Bayko - JMP Securities"," ","Okay. And then just anymore granularity on, I know you had some push back with pricing but there has been some fund set aside with the other regions within in the UK. When might we expect to start seeing revenue there? ","Bob Kauffman"," ","Well, in terms of revenue from England and Scotland, Scotland they\u2019ve set aside a separate fund. In England they\u2019ve agreed to reimburse it. We expect to see commercial sales in England from Q2 and the Scottish fund is supposedly open from March 1st.","So really as Ian said, we were expecting Q1 to be similar to Q4 and then Q2 is when we\u2019d expect the growth really to pick as patients get broader access and reimbursement in those major markets like England and Scotland. ","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is from Yaron Werber of Citi. Your line is open. ","Yaron Werber - Citi","One, just to follow up on Lisa, and so Stuart, just to clarify, in Germany you said that you\u2019re still negotiating the price to a certain degree but as you said the product is available and it is being used. So I'm just trying to get a sense, are you recording most of the revenues in Germany with potential reserve against potential discounts in the future or how do we think about that?","And then, second, and I just hate to bring this up, I just want to be clear. In terms of your communication on the combination data, this quarter on the combo of the KALYDECO and 809, the height of the 400 milligram BID, are you going to show us the full efficacy data, once you communicate whether you've taken that into Phase 3 or is that something that would be communicated in the future after Q1?","Stuart Arbuckle","On the question on Germany, so yes Germany has essentially a two-step process. So products are reimbursed almost immediately following their approval and yes we are recording commercial sales in Germany already.","And then in parallel to the product being available as is the standard part of the process in Germany, you then negotiate the price that the product will be reimbursed at on an ongoing basis. So, we are in that kind of path of that second part of the process currently. And then on the combo data, I'll pass that off to Ian to answer.","Ian Smith ","Yes, and Yaron, thanks for the question. Again it gives us chance to continue to clarify and to expect this data disclosure. So, as we said in the past, we\u2019re currently in discussions with the FDA regarding the protocol design for our Phase-3 with Ivacaftor combination with 809 and that discussion is now under the umbrella of breakthrough designation. So we\u2019re still engaged in those discussions.","Once those conclude and we have a clear line of sight for that Phase 3 protocol, we will find out whether the 400 BID dosing of 809 is included as they dose on in Phase 3. Consistent with that disclosure we will provide the basis for the inclusion in the Phase 3 protocol, or as non-inclusion and so that's the point we would expect.","Now the basis for that disclosure would be based on the basis that we find that it is included or not included within that protocol, and so we look forward to clarifying all of that in the first quarter. As we've announced we expect to initiate this Phase 3 study in the first quarter of this year.","Jeff Leiden","Yaron, this is Jeff. Maybe one comment on Germany just to make sure that you are thinking of it the way we are, Stuart said we are reimbursed at this point in the final pricing discussions but during that first year when those negotiations were going on, there is not full uptake nor do we expect full and rapid uptake in Germany. There tends to be a much slower uptake until formal reimbursement is obtained and so just want to make sure that you are thinking of Germany as something that clearly is not fully penetrated at this point and will continue to grow when and if we get reimbursements.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank","I guess for 661, so will the part A data that you are going to release the first half of this year, give you enough information to have a sense of whether or not you are going to take product forward or do really need to see the part B and C to give you greater comfort and then also regarding Ireland, like what gives you confidence seeking the reimbursement. Is it just a pharmacoeconomic question or is it really a price negotiations at this point?","Jeff Leiden","So Peter will take the first question.","Bob Kauffman","And then Stuart to follow up.","Peter Mueller","Yes, so in terms of the value of 661 and our decision to move it forward, the study part A would basically give us enough confidence to make a decision whether we move forward or not. I want to just reiterate at one point in time, there is another discussion any longer whether we exchange 809 to 661. 661 is a separate molecule and if we decide so has a different base for future regimens like combination regimen with auto correctors and 809 is basically on its own on a fast track moving forward.","Stuart Arbuckle","And on Ireland, I guess the first thing I would say is whilst the past is not necessarily a perfect predictor of the future, I would say the success we have already had with gaining access and reimbursement for KALYDECO gives me a lot of confidence that we\u2019ll reach a successful conclusion in Ireland and in addition to that, as I say, the discussions are ongoing, they are going well.","There is clearly a high level of unmet need in Ireland. It has the highest incidents of G551D mutation in the world and so there is a desire on both sides to reach an amicable solution and I am optimistic that we will do so.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs","I was just wondering in terms of, I guess that first on the CF combo program, if you can provide us with any insight on how you are thinking about six months versus 12 month end point with respect to exacerbations. So it seems to me like there is a focus on 12 months for the exacerbation data. So, I was wondering if that\u2019s in line with your thinking.","And then on 661, was wondering in terms of the dose escalation, if you could maybe just provide us with some additional details on how and who made the decision to stop at the dose you decided to stop on and if you think that\u2019s enough or if you think there is a possibility that maybe you have to go back and use some further dose exploration work, how you did with 809.","Bob Kauffman","","This is Bob. Maybe I will do the second one first and the team has made a decision about the dose escalation all the way through the trial and that who is empowered to do that. That\u2019s all I can really say about that one.","In terms of the 809-770 combo trial, I really can\u2019t comment on durations at this point. I think that\u2019s still a topic of discussion. Again, largely and part of our breakthrough designation discussion with FDA. All the endpoints that you measured are certainly ones that are interest to us. They all are very important ones and they are all going to be included in the trial but the durations I think are not at all settled at this point.","Operator","","Thank you our next question is from Matt Roden of UBS. Your line is open.","Matt Roden - UBS","So just going back to the 400 milligram BID dose, Bob you mentioned the PK\/PD models that you\u2019ll be comparing the data against and can you help us with what your bar is for inclusion in the phase 3. In other words does it have to be better than the 600 milligram QD dose or could it be similar and justify inclusion in phase 3,","I guess what I am trying to get to is would you caution us against drawing conclusions about what the data implies simply by its inclusion or exclusion from the phase 3. And then secondly just real quick, can you update us on how you plan to address the Delta F508 patient population, I haven\u2019t heard about that in a while.","Bob Kauffman","","So to answer the first part of your question, it\u2019s just a complicated equation about how one factors in all the pieces here. Remember that the Cohort is relatively small.","The PK\/PD data tend to be more powerful than just estimates of the effects that are seen in the small study and we are really looking for consistency within RO (ph) and that will determine whether we go forward or not. Clearly the safety piece of it was also a factor and all that was provided to FDA and we are looking forward to completing those discussions.","","Jeff Leiden","","And Matt, as we have said before, this isn\u2019t only about an increased overall dose. This is Jeff. Importantly the BID dose potentially changes both D-Min and C-Max (ph) and we are learning a lot of what the effects of C-Min and C-Max (ph) may be on efficacy as well. So as Bob said it\u2019s more complicated than simply a higher dose.","It\u2019s really how that dose is distributed and what exposures are both at C-Min and C-Max (ph) and that\u2019s why it was so important to confirm the PK\/PD model.","Peter Mueller","And in terms of the heterozygous, I think those two comments will be made number one. I think we anticipate that we have basically include some heterozygous in our Phase 3 program from a safety point of view. So we will explore basically the combination there. And the other thing is, as we go forward with the dual corrector and other programs, that basically the main route that we try to explore value for patients of that category.","Operator","Our next question is from Ying Huang of Barclays. Your line is open.","Christine Huang - Barclays","This is Christine Huang on behalf of Ying Huang. First I had a question about whether the decision has been made to include the VX-809 monotherapy arm in the Phase 3 trials and secondly on VX-661, also wanted to drill a bit further on the stopping criteria. Did you see any of those being for toxicity or have you seen satisfactory long function improvement to stop the dose escalation. And lastly on VX-135, have you conducted any preclinical test to rule out cardiovascular tox?","Bob Kauffman","Okay so let\u2019s see, I\u2019ll take the last one first and yes that as part of our standard battery of testing we always do cardiovascular evaluations and they were satisfactory to move the molecules forward.","For 661, it\u2019s an ongoing study and I just can\u2019t really comment on the findings or where the criteria for stopping or not stopping in that trial. When we report the results you will really see how we came out. And in terms of an 809 monotherapy arm, again I\u2019m not able to comment on that until we complete our discussions with the FDA.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question from David Friedman of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Sara Slifka - Morgan Stanley","","Hi this is Sarah calling for Dave. On a slightly different topic, just had a quick question about the upcoming flu data. Can you give us a sense of what information we could expect in the press release and I think the initial guidance release data was actually 4Q. So if you could talk about what\u2019s causing the delay?","Bob Kauffman","In terms of the delay really, the recruitment went on little longer than we thought. There was also little bit delay in some of the bioanalytic work that supports that trial, particularly some of viral titer work which is very extensive and just took a longer than we thought. Can you repeat the first part of the question?","Sara Slifka - Morgan Stanley","Yes, what you should expect in the press release.","Jeff Leiden","Yes, I think we've talked about this once before, but clearly, the primary end points that we're interested in are the antiviral effect, measured by virus excretion and also clinical symptomatology, as well as the safety of the molecules. I think those are the three key pieces that you'll be looking for.","Operator","Thank you, our next question's from Brian Abrahams of Wells Fargo, your line is open.","Brian Abrahams - Wells Fargo","A question on 135, obviously one of the last nukes standing. I'm just wondering if there are any external assets or classes that you're still considering for potential combinations to leverage its scarcity value and ensure that it's a backbone in future combinations, sort of wondering if getting through that initial highly monitored cohort is gaining factor and then just a quick follow up on KALYDECO commercial dynamics in the U.S., just wondering if there's any opportunity for additional use in the label indication, perhaps with slight increases, improvements in compliance and why are those few patients who are not on it still on the sidelines?","Jeff Leiden","Yes Brian, this is Jeff, I'll take the VX-135 question. I think you remember that we said probably five, six months ago now that our strategy is to find the best combination of all our medicines for patients with HCV, both by combining VX-135 as a backbone with our own medicines but also potentially with those of others and of course that led to the collaborations with J&J and GSK, which we're very pleased with, with respect to additional assets, if we found an asset that we thought added significant value to VX-135 we'd be open to combining with that as well.","Ian Smith","Yes, and just on KALYDECO in the U.S., frankly there's very, very, very few patients on the sidelines. The vast majority have been exposed to KALYDECO at some point in time. In terms of compliance is there an opportunity to increase that? Possibly, but actually the compliance rates are remarkably high, much higher than we would see with virtually any product I've come across in 26 years doing this.","So there may be some marginal increases we can get, but they really are on the margin, which is why we say that kind of net, net, we're expecting to maintain the quarterly revenues we're seeing here in the U.S. in Q4 as we move into 2013.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is from Howard Lang of Leerink Swann. Your line is open.","Howard Liang - Leerink Swann","Does the breakthrough designation cover all of additional indications for monotherapy KALYDECO, including patients with residual CFTR function and one, should we expect to see that phase 3 data, could it be this year?","Peter Mueller","So the breakthrough designation has two components. One is for KALYDECO and the label expansion intent that we have, which covers basically those populations that you have mentioned. We will know when we know what we discussed with the agency in terms of breakthrough, at what point in time we have a submission criteria and then we will also see what data we will release at what point and time. But that\u2019s still ongoing discussions and therefore it\u2019s hard to predict.","Bob Kauffman","And Howard, to the second part of your question of when you could that see KALYDECO monotherapy data and the other mutations we have guided to the second half of this year, we anticipate to start seeing data from those studies.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is from Katherine Xu of William Blair. Your line is open.","Katherine Xu - William Blair","","So with regard to VX-135, I\u2019m just wondering, in the initial cross ribavirin study, how many patients do you need to get to, I might have missed this because I couldn\u2019t hear it very well. How many patients do you have to get through to get the sense of safety that could be satisfactory to go on?","And then on the tightening of KALYDECO Europe, just curios, do you have some kind of guidance on the pricing relative to the U.S.; and in Germany, in UK, Ireland, and in France. Relative to the U.S.; how should we think about pricing?","Bob Kauffman","So for VX-135, we are looking at a relatively small number of patients in that initial cohort and then an expansion, once we receive those data and we expect that that will occur relatively quickly to allow us to expand. That is in the first of the trial, the ribavirin 135 trial. As you know we are also initiating trials with the GSK and the TMC molecules, and those will be following the initiation of the ribavirin trial.","Katherine Xu - William Blair","The small number will be 20 or 100, any?","Bob Kauffman","Yes, in the order of 20 or so. And then, Katherine, on price; I\u2019m obviously not going to talk to the specifics of the pricing discussions that we are having in Europe but what I will say is that obviously we view KALYDECO as a breakthrough medicine and we have priced it as such for the value it brings to patients and we believe we know from clinical trials, it brings the same value to patients in the EU as it does in the U.S and we going to be and are defending that value in our ongoing discussions with reimbursement authorities.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Kolbert of Maxim Group. Your line is open.","Jason Kolbert - Maxim Group","And answered but I\u2019d like to explore little bit about what\u2019s really next with flu? What kind of expenses you\u2019re prepared to spend in order to support that program or whether you\u2019re going to be looking for other sources of funding outside of the company? ","Bob Kauffman"," ","If we progress forward, and we\u2019ve been very clear about our priorities for investment in 2013 and if we haven\u2019t, I\u2019ll take the opportunity to say cystic fibrosis, Hepatitis C, all-oral therapies, and autoimmune diseases. Therefore, that does exclude investment towards flu. We\u2019re still waiting on the data. If the data is good and signals a progression forward, then would use maybe collaborations or external monies to fund the next steps of development for the flu molecule. ","Michael Partridge"," ","Operator, we have time for about one more question. We are right up on call time.","Operator","","Alright, our final question is from Phil Nadeau of Cowen and Company. Your line is open. ","Phil Nadeau - Cowen and Company","Stuart, I wanted to follow up on some of the comments you made about Ireland. I think you said that negotiations going well there and proceeding. But the dossier from the International Center for Pharmacoeconomics is actually available online and in that it says that basically you can\u2019t recommend reimbursement at the submitted price and you need to either, fortify the clinical data, the long term clinical data to suggest a mechanism, such as performance based, risk sharing or significantly cut the price. ","So, can you talk a little bit more about why Ireland is going well and what the next steps are there and when we might get clarity on when or if they are going to reimburse?","Stuart Arbuckle","","Sure, yeah. Just to set expectations, these reimbursement type discussions have a number of phases. There usually an evaluation of clinical benefit. That\u2019s always been unanimously positive for KALYDECO. Then there is often an assessment, sort of from a cost effectiveness point of view and then you get into, on a little substantive discussion about the data and the discussions on price.","All I\u2019ll say is that those discussions continue. They are ongoing. This is all part of the process. These things aren\u2019t linear. You get these kinds of tos and froes and as I say I remain optimistic that we will reach a successful conclusion in Ireland and exactly when that is, I can\u2019t say but I remain optimistic.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen and Company"," ","Okay. And could you give us some senses of what additional data you have to submit to them either on the long term clinical benefit or performance based risk sharing scheme? ","Stuart Arbuckle"," ","I really can\u2019t go into the details of the data that we\u2019re submitting.","Michael Partridge","Thanks very much everyone for listening tonight and for your questions. We will be in our offices tonight following the call for any follow up. And now Jeff will provide the final word.","Jeff Leiden","Yes. Thanks Michael. I think as you heard tonight, we feel that we\u2019re very well positioned as we go into 2013. We have strong financial position, we have two products that are performing well and we expect to continue to perform well and we have a late stage pipeline that's advancing going nicely with the number of milestones coming up through the year that will allow us and you to judge our progress. So we look forward to updating you as we get those milestones and we\u2019re looking forward to 2013. Thanks. ","Operator","","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

Actual outcomes and events could differ materially.","I will now turn the call over to Dr. Jeff Leiden.","Jeffrey Leiden","Thanks, Michael. Good evening, everyone. We saw many investors and analysts at the JPMorgan Conference two weeks ago. So I\u2019ll spend just a few moments highlighting our 2019 achievements and what we believe sets Vertex apart for the future.","2019 was a truly remarkable year for Vertex. All parts of our business met or exceeded the goals we set at the start of the year. And as a result, we are very well-positioned to bring our CF medicines to many more people and to advance our broad pipeline in additional diseases in 2020.","In cystic fibrosis, the U.S. approval of TRIKAFTA for patients 12 and older in October, five months ahead of our PDUFA date, was the most significant milestone to date in our efforts to bring new CF medicines to all people with this disease. TRIKAFTA is a remarkable medicine that holds the potential to treat up to 90% of all people with CF.","As you\u2019ll hear from Stuart, the U.S. launch of TRIKAFTA in patients ages 12 and older is off to a very strong start. This clear interest in TRIKAFTA across all groups of eligible patients and the early feedback from both patients and doctors is highly positive.","Outside the U.S. in 2019, we reached a number of key reimbursement agreements for our CF medicines that will allow many thousands of new patients to begin treatment with our CFTR modulators in countries, including England, France, Spain, Australia and many others throughout 2020.","We are also making excellent progress advancing and broadening our pipeline beyond CF. As we enter 2020, we are now in the clinic with multiple new medicines in five diseases outside of CF. We continue to implement our strategy of advancing a portfolio of medicines into clinical development for each of the disease areas.","Key programs include alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, our AAT program, where we have multiple small molecule correctors in the clinic, aimed at addressing the underlying cause of disease in both the liver and the lung. These include VX-814, which has recently entered Phase 2 clinical development.","Beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease, where we announced clinical data for two patients treated with CTX001, a one-time CRISPR\/Cas9 ex vivo gene-editing therapy, which suggests that we may be able to functionally cure these diseases.","FSGS, where our first small molecule aimed at halting the progression of the disease, will move into Phase 2 development in 2020. And type 1 diabetes, where we are developing an autologous islet transplantation therapy with cells alone, and a second, with a combination of cells and a device to correct islet cell function and potentially transform the treatment of this disease.","Importantly, these pipeline programs now span multiple modalities, including small molecules, where Vertex has excelled in the past, but also new approaches such as cell and genetic therapies. For these new modalities, we\u2019ve acquired or partnered with leading companies who have the best teams and unique expertise to manufacture and deliver transformational therapies for diseases that fit our strategy.","In the business development, we completed more transactions in 2019 than in the four prior years, including our acquisitions of Semma with a leading cell therapy approach for type 1 diabetes and Exonics, the leader in gene editing for DMD and DM1.","In summary, 2019 was the combination of almost a decade of focused execution against our strategy of discovering and developing transformative medicines for serious diseases in specialty areas by focusing on validated targets and predictive biomarkers that will improve the probability of clinical success.","Our strategy is playing out exactly as we had planned and will position us for continued short-term and long-term growth. The company has never been stronger or better positioned for future success in CF and beyond.","Let me now turn the call over to Reshma, who will talk in more detail about the year ahead.","Reshma Kewalramani","Thanks, Jeff. Our 2019 progress has positioned us for continued growth in 2020 and for many years to come. We are focused on bringing our CF medicines to more people, advancing our pipeline and building financial strength to support continued investment in internal and external innovation.","In 2020, we expect to gain approval for the triple combination in Europe in patients 12 years and older and to submit TRIKAFTA for approval in the U.S. for children ages six to 11. Beyond CF, we are advancing multiple molecules in our pipeline through late preclinical and early clinical development and are now entering a period of multiple proof-of-concept data readouts and clinical advances with potentially transformative medicines.","With our AAT program, we recently initiated a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study of the small molecule corrector, VX-814 in patients with two copies of the Z mutation and expect data from the study in 2020.","In APOL1-mediated FSGS, we completed a Phase 1 study of VX-147 in late 2019 and expect to initiate an open label Phase 2 proof-of-concept study in 2020 to evaluate the reduction in protein levels in the urine with VX-147.","In pain, having established proof-of-concept data from NaV1.8 inhibition with VX-150 in multiple Phase 2 studies, our focus is now to find the optimal molecule or molecules to advance into mid and late-stage studies. We are continuing to advance a portfolio of medicines into clinical development and will be advancing an additional molecule into Phase 1 development in the first-half of 2020. We have discontinued Phase 1 development of VX-961, because it did not display optimal PK and tolerability profile.","Beyond our small molecule programs, we\u2019ve made significant progress in building and progressing a portfolio of cell and genetic therapies, in line with our research strategy, primarily through our business development activities. We are highly encouraged by our recent clinical data for our CRISPR\/Cas9 ex vivo gene-editing treatment CTX001 for beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease. Both studies continue to enroll and we expect to provide additional data for this program in 2020.","I\u2019d also like to highlight our cell therapy approach for type 1 diabetes. This program comes to us from our acquisition of Semma Therapeutics in October of 2019. The team of scientists at Semma have cracked the biology on both the production and scale up of fully mature islet cells and has developed a novel implantable device to protect these cells from the immune system, while preserving cell health and function. We have set an ambitious goal to progress this program into clinical development in late 2020 or early 2021.","In summary, we\u2019ve made outstanding progress in CF and multiple other diseases in 2019. And I look forward to updating you on our progress over the coming months and years.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Stuart.","Stuart Arbuckle","Thanks, Reshma. I\u2019m pleased to review with you this evening our strong commercial performance for 2019. Our full-year 2019 CF revenues were $4 billion, up from $3 billion in 2018, which represents year-over-year growth of 32%. This growth in total revenues was driven primarily by the full-year impact of the SYMDEKO launch in the U.S. and Germany, label expansions for our CF medicines globally and the early approval and launch of TRIKAFTA in the U.S.","The launch of TRIKAFTA is off to a very strong start. Our fourth quarter total CF product revenues were approximately $1.25 billion, including TRIKAFTA revenues of $420 million, making TRIKAFTA already our top-selling medicine.","I would note that our fourth quarter revenues include, as expected, launch-related stocking of approximately $100 million. Approximately 18,000 patients are eligible for TRIKAFTA in the U.S., which represents the largest patient population eligible for one of our CF medicines at the time of approval and launch.","For 6,000 of these people, this is the first time they have had a medicine to treat the underlying cause of their CF. We are seeing strong interest from all groups of eligible patients, including new initiations, as well as patients transitioning from our other CFTR modulators.","Our commercial supply, market access, patient support, marketing and field teams were ready for an early approval. And since October, these teams have been doing a phenomenal job with CF centers and commercial and government payers. The centers and their multidisciplinary teams have done a remarkable job responding to the high-patient demand. And while still early in the launch, we are on track to obtain broad reimbursement for TRIKAFTA in the U.S., similar to what we have seen for our other CF medicines. Together, these factors have combined to produce the strong start to the launch.","Outside the U.S., we reached multiple reimbursement agreements in 2019 in key countries, which will enable many thousands of patients to initiate treatment with certain Vertex medicines for the first time. While TRIKAFTA will be the main driver of Vertex\u2019s revenue growth in 2020, we also expect an increase in international revenues based on more patients initiating treatment with our medicines outside the U.S.","In summary, I\u2019m pleased that we are bringing our medicines to many more patients around the globe.","And with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Charlie.","Charles Wagner","Thanks, Stuart. I will provide additional remarks this evening regarding our 2019 financial results and I will also discuss our 2020 financial guidance. All of the results and guidance I will discuss are non-GAAP.","As Stuart mentioned, we had fourth quarter total CF product revenues of approximately $1.25 billion, a 45% increase compared to 2018. Our fourth quarter 2019 combined R&D and SG&A expenses were $496 million, including the operating expenses of Exonics and Semma, compared to $400 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. The significant growth in revenues and disciplined spending in the fourth quarter resulted in operating income of $593 million, a 70% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2018","Net income for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $444 million, compared to $337 million for the fourth quarter of 2018. Our full-year financial results reflect a similar story of strong revenue growth and disciplined spending, resulting in exceptional operating income growth.","Our total CF revenues for 2019 were $4 billion, a 32% increase over full-year 2018. Our 2019 combined R&D and SG&A expenses were $1.69 billion, compared to $1.53 billion for 2018. Our full-year operating income was $1.79 billion for 2019, compared to $1.11 billion for 2018, a year-over-year increase of more than 60%.","As our profitability and cash flow increase as a result of treating more CF patients globally, we have deliberately reinvested in both internal and external innovation to create future medicines.","In 2019, we invested approximately $1.6 billion in external innovation through new acquisitions and collaborations. Even with the significant BD activity, we ended the year with approximately $3.8 billion in cash and marketable securities, compared to $3.2 billion at the end of 2018.","As we look ahead to 2020 and beyond, we expect continued increases in cash flow to provide more flexibility for additional investments to fuel our long-term growth.","Now on to 2020 guidance. Today, we\u2019re providing 2020 financial guidance for total CF product revenues, as well as for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses and our anticipated effective tax rate. The strong uptake of TRIKAFTA and the recent completion of reimbursement agreements outside the U.S. have positioned Vertex for continued strong revenue growth in 2020. Our 2020 guidance for total CF product revenues is $5.1 billion to $5.3 billion, which at the midpoint, reflects approximately 30% growth over 2019.","I would note a few dynamics that are reflected in our 2020 guidance. As part of the strong launch of TRIKAFTA, that Stuart mentioned, we saw an expected launch-related inventory build of approximately $100 million in the fourth quarter that we do not expect to repeat in 2020.","Also, as we move through 2020 as with all of our CFTR modulators, persistence and compliance dynamics will affect TRIKAFTA revenues. And therefore, our experience with our other CF medicines is factored into our guidance. Lastly, we expect gross to net adjustments of 13% to 14% for 2020.","Focusing in on Q1 2020, we expect our revenues to be modestly higher than Q4 2019 revenues. This reflects the impact of the fourth quarter inventory build, as well as gross to net adjustments in the first quarter of each year that are generally higher relative to the previous quarter.","We expect 2020 combined R&D and SG&A expenses of $1.95 billion to $2 billion. The increase compared to 2019 is primarily driven by the launch of TRIKAFTA globally and the expansion of our R&D pipeline into additional diseases. Our R&D expense growth includes increased investment to advance our programs and cell and genetic therapies, including type 1 diabetes and DMD.","Now to tax guidance, where we expect our full-year non-GAAP tax rate to be 21% to 22%. The tax rate may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter with the highest rate occurring in the fourth quarter. The vast majority of our tax provision will be non-cash expense until we fully use our net operating losses.","As Jeff noted, Vertex has a unique long-term growth potential that is based on continued revenue growth in CF and an expanding pipeline. And with continued spending discipline, we expect operating margins, earnings and cash flow to continue to increase.","Now back to Jeff for a few concluding comments.","Jeffrey Leiden","Thanks, Charlie. As this is my last quarterly call as CEO, I hope you indulge me for a couple of minutes for some final comments. First, it has been a tremendous pleasure and honor to lead Vertex for the past eight years. I always say the drug discovery and development is the ultimate team sport. None of our successes would have happened without several incredible teams.","First, I want to thank the entire Vertex team, including our senior leadership team, most of whom have been with me for the entire journey. I\u2019ve never seen a stronger team in my 35 years in the industry and I\u2019m so proud and grateful for all of their work.","The commitment of our outstanding senior leaders and employees to execute the Vertex strategy of serial innovation to deliver transformational medicines to patients and to grow the business is the driving force for our recent achievements, and it\u2019s also what will differentiate us and position us for long-term success for the future.","Second, I want to thank our Board of Directors and our investors for their constant support, encouragement and advice. Even when I first became CEO and we were still losing several hundred million dollars a year, we\u2019re trying to develop the first transformative CF medicines.","And finally, and most importantly, I want to thank the entire CF community, patients, families and caregivers for their courage, their persistent encouragement and their enthusiastic participation in this amazing journey toward a cure for all patients with this devastating disease. I look forward to continuing to work with all of you as Executive Chairman to bring more transformative medicines to patients with serious diseases who are waiting.","I will now open the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Phil Nadeau with Cowen & Co. Your line is now open.","Phil Nadeau","Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Jeff, let me be the first to congratulate you and all that you and the Vertex team have achieved in your eight years of the CEO tenure. It\u2019s really been quite something to watch. Then, my question is just in terms of the numbers.","First, Stuart, you mentioned really three buckets of TRIKAFTA patients, those transitioning from ORKAMBI and SYMDEKO, new patients being added to therapy, who had no option prior and the new initiations maybe among the holdouts to dropouts in other populations. Could you give us some sense of the dynamics in those three markets in \u2013 of the $300 million in end user demand? Where do they come from?","And then second, just on the inventory, it seems like $100 million of inventory is really just two to three weeks of inventory, given the current run rate. So to be clear on your comments, it\u2019s not that you expected inventory to come out of the channel during Q1. It\u2019s just that there is no subsequent inventory build, given that you\u2019re already had a kind of average run rate for inventory in the channel? Thanks.","Jeffrey Leiden","Yes. Great. Phil, I\u2019ll take the question on the TRIKAFTA uptake, and then Charlie can talk to the inventory. So, as you know, we had a very strong launch. There are a number of eligible patient populations. As you might tell from the strong launch, we have had a high level of interest from all patient groups and we\u2019ve seen uptake in all of those patient groups and we expect that to continue into 2020. And so to handle the inventory question, I\u2019ll throw that over to Charlie.","Charles Wagner","Yes. Phil, to your question, the inventory \u2013 first of all, the inventory build in the fourth quarter was expected. And I\u2019d say, the magnitude of the build is probably even a little bit less than what you mentioned. But \u2013 therefore, I think it\u2019s fair to say that, that is a \u2013 we commented that, that\u2019s a build that won\u2019t repeat nor do we expect it to get drawn down significantly. Inventory bounces around a couple of day to \u2013 a day or two on any given quarter, but that\u2019s about the right level.","Phil Nadeau","That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for my questions and congrats on the performance.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Michael Yee","Hi, thanks for the question and, again, congrats on a great result. And, obviously, Jeff, you are moving and leaving them with a great position. I guess, I just wanted to ask, Stu, you made some comments just now on where the buckets were. But maybe you could just characterize how you think about the swapping dynamic and was there parts of that number for swapping? And how do you think, what percent of swapping could happen throughout 2020, just so we can think about that?","And then maybe a question for Reshma. I mean, I know that there\u2019ll be a lot of focus on AAT next. I know you\u2019ve given a broad guidance on 2020. Can you just talk about the speed of that study? It\u2019s a short study. What you\u2019re doing there and how fast we can get that data? It just seems like a very broad timeline for 2020 data. Thank you so much.","Jeffrey Leiden","Yes. Mike, on the uptake of TRIKAFTA. As I said, we\u2019ve seen interest across all of the patient groups and that includes those who are currently being treated with one of our existing CFTR modulators. Over time, where we have overlapping labels, given the superiority of the TRIKAFTA profile, we expect the vast majority of patients who are eligible for TRIKAFTA are going to switch to TRIKAFTA. Exactly how long that process will take, it\u2019s hard to tell. Obviously, we\u2019re early in the launch. But in terms of the destination, the vast majority of those patients are going to transition to TRIKAFTA.","Reshma Kewalramani","Hi, Mike. With regard to the alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency program, I think, the one you\u2019re referring to is VX-814, that\u2019s the one that\u2019s furthest ahead. It\u2019s the one we started Phase 2 proof-of-concept dose-ranging toward the very tail-end of 2019. So actually, it\u2019s really very early days. We\u2019re just getting going with that study. I\u2019m expecting that we will have results from the program in 2020, but it\u2019s just way too early to give you more color around that.","Michael Yee","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Salveen Richter","Thanks for taking my question and, Jeff, congrats on all that you\u2019ve achieved at Vertex. So firstly, could you just comment on how the 2019 TRIKAFTA launch will then form the cadence of uptake during 2020?","And then secondly, as we look at the pipeline, any new thoughts around the requirements for the regulatory pathway for alpha-1 antitrypsin here regarding the need for liver biopsy or not. And then secondly, with Type 1 diabetes, what does a proof-of-concept study look like here?","Stuart Arbuckle","Yes. Salveen, it\u2019s Stuart. I\u2019ll take the question on the 2019 and impact on 2020. So obviously, given the results we\u2019ve announced today, off to a very, very strong start. Having said that, there are many patients. We continue to need to get onto TRIKAFTA. So we are expecting continued growth through 2020 in terms of adding patients and that\u2019s built into our guidance of $5.1 billion to $5.3 billion.","As Charlie said, one other factor to take into account, as you think about the cadence or the shape of those revenues is the impact of persistence and compliance and how that will impact revenues. It does have an impact although as we\u2019ve seen with our other CFTR modulators. Our expectation is that the levels of persistence and compliance will be high with TRIKAFTA, particularly given the strong clinical profile. And then I think on the AAT and type 1, I think Reshma will take those.","Reshma Kewalramani","Sure. So let me tackle the diabetes question first, and I\u2019ll take AATD second. So with regard to the diabetes program, that\u2019s the cell therapy program that we acquired through the Semma acquisition. So, I mean, the proof-of-concept I imagine to be something you can think about more akin to sickle cell and our beta thal program versus a small molecule program.","And what I mean by that is, we are going to be able to go into the clinic right into patients. It\u2019s not going to have a healthy volunteer step. And whether we go with the cell program alone or the cell with the device, I think, the kind of endpoints you could expect are fairly straightforward ones, glucose levels, hemoglobin A1c. Clearly, hypoglycemic episodes on the safety side will be something that we\u2019re watching. But I think that kind of gives you a good sense for what we\u2019re going to be watching for.","The other thing to mention is, I think that you can, again, similar to beta thal and sickle cell, I anticipate that the proof-of-concept studies are going to be a reasonable size and a very reasonable duration.","With regard to the AATD program, we have not had further regulatory interactions. And so, as I\u2019ve commented on before, I was impressed with the October 2019 FDA conference. What the agency indicated was that they would work with each sponsor depending on their approach for what the regulatory enabling endpoint would be. And I anticipate that the key points that we would be looking for from this program that\u2019s ongoing is functional serum AAT levels.","And as we think forward beyond that, we just need to get through the regulatory interactions. I will remind you that the augmentation companies receive their approval based on AAT levels, that\u2019s just the data point to look at.","And the last thing I\u2019ll say is, our approach is obviously very different than those out there and that the small molecule corrector approach holds the opportunity to treat both the liver and lung manifestations. And so, obviously, we\u2019re going to be talking through what those liver manifestations and what those endpoints would look like as well.","Salveen Richter","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Matteis with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Paul Matteis","Great. Thank you so much for taking the questions. Just one quick question on guidance. Even with considering inventories when we just take your comments on 1Q, it looks like you\u2019re already pretty close to annualizing at the full-year number you outlined. And so, we just wanted to get a better understanding of the dynamics that go into your guidance. Are you just being conservative, or is there a reason that uptake could slow?","And then, just second quickly on the cell therapy program in diabetes, I was just curious how do you think about a realistic clinical goal for that program? And do you feel like the bar for true commercial success is insulin independence, or are there other ways we should think about a potential benefit? Thanks so much.","Charles Wagner","Hey, Paul, this is Charlie. I\u2019ll take the first question on guidance. And I would not characterize the guidance is conservative. I think it\u2019s appropriate, given what we know about the TRIKAFTA launch so far, as well as the reimbursement agreements that we signed in the fourth quarter.","Again, just to touch back on the inventory topic, it\u2019s tempting to look at the Q4 run rate and want to extrapolate from that. But if you take the $1.25 billion back out of $100 million for the inventory build, you\u2019re at $1.15 billion into the guidance, obviously implies significant growth over that. And then again as we touched on \u2013 in the remarks, the impact of persistence and compliance is meaningful and will come into the revenues over the course of 2020.","So once you factor those things in, we think that the guidance is absolutely appropriate. And candidly, when you think about the $5.2 billion number at the midpoint, so $1.2 billion increase year-over-year, a 30% growth rate, it sets us up for another very strong year.","Reshma Kewalramani","Paul, I\u2019ll take the question on the cell therapies program and type 1 diabetes. So if you think about the current approach to type 1 diabetes and whether you think about insulin just injection or you think about closed-loop systems or you think about really anything that\u2019s available there, what you realize is in these over 1 million people who have this disease, neither is the glucose control particularly good, whether you look at glucose or hemoglobin A1c, nor is it particularly safe on the other side, and that\u2019s the \u2013 to speak to the hypoglycemic episodes.","Then, if you look at cadaveric transplants, that actually shows that people who have cadaveric transplants, islet cell transplants, they do very well in terms of glucose control and don\u2019t have the deficiencies with hypoglycemia. Now, the problem there, of course, is there just aren\u2019t enough islets \u2013 there are not enough cadavers for transplant and then there is the issue of immunosuppression.","So the real beauty in this approach and why we\u2019re so very excited about this is Doug Melton and the Semma Group have come up with a way to not only produce, but to scale these islet cells. And that holds the potential for really excellent glucose control like the cadaveric transplant without the hypoglycemic episodes. So that\u2019s what the real goal here is.","Paul Matteis","Great. Thanks for the color. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","Alethia Young","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the quarter. And Jeff, certainly, you will be missed in the CEO seat, incredible run. I think we call that CEO might drop. So my two questions are, I guess, when you\u2019re thinking about in the field, what have been kind of the biggest surprises? I know you guys talked about bottlenecks and maybe potentially just so much demand, have you seen that to be the case or has it been a little better?","And then my second question is, it might be a little early, but do you think the compliance and persistence are trending more like a KALYDECO, or kind of what are the puts and takes that you think about that as a dynamic in 2020? Thanks.","Jeffrey Leiden","Yes. Alethia, thanks very much for the question. You\u2019re right. Prior to the launch, there was a couple of potential bottlenecks as you\u2019ve described them that we were concerned about. One was concerns that CF centers, it raised with us about the capacity constraints. They felt they might have given 18,000 patients were going to be eligible for TRIKAFTA.","I have to say, they have done a spectacular job in responding to the high-level of patient demand. And whilst there have certainly been some bottlenecks at some centers, in general, the multidisciplinary teams have jumped, just an amazing job working to get patients initiated on the medicine.","The other potential bottleneck as always with a new product launch is whether we are going to get support from payers. And again, our teams have done a great job working with both government and commercial payers. And clearly, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to deliver the results we have in the fourth quarter without very significant access. So both of those bottlenecks have actually \u2013 we\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised with how well those have turned out in Q4 and I expect that to continue in 2020.","In terms of compliance and persistence, really, it\u2019s just too early to say in the real world exactly what that is going to look like. We do expect it to be high. We do expect it to be in the range of our other CFTR modulators, which you know is very high for both of those aspects and certainly given the profile, we\u2019d expect it to be similar with TRIKAFTA it has been for all of the medicines. But really too early to tell exactly what it\u2019s going to be like for this medicine in the real world.","Alethia Young","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Whitney Ijem with Guggenheim. Your line is now open.","Whitney Ijem","Hey, guys. Thanks very much for the question. I wanted to follow-up on type 1 diabetes. So it sounded like it wasn\u2019t clear whether or not you\u2019d be moving forward into the clinic with the naked cells or the encapsulation. And I\u2019m wondering if you can give us any more color on what the exact encapsulation technology or devices at this point?","Reshma Kewalramani","Sure. Thanks so much for the question. It\u2019s really one of my favorite late preclinical development progress to talk about for a few reasons. But with regard to your specific question, you\u2019re right. We have two shots on goal here, so to speak.","One, development pathway involved the cells alone. And, for example, that is attractive in a couple of different potential areas. One of them would be patients who are renal transplant recipients as an example, who are on immunosuppressive therapy anyway and they have their renal transplant because of type 1 diabetes. So the naked cell approach or the cell alone approach there could be a nice pathway.","The encapsulation is a device. The Semma Group has not only done amazing work with regard to the development and the maturation of cells and the industrial scale up, but they\u2019ve done a really nice job with the device. The device has to be particular, and others have tried this in the past and it\u2019s a tough problem to solve.","The device is different and I think is \u2013 really has the opportunity to succeed here for a few different reasons. It has to do with the geometry. It has to do with the material. It needs to allow glucose and insulin to free flow, but to keep the cells in their state. And it also has to do with ensuring that the device in the cells get sufficient oxygenation and that there is in fibrosis. And the data that we have seen to date, including in large animals tells us that that\u2019s so.","Whitney Ijem","Got it. And just a quick follow-up. So we will be moving the encapsulation program forward into the clinic first, and you sort of abandoned the naked cell approach, or is it still the nearest, which will go first? Thanks.","Reshma Kewalramani","Yes. You can think of it in terms of having two shots on goal and it\u2019s just a matter of which one goes first. But you can think of it as two programs.","Operator","Thank you.","Michael Partridge","Operator, next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is now open.","Robyn Karnauskas","Hi. Thank you for taking my question and thanks Jeff for all the hard work you put in, it\u2019s been great. So two questions. One for Charlie. First, you have cash that\u2019s accumulating. It looks like the studies that you\u2019re about to do may not be as expensive, they\u2019re very tight and they maybe small at least for the next few years. So how are you thinking about thus maximizing cash without running the risk of having lazy balance sheet? And then, Reshma, for pain, you just continued one program. What are you looking for versus the original VX-150? Thanks.","Charles Wagner","Sure, Robyn. Thanks for the question. As you point out, the business model is running very well right now and we are generating cash, which gives us flexibility. We continue to feel that the best use of our cash is to reinvest in the business, both in terms of internal innovation and also external innovation. Again, you saw us have a very active year in 2019 with $1.6 billion on a number of deals that got us access to some great enabling technology and some programs that are a perfect fit with our research strategy.","So going forward, we\u2019ll continue to be active in business development. To the extent that we have additional cash flow in 2020, that\u2019s where the priority will be. I\u2019m not going to say that we\u2019re committing to a certain number of deals or a certain volume of cash flow. Everything needs to be governed by the research strategy and the corporate strategy will stay disciplined, but you continue \u2013 you will continue to see us be active in 2020.","Reshma Kewalramani","Robyn, this is Reshma. I\u2019ll take the question about pain. So, Robyn, I would think about pain just like CF and frankly, all of our programs. The approach here in Vertex speak is first crack the biology, then pour on the chemistry. And where we are with the pain program is, we\u2019ve cracked the biology. And I feel confident saying that because of the VX-150 results that we saw in three Phase 2 studies, right in acute pain and neuropathic pain and in osteoporosis.","So what we\u2019re really doing now is part 2, which is pour on the chemistry. And this is about finding, let me call is the ideal molecule, particularly in this disease state, safety and efficacy, of course, table stakes. But what we\u2019re really looking for is a molecule with the perfect PK, something that can be dosed once or twice a day, given that we\u2019re talking about pain condition in this instance.","We need to ensure that this medicine can be taken with food or without food. If you\u2019re talking about acute pain, immediately post-surgery being able to take it with our food is going to be really important. We\u2019re also thinking about DDIs and COGS. And so really, I guess, I would describe it to you as we\u2019re at the stage of pouring on the chemistry and this is our search for the ideal molecule for this pain condition, or I should actually describe as conditions, we think about it as three distinct groups in there.","Robyn Karnauskas","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Cory Kasimov","Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on a great quarter. Only you pre-announced this a couple of weeks ago, you could have made that Investor Conference a little more exciting this year. I guess, first question, I have for you is regarding AAT. As clinical work ramps, are you seeing any broader-based efforts to help with the diagnosis rate and what kind of education can you do there to facilitate the process while in development?","Reshma Kewalramani","Yes. Cory, let\u2019s take this in two parts. If you would mind, this is Reshma. I\u2019ll make a few comments and then I\u2019m going to turn it over to Stuart to tell us a little bit more about the market opportunity and such.","Cory, as we start our clinical trials and really start to engage with the community, which we\u2019ve already started to do, what you realize and what you\u2019re alluding to is absolutely true. Unlike CF, this is a disease where there isn\u2019t newborn screening and there isn\u2019t 100% diagnosis.","And while there is a 510 cleared CE marked assay for antigenic level, the diagnosis is not done that frequently. We are working with the community. We are engaged with the Alpha-1 Foundation. And I do see that group providing a real good amount of education and I see an opportunity to do even more. Let me ask Stuart to comment from his vantage point.","Stuart Arbuckle","Yes. Cory, so in terms of what we know about the market today, this estimated to be about 100,000 people with the ZZ genotype in the U.S. and the EU. Almost definitely, that\u2019s an underestimate, but let\u2019s just take that as a starting point. Only a fraction of those patients are currently diagnosed, to your point, and only a fraction of those that are diagnosed are actually actively treated with the current standard of care, which is the IV augmentation therapy.","So if we are able to bring to the market a product, which treats the underlying cause of the disease, which has impact on both the lung and the liver and is an oral small molecule, we think there is multiple opportunities here. One is clearly potentially to replace some of the IV augmentation therapies. Another opportunity would be to increase the treatment rate in those patients who are already diagnosed. But we also do think there is a significant opportunity to increase the diagnosis rate.","The diagnosis is not difficult to do. It\u2019s a simple blood test. It\u2019s currently included within treatment guidelines that, that should be done for patients diagnosed with COPD. But I think, as so often the case, where you don\u2019t have a solution, people don\u2019t go looking for the problem. And so we do anticipate that could be an increase in those diagnosis rates, if we are able to bring a better solution to the market.","Cory Kasimov","Great. Thanks guys. I appreciate taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Kostas Biliouris","Hello, this is Kostas on for Matthew. Congratulations on the quarter. Two questions from me. The first one is, can you give us some sense for how to think about the dynamics of European revenues in 2020, please?","Jeffrey Leiden","Yes. I\u2019ll take that. We were able to finalize reimbursement agreements in a number of major European countries towards the back-end of 2019. And as we anticipated, we did not see much of a contribution of those reimbursement agreements in 2019, because even having secured those agreements, you have to work through the administrative process before patients can be initiated.","We are expecting our European revenues to grow in 2020 as more patients are able to access our CFTR modulators and that\u2019s incorporated in the $5.1 billion to $5.3 billion guidance that Charlie talked to earlier on the call.","Kostas Biliouris","Thank you. And my second question is on APOL1-mediated kidney disease program. You have mentioned that you are planning to use the protein urea as a clinical market. I was wondering whether you need more key efficacy endpoints or these would suffice?","Reshma Kewalramani","Sure. Thanks, Kostas. This is Reshma. I\u2019ll take that one. So for those who may not be as familiar with this one, this is the VX-147 program and this is going into patients \u2013 into the clinic in Phase 2 now actually. This is for APOL1-mediated FSGS.","So, Kostas, as you may know, the renal community, along with regulatory agencies, have for the past many years thought and discussed what the appropriate regulatory enabling endpoint might be for a homogeneous pro-generic kidney disease, that\u2019s a mouthful. But basically what I\u2019m saying is that, there is a lot of support and what the idea here would be is to measure protein in the urine. That\u2019s a fairly simple thing to do.","And when you have a disease that\u2019s a homogeneous protein leaking disease that most people believe and this has been discussed extensively in the community that protein in the urine is the right measure for one to evaluate. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to be evaluating in this Phase 2 study and that\u2019s the study that is now getting under way.","Kostas Biliouris","Thank you very much and congratulations, again.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Liisa Bayko with JMP Securities. Your line is now open.","Liisa Bayko","Hi. Wanted to also wish congratulations to the team and during the transition. Wanted to ask about the European roll out. Can you just get into a little more specifics on sort of timing of the different countries. And what you think on ramping could look like, given that this has been sort of a new therapy that\u2019s available on some countries, meaning, they haven\u2019t had access to CFTR modulators in the past? Thanks.","Jeffrey Leiden","Yes. I think, there\u2019s really two aspects to that question, Liisa. One is the timing in different countries of the uptake of our current medicines, which are approved in Europe. And clearly, we expect that, as I mentioned earlier, to begin now that we have reimbursement agreements in some of the major countries, UK, Spain, France, et cetera, for existing CFTR modulators.","In terms of how that might play out for the triple combination, clearly, we have that submission in with the regulatory authorities. Our expectation is for an approval in Q4 of this year and as you know, the regulatory approval is really the trigger to the beginning of reimbursement discussions. And so within our guidance for 2020, there is minimal triple combination regimen revenues included within that guidance.","Operator","Okay.","Michael Partridge","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Brian Abrahams","Hi there, thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on the quarter and congratulations, Jeff, to on all your accomplishments. What\u2019s been your feedback on real-world experience with TRIKAFTA efficacy and safety? To what degree, that\u2019s been aligning with the clinical trial experiences, anything unexpected or different there?","And then secondarily, can you remind us of your plan to collect longer-term outcomes data with TRIKAFTA things like exacerbations, the timeline for updating that and how important you think that will be for full market penetration in the U.S., as well as European access? Thanks.","Jeffrey Leiden","So in terms of the real-world experience, I say \u2013 I would say, has been very similar to what we saw in the Phase 3 program, Brian. The feedback we\u2019ve had from physicians and patients has been almost universally positive. And when I say positive, their experience of the level of efficacy and the impact it\u2019s having on their lives is really inspiring.","Obviously, safety is something, which needs to play out over time. But certainly, we haven\u2019t seen anything in the real-world that has surprised us that has been different from what we saw in the Phase 3 programs. And as you know, those studies demonstrated a very, very strong benefit risk profile.","In terms of outcomes data and what data we\u2019re going to be collecting, I\u2019ll hand that over to Reshma.","Reshma Kewalramani","Sure. So, Brian, you know that we \u2013 in the Phase 3 program for the FMS patients, that was the program with about 400 patients that went out to 24 weeks. We already reported on pulmonary exacerbations and it was a really large reduction of 63%. We are continuing to collect data. So patients in both the FS study and the FMS study rolled over into an open label extension, that goes out through 96 weeks.","And in addition to that, we have additional studies that we\u2019re doing, collecting data from various registries, not only here in the U.S., but as we\u2019ve done with our other CFTR modulators around the globe as well. So we have more data to look forward to not only from the clinical trials program, the open label extension, but also registry data that we\u2019re collecting and will be collecting around the globe.","Brian Abrahams","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you.","Michael Partridge","Okay. On behalf of everyone here, thanks everybody for listening to tonight\u2019s call. Thanks also for all the kind words. We know that there are other earnings call tonight. So we\u2019ll let you get to them. And at the same time, the IR team is in the office and happy to talk to you if you have additional questions.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call.

This call is recorded and a replay of the call will be available later tonight on our website.","Dr. Jeff Leiden, Chairman and CEO; and Ian Smith, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, will provide prepared remarks this evening. Stuart Arbuckle, Chief Commercial Officer will join us a little later for Q&A.","I will remind you that we will make forward-looking statements on this conference call.

These statements, including those regarding the ongoing development and potential commercialization of our drug candidates, and Vertex's future financial performance are based on management's current assumptions.

I will also refer you to Slide 4 of tonight\u2019s webcast.","I will now turn the call over to Dr. Jeff Leiden.","Jeff Leiden","Thanks, Michael. Good evening, everyone. Earlier this month, we met with many of our investors and analysts at the Annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, where we outlined our priorities for 2017.","We have three key goals as we enter the year. First: we remain focused on increasing the number of people eligible for and being treated with ORKAMBI. Our progress towards this goal in 2017 will be measured primarily by achieving reimbursement for ORKAMBI in Europe and by the subsequent growth in our 2017 revenues.","Second: we\u2019re advancing multiple potential new medicines for CF that may improve treatment and also provide many more people with the first medicine to address the underlying cause of their disease. Over the coming year we expect to obtain data from across our CF pipeline that will mark our progress towards this goal.","And third: we\u2019re committed to reinvesting in our pipeline to create future medicines for other serious specialty diseases beyond CF while creating value for our shareholders.","Tonight, Ian and I will briefly review some of the key 2017 milestones and activities that support these goals and how our progress will position the company for continued growth in 2017 and beyond.","First: to ORKAMBI and our anticipated revenue growth for 2017. With the approval for use in children ages 6 to 11 ORKAMBI is now approved for approximately 11,000 with CF in the United States. Similar to the launch in those ages 12 and older, we\u2019ve seen strong uptake of ORKAMBI in younger patients and believe that physicians recognize the importance of starting treatment as early as possible.","Given the large number of eligible children and adults who\u2019ve already started treatment in the U.S. to-date we expect a further growth ORKAMBI in 2017, will come primarily from eligible patients initiating treatment in European countries following the completion of reimbursement discussions.","Across Europe, we\u2019ve completed the clinical and health economic assessments of ORKAMBI in key countries and are actively engaged in reimbursement discussions that would enable patients to initiate treatment with ORKAMBI.","Importantly we recently reached a formal reimbursement agreement in Germany that we believe reflects the value that ORKAMBI provides to eligible patients. We expect to conclude additional reimbursement discussions in 2017 and anticipate rapid uptake of ORKAMBI following these reimbursement decisions which will drive revenue growth beginning this year.","We are confident that it is not a question of if we will achieve reimbursement outside the U.S. but a question of when.","Now, to our pipeline of other potential new medicines for CF, our goal is to create new medicines to treat the underlying cause of CF for all people with the disease. We have potential CF medicines in all stages of research and development and expect to obtain important value defining data from across our CF pipeline of age approved and investigational medicines throughout 2017.","In the first half of this year we expect to obtain data from the Phase III program of tezacafter in combination with ivacafter in two large groups of people with CF, those were two copies of delta-508 mutation and those with one copy of the delta-508 mutation and one copy of a residual function mutation.","These data are intended to support an NDA and MAA submission in the second half of this year. Additionally the Phase III studies are together expected to enroll more than 1,000 people with CF and will thus provide a robust evaluation of the safety of the tezacafter\/ivacafter combination, an important consideration for the ongoing development of our triple combination regimens that also contain our next-generation corrector.","We have four next-generation correctors currently in clinical development including two ongoing Phase II studies evaluating the next-generation correctors VX-440 and VX-152 as part of a triple combination in people with one copy of the delta-508 mutation and one copy of a minimal function mutation and in people with two copies of the delta-508 mutation.","The third next-generation corrector VX-659 is currently being evaluated in the Phase I study in healthy volunteers NCF patients. And the fourth, VX-445 is expected to enter a Phase I study next month. Most importantly we expect to have data in people with CF from three of these studies in the second half of this year.","We believe that based on our in-vitro data, a triple combination of a next-generation corrector with tezacafter and ivacafter could provide benefit for any person with CF who is at least one delta-508 mutation, approximately 90% of all people with the disease.","2017 will be a year of multiple important data events that will inform us as to the potential of our CF pipeline to both enhance treatment and also treat many more people in the years ahead. We look forward to updating you on our progress in CF throughout the year.","Before turning the call over to Ian to discuss our financial position, I will briefly review the key pillars of our research strategy which is designed to support the creation of future medicines focused on serious specialty diseases that are aligned to Vertex as corporate strategy and core capabilities.","First, we\u2019re going to focus on validated targets to address the underlying cause of disease just like we did with CFTR and CF. Second we\u2019re committed to developing assays both at the cell level and in humans that predict clinical efficacy. Third, we\u2019re only interested in discovering and developing transformative medicines for serious specialty diseases. Taken together, we believe this will allow us to identify rapid paths for clinical trials and registration just as we have in CF.","With these principles in mind, we\u2019ve refined our internal research focus to ensure that the types of molecules we may discover in research would also be the types of medicines that we would seek to develop and commercialize ourselves. Today we\u2019re focused on diseases in our research labs that are consistent with these research principles including Adrenoleukodystrophy, Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency, Sickle Cell Disease and Polycystic Kidney Disease.","We look forward to updating you on these and other similar programs as they progress over the coming years.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Ian.","Ian Smith","Thanks Jeff; and hello everyone. Tonight I\u2019ll discuss our fourth quarter and full-year CF revenues and revenues for ORKAMBI and KALYDECO. And I will also review our 2017 financial guidance.","Our total CF product revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016 were $454 million, compared to $401 million for 2015. Our full-year 2016 CF product revenues were approximately $1.68 billion a significant increase compared to $982 million for 2015.","For ORKAMBI, we reported fourth quarter 2016 product revenues of approximately $277 million, a significant increase compared to $220 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Full-year product revenues for ORKAMBI grew to $980 million in 2016 from $351 million for 2015. 2015 revenues for ORKAMBI reflect two quarters of sales following the approval of the medicine in the U.S. in July 2015.","Fourth quarter KALYDECO sales were $177 million compared to $181 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Full-year product revenues for KALYDECO grew to $703 million for 2016 from $632 million for 2015.","Now to operating expenses. Our fourth quarter 2016 non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were $295 million compared to $282 million for 2015. Our non-GAAP net profit for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $88 million or $0.35 per diluted share compared to a non-GAAP net profit of $44 million or $0.18 per diluted share for 2015.","From a balance sheet perspective, we ended 2016 with approximately $1.43 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As part of the recently announced out-license agreement with Merck KGaA, for our oncology portfolio, we will receive an upfront cash payment of $230 million that would add to our current cash position in the first quarter of 2017 further strengthening our financial position.","This agreement and the related upfront payment, is subject to the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.","As we significantly added to our cash position over the recent months, we remain highly focused on reinvestment into our business to support our future growth. Internally, this means we will continue to invest in key research programs to create future medicines and externally, this means business development efforts will remain focused on bolstering our position in CF, expanding our non-CF pipeline with early stage external assets and expanding our access to important scientific technologies that could represent transformative future changes to medicine.","Now to the financial guidance for 2017 which we discussed in detail in our JPMorgan press release. For ORKAMBI we expect $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion in total net product revenues. The low-end of this range reflects potential revenues from markets where ORKAMBI is currently reimbursed including the U.S. in eligible patients ages 6 and older, and outside the U.S. mainly in Germany, in eligible patients ages 12 and older.","The high-end of the range reflects an estimated potential, additional European revenues in 2017 that is largely dependent on which European countries complete reimbursement agreements in 2017 and when these agreements become effective.","Stated differently, revenue growth for ORKAMBI will be driven primarily by the completion of reimbursement discussions in Europe later this year. We continue to expect our first quarter 2017 ORKAMBI revenues will be similar to the fourth quarter 2016 given the majority of eligible patients in the U.S. have initiated treatment.","For KALYDECO, we expect $690 million to $710 million in net product revenues. As the majority of all patients eligible for KALYDECO have initiated treatment, further growth for KALYDECO revenues will only be driven by potential U.S. approval for treatment of people with residual function mutations.","Additionally, we expect to combine non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses of $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion for 2017 compared to $1.2 billion for 2016. This reflects investments in our CF pipeline and in our global infrastructure for KALYDECO and ORKAMBI.","Our path to treating many more people with CF which will result in significant and sustained revenue growth is clear. Importantly, as our revenues grow over future years, we\u2019re committed to managing our operating expenses to drive earnings and operating margin growth.","With that, I will open the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Harrison","Great good afternoon I appreciate it, thanks for taking the question. Can I ask on the VX-150 not an area that I think a lot of us are as familiar with can you put any context what you see as the sort of key competitive hurdles and how you plan to further develop that compound?","Jeff Leiden","Yes, this is Jeff, thanks for the question Matthew. This is the first time we\u2019ve really spent a lot of time talking about this, looking at the clinical results. Maybe to start-off and take a step-back and remind you that obviously pain is an enormous indication actually multiple indications around the world that really hasn\u2019t been a novel pain mechanism of action probably in 40 or 50 years.","And obviously the recent attention on some of the side-effects with pain medicines line opioid has made that even more urgent problem. You probably also know that the NAV channels are interesting because both NAV 1.7 and 1.8 has been validated genetically in humans, meaning that patients who have homozygous loss-of-function mutations in 1.7 really don\u2019t feel any pain as those of the famous fire-walkers and patients that have various gaining functions in 1.8 have hyperacute pain syndromes.","So, one of the reasons that are exciting to us is, as they\u2019ve hit the Vertex strategy of having a validated target in the area of large unmet need where if you had a medicine that could have that kind of pain efficacy without the pain side-effects some of the others you\u2019d obviously have a very important new medicine for patients.","So that\u2019s sort of the background. We\u2019ve been working on 1.7 and 1.8, actually for some time in our San Diego labs, this is the first one of those molecules we\u2019re bringing forward 1.50 to 1.8 inhibitor. And in this study which was a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled crossover study which is probably the most powerful kind of study in pain because of the placebo effects.","What we saw was the statistically significant reduction in pain using the WOMAC scale and also a number of other secondary end-points that were all consistent with that. And the tolerability profile that actually was quite good in 124 patients. So that tells us that works in just kind of chronic away pain again as very different as you know from acute pain and it\u2019s very different from neuropathic pain.","And so, in order to fully understand the profile of this molecule, our plan is to take it forward in a couple of more exploratory studies one of two pain studies this year and then one in neuropathic pain probably starting later this year or over the next year.","When we have the results from those we\u2019ll really understand what we have here and then we could really make decisions about how to bring it forward to patients most quickly, and these different indications what are involved with the potential involvement of the partner might be etcetera. All those questions are little bit premature. I think you should really take away, it\u2019s yet another novel mechanism of action potential transformative medicine to come out of the labs and because of that large unmet need, we\u2019re excited about it.","Matthew Harrison","And just for clarity why not move, it ahead in LA right now, is it because of the competitive landscape or because of commercial considerations including partnering?","Jeff Leiden","Yes, great question. I think in pain, with the experiences that I\u2019ve had in my career, you really want to understand the molecule fully to understand how you develop it to its fullest potential for patients. And while we could take it forward in LA now, which is a large study and actually would probably not be consistent with our commercializing it.","I think we\u2019re going to do, we\u2019re going to create a lot more value as we first fully understand the mechanism across for three different types of pain, then we can make a really rational development plan. And I still think we have a nice competitive position even while doing that.","Matthew Harrison","Okay, great thanks","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Geoff Meacham","Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So, when you look at the 661 data in the first half, is it more important in the near term to have a new product cycle for ORKAMBI or are you guys thinking about this as being the cornerstone of a triple, I guess more of a focus on, is it more of a focus on limiting Bronchoconstriction rather than higher FAB one? And I have a follow-up too.","Jeff Leiden","Yes, thanks, Geoff. As you know, we\u2019ve always talked about 661 is having at least three goals. One, exactly as you said is if it had an enhanced benefit tolerability profile and delta-508 to delta-508 that are currently being treated with ORKAMBI, obviously that would be important because we do have a subset of those patients that has not been able to tolerate ORKAMBI due to respiratory effects and we\u2019d be able to reach more of those patients with such a combo.","The second purpose really is around those patients who are on KALYDECO monotherapy because they have a gating residual function mutation; remember 90% of those patients have delta-508 and other allele. And so, if you could add tezacafter to ivacafter in those patients and produced enhanced benefit that would obviously be very, very important for those patients.","And you\u2019ll remember that we actually published a Phase II study a couple of years ago a small number of patients but it was impressive and that it showed adding tezacafter\/ivacafter in those patients added an additional about 4.6% increase in the FEB-1 and that was a significant result.","If we could reproduce that in our residual function and gating mutations in this larger study that's going to be very important for that population of patients and obviously somewhat important competitively as well since we try to move most of those patients on to the double regimen.","And then the final one, just as you said is the basis for the triple regimen and here we\u2019re going to have 1,000 plus patients of safety data in particular on 661 plus ivacafter meaning that two of the three components would have been fully vetted in our combination and we would only have to add the one component the next-gen corrector which we think moves that program ahead considerably and also gives us a pretty nice competitive advantage.","So I think about it with those three different perspectives and frankly all of them are important but anyone of them could be successful.","Geoff Meacham","Got you, okay. And Jeff I know you guys have talked about the productivity of your technology when you look at generating new correctors. What would you say is the optimal number of leads or backups should we expect to see more going into Phase I, just that JPM obviously we added 445 to the pipeline but is for Next-Gen enough?","Jeff Leiden","Yes, I mentioned that we literally have hundreds of these now obviously, we\u2019re not going to bring hundreds forward into the clinic. We\u2019re bringing forward molecules that we think have particularly interesting and advantageous properties compared to what is there.","My hope is that at some point maybe relatively soon we\u2019ll stop because one of these looks very, very good as it goes through Phase II and we\u2019re ready and off to the races and it's going to be hard to improve on it, sort of like KALYDECO was an example. But until we see the data, I\u2019m just happy to have multiple swings at the ball and I think you can expect potentially to see even another one come this year depending on the data that we start to generate.","Geoff Meacham","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Yee","Thanks, I have to two questions. One is following up on 661 on the efficacy side of the equation. Do you guys have confidence that it\u2019s at least as good as ORKAMBI? And if it was not for some reason given there's only been short-term studies, is there a rationale for not filing in that situation and just using it as a triple, if it was lower with that change of confidence on the triple overall?","And then the second follow-up question is, as you are mentioning a lot of comments around business development which we appreciate. Are you pretty focused on very early stage stuff or should we not be surprised if you do something different than early stage? Thanks so much.","Jeff Leiden","Yes, Mike, this is Jeff. I\u2019ll take the first one and then Ian can take the BD question. With respect to 661 and efficacy, obviously the reason we\u2019re doing the study is to get the final answer in a large number of patients. But the reason we\u2019re doing this study is that our Phase II data just supports the notion that it has an efficacy profile that was as, good or better than ORKAMI. And we\u2019re going to find out a large number of patients for longer now.","With respect to I think just sort of asking what would be a positive or what would be a good result, I thought I\u2019d interpret your question. A good result to me would be a drug that\u2019s approvable with enhanced benefit tolerability profile in one of those groups of patients that I told you about that would be success and the safety database that was consistent with taking it forward as part of the triple.","Ian Smith","Yes, Michael, two BD questions. As I\u2019ve said many times on this call, it\u2019s really a three-pronged approach. Firstly, we look at most things pretty much everything that\u2019s involved with cystic fibrosis that may be complimentary to how we\u2019re progressing, our own medicines. And we actually - usually get the opportunity to work with a lot of those, let\u2019s call them other ideas internally in our labs in San Diego and run them through our assays. So we get a pretty good look at how to progress in the area of CF that is number one priority.","Secondarily I\u2019d say that the last couple of years we\u2019ve also understood how we may expand our scientific footprint and couple of markers for progression there, the two deals, recently one with Moderna Therapeutics and the other with CRISPR for gene editing and they\u2019ve allowed us different modalities, different approaches to solving some of the problems we\u2019re trying to solve.","And then to your point, there is a third like to our BD approach in corporate development and that is potentially in licensing, potentially smaller M&A, but it is really focused on early-stage. Our priorities today in the business as I said is about growing our, as well as growing our revenues but growing our cystic fibrosis franchise and expanding scientific modalities. And if we can expand our efforts into other diseases, we will at the right time.","Michael Yee","Okay. Thanks that's helpful. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from Jefferies.","Brian Abrahams","Hi, thanks very much for taking my questions. Two questions, first, I wonder if you had any updated sense of how compliance persistence and tolerability in the 6 to 11-year-olds, compares to adults. And secondly I know you\u2019ve mentioned that the NDA for tezacafter and KALYDECO would include data from the het\/min study that was discontinued. I just wanted to follow-up and see whether at this point you had received the data and if you could potentially provide any general sense as to trends on lung function or biomarkers or perhaps rates of A&E including bronchoconstriction how those looked relative to prior ORKAMBI Phase II in the het\/min population? Thanks.","Stuart Arbuckle","Hi Brian, it\u2019s Stuart here. I\u2019ll take the question on 6 to 11 compliance and persistence. And really it\u2019s too early to tell in that population in terms of actual data from the real world as it were. There are some reasons to be optimistic that it could potentially be better than in the 12 plus population, couple of reasons for that, one we know from the clinical data that we have generated in 6 to 11 population that we do see less of the respiratory adverse events that we know were, so important to some of the early discontinuations we saw with ORKAMBI in the adult population.","In addition, we also know from KALYDECO and indeed from many other chronic therapies that compliance in the 6 to 11 patient group not surprisingly because of the parental supervision tends to be as high as it is, if not higher than it is in any of the patient group. So, we don\u2019t have actual data really that\u2019s mature in the real world but I think there are some reasons to be optimistic that it could be higher than in the adult population.","And for the second part of your question, I\u2019ll hand that over to Jeff.","Jeff Leiden","Yes, hi, Brian. So, I think the second part of your question was about the het\/min data from the tezacafter trial, yes, we\u2019ve seen that data, by the way the data safety monitoring board has also evaluated that data. At some point we\u2019ll publish it I\u2019m not going to go into detail, I will just say that there were no new or concerning safety signals seen in that population of a little over 100 patients.","Brian Abrahams","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Maybe first just Stuart to follow-up, can you tell us what's embedded in your ORKAMBI guidance for assumptions on persistence and adherence in younger population?","Ian Smith","Terence, I\u2019m actually going to take that question. We provided guidance for ORKAMBI at JPMorgan as you know, that was $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. The assumptions are underneath the model, what we\u2019ll do more towards providing you with revenue guidance and then also updating you on timing as we gather reimbursements at the different markets.","Just a quick commentary to the $1.1 billion to the $1.3 billion though, the $1.1 billion that\u2019s the low-end of our guidance range is principally from the U.S. markets that does assume some growth in the 6 to 11 population, so it also does assume that there are some loss of patients due to the chronic nature of this medicine.","And then the growth beyond the 1.1 or towards the 1.3 potentially above it if it\u2019s possible will be driven by European reimbursement and approvals in the different markets and a key contributor to the growth of the revenue line in 2017 will be France.","Terence Flynn","Okay, thanks Ian. And then just maybe one on the pipeline I think you\u2019re expecting VX-371 plus ORKAMBI Phase II data in the mid-point of the year. Maybe just help remind us what you guys want to see to move forward with that combination or assuming maybe you\u2019d move forward with 371 plus 661 KALYDECO?","Stuart Arbuckle","Well, I\u2019ll take that Terence, first of all I appreciate you recognizing, it was a transaction that we did in terms of in licensing because there was something that\u2019s going to one of the questions that was earlier on the call where we were able to scan the landscape the CF medicines and we weren\u2019t able to work with [indiscernible] and we saw in-vitro e-NAV inhibitor [ph] together with our own medicines we actually saw an additive benefit in our in vitro assay.","So, that's why we move forward with that transaction. We\u2019re happy to say we\u2019re now in Phase II where we are studying inhibitor with ORKAMBI combination in 508-508 patients and we expect that data in the second half of the year. Data to move forward obviously we want to see a proof of concept of the combination of inhibitor with ORKAMBI in the 508-508 patient and we\u2019ll be looking for risk-benefits and progressing based on that proof of study concept.","Terence Flynn","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.","Cory Kasimov","Hi, good afternoon guys thanks for taking the question. I actually have two of them for you as well. I guess, first of all now that the list price has been published in Germany can you discuss how that may or may not impact or facilitate pricing discussions with other European countries? And then the follow-up is just curious when we could perhaps expect to start hearing of progress on the gene editing and\/or mRNA fronts? Thanks.","Jeff Leiden","Sure Cory. As I said we have come to a pricing agreement with the German authorities at the backend of last year which became public in the middle of this month and we're pleased to have reached that point with the German authorities.","In terms of the impact it's likely to have on other negotiations both firstly it shows that we're able to come to an agreement with a very major market in Europe, it certainly puts a benchmark out there in terms of a price because the price is in the public domain. And I hope it\u2019s certainly going to encourage other governments in the interest of the patients in their countries who were waiting to get access to this great medicine that it\u2019s going to encourage them to act with a sense of urgency. Exactly what that means kind of quantitatively is really very hard to say but hopefully it encourages other governments to act as the German government has.","Ian Smith","And Cory I'll take the second part on gene editing and RNA therapy. As you remember with the CRISPR collaboration and gene editing is multi- indication collaboration with fixed indication that we can choose from. We\u2019ve announced two which is CF and hemoglobinopathies, you\u2019ve probably seen the CRISPR has recently announced their intention to try to get the hemoglobinopathy program into the clinic later this year we\u2019re really pleased with how that's going that's obviously a bit of an easier progress because of the gene editing.","We're continuing to work on CF and as we get products that we think are approaching the clinic we\u2019ll start to tell you about them. Somewhat similar is Moderna, Moderna has been a more recent collaboration where we are looking at CF only right now and as we get products that actually we believe to move into the clinic we\u2019ll start to give you updates on some of those time lines.","Cory Kasimov","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI.","Mark Schoenebaum","Hi gents, thanks for taking the question. I was wondering back on ORKAMBI could you just give us an update as to where you guys are in French negotiations and remind us how big that market is. And then I think the news on 150 is great today so just a question to make - reduce my workload because I'm lazy. Is there anything else outside of CF that we could see this year that could just kind of pop up like this that we should be aware of? And thanks for everything while I was out guys thanks for helping out my team.","Jeff Leiden","Yes, Mark, first of all, this is Jeff. Welcome back, that\u2019s most important.","Mark Schoenebaum","Thank you.","Jeff Leiden","I\u2019m going to let Stuart answer your first question I\u2019ll come on your second one.","Stuart Arbuckle","Hi Mark, so in terms of where we are in France. You know these negotiations while they\u2019re kind of different country by country, all fall in the same process. They have a clinical benefit assessment, the health technology assessments and then a pricing negotiation. And in France, as with most of the other markets in the EU, we are in that third phase of negotiations with France talking about the specific pricing and reimbursement parameters.","So that\u2019s the phase that we\u2019re in right now. And obviously we\u2019re looking forward to try and bring those to a successful conclusion for the patients in France. Many of them are already enjoying the benefits of ORKAMBI.","Jeff Leiden","Let me take the second part of your question Mark, I don\u2019t want to give all the thunder, we like some of these surprises. But just to give you a little bit of the landscape. First of all, as you know we out-licensed flu compound to J&J, they\u2019ve been progressing that compound nicely. And so it\u2019s possible that over the next year or so you\u2019ll start to hear some more proof of concept there. Let them speak to the timelines but I think it\u2019s possible.","Oncology, we just out-licensed four assets to Merck KGaA. One of those is in Phase II and again depending on how they\u2019ve progressed the program I think you could hear some proof of concept there. Obviously the proof of concept, most importantly for us is going to be the proof of concept studies with the next-gen correctors which you\u2019ll definitely hear in the second half of this year.","And then I would say stay tuned for maybe another program or two to enter the clinic this year, but we\u2019re going to surprise you with those.","Mark Schoenebaum","And then a question for Ian. Ian, are you sporting a beard these days or no beard?","Ian Smith","Welcome back Mark, I\u2019m not sporting a beard.","Mark Schoenebaum","Take care. Thanks guys.","Ian Smith","Welcome back Mark, good to hear you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners.","Geoffrey Porges","Thanks very much for taking the question. First, Stuart or Ian could you give us a breakout of revenue for KALYDECO and ORKAMBI U.S. and ex-U.S. and then the updated patient starts to products if you will? And then secondly just going back to the 150 and the pain target, I\u2019m just looking at your own pipeline strategy criteria Jeff and wondering how developing a treatment for osteoarthritis fits with these criteria particularly given the target its early stage it's really a widespread disease it's a chronic indication. So should we assume that ultimately that might be a partnering candidate as well given that strategic focus?","Ian Smith"," So Geoff I\u2019ll answer on the U.S. ex-U.S., in Q4 of the $177 million that we reported for the fourth quarter $101 million of that was in the U.S., $76 million of that was ex-U.S. so that's the KALYDECO Q4 numbers and that was essentially the same split for the full year. For ORKAMBI of the $277 million in Q4 $248 million of that was U.S. and $29 million of that total was ex-U.S.","Jeff Leiden","And the 150 question, sort of, I thought your question is about strategic commercialization, sort of divided into two parts. There is our research strategy I think you\u2019ve probably heard me and David R Schuyler talk about a fair amount over the last year or so that is the focus on serious disease with unmet needs, so we\u2019ll get validated targets we\u2019re going to have assays take response, we could make a transformative medicine.","And actually pain in general and NAV channels fit those beautifully, by their fully validated target in serious disease with large unmet need where you can transformative medicine.","Then you come to the commercial and development strategies. Pain is an area we could develop but pain isn\u2019t really one disease as I said, pain is a number of different diseases, OA is a very different disease as you know from neuropathic pain, imagine from acute pain and there are different medicines that work with different degrees of efficacy in those diseases.","And so I would think of pain as a legacy program that fits our scientific strategy extremely well and depending on what the profile of the drug is might fit parts of our commercialization strategy or might be more appropriate with the partner but until we know the whole profile which is sort of easy and cheap to determine at this point we won't be able to come up with a strategy for how to create the maximum value from the assay once we do I think it will be pretty straightforward actually.","Geoffrey Porges","Great. Thanks everyone.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alethia Young from Credit Suisse.","Alethia Young","Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. One on 661, just when you saw the power in the study for 661 homozygotes, were they kind of different assumptions than how you thought about it with 809? And the reason why I ask is if I recall correctly, I thought the 809 had two arms where you get to split the power. And then I have one quick question on the residuals.","Jeff Leiden","Yes, so on the 661, strategy the positive sides of the homozygous study which I think is what you\u2019re really asking about was driven more by the necessary size of the safety database that it was by the powering for efficacy. Because obviously we need a total safety database which includes all the different trials, fits the business sufficiently large to get approval. And the biggest part of that turned out to be the homozygotes because they are the biggest population and the easiest to enroll the fastest so that's what really drives the size of that study. It is highly powered as it is.","Alethia Young","And then just on the residual study that\u2019s underway like 661, I know you said you\u2019re still in discussions with the FDA but I guess maybe can you help us think about what might be compelling data or file-able data more specifically?","Jeff Leiden","Sure. I do want to separate those tow a little bit. The discussions that we\u2019re having with the FDA now are really around KALYDECO monotherapy, based upon our initial submission which contains a lot of in-vitro data in the 23 different mutations as well as small clinical study.","And as you know, we received a complete response letter from that initial application in February of last year and we\u2019ve been in discussions with them since then because we feel that there is sufficient data to very clearly show that the drug works as monotherapy in those patients, so that\u2019s one set of discussions which you should think of it separate from the new trials that we\u2019re talking about.","The new trials that you\u2019re talking about are part of the 661 program, and that that particular residual function trial there is a placebo arm, KALYDECO monotherapy on and a KALYDECO plus tezacafter arm. So we\u2019re going to actually be able to see, compare those three if you will. And that data would hopefully provide the basis for submitting either KALYDECO monotherapy or dual therapy or both in the U.S. and Europe and that\u2019s the data that we\u2019ll see in the first half of this year. Is that clear how the two things are moving.","Alethia Young","Yes, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Jeff Leiden","Thanks. Operator we have time for two more questions.","Operator","Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ying Huang","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Number one I want to probe a little more about these 6 to 11-year old in the U.S. given the number at about 2,400 patients, I'm a little surprised that you do not expect much incremental growth for ORKAMBI from 4Q 2016 to 1Q. And then I have another question on the VX-659 because the trial product has been posted on [indiscernible], you guys are excluding patients or healthy volunteers with any childbearing potential so just curious did you observe any preclinical reproductive molecule or not? Thanks.","Ian Smith","Hi Ying, it\u2019s Ian, remember JPMorgan I think you asked the very same question. We provided guidance in 4Q actually, and that was we stated we expected Q1 for ORKAMBI to be similar to that of Q4 2016. And in that assumption we\u2019re trying to help folks like yourself understand how the revenues may flow in 2017 with helping you understand that the low-end of the guidance is still revenues are coming from those approved markets and those approved indications or patient categories that are already here.","Within that assumption, there is some expectation of growth but we\u2019re already treating the vast majority of the patients within those categories. So even though we may add new patients, new growth, it is somewhat offset by the loss of patients that are already currently on the medicine, they work currently on the medicine.","And we\u2019re also trying to help you understand that as we go out through the year, as the low-end of the guidance is 1.1, we do expect that to be the kind of the exit run-rate to 2016 and the earlier part of 2017 because we anticipate the growth which would be mainly from ex-U.S. markets and principally Europe that would be in the second half of the year as I mentioned earlier on the call a key contributor to that is actually France. So we\u2019re still in the same position in the same discussion we had back at JPMorgan.","Jeff Leiden","So Ying Huang, 659, question on report tax, we don\u2019t have the pre-clinical report tax data yet, and so exclusion nearly represents a typical caution until we have that data.","Ying Huang","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Phil Nadeau from Cowen and Company.","Phil Nadeau","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions and fitting me in. Just two, I guess, first, on Germany. In the past, at some point you saw that there was maybe some hesitation among physicians to prescribe ORKAMBI to patients in Germany without a final price. So, I\u2019m curious whether you think that impediment continues to exist and now that you have that final price, would there be an uptick in the Eastern Germany? That\u2019s the first question.","And then the second question is on the study we\u2019re looking at KALYDECO plus tezacafter versus KALYDECO and placebo and the residual function of patients. Is there any requirement for that study to how a benefit of KALYDECO plus tezacafter over KALYDECO monotherapy alone or is it the really compare versus placebo in order for them to be able to be secured? Thank you.","Stuart Arbuckle","Okay, Phil, its Stuart here. I\u2019ll take your question on Germany. Actually we don\u2019t believe that the hesitation to prescribe has been due to uncertainty about the final price that we would agree in Germany. The relatively slow uptake we\u2019ve seen in Germany I think is due to a couple of things. Notably the lack of experience many centers had with CFTR modulators at the launch of KALYDECO because of the fragmented nature of the market and because in general a more conservative nature and approach to new medicines in Germany in that market compared to other markets in Europe.","And so, I\u2019m not really expecting the fact that we\u2019ve been able to reach a final pricing agreement with the German authorities to significantly change the perception of ORKAMBI in the eyes of German physicians.","Jeff Leiden","Phil this is Jeff, on your 661, residual function question, each of the arms KALYDECO monotherapy and 661 plus KALYDECO would be compared to the placebo arm. And in terms of what would be required to get approval is really going to depend on the profiles of each of those. So it\u2019s not only about efficacy, it\u2019s about tolerability, it\u2019s about the overall profile. So when we see the data I think we\u2019ll be able to give you a pretty good sense of which direction we\u2019re going to take that.","Phil Nadeau","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Michael Partridge","That will conclude our call. This is Michael Partridge. Thanks for your questions tonight. Thanks for tuning in. The investor relations team is available for any follow-up that you have after the call. Enjoy the rest of your evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. And you may now disconnect.

Chodakewitz - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Michael. Good evening, everyone. Vertex's strategy in cystic fibrosis is to treat as many people with CF as possible, and to continue to enhance the clinical benefits for those treated by our medicines. Our long-term goal is to reduce the progressive and irreversible effects of CF by treating the underlying cause of the disease. There are three key components to our strategy. First, to increase the number of eligible patients being treated with our approved medicines, mainly by obtaining reimbursement for ORKAMBI for more patients outside of the U.S.","Second, to further expand the labels for KALYDECO and ORKAMBI around the world and third, to develop new combination regimens with CFTR modulators, designed to enhance benefit for all patients.","This evening, I'm pleased to report that we continue to make excellent progress on all of these fronts. Last month, the FDA approved ORKAMBI for the treatment of children with CF, ages six through 11, who have two copies of the F508del mutation. With this approval, approximately 29,000 patients worldwide are now eligible for our medicines. Today, we are treating approximately 9,000 of these 29,000 eligible patients. Moving forward, we remain focused on expanding access to ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, for the many eligible patients, who are still awaiting treatment, largely through obtaining reimbursement for ORKAMBI in Europe, Canada, and Australia. We are also continuing to make progress and our efforts to expand the labels for KALYDECO and ORKAMBI.","In the U.S., we're focused on obtaining approval for KALYDECO in patients with residual function mutations. And in the EU, we expect data this quarter from our Phase 3 trial of ORKAMBI in children ages six through 11, who are homozygous for the F508del mutation. If successful, these would represent approximately 5,000 additional patients, who may benefit from our approved medicines. Beyond this important progress, our long-term goal is to treat all people with CF.","During the last year, we have significantly advanced our CF pipeline, which now spans all phases of research and development. Today, we announced the planned initiation of two separate Phase 2 studies of our next-generation correctors, VX-440 and VX-152 in people with CF, and also a Phase 1 study with third next-generation corrector, VX-659, is part of a triple combination.","These studies represent significant milestones in our efforts to treat as many people with CF as possible and will provide the first safety and clinical efficacy data in patients including het\/min patients for a triple combination regimen that includes a next-generation corrector. We expect to have data from the Phase 2 studies in the second half of 2017. Additionally, we look forward to obtaining Phase 3 data for the combination regimen of VX-661, which now carries the generic name tezacaftor and ivacaftor in the first half of 2017.","As we enter the fourth quarter of 2016, Vertex is a global biotech company that has discovered and developed two breakthrough medicines for people with CF, while broadening our pipeline of future medicines. Our significant revenue growth and return to profitability over the past year are metrics of the kind of company that we are becoming. A company that consistently creates transformative medicines for patients and deliver significant and sustained revenue and earnings growth for our shareholders.","With that, I'll hand the call over to Stuart to discuss the performance of our medicines.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Tonight, I will review the performance of ORKAMBI, our ongoing efforts to obtain reimbursement in Europe, the label expansion for children, ages six through 11 in the United States, and the outlook for KALYDECO.","In the third quarter, global sales of ORKAMBI were $234 million, comprised of U.S. sales of $211 million and ex-U.S. sales of $23 million. This quarter, sales in the U.S. declined compared to the second quarter of this year, largely due to a slowing in refills during the summer months of July and August.","We have now seen the vast majority of these patients refill their prescriptions. The overall compliance and persistence rates, we are observing remain as we outlined earlier in the year. During the quarter, patients in the U.S. continued to initiate treatment at a slower rate as we approach peak penetration in the U.S. for patients aged 12 and over.","As of the end of September, approximately 6,400 patients in the U.S. have initiated therapy on ORKAMBI. Last month, we revised our 2016 ORKAMBI revenue guidance to be between $950 million and $990 million for the full year and we are reiterating that guidance today. U.S. treatment trends were one reason for the revised guidance. And the other main driver was the ongoing launch in Germany, which has been slower than expected. As of September 30, approximately 500 of the 2,500 eligible patients have initiated treatment in Germany.","We remain confident that we will treat the vast majority of eligible patients over time in Germany, but it will take longer than we had originally anticipated to reach that goal. In contrast to Germany, we continue to see a strong demand in France, where approximately 900 of the 1,500 eligible patients have initiated therapy through early access programs as of the end of September.","I would note that we're not recognizing revenue for these patients in France, until we achieve a formal reimbursement agreement. Throughout Europe, reimbursement is progressing as anticipated. While there are unique aspects to each process, reimbursement typically falls into three phases, a clinical benefit assessment, an economic evaluation, and price negotiations. In several countries, benefit assessments and economic evaluations are complete.","We're pleased that government pay us across Europe, recognized the severity of this disease and the broad clinical benefits of ORKAMBI. We have now entered the third phase of the reimbursement process, which includes price negotiations in many key countries. While the process takes time to complete, we believe that we will achieve broad reimbursement from key European and other government payers.","We expect our first pricing agreement in a major European market to come in Germany this December. Pricing and reimbursement approvals for patients eligible for ORKAMBI outside of the U.S. are expected to drive significant revenue growth in 2017.","I will now turn to our recent sNDA approval for ORKAMBI announced last month. We were delighted the FDA approved ORKAMBI for the treatment of children ages six through 11, who have two copies of the F508del mutation and since then we've been working to get the medicine to the approximately 2,400 eligible patients as rapidly as possible. Interest in ORKAMBI for this age group has been very high and our interactions with public and private payers have been productive. We expect broad coverage of ORKAMBI for these patient population, as payers have already evaluated the product after approval last year in patients 12 years and older. Thanks to the commitment of healthcare providers at CF centers across the country. I'm pleased to report the first children ages six through 11 are already receiving ORKAMBI. We expect the launch to drive revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 and in 2017.","Turning to KALYDECO, net revenues for the product were $176 million in the third quarter. We are now treating the vast majority of currently eligible patients and therefore we expect this level of quarterly revenues to be maintained in the near-term unless KALYDECO is approved in CF patients with residual function mutations.","Today there are approximately 29,000 people eligible for ORKAMBI or KALYDECO globally. Yet, we are only treating approximately one-third of these patients. Therefore expanding access to both of our medicines for eligible patients around the world is our top priority.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Chodakewitz.","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Stuart. Tonight, I will review the significant progress we are making with our CF pipeline and I'll start with the Phase 3 program of tezacaftor. We believe the investigational combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor could play an important role in the treatment of people with CF. Enrollment is now complete in the Phase 3 study in F508del homozygous patients and also in the study in people who have residual function mutations.","Data from both studies are expected in the first half of 2017. The Phase 3 study in people with gating mutations is expected to complete enrollment in early 2017. Pending data from the Phase 3 program, we plan to submit an NDA in the U.S. for tezacaftor and ivacaftor in the second half of 2017.","I'd like to turn now to the progression of our next-generation correctors and triple combination regimens. Our research and development strategy is to advance multiple compounds into development on the basis of our predictive preclinical assays and on Phase 1 safety studies, so we can choose the best combinations to evaluate in Phase 3 development.","The advancement of VX-440 and VX-152 into Phase 2, and the selection of VX-659 for clinical development reflect the strategy. VX-440 and VX-152 will evaluate triple combination dosing for four weeks and two weeks respectively. And we'll evaluate both het\/min and F508del homozygous patients. Data from both of these studies are expected in the second half of 2017. The Phase 2 study of VX-440 includes three parts, each has a different strategic objective but shares the same primary endpoints of safety and efficacy as measured by absolute change in lung function.","Slide eight of the webcast, outlines some of the study's key features. Part A is focused on het\/min patients, and part B will enroll F508del homozygous patients. Parts A and B of the study will evaluate triple combination dosing for four weeks, and we expect to have the data in the second half of 2017. The potential initiation of Phase 3 development will depend on these data and discussions with regulatory agencies.","Part C is designed to generate 12-week safety and efficacy data for triple combination dosing in het\/min patients and will run largely in parallel with potential Phase 3 development and we'll evaluate the contribution of the individual components to the overall triple combination regimen.","Slide nine of our webcast outlines the Phase 2 study of VX-152. This study includes two parts; the primary end-point of safety and tolerability, but a key focus will also be looking at measures of efficacy including absolute change in lung function and change in sweat chloride among others. Part A will enroll het\/min patients and Part B will enroll F508del homozygous patients. The VX-152 study will evaluate triple combination dosing for two weeks and data are also expected in the second half of 2017, and are intended to support the potential initiation of a longer duration Phase 2b or registration program, pending data and discussions with regulatory agencies.","Our Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers and other pre-clinical studies provide support for advancing both VX-440 and VX-152 into Phase 2 development, and have informed the designs of the Phase 2 studies we're announcing today.","Based on Phase 1 learnings, we believe VX-440 may have a wider therapeutic window and this is the reason that the VX-440 study will evaluate four-week dosing from the outset. We also noted in our press release today, a specific contraception requirement for females of child bearing potential seeking to enroll in the VX-440 study. This enrollment criterion was based on recent results from pre-clinical development toxicology studies. Based on laboratory findings from our Phase 1 study of VX-152, we're also excluding patients with G6PD deficiency from the Phase 2 studies of VX-152 and also VX-440.","G6PD deficiency and CF prevalence have limited (13:50) geographic overlap and therefore the incidence of G6PD in the CF population is very low. We estimate this impacts less than 1% of all CF patients overall.","I will just make a few comments on the in-vitro profile for VX-659 highlighted here on slide 10. In our HBE assays, the use of a triple combination that contains VX-659 with tezacaftor and ivacaftor resulted in maximal efficacy that was greater than that seen with VX-440 or VX-152 in triple combination.","Additionally, VX-659 is highly potent in-vitro, which makes it favorable for a combination with other molecules. The Phase 1 study of VX-659 will be very similar to those we conducted for VX-440 and VX-152. Pending data from healthy volunteers, we plan to conduct the first evaluation of VX-659 in CF patients as part of the initial Phase 1 study. We expect to initiate Phase 2 development for VX-659 in the second half of 2017, pending data from the Phase 1 study.","Stepping back from the trial designs, we believe, we are in a strong position to define the clinical activity of three different next generation correctors in patients and have data in 2017 that enhance the probability of success for our next-generation corrector program. The studies we are conducting with VX-440 and VX-152 could provide data sufficient to move to pivotal development, accelerating our ability to deliver significant clinical benefits to even more patients than we treat today. I look forward to providing updates on our triple combination regimens as they progress.","Before, I hand the call over to Ian, I did want to mention, one additional clinical milestone we expect to achieve before the end of this year. Data from a Phase 3 efficacy study to support approval for ORKAMBI in children ages six through 11 in Europe is expected in the fourth quarter. Pending data from this study, we plan to submit an MAA variation in the EU in the first half of 2017.","With that, I'll hand the call over to Ian.","Ian F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff. Good evening to everyone. As you've heard tonight, we continue to make significant progress across our business. In my opening remarks today, I will review our third quarter financial results, review our 2016 financial guidance and discuss our anticipated financial trajectory into 2017 and longer-term.","Financial results first. In the third quarter of 2016, we reported total net CF product revenues of approximately $410 million, growing 38% compared to the third quarter of last year, of the number of patients being treated with our medicines significantly increased with the launch of ORKAMBI in July 2015.","Our third quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were $298 million, including R&D expenses of $214 million and SG&A expenses of $84 million. The increased expenses for the third quarter of 2016 compared to 2015 were primarily the result of increased costs related to the progression of our CF pipeline and increased investments in global commercial support for the launch of ORKAMBI. This quarter we recorded a non-GAAP net profit of $40 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $32 million, or $0.13 per share for the third quarter of 2015. This turnaround to profit was driven by a significant increase in revenues compared to the prior year, which outpaced a smaller increase in non-GAAP operating expenses.","From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the third quarter with a strong cash position of $1.1 billion. Additionally, earlier this month, we've replaced our $300 million term loan with a credit agreement that will significantly lower our interest expense and increase our available credit up to $800 million pending certain conditions. We will continue to build upon our strong financial position going forward.","Now, let's turn to 2016 financial guidance. We are reiterating our 2016 ORKAMBI revenue guidance of $950 million to $990 million and within this guidance, we expect ORKAMBI revenues to grow from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2016 as children's ages six through 11 initiate treatment in the U.S.","As Stuart mentioned earlier, the initial signs of these patients initiating therapy are encouraging. And as we look into 2017, we see continued growth for ORKAMBI, primarily driven by gaining reimbursement approvals throughout Europe and continuing pediatric launch in the U.S. We continue to anticipate 2016 KALYDECO net revenues to be between $685 million and $705 million.","As we look forward into 2017, we do not expect significant revenue growth for KALYDECO, if KALYDECO were to be approved in residual function patients that would be the only significant driver of growth for KALYDECO in 2017.","For our operating expenses, we continue to expect our combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be between $1.18 billion and $1.23 billion for the full year. As we look forward to 2017, we anticipate modest growth in operating expenses to support the progression of our CF pipeline and the launch of ORKAMBI in new geographies.","As we continue to increase the number of patients that we treat, we expect our revenues to grow significantly in the coming years, while operating expenses will only increase modestly. We are well on track to deliver financial profile that is similar to many of our large cap biotech peers, which includes high operating margins, sustainable earnings growth, and significant cash generation.","I'll now open the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, good afternoon and thanks for the question and congratulations on the updates on everything, particularly the triple. I guess my question on the next-generation compounds is, can you talk a little bit about what you mean by therapeutic window for VX-440, for VX-152, talk a little bit about safety and tolerability, what you saw in PK. Just give a little more color there, that would be helpful in between the two programs.","And then just a commercial question for you is in the guidance you have given for the year in ORKAMBI, obviously you're launching the six-year olds to 11-year-olds. What type of cadence or ramp do you expect there? What's in your guidance? Is it a similar ramp to the 12-year old and up, even if these are healthier patients? Just want to understand what you're expecting there. Thanks so much.","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Hey, Mike. It's Jeff Chodakewitz. Maybe I'll start, talk about the next-gen program. We are excited as you said to have both molecules progressing into Phase 2. We think that based on our Phase 1 results, and you know that given our ability to use our preclinical assays, we can look at the exposure and have a sense of whoever is going to get to in the clinic, we think that both compounds are going to go into their Phase 2 studies with doses that are both going to be well tolerated and efficacious and I think that's very exciting.","Maybe just to hone in a little bit on your question about therapeutic window, that really comes from both compounds being generally well-tolerated. In VX-152, we did see some GI symptoms mostly nausea and vomiting, and therefore that's the basis for that comment. So for VX-440, we're going right to four week studies and with the potential therefore to accelerate quickly into a Phase 3. And then for VX-152 because of that we are starting with Phase 2 studies and then can extend dosing from that.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And Mike, just to address your question on the six to 11 launch, obviously it's now early days, we've got the approval on the September 28, so we're less than a month in but certainly the early signs are encouraging and you might expect interest is high in using ORKAMBI in this younger patient population. We're making good progress with both, public payers and commercial payers. In terms of securing access and already have approval for about 50% of covered lives which is, obviously, an important prerequisite to getting access to these younger patients, and so, as a result of all that, we are expecting similarly robust uptake for that, which we saw with ORKAMBI in the 12 plus population and that's what's incorporated into our overall guidance.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your question, please?","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Afternoon, guys, thanks for the question and congratulations on the plans for the triple. I just had a couple on that, for either VX-440 or VX-152, can you talk a little bit about what you're looking for FEV1-wise, just from a powering perspective? And then in either Phase 2 is there a washout period for homozygous patients who have had prior exposure to ORKAMBI? And I have one follow-up.","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Hey, Geoff, it's Jeff Chodakewitz. So, again, I think that as you saw from our Phase 2 designs we're really going to be getting a pretty robust look at how both molecules are going to perform. We're really being able to look at both het\/min patients and homozygous patient, which is, I think, very important and the fact that we think that the doses we're going to be taking into Phase 2 can deliver benefit for both populations. That's really \u2013 that's really critical.","Our Phase 2 studies are really not so much powered on any individual number. They're really giving us a good handle on being able to understand what the drugs are capable of doing and to your point, we are going to actually leverage a washout from ORKAMBI, so that people can participate and we're going to importantly look after the end of dosing and because we think that that follow-up period coming off of treatment actually has been, can be very informative in terms of having confidence in the result. So, that gives you a sense.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got you. Okay. And just real quick, in the past, you guys have talked about between VX-661 and VX-809, things like tissue penetration differences, half-life differences. Any way to generally characterize what you would say are differences between VX-659, VX-440, and VX-152 just from maybe a PK or chemistry perspective?","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So, Geoff, maybe I'll just quickly take that because that question is just frequently asked. There are small differences between compounds. I think the major difference is that they are structurally different.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got you. Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two from me. Just on the second-gen correctors, can you give us any insight in terms of the dose-limiting talks in the animal models? Was the GI seen there? And then on VX-440, just wondering some more details on the design of Part C of that trial. I was wondering if you have regulatory sign-off to run that as part of Phase 2 rather than include in Phase 3. Thanks.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So, I think in terms of our Phase 1, I think I have given you actually quite the flavor on what we've seen with the \u2013 in the healthy volunteers, good tolerability overall. I mentioned the nausea and vomiting. I should clarify that that was at doses \u2013 that was absorbed at doses higher than the doses that we're going to be talking into Phase 2, that's how we think about being sure that we have a therapeutic window.","In terms of the pre-clinical data, I really can't comment on that level of detail, and of course everything we do as we go forward will be confirmed with regulatory agency.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then on the VX-440 Part C?","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I was \u2013 sorry Terence, I was going to that part of your question. We can't comment on the individual discussions we're having with regulatory agencies. I think to your \u2013 as we talked about that, that is going to accomplish several things. It's going to help us understand the performance of the triple, it's importantly going to give us data on 12-weeks of dosing, and depending on the results that we're seeing as we said this data actually could be done, basically in parallel with Phase 3 study.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Is that the triple versus each of the sub component, each \u2013 versus mono of each of the three drugs or is it versus a doublet?","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","No. It's really primarily about triple versus doublets.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ying Huang of Bank of America. Your question, please.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. And it's great to hear the Phase 2 advancing for the new CF correctors (27:40). So maybe for Steve, you mentioned that 6,400 patients now have started treatment in U.S. for ORKAMBI. That leaves to about another 2,000 patients. Is there a reason we should think of why those 2,000 patients would not initiate therapy, if that's possible? And then secondly, I have a question on, maybe Jeff, on the Phase 2 protocol for these two molecules. Do you think as what we've seen with KALYDECO in G551D patients and also ORKAMBI in homozygous F508 deletion patients, two weeks or even four weeks should be long enough to see a significant improvement in lung function given that these patients have the (28:19) mutation? Thank you.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Ying, so thanks for the question. Yes, over 6,400 patients have initiated therapy on ORKAMBI and we're obviously delighted with that. It's over 70% of the eligible patients, but as you said that means that 2,000 are yet to be initiated. Obviously the individual decision about whether a physician and patient want to initiate therapy is one that they have to come to themselves, but we are certainly continuing to see new patients being initiated as we deliver and develop more evidence about the long-term benefits of ORKAMBI, I think that's giving physicians, patients even more reasons to think about whether they would want to be initiated on ORKAMBI. And on the Phase 2 question, I'll hand that over to Jeff.","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Stuart. Hi, Ying, as you note, we obviously don't have data yet for the triple, but everything that we've seen across our portfolio with modulating CFTR really suggests that both the two-week and the four-week studies are going to be able to give us valuable insights into the potential efficacy of the regimens.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alethia Young of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the progress in Phase 2. On the corrector front with some of these new correctors, I guess how do you think broadly about positioning of these assets? And like you know with the VX-440 and VX-152 compounds, would you think about moving both into Phase 3? And then I have one question about Europe.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, Alethia, this is Jeff Leiden, that's more of a strategy question, so maybe I'll take that and first I'll just remind you that our strategy all along has been to develop a portfolio of next-generation correctors, really for two reasons, one they do have different properties, they come in different flavors and we really want to see those different flavors in people and understand how they perform and two, there is a probability of success issue here, right? By bringing three or four of these different correctors into Phase 1 and now in this case Phase 2 studies, it increases the probability of success that will come up with the best regimens for each of the patient populations.","And while we can predict an awful lot from our preclinical cellular-based assays, because they predicted quite well on the efficacy front, as a couple of folks noted before, there can be differences in potency and maximal efficacy in drug-like properties and those are best seen really from these Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials and we're learning a lot as we go about these different molecules.","Would we ever take two molecules into Phase 3 development? It's absolutely possible just as you've seen with lumacaftor and VX-661, two first-generation correctors because they may also have different profiles. It's just going to depend on the data that we see from these Phase 2 studies, but I think the important thing is the strategy we're taking is this portfolio strategy.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great, thanks. And then on Europe for Stuart perhaps, maybe with some of the reimbursement conversations, do you find them kind of a different flavor as you go through each country, or there kind of similar themes on what you kind of payers are concerned about for ORKAMBI?","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. So the concerns and questions that we get, Alethia, are very consistent. As we've said a number of times, while each process is different, they tend to kind of orient themselves around three phases. One is a discussion of the clinical benefits of ORKAMBI. And in general, we've been very pleased that payers across Europe have recognized the broad clinical benefits of ORKAMBI.","Then there is an economic evaluation and after that phase you enter into the price negotiations. And so, while each process is different in each different country, they tend to follow that same pattern, and they are kind of proceeding as we anticipated.","And I'd say the last thing is that in addition to evaluating the clinical benefits from an economic perspective, they're concerned about the overall budget impact it might have for them in their individual country.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams of Jefferies. Your question, please.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Hey, thank you for taking my questions. And my congrats as well on the progress of the next-gen correctors. Two questions, first, I was wondering if you might be able to expand upon the comments you made regarding preclinical tox studies that led you to include contraception and exclude the G6PD deficiency patients for the VX-440 studies. Was that something just related to a hormonal interaction?","And then, on the commercial side, I realize it's very early days, but just wondering if you had any sense of compliance and persistence, or at least compliance in the six year old to 11 year old patients relative to what you've seen in adults thus far?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So, Brian, it's Jeff Chodakewitz. I'll start and then turn it over. Just want to be sure I understand your question. For the preclinical data for VX-440 and contraception, I believe there are a set of standard studies that are done actually on rabbits. And there we test the development of toxicity, the effects of the drug and we did find for VX-440 that they were some abnormality suggesting a potential deleterious effect on the fetus. We don't know whether that actually translates to people, but the prudent thing to do clearly, is to ensure that women in the study are using highly effective contraception and that's what we flagged that we'll be doing that in our Phase 2 study with VX-440.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And on your compliance question, as you say, it's very early days yet, we're just one month into the launch in the six year to 11 year old children. However I think, there are some reasons to be optimistic that the compliance rates there could be higher than we see in teenagers and in young adults. Certainly, that's what we've seen with KALYDECO and that's not atypical for what you see in other chronic disease, is where clearly these young kids are largely, if not exclusively under the supervision of their parents and therefore, compliance rates tend to be at the higher end of the spectrum.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks very much. I have, two things that I just wanted to ask. So, I guess, both on next-generation correctors. One, can you just compare and contrast, what you would expect to learn from two-weeks of dosing versus four-weeks of dosing and how you would correlate whatever signals you're going to get out of that? How you might move those compounds ahead? And then, second question is can you just tell us the dose levels of VX-152 and VX-440 that you're using in these Phase 2 studies?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Hi, Matthew, it's Jeff Chodakewitz. So, let me talk about the two-weeks and four-weeks, because we're actually going to have very similar end-point in both. And as we spoke about earlier actually, we think that both two-weeks and four-weeks are going to be able to give us meaningful information. We're also going to have sweat chloride being evaluated in both trials which will also be valuable.","Ultimately, what we're going to do is use all the information, we actually also have a lot work being done to actually understands from a modeling perspective, so that we can get the absolute most information out of our clinical trials. And so we're going to use all that information across both to make the best decisions and we think that that will contribute to both.","I think in terms of the specifics of the doses as you may see in this design, we're going to go into patients with the small cohort, that's really just to confirm that that exposure is the same in patients as it is in healthy volunteers, we don't have any reasons to think that it will be different or we're going to do that just to be sure, we're taking the right approach. And then we'll choose our doses from there to confirm for the rest of the trials.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of Leerink Partners. Your line is open.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much for taking the questions and congratulations on advancing some more CF compounds. First, just wondering if on slide 10, you could tell us, where VX-152 fitted compared to VX-440 in tezacaftor in that assay? And then a couple of commercial questions. Ian, you've been fairly clear about, what we should be expecting for KALYDECO in 2017, and there have, certainly, been some ups and downs in both consensus and in guidance this year for ORKAMBI.","So, wondering where you would suggest that we sort of should be bracketing for next year for ORKAMBI. There are certainly a lot of variables with Europe, with the pediatric indication coming online in the U.S. so that would be helpful?","And then, Stuart, lastly, as you're negotiating price in Europe, could you give us a sense of how you're thinking about having a portfolio of CF combinations? Are you expecting to have them at different price points, so should we be thinking that over time, they gravitate towards a band, regardless of whether it's two or three drugs in the combination? Thanks.","David Matthew Altshuler - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks for the question. This is David Altshuler. I'll take the first part. As we showed last year in the het\/min cells and also homozygous cells, VX-152 and VX-440 have very similar levels of max efficacy.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Ian F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And Geoff, to your question on guidance, I was very clear on KALYDECO in my prepared remarks, where KALYDECO is treating roughly 90% of eligible patients that it's \u2013 and it has a very good persistence rate and compliance rate, and we'd anticipate that continuing on into next year.","So, as you see the current quarterly run rate for KALYDECO, we see that continuing on in 2017, the market for that potentially increasing would be if we were able to gather residual function approval, and as Jeff Chodakewitz explained, we are currently in discussions with the regulatory authorities in the U.S. regarding that approval and that continues that discussion.","Regarding ORKAMBI, it's still too early to say. We're very comfortable with the guidance we've provided through the end of this year of $950 million to $990 million and that does include the recent pediatric approval.","As we look to 2017, we'll probably thinking about how we give guidance around the U.S. market and maybe Germany as well, because we do have visibility and knowledge to those markets in terms of the other international markets of how quickly and the timing that they come on, we just need to get that some thought over the next few months of whether we actually try to provide a bracket around that guidance, there is a certain unknown elements but I'm sure, you can appreciate with these discussions and sometimes the discussions push out because you are actually holding out for a price that you believe is appropriate for the medicine.","And so, it's about us getting to the right spot and rather than putting guidance around it and be forced around guidance, we'll give it some consideration of how we put a bracket around that and we'll be back to you early in 2017.","And then to your third question, I'll pass it over to Stuart.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thank you.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Hey, Geoff. In terms of pricing principles, obviously, we can't comment on the pricing of future products, but I'll talk to our pricing principles overall, which have been very consistent for how we priced KALYDECO and ORKAMBI and the two primary drivers and really the number of patients that we're able to benefit with our medicines, and then the level of clinical benefit or value that we're able to bring. And I think, you've seen that we adhere to those principles with ORKAMBI and whilst we don't have formal pricing agreements in place across Europe, yet, you have seen with the list prices of ORKAMBI that they are lower than they are for KALYDECO, which reflects the fact that clearly ORKAMBI is \u2013 has a much wider eligible patient populations despite the fact that medicine has two different components within it. So, I think you can expect that we'll be adhering to those pricing principles as we bring next-gen correctors and other medicines to market for eligible CF patients.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from John Scotti of Evercore ISI. Your question, please.","John Scotti - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Congrats on all the progress. I just wanted to ask on VX-659, if you were to compare the preclinical toxicity profile of that asset to VX-440 with regard to what the potential teratogenicity et cetera, and then VX-152 with the nausea, are you confident that the chemical structure of VX-659 is different enough where we won't see those issues in humans in the clinic with regard to what we see with VX-440 and VX-152?","And then I guess just quickly on timing, given the trials are small and if we assume they enroll quickly, is it unreasonable to assume that we could see data more towards mid-next-year rather than towards the end of the year, I know, you've guided the second half? Thanks.","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So, John, first of all, I just want to pass on the team's best wishes to Mark and we look forward to...","John Scotti - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks, thanks \u2013 thank you so much.","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","...hearing back from Mark at some point, and I'm sure, I share everybody else's thoughts that are on the phone. In terms of the question, I'm actually going to ask Jeff Leiden to answer it because there is a whole portfolio approach here that we have starting from VX-659 and the methodology of how we pick our molecules and what that basis is. And you should anticipate that the world, there will be more molecules coming, so. So, Jeff?","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the question, John. Maybe just to go back one step and remind you of how we look at these molecules and select them. So, first real acid test for these molecules is our human HBE cells, both het\/min cells and homozygous cells from multiple donors.","And as we showed you, I think in one of the slides today, VX-659 actually has efficacy as measured by chloride transport, which is maximal efficacy that's significantly higher than what we were seeing in VX-440 and VX-152, which were also quite high by themselves by the way.","We've also measured a number of other things in that assay, like cilia beat frequency (45:38) and others and we see the same kind of difference between the VX-659 and VX-440.","We then put the molecules through a pretty rigorous stream with respect to PK, tox co-formulability, really making sure that we're bringing the drugs into the clinic as oppose to molecules. And we're done with most, but not all of that for six, five times, we're certainly done with enough that so we feel very comfortable that we have a tox profile and the PK profile, that we're confident in taking into Phase 1 studies, both in normal and in patients this time as well. We have not done yet with the developmental studies in rabbits and we don't have that data yet and obviously we don't have any human data, which is the final test of PK and safety and we'll only see that in the Phase 1 study.","In addition just as Ian mentioned just meeting the clear expectations, we have a number of other next-gen correctors, in our late preclinical pipeline we expect to bring at least one of those forward into the clinic in the first half of next year and maybe more and the reason for that again is that these molecules come in a number of different flavors, different policies, different properties and we want to bring a multiple of them into humans as part of triple combinations to understand how they interact.","I hope that gives a flavor of where VX-659 sits and what we know and some things we don't yet know, but we'll know soon.","John Scotti - Evercore Group LLC","That's really helpful. Thank you. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney of Robert W. Baird. Your question, please.","Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, good afternoon, guys. I have two questions. I guess why both \u2013 why start both programs in het\/min, it seems like you'd potentially get more information out of adding this on top of VX-661 ivacaftor in patients with two F508del alleles, and also when we look at the relative differences of the four generations, is it reasonable to assume that two correctors within the same generation still are redundant? And is there any obvious redundancy to cross combining correctors of the different generations?","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, Brian, it's Jeff, again. Let me answer both. Both are really good questions. Maybe I'll answer your second question first. Really the portfolio approach is based upon the fact that while the molecules may bind to the same site, they may even have the same mechanism of action. There are obviously a number of other properties that are going to be really important in picking the best regimen. They include potency because the more potent a molecule is the easier it is to combine into a triple combination of formulae.","They include maximal efficacy, obviously and we showed you that VX-659 as an example has a greater maximal efficacy, but they also include things like PK properties, tissue penetration, drug-drug interactions, all of those things. And so when you think about this portfolio, think about it not only in terms of mechanism of action and not only in terms of efficacy and potency, but think about it as, how do we create the best triple regimen with one or more of these molecules going forward. Does that make sense to you in terms of how we're thinking about it?","Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, that is helpful.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And then repeat your first question for me?","Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Just on the strategy of going in het\/min first.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yes, so just to be clear about what we're doing here. First of all het\/min obviously is the big group of patients with the largest unmet need. And so as we think about taking these molecules forward, that's the patient population that we are most focused on, but I do want to be clear that we're essentially doing these things in parallel. And so we will have results both in the het\/min population and the homozygous population essentially at the same time or with very little delay and that's going to let us really design the best Phase 3 study I think here.","One of the things that I've really been pleased with over the last four years or five years is as we've developed these molecules, we've learned an awful lot about how to take the development forward. Most quickly, most efficiently and then how to start to think about Phase 3 trials, perhaps a little differently, and so I do think you're seeing the results of that here as we sort of streamline these Phase 2 trials, do them in parallel as opposed to in series, as we've done it in the past and then hopefully based on the results of course launch into Phase 3 in a much broader fashion than we've done previously.","Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks, Jeff. That's helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Liisa Bayko of JMP Securities. Your line is open.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. And just to clarify, there is no intention to formulate maybe a quad or something, you wouldn't add some of your next-generation correctors together and I guess why not would be the question?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yes, so as a theoretical question, Liisa, of course we would think about quads, and as you know we're also looking at some other mechanisms of action, things like ENaC inhibitors that could be combined. So there is nothing a priori that says that we wouldn't look at four drug combinations. Obviously, the ENaC inhibitors inhaled, so it wouldn't be co-formulated but I do think there is one difference here that's worth mentioning. I think it would be unlikely that for instance that we would put VX-152 and VX-440 together because they do appear to have the same mechanism of action and so adding them together would be not expected to produce a lot more benefit.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. And then, can you maybe talk about where you're going to be enrolling patients for some of these preliminary studies for the next-generation? Is it going to be North America, ex-U.S.?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Hi, this is Jeff Chodakewitz. We're actually going to be doing studies in sites both in the U.S. and in Europe.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, just wanted to get a little bit more clarity on the hormonal component, I think you maybe talked about this earlier for VX-440 and what you've seen there in your preclinical stuff and then what that would just mean, if you were to take it forward? Thank you.","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sure. This is Jeff Chodakewitz again. So just to clarify perhaps, we've already talked about the rapid toxicity and why we're putting the contraceptive language in place. The hormonal wording doesn't actually come from preclinical studies, with VX-440 at higher doses there was some evidence of liver enzyme induction and that can actually somewhat lower the exposure to the hormones in contraceptives. And so therefore again, to ensure that we're using highly reliable contraception, where excluding that as being the primary method.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tony Butler of Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.","Tony Butler - Guggenheim Partners","Thanks very much. Two questions briefly. And cohort 1a, can you help me understand the notion of using the low dose first before you move forward, while it may be intuitive you don't do that for VX-152? And then the second question is really around VX-152. To me you've outlined very well the portfolio strategy, why certainly you're moving forward with VX-440 and VX-659. But is the only reason for VX-152 the fact that it does not have teratogenicity? Thanks again.","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Hi, Tony. It's Jeff Chodakewitz. So two comments, one the 1a as we go back to sort of a prior conversation, the intent of 1a is to go make the transition from healthy volunteers to patients and be sure basically as the exposure is similar in the two groups. And since it could potentially go up or down, although we don't expect it to do either, that's why we wouldn't want to go in at a high dose and then have the exposure actually end up higher. That's why we always would start in this kind of situation with the low dose and then expand, which is the intent.","In terms of your broader question about the VX-152 and VX-440, I think it goes actually back to Jeff Leiden's comment that we think both molecules will have the potential to be well-tolerated at doses that can deliver benefit to patients, including excitingly both homozygous patients and het\/min patients, we don't have a treatment option, and that's really why we're taking both forward and we'll continue to learn as we have other molecules to our portfolio.","Michael Partridge - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, it's Michael Partridge, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Yes, sir. And that question comes from the line of Alan Carr of Needham & Company. Your question, please.","Alan Carr - Needham & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks for taking my question and congratulations on progress. Wondering if you could clarify a bit some of the timing around VX-152, VX-440, and the results from those and the results from your VX-659 phase to \u2013 are you trying to \u2013 are you going to be able to position these three \u2013 a data from three Phase 2 trials at the same time in order to decide which one or two to bring into Phase 3?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So, Alan, this is Jeff Chodakewitz. Let me just review how that winds up of course in the end, all these timeline, particularly the Phase 2 studies are going to be dependent on the rate of enrollment, but what we expect would be that for both VX-152 and VX-440 that we will be getting results as we've said in the second half of 2017. At that point, we will also have the Phase 1 results from VX-659 as we talked about that's given everything, we've learned about the relationship from pre-clinical to exposure to benefit a patient, we think that we will be able to understand a lot about all three compounds as we're looking forward to make decisions at that point.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Okay. This is Jeff Leiden. I just wanted to be clear that we don't think about VX-659 as being on exactly the same timeframe as VX-152 and VX-440 and as Jeff said, it's a little difficult to give you precision, because it depends on how fast user enrolled. VX-659 will only have a small cohort of patients in the Phase 1 and so we'll have to see what we learn from that. But if you were to ask me just to put a sort of marker on the table, I think that VX-659, myself, is about six months behind VX-152 and VX-440. So, we're not going to be waiting obviously if we see positive results with VX-152 and VX-440 before taking those into Phase 3 to wait for VX-659, if that's really the question.","Alan Carr - Needham & Co. LLC","Yeah. Okay. That helps. And then one other one, I guess, can you give us an update on VX-371, where do you think you stand with your CF program and ciliary dyskinesia there?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So, it's Jeff Chodakewitz. For both of our studies, both the study in CF where we're looking at the ENaC inhibitor on top of ORKAMBI and in people who are homozygous for F508del and the study in patients with PCD, both are actively enrolling.","Alan Carr - Needham & Co. LLC","And timing for results, what's the latest on that?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","It's always going to be \u2013 of course until we end up getting the study fully enrolled, it's just too hard to give you any precision, I'm sorry.","Alan Carr - Needham & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks very much. I appreciate you taking my questions.","Michael Partridge - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Okay. Everybody thanks for joining us tonight. For those of you going to the North American CF Conference, we look forward to seeing you there, on Thursday night this week. We will also be webcasting our presentation there, starting at 6:30 PM Eastern Time on Thursday. Tonight, the Investor Relations team will remain in the office, if you have any additional questions.

Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Partridge","Thank you, operator, and good evening to everyone. Joining me on tonight's call are Dr. Jeff Leiden, Vertex's Chairman and CEO; Bob Kauffman, Chief Medical Officer; Stuart Arbuckle, Chief Commercial Officer; and Ian Smith, Chief Financial Officer.","Jeff will begin with a few comments on the execution of our strategy to date in 2013. Then Bob will provide an update on our pipeline progress, including our mid- and late-stage programs in cystic fibrosis and hepatitis C. Stuart will follow with comments on trends for key marketed medicines, KALYDECO and INCIVEK. And to close, Ian will review the second quarter financial results and update our 2013 guidance. Following prepared remarks, Peter Mueller, Chief Scientific officer, will join us for a question-and-answer period.

These risks and uncertainties are discussed in detail in our 10-K and 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and also in the press release announcing our financial results tonight.","These statements, including without limitation, those regarding the commercial performance of INCIVEK and KALYDECO, our development plans and expectations and our guidance, are based on management's current assumptions. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and events to differ materially.","GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this call. The information regarding our use of these measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is available in our second quarter 2013 financial press release and is described on Slide 4 of tonight's webcast.","I'll now turn it over to Jeff.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Thanks, Michael. Good evening, everyone. Tonight, I'm pleased to discuss the progress that Vertex has made in the first half of 2013. At the start of this year, we outlined 3 strategic comparatives for our business that would position us for long-term growth: first, prioritizing our development investment to advance our late-stage medicines for cystic fibrosis, hepatitis C and autoimmune diseases; second, focus on continuing to discover innovative medicines for serious diseases from our research efforts; and third, maintaining our financial strength to support the investment acquired to realize our significant growth opportunities in the near future.","Halfway through 2013, we have accomplished a great deal to advance our late-stage medicines, and we continue to reinvest in research to bring further groundbreaking therapies to patients, all while enhancing our financial strength.","In cystic fibrosis, KALYDECO has been successfully launched for G551D patients in Europe this year. We have multiple studies under way that could potentially expand the KALYDECO label. Today, we're announcing the first clinical data for ivacaftor monotherapy outside of G551D. Ivacaftor monotherapy has received breakthrough designation from the FDA, and we plan to submit regulatory filings in the U.S. and the EU in the second half of 2013 to expand the use of ivacaftor.","Our Phase III program for VX-809 or lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor is under way to evaluate 6 months of treatment in approximately 1,000 patients homozygous for the F Delta 508 (sic) [Delta F508] mutation. We are on track to submit an NDA in the U.S. for this combination in 2014.","The combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor has also received breakthrough designation from the FDA. In the second quarter, we reported Phase II data with another corrector, VX-661, that further validated the strategy of combining a corrector and a potentiator to treat CF patients with 2 copies of the Delta 508 mutation. In the second half of 2013, we plan to conduct a study of VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor in G551D Delta 508 heterozygous patients. Our in vitro data supports the potential for further benefit for these patients.","In hepatitis C, we have generated nearly $450 million in hepatitis C revenues and royalties in the first half of this year. We have initiated multiple studies of VX-135 in combination with ribavirin and, separately, in combination with daclatasvir. Despite the partial clinical hold placed on the U.S. study, our strategy remains clear to identify all-oral, high-viral cure regimens containing VX-135 with durations of 12 weeks or less in multiple genotypes.","Commercially, we continue to generate significant revenue in the hepatitis C market with INCIVEK-based therapy, although the number of new patients initiating treatment continues to decline.","In CF, KALYDECO reimbursement and uptake in Europe has been very strong, resulting in significant growth in our KALYDECO revenues. Financially, we enhanced our strength by seeking to maximize revenues while making prudent investments focused on R&D and controlling expenses. These actions are reflected in our Q2 results.","Importantly, we ended the quarter with over $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities with no outstanding convertible debt. In summary, we are creating hope for people with CF and HCV, value for shareholders and a platform for long-term growth by executing on our strategy.","Now I'll turn it over to Bob.","Robert Kauffman","Thank you, Jeff, and good evening. Tonight, I'll review the status and timing of our 3 ongoing studies with VX-135. Then I'll also review our CF development pipeline and provide a few updates based on our progress to date.","First, VX-135 for hepatitis C. We have initiated a 12-week study of 100 milligrams and 200 milligrams of VX-135 plus daclatasvir in 20 genotype 1 patients in New Zealand. Pending data from this initial cohort of patients, we plan to expand the study to enroll additional patients with both genotypes 1 and 3 and to evaluate an 8-week combination regimen in genotype 1. Safety and efficacy results from the first part of the study are expected to be available in early 2014.","In our European study of VX-135 plus ribavirin, 20 patients, 10 in each of the 100-milligram and 200-milligram arms, have now completed 12 weeks of dosing. Both the 100-milligram and 200-milligram doses were well tolerated, with no discontinuations and no serious adverse events reported. 100% of patients achieved undetectable HCV RNA during the 12-week dosing period and 70% -- and 80% of patients in the 100- and 200-milligram dosing arms, respectively, had undetectable virus within 4 weeks of initiating treatment. We expect to provide complete safety and efficacy results from the 100- and 200-milligram arms in the second half of 2013.","In the U.S., dosing and evaluation is ongoing in the study of 100 milligrams of VX-135 plus ribavirin. 10 patients with genotype 1 hepatitis C are enrolled in this dose group, and all patients have now completed at least 10 weeks of treatment. We are working to provide to the FDA the requested clinical, preclinical and pharmacokinetic data from ongoing VX-135 studies with the goal of resolving the partial clinical hold and supporting the evaluation of the 200-milligram dose of VX-135 in the U.S. We expect to complete submission of the requested data to the FDA in the fourth quarter. Safety and efficacy results from the 100-milligram arm of the study are expected to be available later this year.","In addition, our partner, J&J, has completed a drug-drug interaction study of VX-135 in combination with simeprevir in healthy volunteers, and we expect dosing to commence in genotype 1 patients in the second half of 2013, pending data analysis and dose selection.","Our strategy continues to be one of identifying high-viral cure regimens of 12 weeks or less effective in multiple genotypes, and we have multiple trials planned or under way to fulfill this strategy.","Now moving to cystic fibrosis. Our most advanced compound is KALYDECO, which is indicated for the treatment of G551D patients over the age of 6. We are studying this compound, known generically as ivacaftor, in a number of additional patient populations that we believe have the potential to benefit from KALYDECO based on in vitro data, along with our understanding of the disease biology and KALYDECO mechanism of action.","We have 3 Phase III label expansion studies under way, and we reported top line results in the first of these studies, the non-G551D gating study today. Ivacaftor produced statistically significant lung function improvements in patients with benign characterized non-G551D gating mutations.","This was a blinded crossover study design. A schematic of the study is shown on Slide 11 of the webcast. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either ivacaftor or placebo for 8 weeks then go through a 4-week washout and then receive the alternate treatment for 8 weeks, that is through weeks 12 to 20. This study included 39 participants ages 6 and over, who have at least one of the 9 characterized non-G551D gating mutations. The primary endpoint was absolute change from baseline with [ph] percent predicted at FEV1.","In this study, the mean absolute treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo was 10.7%, with the p value of less than 0.0001, and the mean relative difference was 14.2%, again, with the p value of less than 0.0001, as measured by FEV1 through the 8-week treatment period. The mean, absolute and relative FEV1 improvements during ivacaftor treatment, that is the within-group changes, were 7.5% and 10.8%, respectively. Both were highly significant with p values of less than 0.0001. We also achieved statistical significance for secondary endpoints of weight gain and improvement in the respiratory domain of the CFQ-R, the patient reported quality of life measure. Safety was similar to the experience to date with KALYDECO and G551D. Ivacaftor was well tolerated, and in the study, the most common adverse events were pulmonary exacerbation, cough, headache and abdominal pain, each occurring more frequently while patients received placebo.","These results are another example of the correlation of clinical data with in vitro chloride transport data that we have seen across the CF program. In the second half of 2013, we expect to present full data from this study at a medical meeting. Also in the second half of 2013, we intend to file both an sNDA in the U.S. and an MAA variation in Europe for use of ivacaftor in patients with other gating mutations.","We have 2 additional Phase III label expansion studies ongoing in CF patients. In patients with the R117H mutation and in children ages 2 through 5 with the gating mutation, including G551D. Slide 12 shows the design of each of these studies. We expect the results from the R117H study in the second half of this year and pending study results we expect to submit an sNDA in early 2014.","In the study in children ages 2 through 5, we have now completed the PK portion of the study, and we have selected a dose. Enrollment in the 20 4-week dosing portion of this study is now ongoing, and we expect results in mid-2014.","We are also conducting a proof-of-concept study in patients with residual CFTR function, also known as the n-of-1 study. The design of this study is shown on Slide 13. Like the gating study, the n-of-1 study has a crossover design. Crossover designs have increased power to show a treatment effect by focusing on the drug-on and drug-off effects in individual patients, which may reduce variability. Data from this study are expected in the first half of 2014. Our CFTR corrector lumacaftor or VX-809 is in 2 global Phase III studies, TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT, to determine its efficacy and safety in people with 2 copies of the F508del mutation. Site initiation and recruitment is going well, and we expect to complete enrollment in both studies in the second half of 2013, and we are on track for reporting data and submitting an NDA and MAA in 2014.","As part of the lumacaftor registration program, we are planning to start an 8-week study of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in F508del heterozygous patients in the U.S. in the second half of 2013. This placebo-controlled, Phase II study is part of our registration package agreed with the FDA earlier this year and is expected to enroll about 80 patients randomized between active and placebo arms. Based on our prior data in this population, we do not anticipate that the lumacaftor and ivacaftor combination will have a clinically meaningful benefit for heterozygous patients, but the study has been requested by the FDA for labeling purposes.","Tonight, we are also announcing a new study for VX-661, another corrector we have in clinical development. We plan to evaluate VX-661 plus ivacaftor in a proof-of-concept clinical study for the mechanism of using a corrector and potentiator in heterozygous patients, who have the G551D mutation, a gating mutation on 1 allele and F508del on the other allele. The patients who enroll in this study will already be receiving KALYDECO as labeled in the U.S. and EU. We expect to start this 4-week Phase II study shortly in approximately 20 patients and report data in late 2013 or early 2014.","In addition, we are planning to start a Phase II proof-of-concept study with the corrector, VX-983, pending the outcome of ongoing studies and discussions with regulators. The results from these Phase II studies with VX-661 and VX-983 will be important factors, as we consider which molecule to prioritize for further development as part of dual- or triple-combination regimens.","We are also actively working to advance second-generation correctors that act on a different part of the CFTR holding process and could be used as part of the dual-corrector regimen, along with ivacaftor, to further enhance benefit for patients who are homozygous or heterozygous for F508del. Our goal is to bring a second-generation corrector into clinical development by the end of 2014.","At the recent ECSF (sic) [ECFS] meeting, Dr. Fred Van Goor of Vertex presented data that showed a combination of 2 correctors plus ivacaftor nearly doubled chloride transport in human bronchial epithelial cells with 2 copies of the F508del mutation compared to the use of a single corrector plus ivacaftor.","In summary, we are pleased to have a full pipeline of medicines that may provide life-changing treatment for more people with CF.","And now, I'll turn it over to Stuart.","Stuart A. Arbuckle","Thank you, Bob, and good evening. I'll provide some background and commentary on our approved medicines, INCIVEK for genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C infection; and KALYDECO for CF patients, who have the G551D mutation.","Starting with INCIVEK. Since launching INCIVEK in May 2011, we've treated more than 65,000 patients in the U.S. and Canada then recorded approximately $2.5 billion in cumulative revenues. While we see ongoing demand for hepatitis C treatment for motivated patients and those who need to be treated now, we are seeing a decline in the number of patients treated in anticipation of the next generation of medicines to treat hepatitis C. We expect this decline to continue for the remainder of the year. However, INCIVEK continues to generate significant revenues, and so is an important component of building the financial strength we need to fund our future opportunities.","Our net revenues from INCIVEK in North America were $156 million in the second quarter, as we maintained our market-leading position even in this declining market. Outside of the U.S., telaprevir performed well in the first half of 2013. The availability of INCIVO marketed by Janssen has expanded to additional countries, and based on Janssen's sales in the second quarter, Vertex earned $44 million in royalties in Q2. This was largely driven by performance in Latin America. However, the outlook for INCIVO for the remainder of 2013 is difficult to forecast due to seasonal prescribing patterns and the potential reduction in patients initiating therapy in advance of new regimens entering the market.","Moving to KALYDECO. Worldwide revenues were $99 million for the second quarter of 2013, including U.S. sales of $55 million, based on the rapid adoption of KALYDECO in the U.S., following our launch in early 2012.","Over the first half of this year, we have successfully completed reimbursement discussions in most of the major EU markets, including England, Scotland, Ireland, Northern Ireland and Wales, and made KALYDECO available for the many patients who need it. Since then, we have seen a similar pattern of rapid uptake of KALYDECO as we saw in the U.S. last year. I'm proud of the incredibly effective efforts of our field organization, which, together with the dedicated health care providers who care for CF patients, have enabled us to begin treating nearly all the eligible G551D patients in the EU.","We achieved approximately $44 million in KALYDECO sales outside of the U.S. in the second quarter, which represents significant growth over the first quarter. This figure does include approximately $2.5 million of inventory build in Europe.","We do not see further meaningful growth for KALYDECO in 2013. However, we do see 3 potential drivers for revenue growth beginning in 2014, subject to the successful completion of reimbursement and regulatory discussions and likely to occur at different times throughout the year.","First, achieving public reimbursement in Australia and Canada. KALYDECO was approved in Australia earlier this month and is the third largest potential market for KALYDECO after the U.S. and England, with approximately 200 eligible G551D patients over the age of 6. We estimate that there are approximately 100 eligible G551D patients in Canada.","Second, regulatory approvals for patients with non-G551D gating mutations based on the data that Bob described earlier. This could allow for an expanded label as early as the first half of 2014, where we could begin to add as many as 400 additional cystic fibrosis patients globally, based on a label for all gating mutations.","Third, potential for future growth in non-gating mutations, such as residual function patients, including R117H. This will be based on successful outcomes from the ongoing clinical trials that Bob described earlier.","In summary, I'm pleased with the progress we've made in the first half of 2013 and would like to thank all of those who have contributed to these results.","And now, I'll turn it over to Ian.","Ian F. Smith","Thank you, Stuart. I'll start by reaffirming our business and financial strategy. We're investing and advancing important medicines to drive sustained long-term revenue and earnings growth. Our goal during this period is to maintain financial strength by prioritizing our spend towards R&D and balancing our expenses with revenues while protecting our balance sheet. I'm happy to report that we remain nicely on track.","Now to the second quarter 2013 results. Total revenues were $311 million. Our GAAP -- total non-GAAP operating expenses, excluding cost of revenues and other charges, were $281 million for non-GAAP loss of $6.2 million or $0.03 per share.","From a balance sheet perspective, we completed the quarter with over $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and no convertible debt. This was the result of the June debt-to-equity conversion. These results, specifically our balance sheet strength, will enable us to continue to maintain our investment in our priority medicines.","Now to the more detailed results. In the second quarter, total KALYDECO revenues were approximately $99 million. EU uptake in the second quarter exceeded our expectations, and KALYDECO is now treating nearly all of the eligible G551D patients in the U.S. and EU. As such, we are raising our guidance for 2013 KALYDECO revenues to $345 million to $360 million.","INCIVEK revenues in the second quarter were $156 million, reflecting ongoing demand for hepatitis C treatment, even as the market anticipates the arrival of other regimens in 2014. INCIVO royalties were $44 million, and our combined hepatitis C revenues contributed approximately $200 million to our top line in the second quarter.","Finally, collaborative and other revenues in the second quarter were $12 million.","Because of the increased visibility into revenues for 2013, we are tightening our 2013 total revenue guidance range to $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, which includes the increased KALYDECO guidance of $345 million to $360 million.","Now to our non-GAAP operating expenses of $281 million, which includes cost of revenues and other charges. This is similar to the first quarter made up of $191 million in R&D investments and $90 million in SG&A expenses. Consistent with our financial strategy, we are prioritizing investment in R&D and being disciplined with our SG&A spending. We are reiterating our non-GAAP operating expense of $1.09 billion to $1.15 billion for 2013.","In summary, financially, we are executing on our strategy and prioritizing investment within our business to drive long-term growth. Our cash position and our financial strength will enable us to continue to maintain our investment to progress our medicines in development.","I'd now like to open the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Geoff Meacham from JPMorgan.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","One on CF and one on hep C. So for the 809 KALYDECO trial on heterozygous, are there any limitations on enrollment for genotype beyond G551D that's on a non-delta F allele? I just want to make sure that there may be -- you're excluding patients that may have some residual KALYDECO function. And I guess the question here is if this serves as a negative control for labeling but you see a signal then what's the path","beyond that.","Robert Kauffman","This is Bob. It's hard to speculate on the path until we actually see what the data show. But we choose the patients for this study who have mutations on the other allele that would not respond to KALYDECO. So we obviously try to keep our baseline at an absolute minimum. And that's what we've done throughout the heterozygous studies, and we'll do the same in this one.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Excellent. And just a real quick one on VX-135, I know you guys have been asked a lot about spend in hep C. Is there a time to get off the partial hold from FDA or some data set that you guys view as a trigger for making future investments in 135?","Robert Kauffman","This is Bob. I'll answer sort of the first part of that. And that is, based on the particulars that the FDA has asked us for, we expect to be able to have complete data set in the early part of the fourth quarter. And we then expect the FDA to review those data and then respond back to us. As to the other part, I'll pass it on to Ian.","Ian F. Smith","Yes. Geoff, thanks for the question. The question has been asked a few times since Thursday night actually. And we're very aware of the competitive nature of this market, this disease area. And we're always looking and making a decision to see whether we can compete in what is a significant market, in a global market. At this point in time, we have the assets and we have internal capability that we want to progress that opportunity. As we go through, there'll be a very important, let's say, Phase II period of establishing a potential regimen to compete in this market. We'll be making those kind of decisions. But at this point in time, we plan to keep committed to HCV and drive forward for an all-oral regimen.","Operator","The next question comes from Geoffrey Porges from Sanford Bernstein.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Perhaps just to drill in a little bit more on 135, Bob, could you let us know, first, what the primary metabolic pathway is for VX-135? Secondly, the thinking behind taking it up to the 400-milligram dose, and then what the outcome was for those patients with the elevated liver functions? And lastly, can you just tell us whether you've seen any transaminase elevation, not enough to get to an SAE or discontinuation, but any at all at the 200-milligram dose?","Robert Kauffman","So I'll take -- if I can remember all 4 of those questions, I'll take them in order. The pathway of metabolism is it's primarily renally excreted as most nukes [ph] are. In terms of why we went to the 400-milligram dose, I would say that part of the Phase II evaluation of any compound, really, is to explore the dose range. When we had completed the 100- and 200-milligram doses in the European study, we had very good tolerability and therefore, we decided to dose-escalate. And we wanted to sort of maximize the viral kinetics in order to get the best response possible.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","The outcome of the elevated transaminase patients and then any at 200?","Robert Kauffman","Yes. There were none at 200 nor at 100, and they all resolved really quite quickly within a week or so. And in terms of the other transaminase elevations, I guess I just answered that by saying we really haven't seen anything in the 100- and 200-milligram groups.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A question on hep C and then on CF. On the 135, can you walk through what type of PK exposure you're seeing at 100, 200 and 400 and maybe whether there's any short overlap there? Just trying to think about exposure, 400 is only twice 200, so think about that. And then on CF, can you explain the confidence in the other non-gating mutations -- excuse me, the residual function studies? Where the confidence comes from [indiscernible] obviously, that's a -- it's a huge population. I'm just trying to understand whether there's any read-through in today's data and to that study.","Robert Kauffman","Okay. So in terms of 135, I'll say the following. Firstly, in the 3 subjects who had LFT abnormalities in the 400-milligram group, the exposures in those 3 patients were essentially the highest of any of the 10 subjects that were enrolled in that dose group. And in addition, the exposures in the 200-milligram group differed on average by about twofold with those in the 400-milligram group. So there really is a fair spread between those subjects who had the LFT abnormalities in the 400-milligram group and the 200-milligram group. On the other hand, I'll just say that this is a very small data set and clearly, we have to establish this in larger numbers of patients to really understand this, but that's really where we're headed in the next set of evaluations.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on CF?","Robert Kauffman","Yes. So you asked about our confidence in the patients with residual function. And I think that has largely to do with, first of all, both in vitro data, that show that we can enhance the chloride transport in patients -- in cells who carry the R117H mutation and other mutations that result in residual function. And we've had a very good in vitro-in vivo correlation, correlating chloride transport in vitro and clinical results so far in the program, and we would expect that to continue in this group as well.","Operator","The next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe the first one for Bob. Bob, I think the concern, I guess, for 135 is the potential for mitochondrial toxicity. Can you walk us through evidence we have thus far that this drug is not -- does not have mitochondrial toxicity, maybe make an argument to try to convince us all? And then number two is -- the second question is an expense question, maybe the first part for Jeff, and that is $1.4 billion of cash in the balance sheet's quite a bit, very formidable. Be curious to hear updated thoughts on what you're going to do with that cash, what kind of stuff in -- conceptually is on the table versus off the table and maybe I'll just stop there.","Robert Kauffman","This is Bob. I'll answer the first part. We've done an extensive evaluation of VX-135 for mitochondrial toxicity using basically all the state-of-the-art techniques, and in fact, we have seen no evidence for mitochondrial toxicity for this compound. And that's really about all I can say.","Ian F. Smith","And Mark, to your -- in answer to your second question, I'll just comment on cash and then turn it over to Jeff about more strategically where we may go. But from the cash position, as you can see, we're in this position where we are accumulating. We want to maintain our strength from the balance sheet. That includes managing the liabilities on the balance sheet. So we're happy that we've got over $1.4 billion at June 30. And we've been able to convert our debt into equity, so we don't have any significant liability of debt on the balance sheet. So at this point, we're still in the phase of building, and I think you'll see that continue for at least a short period of time. We're very aware, as we go into 2014 that as INCIVEK revenues decline, that we may need to apply some of that cash from the balance sheet to continue to invest in our medicines. As we come through that period, I think that's when your question becomes most pertinent in terms of how do we put the capital to use. And we're starting to think about that in our business at this point.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Yes, Mark, this is Jeff. Just a quick comment to add to what Bob said on the mitochondrial toxicity. One of the other things that we learned from the 100- and 200-milligram trial that was done in Europe was that we were monitoring those patients by both echo and EKG. And I think one of the important findings is, now that those patients have all completed 12 weeks of therapy, we really didn't see any echo or EKG signs of cardiac pathology, which obviously is the mitochondrial toxicity of the most interest and frankly, the most worrying [indiscernible]. With respect to the $1.4 billion, the only thing I would add is what I've always said before. We're very pleased with our own pipeline, and we think that we have a number of interesting assets coming forward. But we're also always looking strategically for things that can complement what we've done, certainly in CF and HCV, but also in other areas that fit our specialty transformative medicine strategy.","Operator","The next question comes from Rachel McMinn from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So I guess I wanted to ask Jeff a question a little bit differently. I mean, given the news on the VX-135 from last week, how should we think about your SG&A infrastructure going forward? I recognize that you're not ready to terminate the program. You're not saying anything of the sort. But I think you previously alluded to keeping your HCV sales force through the VX-135 development. How should we think about potential cost savings, following the Gilead launch? And then separately, I wanted to better understand the rationale for this study design for 661 in 551D patients. There's already a very strong benefit with KALYDECO alone, so I'm just wondering, if you think you'll be hitting up against the ceiling and why you wouldn't be looking at 809 in that setting?","Stuart A. Arbuckle","So Rachel, it's Stuart here. I'll take the first question on HCV SG&A and then hand it over to Bob. So on our HCV investment, I mean, we know we have an absolutely world-class HCV sales force. And although it's relatively small, one of the beauties of the specialty business model is it's a small sales force. We know it's been instrumental in our success to date. However, as with all aspects of our business, we're constantly evaluating the return on investment we get for that sales force. And in our judgment, the sales force continues to be a really good investment based on the revenues that they are generating today. What I would say though is that we are, as I say, looking at spend across all of our areas and we have substantially reduced in the HCV area our marketing expenses from 2012 into 2013. And that continues to be the case going into the second half of 2013, where we are looking very much at managing those expenses in line with the trajectory of our revenues. Then on the CF question, I'll hand it over to Bob.","Robert Kauffman","Right. So your question relates to the combination of 661 plus ivacaftor. And the rationale for this is based on in vitro data, again, that's -- we generated at Vertex to show that you can actually get a substantially greater effect on chloride transport in vitro in G551D F508del heterozygous cells in culture and the rationale is, whether in fact in vivo in humans, whether a greater clinical benefit can be obtained by this combination, again, going back to the correlation that we've seen between in vitro and in vivo. As to the choice of 661, I would just say that VX-809 is in an extensive program, a Phase III program, with many, many studies. This is another opportunity for us to learn more about 661, and that's why we chose it for the combination.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Abrahams from Wells Fargo.","Brian Corey Abrahams - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A question on 135. I think that a lot of us are trying to figure out is whether the 100- or 200-mg dose is -- could potentially be sufficient. I know rapidity of viral load reductions are often seen as a surrogate for potency. You reported 70% and 80% RVRs. Obviously comparing across small studies has limations. So I was just wondering if you can maybe help us understand how the population in the European study may have compared to that of the analogous study conducted for sofosbuvir plus ribavirin and whether you had any details on characteristics of patients who are maybe a bit slower to respond in this study. And maybe, could you possibly give us RVR results for those U.S. patients on 100 mg? That would help as well.","Stuart A. Arbuckle","First, Brian, I'll just jump in front of Bob, we're not going to compare studies -- cross-studies, actually. We're not going to compare patient demographics between a study that was run by another company and ourselves. We're waiting for the full data to be read out and then you can do the analysis at that point in time. But maybe Bob would like to comment on how we think about 100 and 200, and the viral decliners [ph] or maybe that's where it comes from.","Robert Kauffman","Yes. So it's really impossible to ever match across studies when you don't have all the data so I just -- we just can't really do that. I would say that, obviously, in our PK studies, we've seen very good antiviral activity in both the 100 and 200. The results in our 200-milligram group compared favorably with the results that have been seen for sofosbuvir at 400 milligrams and we consider both of those doses to be -- really have very good activity. As to the RVR rates that we saw in this trial, I would just remind you that our real primary development path for VX-135 is in combination with the other antiviral agents, not with ribavirin. And I think we should wait and see how our daclatasvir plus 135 study comes out to really make judgments on 100 versus 200 milligrams and the efficacy that we might see. So I think that it would best to kind of wait to see where there's more, in terms of more realistic studies, in terms of ultimate development that -- how they come out.","Operator","The next question comes from Liisa Bayko from GMP Securities.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to know if you could comment at all on some of the other observations in terms of exacerbations, the sweat chloride that you saw with the current study results in the non-G551D gating.","Robert Kauffman","So this is Bob. We've just really announced our top line results. We're obviously combing through the data of that study much more extensively now, and I think I'd probably prefer to wait until those results are presented at a medical meeting to discuss any further details.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then in the new study that you've initiated, the heterozygous study, G551D plus the background of Delta 508. I'm just curious, of the G551D population, what percentage of them have F508 on the other allele?","Robert Kauffman","About half of them do.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then for the 400 patients, the R117H, can you maybe talk about the geographic distribution? I know you spoke about, what, about [ph] 400 patients.","Robert Kauffman","It's roughly evenly split between the U.S. and EU. That's actually probably slightly more in the European Union but it's roughly evenly split.","Peter R. Mueller","And maybe we can just...","Robert Kauffman","I just want to clarify. I actually misspoke when I answered your question, that in terms of G551D F508del, probably close to 80% of those patients actually have F508del on the other alleles, sorry, not 50%.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","That's what I thought, okay. Okay. And then just final question, again, on cystic fibrosis. For G551D, I know you said you've treated now the majority of patients in the U.S. and Europe. Can you maybe talk about how many other patients might be in other world areas? Just trying to understand how much more upside there is in KALYDECO for the G551D population.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Yes. The most significant other markets where we're yet to get full reimbursement are Canada, where we think there's about 100 eligible patients; and then Australia, where there's about 200 eligible patients. And clearly, that's got a lot to do with the G551D mutation, being called a kind of Celtic mutation. Those are areas where there's obviously a lot of emigration, and so those are really the remaining areas of growth for us for the G551D population. And really, their reimbursement is going to be the key that will unlock the drug to be made available for those patients.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Can I just sneak in one more question? Can you maybe talk about compliance, so far, on KALYDECO? Kind of what -- now that it's been on the market for some time and at least in the U.S. or some of the bigger European countries, what sort of normalized compliance rates are we observing? And that's my final question.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Sure. So what I'd say is that we're seeing rates of compliance, which are as high as certainly I've ever seen in any therapy area, and I'd say they're above 80%, which is really pretty substantial.","Operator","The next question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was just -- just 2 for me. So in terms of the other gating trial that you reported today, I guess, can you give us any sense of if you collected data on pancreatic enzyme usage? And then with respect to the new trial of 661 and KALYDECO, was wondering if that is going to include a KALYDECO control arm. Or I guess, how should we think about benchmarking the combo data when we see those results?","Robert Kauffman","This is Bob. In terms of the other gating mutations, obviously, we collect data on concomitant medications. But we are not conducting sort of what I would consider a really rigorous assessment of the use of pancreatic enzymes. We'd be able to get some sense of it from the data we have, but it's really not designed as a key endpoint of the study. And in terms of 661 with KALYDECO, remember that we will have historical data on those patients because they're on KALYDECO already. So when you add 661 on top, we'd be able to compare their change from their prior baseline, which we will have measured, rather than having a concurrent control. These are all people that are eligible for KALYDECO and are taking it commercially, so they're -- you can't take them off treatment.","Operator","The next question comes from Matthew Roden from UBS Securities.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Bob, if I understood your comments on the VX-135 study with daclatasvir, it sounds like you're looking to expand beyond the 20 patients that you're initially going to be testing once you have those data. So the question I'm trying to get to is, what do you need to see in order to advance this molecule on to registrational studies in terms of either SVRs or duration of therapy? And also related to that, when would that decision be taken? It sounds to me like, regardless of what you see in the first 20 patients that, given the small sample size, you'd be -- it would be warranted to take that into larger studies.","Robert Kauffman","So yes, this is Bob. Yes, I agree. We would likely expand that study just to get a better sense of the treatment effect before launching into a pivotal program. The initial 20 patients are really primarily a safety PK and kind of the preliminary efficacy read reassessment. We know the bar is very high in this therapeutic area, so obviously, we'd like to see very good efficacy, as well as good tolerability. But it may be that we'll have to see some more patients before we really get a complete handle on that.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then just real quick on CF...","Peter R. Mueller","So Matt, this is Peter speaking. On top of that, I think what is really important to understand for all of those studies, we need enough safety database to move forward to a longer-term pivotal type of studies, and I think that's another reason why you have to basically enhance the population in the regimen that you're going to consider later and so this is outside of efficacy, an equally important component that you have the right safety description.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then a quick one, either for Ian or Stuart on CF, I just wanted to make sure that I understand the KALYDECO guidance. It looks like you've already done about $160 million, $161 million year-to-date, and if you just had sequentially flat sales in the second half from 2Q run rate, that you would already hit the top end of the guidance. I heard what you said just in terms of inventory in Europe. Just trying to understand under what scenarios it could possibly -- the bottom end of guidance could possibly be in play.","Ian F. Smith","Yes, good question, Matt. So as we set the guidance, the numbers you called out are right on. And -- but there was a $2 million to $3 million inventory build and therefore, the demand in the second quarter -- even though we record $99 million of sales -- the demand is maybe closer to $95 million, $96 million. And then if you do flatline that out, it puts you in around the $350 million or just above the $350 million mark, if you do the math that you're doing. And that $350 million mark is -- or just north of $350 million is actually right in the middle of the guidance we gave at $345 million to $360 million. So that's how we gave it. We didn't want to put a precise number, but we do think it's appropriate to be conservative to put a range around the trajectory, the number of patients, which we think at this point in time. I would just say that even though we're commenting on that range and saying that we're treating nearly all the patients, the G551 patients in U.S. and Europe now, the growth, as Stuart mentioned on the call, the growth we do anticipate to start again in 2014. And that does come from these other geographies that we start to sell drug into, that we've been approved and we're looking for reimbursement. And that it comes with label expansion to the study we're announcing today and then the other studies that we're running, so. And those can come throughout 2014, giving us a -- kind of a nice growth trajectory and an important revenue line item in 2014.","Operator","The next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So I guess, if you were to see a really significant improvement by adding 661 to KALYDECO in these patients, do you have a sense of how nimbly you could be to advancing the program forward for approval, now that you've had some more time to understand what breakthrough designation gives you? And then the second question I have, how many patients do you think that you need to see with 135, say, at 100 milligrams or 200 milligrams to be comfortable that you will not see the liver tox you saw at the 400-milligram dose?","Robert Kauffman","I'll take the second one first. In terms of how many patients, it's very hard to say. Obviously, statistically, if you study 300 patients and you don't see it, you can say that there's a rate of less than 1%. It all just depends on the end. I think as Peter mentioned, as we begin to build our safety database towards pivotal studies, we'll be in the hundreds range for patient numbers and that will give us a fair amount of confidence that we're not going to see it at any substantial rate.","Peter R. Mueller","Yes. And Robyn, for the first question with 661 and 770 in those heterozygous 551, 508 patients, if we see a positive signal, I think the first thing is we have to basically show enough safety data for 661, which we haven't at this given point in time. And what that means is you have to at least conduct a trial of a couple of hundred patients at the end of today to be in a label position that the agencies might accept.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, do you feel that the fact that the liver signal was not predicted preclinically, that, that -- and the mechanism of the tox is not fully understood that, that could be a hurdle with the FDA? Or is it really just all about statistics and showing that the incidence is well below a certain number to get people comfortable at the FDA?","Peter R. Mueller","That's 135 now. I was talking about...","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. Sorry, I was going back and forth.","Robert Kauffman","Yes. With 135, I mean, I think obviously, the clinical data will likely trump any other information. I think that's really what we're largely focused on. As I mentioned, in terms of in vitro data, we've done a very extensive evaluation for mitochondrial effects and there just don't seem to be any. So we're pretty confident in that regard.","Operator","The next question comes from Yaron Werber from Citi.","Kumaraguru Raja","This is Kumar Raja in for Yaron. What is the strategy for VX-809 JAK inhibitor? And also, can the timeline for the non-G551D label expansion be shorter, given the breakthrough designation?","Stuart A. Arbuckle","So I'll ask Peter to talk about the breakthrough designation, how that affects timeline for VX-809. And I think your first question -- I didn't quite catch your name.","Peter R. Mueller","Kumar.","Stuart A. Arbuckle","Kumar, the first question, I think you're referring to VX-509, the JAK inhibitor and our strategy remains as we've described, again, this year is that we think the most value can be captured from VX-509 by -- and recruiting partner help. So it is something that we're evaluating partnering opportunities to drive that molecule forward in multiple disease areas. We're aware the market is competitive and the disease areas are broad and big and it's a global market. And we believe to get the maximum benefit from this molecule, the best decision is for an out-licensing, and we're currently looking at and evaluating opportunities to do that. To the -- to VX-809 in CF, I'll ask Peter to comment on how breakthrough designation may affect it.","Peter R. Mueller","So Kumar, there are many different ways how breakthrough works. So the first is, you have basically a more frequent interactions with regulatory authorities with the clear goal to come forward with an acceptable fast development program that authorities can accept. In that context, we already got an acceleration because the [indiscernible] now went down from 48 weeks or 52 weeks to a 24-week regimen, which basically [indiscernible] substantially faster. And that -- and also the clearcut agreement about several doses and now, basically, a mono arm and all those types of things basically accelerated the overall program by about 1.5 years. That's already good news. Now obviously, the next piece is the registration and the approval process. And what regulatory authorities normally do is, they talk with you about how you basically can file so that this may be more accelerated. But it doesn't say that -- a timeline. It doesn't give you, it is 2 months or 3 months or 5 months or 8 months. You don't know. It's dependent on the data set that you have. What might happen, which is maybe a benefit that you not have to do an ad board [ph], which is something they basically sort of say in many different meetings, which would also be beneficial and turn [ph] positive to the timeline. That's about what it is. It is the closing direction with the agency on a daily basis, so it might progress [ph].","Operator","The next question comes from Ying Huang from Barclays.","Ying Huang - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So I have a couple on VX-135 first. Were there any Hy's law cases reported or observed in that 400-mg dose cohort in Europe? And then also, do you guys still plan to start a pivotal development by the end of 2014, if assuming 100 milligrams just goes well?","Robert Kauffman","So this is Bob. In terms of your first question, no, there were no cases of Hy's law in any of the subjects who had elevated liver function tests. Can you go -- repeat the second question?","Ying Huang - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes. If 100 milligram actually looks good and everything goes well, do you still plan to start a pivotal development of VX-135 by the end of next year?","Robert Kauffman","Yes. I mean, our goal is to, as we've said, to get the results of these studies, to provide them to the FDA, in the hopes of resolving the clinical hold so that we can assess higher doses in the U.S. and, at the same time, to expand the study once we're able to, the daclatasvir study in particular. And I think our ultimate regimen will be guided by the data. If 100 milligrams looks good, we will consider taking that into Phase III. It really just is very data-driven.","Ying Huang - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then I have one more on VX-661 here. Anything you guys have seen in the preclinical model that leads you to believe this compound could behave differently from VX-809 in heterozygous patients or not?","Robert Kauffman","No, I don't think there's anything particular that would make one think that one way or the other in terms of 809 versus 661.","Ying Huang - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And if I may slip just one more. Shall we expect anything reported at AASLD for 135?","Robert Kauffman","I can't really comment on where our data are going to be presented at this stage of the game. Just stay tuned.","Ian F. Smith","And Ying, we can say that when the -- certain study is complete, we generally provide a top line press release in terms of those study results when we have both safety and efficacy. So you can expect that and generally more complete data at the medical conferences to follow.","Operator","The next question comes from David Friedman from Morgan Stanley.","David Friedman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","It's a question on 983. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about what the -- what final steps are necessary until that is in humans and then also, if you have any more detail beyond just the brief sentence in the press release about your thoughts on some initial studies with that drug?","Peter R. Mueller","All right, so it's Peter. So first is, basically, as it is true for all experimental medicines, you have to do a serious preclinical and early clinical assessment, which means tox studies, PK studies, DDI studies, many of those and we are currently conducting these. And we'll see what the outcome is and then come back to you and see what actually we can do. So it's data-driven. Hypothetically, 983 acts very similar to 809 and 661. And you can assume a similar development path as you have seen for 809 or 661 as we go forward in case everything goes positive. Oh, it is already in humans anyhow, so -- but I think it is not in a POC study as -- if that is what you mean.","Robert Kauffman","Yes. Dave, we've completed the Phase I healthy volunteer study. And right now, we're considering what the next study would be with the compound in combination with KALYDECO and also having some kind of the normal regulatory discussions about what study we may proceed ahead with. And we'll be back to you later this year when we have greater clarity on that.","Operator","The final question comes from Salveen Richter from Canaccord.","Unknown Analyst","I'm Chris Halveen [ph]. Just 2 qualitative questions really briefly. Given the -- for CF, given the in vitro to in vivo correlation, how did the in vitro results for the R117H in the residual mutation data look versus the non-G551D gating mutation?","Unknown Executive","Do you want to just close on that?","Peter R. Mueller","Yes. So basically, from a sensitivity, in vitro, the 117 is highly sensitive. And we have, therefore, some hopes that it might also work at the end of the day in the clinic. Now in general, the comment is we have mutating [ph] type of mutations. And I want to just make a general comment. It's not the same for each and every class of mutations. And I wanted to just put that word of precaution out, because there's a difference between trafficking mutations and gating mutations.","Unknown Analyst","Gotcha. And then just briefly for the chief -- the gating trial, your data today, was the 8-week data in line with the 20-week data? The pre-crossover 8-week data, that is?","Robert Kauffman","You mean each period?","Unknown Analyst","Yes.","Robert Kauffman","Yes. So yes -- so we looked at that specifically to see whether there was any carryover effect after the washout period. And in fact, there was no carryover effect. The results, whether you gave it first or second, were very comparable to each other.","Michael Partridge","So thanks everybody for tuning in tonight. If you have additional questions, we are in our offices. We'll be happy to take your call. Have a good evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference for today. Again, thank you for your participation. You may all disconnect. Have a good day."],"22377":["Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) Q3 2013 Earnings Call October 29, 2013  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Michael Partridge - Senior Director of Strategic Communications","Jeffrey M.

Welcome to the Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Third Quarter 2013 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Michael Partridge, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Michael Partridge","Thank you, operator. This morning, we announced our third quarter financial results and in conjunction with that, the decision to reduce our workforce and to focus our investment on future opportunities in cystic fibrosis and other key R&D programs. On the call today, Jeff Leiden, Vertex's Chairman and CEO; will comment on these announcements in the context of Vertex's long-term strategy. Then Bob Kauffman, Vertex's Chief Medical Officer, will review Vertex's weakened clinical progress in the areas of cystic fibrosis and also review the current status of our hepatitis C and JAK3 development programs. Following that, Ian Smith Vertex's CFO, will review financial results and provide some perspective on the financial impact of today's announcement on Vertex's profile going forward. Please note that Stuart Arbuckle and Peter Mueller are not available to be on the call this morning. They are communicating with their teams regarding the reduction in workforce announced today.","It is our intention to conclude today's call before 09:30 a.m. After the call, we will be available in our offices for follow-up.","Before we begin, I will note that information discussed on this conference call includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in detail in our 10-K and 10-Q reports, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and also in the press release announcing our results this morning.","These statements, including, without limitation, those regarding the commercial performance of INCIVEK and KALYDECO, our development plans and expectations and our guidance are based on management's current assumptions. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and events to differ materially.","GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this call. Information regarding our use of these measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is available in our third quarter 2013 financial press release, and is described on Slide 4 of this morning's webcast.","I'll now turn it over to Jeff.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. Given the nature of today's announcements, I know we are joined by a significant number of Vertex employees, members of the media and other interested parties, as well as many investors and analysts. I'd like to thank all of you for joining the call.","Today, we made 2 announcements. The first was to announce the reduction in workforce related to INCIVEK and the resulting focus of investment into our opportunities in cystic fibrosis and our research in early development programs including all-oral regimens for hepatitis C. This include the elimination of 370 positions. We made this decision in response to continued and rapid decline in hepatitis C treatment rates, which resulted in the reduced use of our marketed therapy, INCIVEK. The overall reduction in hepatitis C treatment has occurred its physicians and patients anticipate the arrival of new treatment regimens. We reached the point where our level of investment and support for INCIVEK was beyond what we believe is necessary to support future physician and patient demand.","The groups most impacted by this decision are those related to the promotion and development of INCIVEK. Related G&A infrastructure has also been reduced.","This announcement today represents perhaps the most difficult choice for a company to make, and we did not make this decision lightly. Vertex is a very special place. The creativity, passion and dedication of employees define us as a company.","The hepatitis C market however has changed very rapidly. Reduction in workforce is difficult but it's the right thing for our business, particularly in light of the significant potential we have for future growth. Going forward our investment and our people are focused on 2 key areas. One, our CF programs; and 2, our earlier stage research and involvement programs including VX-135, as part of all-oral regimens for hepatitis C.","INCIVEK was and still is a breakthrough medicine. It transforms the treatment of genotype 1 hepatitis C patients by doubling cure rates in half the time. Since launch in 2011, more than 100,000 patients have been treated worldwide with this medicine. INCIVEK has transformed our company as well, bringing in more than $2.8 billion in revenues and royalties since launch and creating a foundation from which we can execute a broad strategy to drive sustained growth. We're continuing to make significant progress against the strategy, which we discussed with you earlier this year, and I'd like to spend the next few minutes reviewing our progress with you.","The first part of the strategy is prioritizing our development investment to advance our cystic fibrosis pipeline. 2 weeks ago at the NACF conference, we told you about our progress towards expanding the number of CF patients we can treat and maximizing the clinical benefit we can achieve with our transformative CF medicines. We're on track to get key data later in 2013 and throughout 2014. The second part of the strategy is to focus our research and early development efforts on innovative medicines for serious diseases. In hepatitis C, we continue to pursue a potential opportunity to participate in a future market of all-oral regimens with development of VX-135 our nucleotide polymerase inhibitor. We remain committed to innovation, and I expect you will hear more about some of our emerging early stage programs in 2014. Although it is still early, areas of significant progress include novel approaches in oncology, next-generation correctors for CF, the small molecule approaches for progressive multiple sclerosis.","As discussed previously, we also made a decision to seek a partner to advance global development of our JAK3 inhibitor, VX-509. We've recently obtained positive 12-week results from a Phase IIb study of VX-509, which will be presented as a late breaker at the ACR conference in San Diego later today. We are committed to pursuing a potential collaboration for further development of VX-509.","The third part of our strategy is to maintain our financial strength. This will support our continued investments to drive the creation of new medicines. We finished the third quarter with more than $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.","In summary, we are focusing our business towards cystic fibrosis and earlier stage pipeline programs. We're well-positioned as we move into 2014. Ian, will describe the financial implications in more detail during his remarks.","I'd like to conclude by thanking and recognizing the many colleagues who have contributed to the success of INCIVEK and the success of Vertex. I'll be meeting with Vertex employees today and tomorrow, I'll tell you, what I'll tell them. The management team and I are at deeply grateful for everything they've done and continue to do to transform lives.","Vertex remains a company dedicated to the creation of transformative medicines. KALYDECO and INCIVEK have benefited so many patients and there is much more that we can do to bring innovative medicines to the people who need them. Thank you. I'll now turn it over to Bob.","Robert Kauffman","Thanks, Jeff and good morning. My remarks will focus on 3 important clinical areas for the company. First, I'll recap the updates we gave on our CF development pipeline at the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference earlier this month. Then I will review the current status of our nucleotide polymerase inhibitor VX-135. Finally, I'll review some of the highlights of the VX-509 RA data that are being presented today at ACR.","Beginning with cystic fibrosis. We presented a comprehensive update in Salt Lake City, 2 weeks ago during the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference. I will briefly summarize the main points here.","First, key clinical data to help understand the full potential of ivacaftor monotherapy is expected to be available in the next 8 months. The key studies and anticipated timing of the data for ivacaftor monotherapy are shown on Slide 6 on the webcast. These include Phase III studies and the other gating mutations and R117H populations, as well as the study in children ages 2 through 5 with gating mutations. And the proof of concept study in patients with residual function. If successful, we believe ivacaftor monotherapy has the potential to reach more than 7,000 people with CF.","Second, we have completed enrollment in our TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT Phase III studies evaluating fixed dose combinations of lumacaftor, otherwise known as VX-809 and ivacaftor, and F508del homozygous patients ages 12 and older. We are evaluating multiple endpoints in Phase III, including our primary endpoint of lung function as measured by relative change from baseline in FEV1 and secondary endpoints including change in weight, rate of pulmonary exacerbations, and change in quality of life is measured by the CFQ-R. If successful with the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor in F508del homozygotes patients, we may expand the treatment population by another 28,000 patients. We expect to have data from these studies in mid-2014.","Third, VX-661. For VX-661, we see 2 principle potential roles. The first role representing our primary strategy is as a first generation corrector, as part of a triple combination that includes a next-generation corrector and ivacaftor. To potentially create a combination medicine for F508del heterozygote patients that may also enhance benefit in the F508del homozygotes population. To further this strategy, we plan to advance VX-661 in to a 12-week Phase IIb study in combination with ivacaftor and F508del homozygous patients. This study is designed to provide safety and efficacy data for VX-661 and ivacaftor and we expect to initiate the study in the first quarter of next year, following approval of the study protocol by regulatory authorities. In addition, VX-661 could serve to enhance efficacy in an F508del heterozygous population that is known to respond KALYDECO. For example, in patients with G551D on one [indiscernible] and F508del on the other [indiscernible] by correcting the F508del CFTR protein produces in these cells, which can then be potentiated by KALYDECO.","We have now begun enrolling a 4-week proof of concept study, evaluating VX-661 and ivacaftor in patients with both the G551D and F508del mutations.","We anticipate data from both of these VX-661 studies in 2014.","Now onto hepatitis C. Our goal is to develop VX-135 as part of a potential all-oral 12-week or less pan-genotypic regimen with high viral cure rates. We have conducted 2 studies of VX-135 with ribavirin, principally, to evaluate the safety of VX-135 over the course of 12 weeks. Data from a 20-patient study conducted in Moldova is being presented at AASLD. VX-135 was well tolerated in this study and we are reporting an SVR12 rate of 10% and 50%, respectively, in the 100- and 200-milligram groups in this study.","Additionally, in the U.S. study of 10 patients receiving the 100-milligram dose of VX-135, we are reporting an SVR4 rate of 10%.","A 20-patient study of VX-135 in declatasvir an NS5A inhibitor from Bristol-Myers Squibb is ongoing in New Zealand. We expect safety and efficacy data from this study in the first quarter of 2014. Our plan is to analyze and discuss the data with regulators and our partner, to determine the next steps.","We have a complete DDI study of VX-135 and simeprevir, otherwise known as TMC435 and we are discussing with the J&J the design of potential additional studies for this combination.","VX-135 is on partial clinical hold in the U.S. Before finalizing a response to the FDA on the hold, we have decided to include 12-week safety in SVR data from the current VX-135 and declatasvir study as part of our submission.","Lastly, an update on our JAK3 inhibitor VX-509. Later today, 12-week data from a 350-patients, 24-week Phase IIb study of VX-509 dosed once and twice-daily in combination with methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis is being presented as an oral leg-breaker at the American College of Rheumatology meeting. We have already summarize the key 12-week results in a press release on October 18, when the abstract was published online. In this study, response to therapy was rapid. All VX-509 dose arms had statistically significant ACR20 improvements over placebo by week one. A further comment I will make on these data, is that the ACR50 and 70 rates in patients treated with the VX-509 were significantly greater compared to placebo at the 12-week evaluation point and still appear to be increasing. We await the week 24 analysis of these efficacy and safety endpoints. These results further validate JAK3 as a potentially valuable mechanism to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.","With that I'll turn it over to Ian.","Ian F. Smith","Thank you, Bob. I'll start with today's announcement to reduce our workforce and focus our investment, and how such actions affects the company financially as we enter 2014. I'll then provide direction on our anticipated financial profile for 2014 and discuss our third quarter financial results.","While there are many strong financial aspects to our business, in particular, our current cash position and our growing revenues from KALYDECO, the decline in the hepatitis C treatment rates has occurred at a rapid pace and this has adversely affected our near-term revenue outlook. We have therefore chosen to restructure our business.","Our developments in commercial investment will be focused on multiple opportunities in cystic fibrosis, which have the potential to drive significant revenue growth in the near-term and also focused our most promising early-stage research and development programs, including development of all-oral regimens for hepatitis C.","We've also adjusted our infrastructure support, our G&A investment to reflect the updates of needs of our business. These actions reduced our headcount by 370 people or approximately 15% of our workforce and also include a reduction in other spending, principally those areas that support INCIVEK. We expect to incur a total restructuring charge of approximately $35 million to $45 million in 2013, including a restructuring charge of approximately $11 million in the third quarter of 2013.","Importantly, these actions align our organization and our financial investment with the growth opportunities we see for our future. With clinical success in KALYDECO label expansion studies, success in addressing F508del homozygote patients with our combination therapy and potential to further expand the number of CF patients we may treat. We have the possibility of emerging in 2015 as a high-growth, high-operating margin business with significant cash flow and earnings.","We intend to continue to manage our business in this way, while continuing to invest in product creation for the future.","I'd now like to provide some specific commentary on our financial profile, as we head into 2014. First, from a balance sheet perspective. We finished the third quarter with more than $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and we expect to complete 2013 and enter 2014 with $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. This cash position is a strong starting point for 2014 and along with our growing CF revenues can fund 2014, a period when we receive important clinical data that sets the potential product revenue growth for the future.","Next. From an operating perspective. We expect 2014 total non-GAAP OpEx to be approximately $150 million to $200 million lower than the forecast of approximately $1.1 billion for 2013. The lower OpEx in 2014 is the result of reductions in our workforce and the realignment of our investment.","More specifically, we see: 1, a $60 million to $70 million reduction in payroll and related costs; 2, a reduction of $30 million to $50 million in commercial and other expenses, primarily those to support hepatitis C sale and marketing; 3, a net reduction in R&D of approximately $35 million to $50 million, which reflects INCIVEK, VX-509 and other development costs coming down. This is netted against the expected increase investment in cystic fibrosis; and 4, a reduction of $25 million to $30 million in G&A costs and expenses.","We continue to analyze and plan our business and will provide a further update to know the 2014. I'll just make a quick comment, that we expect research investments to remain relatively consistent between 2013 and 2014.","We believe this level of ongoing operating expense provides financial leverage in our business, as we move beyond 2014 with a potential revenue growth in cystic fibrosis.","Now turning to the third quarter 2013 results. Total revenues were $220 million. Our non-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude costs of product revenues and other charges were $276 million for a non-GAAP loss of $74 million or $0.32 per share.","Now for the more detailed results. In the third quarter, total KALYDECO revenues grew a $101 million, reflecting the fact that we are treating nearly all G551D patients in the U.S. and the EU. With the sale to date in 2013 and the visibility we have into the fourth quarter revenues, we have increased our 2013 KALYDECO net revenue guidance to between $360 million and $365 million from a previous range of $345 million to $360 million.","As we have stated previously, we see the potential for KALYDECO growth in 2014 based on the following: Achieving reimbursement for G551D patients in Australia and Canada; and 2, expansion of KALYDECO label into additional populations.","INCIVEK revenues in the third quarter were $86 million. This decrease in INCIVEK revenues compared to the second quarter stems from a smaller number of patients entering treatment, as the next wave of treatment regimens is anticipated, as well as a reduction channel inventory and lower realized revenue per unit sold after mix shift to government payers. INCIVO royalties were $21 million compared to $44 million in the second quarter, driven by both patient warehousing and seasonal treatments -- seasonal changes in treatments.","Finally, collaborative and other revenues in the third quarter were $14 million. Based on the sharper than unanticipated decline in hepatitis C product in royal revenues -- royalty revenues, we are revising our total 2013 revenue guidance down by approximately $100 million to $1 billion to $1.05 billion.","Now to our non-GAAP operating expenses of $276 million, which excludes cost of product revenues and other charges. This was lower than the prior quarter and was made up of approximately $202 million in R&D investments and $74 million in SG&A expenses. We expect 2013 non-GAAP operating expense to be approximately $1.1 billion, which is at the low end of the guidance range of $1.09 billion to $1.15 billion that we provided in February of 2013.","In summary, I hope the financial results reported today and the actions we've taken are understood, in the context of how we are seeking to advance our business. In particular, I have provided some clarity around the opportunities for our revenues and earnings growth that we see ahead of us and now we are managing our investment and aligning our business with our financial growth opportunity.","I'd now like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham of JPMorgan.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just in light of the INCIVEK decision. Does this change the internal quarter rate for you guys for VX-135 moving forward? I guess, I just want to get a sense for how you're thinking about hep C as we go forward.","Ian F. Smith","Geoff. I'll take that. I think is that internal hurdle rate, can I just clarify?","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, that's right.","Ian F. Smith","Yes. So it is an early stage program, proof of concept study into the combination therapy that we're running VX-135 with the declatasvir. As we look at that study, I mean, we need to get the data which we anticipate will be in the first quarter 2014, and at that point, we'll decide on how we progress our business. We are very and -- for AC overall therapies . We're very aware of the external environment, it's progressing fast, it's highly competitive, and we're going to be taking that into account when we get our data from this combination study that's been run down in New Zealand and we'll advise you at that point, in early 2014.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Perfect. And just one follow-up if I could on CF. for 661, for ivacaftor, when you're looking at the G551D and the delta F hetero patient, how fast do you think when you get the proof of concept data? What could be the next steps there? Do you feel like you'd have to do a full-on Phase IIb, that's a 12-week study or do you feel like you could get into a faster population at the Phase III setting?","Robert Kauffman","This is Bob, I'll take that question. Obviously, depending on the results, we think we could move really fairly quickly into a more advanced program. Obviously, this would take some discussion with the regulatory agencies, once we have the results of the study to decide on the next steps. But given the track record of ivacaftor and what we're developing in knowledge about 661, we could probably move into Phase II study fairly quickly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges of Sanford and Bernstein.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Couple of questions. First, on VX-135. You haven't disclosed anything about genotype 2, 3 and it would be helpful to know whether you contemplated or planning any studies in the other genotypes with the right environment combination because, I think, it appears as though it's reasonably well tolerated. And secondly, just a follow-up on the question of hurdle, if you do not go ahead with VX-135 is there additional savings to P&L, if you abandon virology and would that be the decision to see if VX-135, can go ahead?","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Jeff, I'll take the first part and then turn I'll it over to Ian. For genotype 2, 3, we did develop some data as you know in our viral kinetic studies 7-day data to show very good activity in both of those other genotypes, and we do plan to carry that forward into more advanced studies once we have the initial data in genotype 1 from the 135 and declatasvir study. Whether we would pursue the ribavirin and 135 combination, I think it's unlikely, given the efficacy results that others have generated and obviously, our work going forward would be likely with the declatasvir in combination in those other genotypes.","Ian F. Smith","And it gives me the opportunity to say that we're still in our planning phase as we look at 2014, maybe I could expand on that, which is planning phase means we're still trying to gain an assessment of the revenue picture in 2014 as well. We've got some important data coming up, most proximal data is actually coming out of an R117H label expansion study. So again, that will drive potential expectations on revenue in 2014 as well. And then as far as the cost structure of the business is concerned, we are communicating $150 million to $175 million of savings of what we anticipate will be a $1.1 billion operating expense in 2013. We are pretty tight on those costs. We have good visibility on those costs and as I explain where they come from on the call. As far as additional savings, if in terms of -- if decisions are made to pursue certain programs or not and you refer to VX-135, those haven't yet been taken into account. So yes, there would be probably further savings beyond the $150 million to $175 million. We are planning for success at this point, that's how we run our business at this point in time, that's how we plan financially, frankly how we build the balance sheet to assume how we need to invest in the business. So we look forward to finding out what those results are, out of New Zealand and probably late January, early February, when we're on our year-end call, we'll give you the more precise GAAP financial guidance for 2014.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","2 questions. One is on the expense structure. Ian, maybe you could give us a little bit more specifics on the size of the R&D programs. In other words, what is -- how much is early stage versus CF versus hep C. And same with SG&A, maybe you could break that down a little bit, so we know the size of the moving parts. And the second question, is on the 661. You said you're starting a homozygous study, a 12-week study. That data probably comes out sometime after the 809 stage, so maybe you can explain what the point of that study is? And what we do with that, once that data comes out.","Ian F. Smith","Good morning, Michael. Thanks for the question. I'll first of all start by commenting on 2013 and the kind of trajectory for the R&D and SG&A. So as we look into the fourth quarter, so how you understand, how we may finish the year, you should anticipate that our operating expense is very similar to actually the third quarter. You may see some slight reductions in the SG&A specifically, because it's easier to adopt that cost structure with the decisions we've made in R&D. We still have full programs going ahead in many areas in R&D. So you'll see a slight decline in the fourth quarter of SG&A. But overall relatively similar to the Q3 results. And more importantly, as we look at 2014, and again, I'll reiterate we're in our planning phase, but I can give you an idea of the trajectory again, which is that -- when you look at the R&D expense in 2014, you should see a slight reduction as principally due to a reduction in development of -- in areas that I mentioned in my prepared remarks, which was VX-509 and INCIVEK-based therapies. We were actually still studying those in 2013. The big reduction -- by the way, we expect the research investment to stay relatively similar in 2014. The big reduction that you would expect to see when you look at the GAAP financials is in the SG&A area. That's why we've been able to reduce the cost around INCIVEK marketing and sales support. So you should see that decline in 2014. And sometimes even though I provide you some numbers, sometimes there are some missing features that are kind of buried within the numbers because we still are continuing to invest in cystic fibrosis, so we do watch the anticipated increase in the investment in development in cystic fibrosis and also to support the launch and label expansion in 2014. So even though you've seen these declines, would continue to invest in the area of cystic fibrosis to drive that growth opportunity.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","But if I just to ask a little bit more, what percent of your R&D is early stage versus CF clinical trials versus early stage?","Ian F. Smith","Yes. Back if February 2013, we gave that break out when we gave the guidance for the full year. I can't commit that we'll do that again at this point but that would be a better point in time that would be able to help you understand the full profile for 2014. It's just a little early, we're only at Q3 of 2013.","Robert Kauffman","This is Bob. I'll take the second part of your question related to 661. So this is a study in homozygous patients. The reason for that, obviously, is that we want to be able to assess PK\/PD and efficacy and dose response as part of that study. The 12-week duration is really to get a much better handle on safety as sort of a second molecule coming through, the bar is fairly high compared to VX-809. We want to characterize it well. And we would then have an opportunity to further develop 661. As to when the data would come out from those 2 studies? I really can't speculate at this point. The ivacaftor\/809 combination study, and this one, we haven't started this one yet. So we don't really have that much visibility on the exact timing but we'll be able to do that once we get the study enrolled.","Operator","And our next question comes from line of Mark Schoenebaum of ISI group.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I had a longer term question and that can be any kind of long-term guidance but this is qualitative, I guess, question. Am I thinking about this the right way, now that you're effectively reducing -- eliminating or greatly reducing hepatitis C infrastructure on the SG&A side. It should be left basically with the CF infrastructure? And, obviously, if things play out, the revenue growth for CF should be pretty dramatic. So my question is as we look at SG&A line over the very long-term and if we make them the assumption that Vertex stays focused commercially on cystic fibrosis, would it be reasonable to assume that, that SG&A line really shouldn't grow all that much over the long-term as revenue potentially grows, obviously, heck of a lot of things work out? And then, I had one more question more on the clinical development side, if I may. Could you just remind us of the powering on FEV in the KALYDECO plus 809 ongoing Phase III's TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT, and then also remind us what you deem to be a clinically meaningful improvement in FEV, please? And then just housekeeping, do you happen to know how many INCIVEK patients were treated in the quarter in the U.S.? Do you happen to have that?","Ian F. Smith","Thanks for the list of questions, and good morning. So, I think you are thinking about the business financially in the right way. We are consolidating down around cystic fibrosis at this point that's why the growth opportunity is for us. We still have a research investment for product creation and we're still investing in that early stage all-oral program for hepatitis C. But in terms of our earnings capability and cash flow, if successful in the area of CF, yes, we don't anticipate a significant expansion in SG&A. There will be some because you got to launch the product to get into a broader audience and it's a geographic -- it's more a U.S., Europe or North America and Europe type expansions. So there will be some growth but the financial leverage in the area is important to us frankly and that's why we're managing the business in this way.","Robert Kauffman","This is Bob. I'll take the other part of the question. In terms of powering of the study. The study is powered based on a 5% relative improvement in FEV1. I won't really talk much about what we think is a clinically meaningful FEV1 change because I think you have to see the study endpoints in their totality, and particularly some of the nonpulmonary endpoints that we saw with ivacaftor, actually are clinically quite meaningful to patients, the weight gain reduction exacerbations. So I think we should take a little bit more broad look at the way this study is being conducted. It is the case that the FEV1 change, however, is the primary endpoint and that's how the study was powered.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Mark, this is Jeff. Just one minor addition or really to elaborate a bit on what Bob said. You probably saw the recent results from the GOAL study at NACF, which really looked at a variety of other endpoints in patients treated with KALYDECO, including mucociliary clearance and digestive function, Pseudomonas colonization. I think we really do think about these therapies as being systemic and one of the things that we will focus on as we move forward. It's measuring a number of these other endpoints because they really reflect patient outcomes very accurately.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn of Bank of America.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'll try to keep my list a little bit shorter but I do have a couple of questions as well. Jeff, for you, I guess, I'm wondering why you chose not to make any changes to your research infrastructure. I think I recall that number being around $200 million annually, and then I guess as a corollary, when do we as investors get more visibility into your efforts there, just in terms of value creation. On 135, can you confirm that 200 mix is being studied in the daclatasvir study? And then, what do you do if 135, just big picture question, if you can actually get those through the FDA and you get a profile that's worth reinvesting in, is this something that you plan to just partner off to multiple companies, keep, look to in-license, something to bring in with it. I just want to better understand your strategic outlook there.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Thanks, Rachel. I'll answer the first part of the question and thanks for it. This concerns our investment and research, and as Ian said, as we move into next year, we expect the investment in research to be approximately equivalent to what we invested this year. And the reason for that straightforward, we believe that our research engine is really the current and future engine for the growth of the company. Actually with a very -- what I would consider a very modest spend in research -- this organization has produced a series of transformative drugs from INCIVEK to KALYDECO to now 809, 661 to JAK inhibitor et cetera. And certainly as we look to the future, we're relying on this engine to continue to do so. So we have a short-term financial issue that we're addressing in 2014 as Ian described, but it just doesn't make sense to cut the long-term engine of growth for a short-term financial issue. We think we have a pretty good strategy for managing it otherwise. Bob, do you want?","Robert Kauffman","Yes, this is Bob, just a quick comment on the 135, we are studying 100 and 200 milligrams in combination with daclatasvir.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","And then the rituality of your point about in-licensing, out-licensing, and let's say, a corporal business development strategy around hepatitis C broadly. To me, it's about the results we achieved in the combination study that's ongoing, and pending, let's say the quality of those results, I think it sets a path. High quality results, obviously, means that Vertex is in the game of all-oral therapies for hepatitis C, something that's not high quality then we have to understand how VX-135 may play a role in hepatitis C. That's with Vertex or with another company that has a combination approach. So I'd like to think that we're looking at our position in hepatitis C at this point by looking at the external landscape, understanding the commitment we have as a company, but we've got to make a decision as we go into 2014 based on data.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And I'm sorry, your early stage pipeline, when do we get visibility outside of CF?","Robert Kauffman","As Ian mentioned, we hope to begin to give you visibility to some of that next year. As you know, traditionally we do provide visibility once we begin to see human proof-of-concept data and we hope for some of the programs that will be beginning next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang of Barclays.","Ying Huang - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So my first question has to do with the Australian and Canadian patients with G551D mutations. Because it sounds like those are the 2 major markets where you haven't passed on KALYDECO. Can you give us little bit color in terms of patients number with G551D [ph] mutations. Should we also see 4% of CF patients in those 2 countries having G551D? And then secondly, the R117H trial success here. So I've got a lot of questions from investors about the trial because we know that you're going to put out the top line data by the end of this year. I guess, when we talked to physicians, there are many mild patients there and that's why some investors were concerned about the trial success of R117H. So I'd like to have any thoughts from you guys. And then lastly, given the -- I guess, ACV strategic direction here in your company, are you thinking differently about, let's say, the flu program as well or are you still going to out-license that program and find a partner?","Ian F. Smith","So, Ying, thanks for the list of questions again. I'll take the first and last question, and Bob can talk about 117H heterogeneity of population. So first Canada or Australia, it's approximately 300 G551D patients and that would be important once we gain reimbursement approval in those 2 countries to add to growth. And just staying on the KALYDECO growth path, as you're aware, we do have a filing that's currently under review for other gating non-G551D patients. And that's currently being reviewed by the FDA and Europe. As to the third question you asked, which is our commitment to the flu program. The flu program is actually one of those molecules that we are seeking a partnership to advance forward given our focus and consolidation, and let's say, financial direction of the company. Earlier this year, we communicated that we would be along with VX-509 looking for potential partners to advance the flu program. We continue to seek that partner. And Bob?","Robert Kauffman","Yes, this is Bob. So on the R117H population, we estimate the total R117H population at around 1,100 patients worldwide. It is true that this is a heterogeneous group from really quite mild disease to almost no disease all the way up to a more significant disease with declines in FEV1 exacerbations just like other patients with significant cystic fibrosis. So it is heterogeneous. The way we've tried to deal with that is to narrow the population that we evaluated in our study. That population has a percent predicted FEV1 at baseline of between 40% and 90%, which for R117H clearly puts you into a more severe and more significant group. That is the way we're kind of dealing with the heterogeneity's to basically homogenize the population a little bit, and obviously, we'll see how the results come out when we have them at the end of this year. From a clinical point of view, how the -- should the study be successful, how the uptick will be? I think we'll have to see it, likely will not be as rapid as what we've seen for KALYDECO and G551D.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just maybe 1 point of clarification. Is there any sales force still left to market INCIVEK or is that completely restructured today? And then I was just looking back at your guidance you gave for peak KALYDECO sales gave at NACFC. And if I do some simple math here, it seems to me that I get about $180,000 per year on average for pricing for the drug on a worldwide basis, just wondering if that's a good ballpark for net pricing or if there's other assumptions like a discontinuation rate, that I might be missing that goes into that number?","Ian F. Smith","Terrance, thanks for the question. Can you just remind me the first question.","Unknown Executive","Is there any sales force?","Ian F. Smith","No, we've completely restructured the marketing and sales support behind INCIVEK. And then as to the realized price, we don't comment on the realized price. We'll provide you guidance on total revenues for the full year of $360 million to $365 million.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Roden of UBS.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First on 509. The efficacy looks pretty potent here. Just wondering, Bob, if there's anything mechanistic behind the 2 cardiovascular events that you've seen across 2 studies and your relative comfort with the safety profile of the molecule overall. And then, how do you extract maximal value from 509? Has there been significant interest from other parties, I don't know to what extent you can comment on that but when do you think would be the right time to look a partner. And then just lastly, just want to follow-up on the earlier question on the R117H study. With considering the heterogeneity of this population, how can you specifically speak any steps that you took to control for the -- for that heterogeneity in terms of minimizing risk of baseline imbalances?","Robert Kauffman","So several questions. First of all with 509. We agree with you, the efficacy we think is really very, very good. In terms of the safety profile, we're actually quite pleased to both -- the safety profile of both without methotrexate in our prior study as well as this one. As you're well aware, cardiovascular disease is very common in this population. In fact, it's the most common cause of death in patients with RA. And so it's not unexpected in a study of these durations to see outcome such as that. So looking over the program overall, we actually are pretty comfortable with the cardiovascular safety profile that we generated.","Ian F. Smith","And I'll add to how to extract maximum value for the VX-509. It's -- for us it's a fascinating area but it's also a competitive area in terms of the all-oral creation of these types of molecules. To get full success from the opportunity, you need to run multiple, let's say, multiple studies, multiple -- in multiple diseases to get the full benefit as most companies are doing. Given our focus at this point in time, we look for somebody else to do that. So we continue to explore partnerships. It's nice to have such good data in our hands, which will enhance those discussions with potential partners, and maybe even better to have a week 24-day there as well depending on how that comes out and we'll continue that discussion with partners to do the right kind of partnership to extract the value. But our focus right now is around cystic fibrosis and all-oral therapies for hepatitis C and also continue to invest in research.","Robert Kauffman","And this is Bob, again on R117H. I think the primarily way that we try to manage variability was really by, as I said before, eliminating the population to those with a baseline FEV1 of 40% to 90%. Otherwise, we relied on randomization as we usually do to create the balance between the treatment groups.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Bob, there wasn't any specific stratification of any other parameters that would speak to the severity of the population?","Robert Kauffman","Honestly, I don't remember that but I don't think there is anything major. I think, it really was just a baseline FEV1 to define the population.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams of Wells Fargo Securities.","Brian Corey Abrahams - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","At the NACFC conference you outlined relatively large population with residual function mutations. Can you give us the latest views of how you think the NF-1 study would be interpreted by regulators, just given the growing positive safety experience with the drug and what the process would be for getting these groups on the label. And then Bob, maybe you could just remind us about the preclinical assays you looked at over time with 809 or KALYDECO, and how the time frame and cell lines might be similar, different to some of the studies we saw from investigators at the conference last week?","Jeffrey M. Leiden","So just in terms of the NF-1 study, this is a proof-of-concept study. Obviously, we need to learn more about the efficacy of ivacaftor in this population, obviously, depending on how the study comes out, of course, we'll talk about it with the regulatory agencies. However, at this point, we are considering that we may need to run another study in order to get an approval, but obviously, much depends on what we actually see in terms of the results. In terms of preclinical assays, I think I know which paper you're referring to from the CF meeting. We've had some questions about that. Obviously, they have their data. We've done similar studies in cell lines for perhaps a somewhat longer duration. This is a combination of ivacaftor and VX-809. We don't see the same diminution of the activity of CFTR that we've seen in those studies. And I think from our viewpoint, the clinical data that we have really kind of trumps the nonclinical data and that we both for 661 and for 809 have seen really well-maintained clinical benefit over at least a 28-day period.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber of Citi.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I have a couple of questions in CF, and if you don't mind a quick question on hep C. So just, on the Class II residual function mutation, the KALYDECO kind of proof-of-concept Phase II, which is taking R117H plus a broader set of residual patients. What's your sense on the variability in phenotypically in the non-R117H population? And then, just to make [indiscernible] CF, the second question on R117H. Is there -- can you correlate at all what the residual CFTR function is to the actual phenotype, the predicted FEV1? I'm trying to get a sense, can you control for that variability by anyway or no? And then sort of a follow-up on hep C.","Robert Kauffman","So this is Bob. I'll try to answer those questions. In terms of the residual function, obviously, we are -- I think in the big picture, the residual function sort of part of the program starts to shift over from a genetically-based program to a phenotypically-based program. That's really where the end of one study kinds of fits in, as our first look is to whether it's feasible to do that. We'll see how much of variability we have and try to get a handle on what our path forward would be for that population. I think until we see those data, it's going to be pretty hard to speculate. Obviously these are people that have -- sweat chlorides tend to be lower than those with severe disease, they tend to have more mild disease, most of them are pancreatic sufficient as compared to insufficient and so there are many differences, I think that's why we're running an exploratory Phase II study.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","One additional comment. This is Jeff, I remind you if you look back at the KALYDECO G551D studies, the responses that we saw really didn't correlate with the baseline FEV1. So we had patients with very high baseline FEV1, who actually responded very, very nicely. So I think until we get the data, what we're really doing in the N01 is, we're studying, as Bob said, a spectrum of patients with different mutations and different severities to try to understand exactly the answer to your question. Until we see the data in a representative population, it's a little difficult to speculate.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Thank you for that. And just a follow-up on hep C. At the 200 -- maybe I'm kind of asking you to dive into your, some of your kind of very early data on monotherapy with 135. At the 200 milligram dose, do you have enough potency if you think that with another DAA like daclatasvir you can really get to a high enough potency? But you really think that you might need a third agent?","Robert Kauffman","So, the data we have is in our biokinetic studies where we have seen very good activity comparable to that of sofosbuvir and that, obviously, kind of factored into our choice of doses that we're studying going forward and, obviously, for the daclatasvir study, we'll see the results when they come out.","Unknown Executive","Operator, we're close to 9:30, so we have time for just 2 more questions.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Liisa Bayko of JMP Securities.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Actually most of mine have been answered, but maybe just a drill down on Rachel's earlier question. Can you maybe -- I know we'll hear about early stage pipeline development when it comes but can you just maybe review the core areas that you're investing in, obviously, CF phorology we have C and flu as a focus in phlegm. Is there anything else that we might expect something to come from, what are the core areas of investment?","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Yes, this is Jeff. So I think you've got it right. In the mid- to later stage, obviously, CF and then the all-oral program in HCV, which we've been talking about today. Flu is not a program that we're going to invest in further, just to be clear about that, nor do we plan to invest in 509 further. But as you move back into the earlier stage pipeline, we do have programs, as we said, in cancer, in progressive MS, in Huntington's disease and others and, as well as the early stage CF programs in the second gen correctors. And it's those programs that I was referring to and I said we'll begin to get some data beginning next year and certainly into 2015 and as we get the human proof-of-concept data that's usually when we start really talking about these programs.","Operator","And our next question -- our last question comes from Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So I guess, 2 things. Number 1, what is the genotype composition for the 135 studies your reported today? And then the second question is, now that you have longer term data with KALYDECO, you mentioned outcomes, some outcomes measures. When you think about how pairs might look at in 809 KALYDECO combination, do you think the pairs will take into account the durability you see with KALYDECO and view it as a class of drugs or view the combination as completely independent?","Robert Kauffman","So this is Bob. The composition of the population is genotype 1 and the study that we were discussing today, the study that was conducted in Moldova. Most of the patients were genotype, in fact, all the patients were genotype 1b, which reflects the composition of patients in that country.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And what about [indiscernible] city -- and what about subtype?","Robert Kauffman","There was a mix of subtypes, it was relatively a little low on the CC patients, but I think you'll see the full data when the poster is presented next week. In terms of durability, without kind of getting beyond the data we currently have, I would say that based on the data from the PERSIST study, CFTR modulation appears to be kind of a long-term effect. There was really no diminution in the activity over 3-year period with KALYDECO monotherapy. And while, obviously, I can't speculate because we don't have such long-term data for the combination of 809 and ivacaftor, I would generalize it a little bit and just say that this mechanism appears to be one that produces a longer-lasting effect. And, obviously, we'll see as we get further data over the next couple of years how that turns out. I think the payors, obviously, if I can speak for them, I think they, obviously, will be interested in and I think, obviously, very happy to see that this affect is long-lasting. And for the patients, clearly, very important.","Unknown Executive","Thank you. I'm going to turn it over to Jeff for some final remarks.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","First of all, thank you for your questions today. I just want to finish with a very clear acknowledgment of our employees. This is obviously a difficult day for all of us here at Vertex and I want to make sure to acknowledge the incredible work that our employees did to develop and commercialize INCIVEK, we've treated more than 100,000 patients worldwide with very high cure rates. This is what it is, truly a breakthrough drug, and we have a lot more to do but I want to make sure to acknowledge what's been done by our employees because that really formed the foundation of our company going forward. Thanks very much for your questions and for joining the call today.","Ian F. Smith","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, and good evening, everyone.","2017 is an important year for Vertex, and we've had a strong start to the year with excellent progress across all aspects of our business. This progress has advanced us significantly toward our goal of developing medicines for all people (1:41). In the first few months of 2017, we continue to increase the number of people eligible for and being treated with our approved medicines, KALYDECO and ORKAMBI.","In September of 2016, we received approval for ORKAMBI in children ages 6-11 in the U.S., and we've seen rapid uptake and strong compliance and persistence in these patients. This quarter, we also submitted an MAA line extension to the European Medicines Agency for approval of ORKAMBI in children ages 6-11. There are approximately 3,400 children, ages 6-11, who have two copies of the F508del mutation in Europe. We remain committed to expanding the eligibility for and access to ORKAMBI.","We've also made significant progress across our CF pipeline. Last month, we shared positive results for two Phase III studies of the investigational tezacaftor\/ivacaftor combination; one study in people with two copies of the F508del mutation and one study in people with one F508del mutation and the second residual function mutation.","Both studies demonstrate the clinically meaningful benefit of favorable safety and tolerability profile across multiple patient groups.","We look forward to submitting an NDA and MAA for tezacaftor\/ivacaftor in the third quarter of 2017. In addition, we have four next-generation correctors currently in Phase I and Phase II study. We believe a triple combination of a next-generation corrector with tezacaftor and ivacaftor to provide benefit for the approximately 90% of people with CF who have at least one F508del mutation.","We expect to have data in people with CF from three of these combination regimens in the second half of 2017 and I look forward to updating you on this progress over the coming months.","Lastly, we are focused on broadening our CF pipeline and during the quarter, we announced an agreement to acquire CTP-656 from Concert Pharmaceuticals. Our goal is to develop the most effective and convenient medicines for people with CF and CTP-656 has the potential to be used as part of a future once-daily combination regimen that can treat the underlying cause of CF.","These recent accomplishments give us tremendous conviction that we will achieve our vision of bringing new transformative medicines to people with CF around the world. Our continued progress has also positioned us well to meet our financial goals of delivering sustainable, long-term revenue and earnings growth.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian to discuss our financials.","Ian F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff, and good evening to everyone. Tonight, I will discuss the key aspects of our first quarter 2017 financials and I will also review our 2017 financial guidance. Total CF product revenues of $481 million in the first quarter 2017, represents a 22% increase, compared to $394 million we recorded in the first quarter of 2016.","Additionally, it represented a $27 million increase compared to the total CF revenues of $454 million we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016. For ORKAMBI, we reported first quarter 2017 product revenues of approximately $295 million, an increase of $18 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily driven by the rapid uptake for ORKAMBI in the 6 year olds to 11 year olds as well as strong persistence and compliance with this medicine in this age group.","First quarter KALYDECO sales were $186 million, compared to $177 million for the fourth quarter 2016. I'd like to point out that $9 million of this increase was based on mainly one-time adjustments related to reimbursement agreements in Europe.","We also continue to manage and prioritize our operating expenses. Our first quarter 2017 non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were $313 million, compared to $306 million in the first quarter 2016 and compared to $295 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This revenue and expense profile resulted in a non-GAAP net profit for the first quarter 2017 of $101 million or $0.41 per diluted share compared to the non-GAAP net profit of $22 million or $0.09 per diluted share for the first quarter 2016 and compared to the non-GAAP net profit of $88 million or $0.35 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2016. The significant growth in the net profit was largely driven by the strong growth in product revenues while prioritizing and managing operating expenses.","From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the first quarter with approximately $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. During the quarter, we received an upfront cash payment from Merck KGaA related to out-licensing of our oncology portfolio. We also chose to repay $300 million that was outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Our financial position gives us a significant flexibility to reinvest into the business to support our future growth.","Now, turning to our full year guidance, for ORKAMBI, we continue to expect $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion in net product revenues. Where we land in this revenue range will be determined by the continued uptake and compliance of ORKAMBI in markets where it has been reimbursed as well as the completion of reimbursement agreements in individual countries within Europe. In particular, if we succeed in gaining reimbursement in France in 2017, this would be the major contributor to revenue growth this year. After KALYDECO, we are increasing our full year guidance and now expect $710 million to $730 million in net product revenues due to the one-time reimbursement adjustments recognized in the first quarter and the strong underlying demand for the medicine.","Lastly, we continue to expect combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses of $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion for 2017 as we guided to earlier this year.","This guidance reflects the rapid progression of our CF clinical development programs and the ongoing global launch of ORKAMBI. We do expect non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to grow in the future quarters in 2017.","Our goal is to increase the number of people eligible for and being treated with our medicines around the world. We expect this to result in significant long-term revenue growth and we are committed to investing to create new medicines in other disease areas, while managing our operating expenses and delivering significant earnings growth.","With that, I will open the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau, Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Phil Nadeau, Ph.D. - Cowen and Company","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the progress and the strong quarter. One question on what was disclosed in the press release, moving one of the studies of the triple combo from two-week dosing to four-week dosing. Could you talk a little bit more about that decision, what were the data or analyses that you did to support the longer dosing and what do you hope to achieve or demonstrate with it?","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yes, hi, Phil, this is Jeff Leiden, I'll take that one. Maybe just to back up a little bit and remind you that we have four different triple regimen combos that are in clinical trials. We sort of think of them in two ways, VX-440 and VX-152 are the first wave, they're in Phase II trials. And as you know, those trials have two parts, both a het\/min population and a homozygotes population. And then the second wave is VX-659 and VX-445, and those are in Phase I trials, but the Phase I trials have a patient component as well.","Before I answer your specific question, I would just say that we're very pleased with the progression of those \u2013 all four trials, they are all on time, or actually a little ahead of schedule, to deliver results for the first three in the second half of this year, and the final one, VX-445, in the beginning of next year.","With respect to VX-152 and your question now, the initial studies of VX-152, both parts, het\/mins and homozygotes, were designed to be two-week dosing studies. Based on the tolerability profile that we've seen so far, we decided to extend the duration of the second trial, the homozygous trial, to four weeks, and the reason for that is, it's just going to give us more patient information upon which to make the best decision about which one or several of these we're going to take forward into Phase 3 next year.","Phil Nadeau, Ph.D. - Cowen and Company","Got it. And one question we get about those Phase 3 trials is, your plans for the Concert molecule in them (10:44), can you talk about your decision process there?","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sure.","Phil Nadeau, Ph.D. - Cowen and Company","How likely are you to move forward with ivacaftor \u2013 tezacaftor versus the Concert molecule in combination with tezacaftor?","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, so our first priority is to get an excellent efficacy and tolerability regimen for patients who particularly had commenced, we have (11:02) nothing today, and if that's a BID regimen, everything that we've learned from those patients says that it will be well accepted because, as you know, those patients take many, many pills, 20 to 40 pills a day often.","On the other hand, our ultimate goal is to get a highly effective and tolerable regimen that's once-a-day, and the good news there is that both VX-659 and VX-445, we believe, are once-a-day regimens. We know that VX-661 is a once-a-day regimen. KALYDECO is a twice-a-day regimen. And so, the impetus to acquire the dual rate in KALYDECO (11:34) from Concert was to be a \u2013 it's a once-a-day regimen, we'd be able to combine it with VX-661 and either VX-659 or VX-445 to get a once-a-day highly tolerable and highly efficacious regimen.","Phil Nadeau, Ph.D. - Cowen and Company","Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering, to follow up on the triple combos, maybe, can you talk about your disclosure plans, will you plan to release those as a group or will they come in \u2013 come out as they come in? And then, regarding the ongoing Phase 3 trial of tezacaftor and KALYDECO on the F508del plus gating patients. Can you remind us of the design there and what you're hoping to see? Thanks.","Ian F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, Terence, thanks for the question. I'll take the first part, the disclosure question. As we've done in the past, obviously, you are asking the question about future disclosures, I think our plan at this point would be to let the studies play out, we'll have a better visibility of the timing of the data coming from each of the studies in a couple of months from now. And I think at that point in time, we'll have a better understanding of how the data will roll out. Our intention actually is to provide you with a top line release, probably in the form of a press release, as usual, and safety and efficacy data, because these studies now are including patients, with safety and efficacy data. And the data supports what the next steps are for each of the compounds and the triple combinations.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And Terence, this is Jeff again. On your question on the gating, tez\/iva gating 508 trial. Just to remind you, this is really the follow-up Phase 3 program to the Phase 2 results we have already published that showed, in that case, about a 4.6% additional increase in FEV1 when you add tezacaftor to ivacaftor in these patients. This is obviously a larger trial, more than 100 patients, it's an eight-week trial, the control is ivacaftor monotherapy versus tez\/iva. We're completing enrollment of that trial, and we expect to have the results in the second half of this year. Based on those results, we'll decide the regulatory strategy, it's a little too early to tell until we see what the results are, and it could be a different regulatory strategy in the U.S. and in Europe, as you can imagine.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the question. So I have another follow-up on the triple. I guess two pieces, so first, should we infer from your comments that we saw better tolerability than you're expecting and that's what allowed you to increase from two weeks to four weeks? And then why only extend to four weeks in the homozygous arm as opposed to both the homo and heterozygote arm?","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the question. So I think I would say that sort of the way I said it before, which is based on the tolerability that we've seen, we felt comfortable to extend into four weeks. (14:48) whether that's better or same, that's what the speculation. We have solid data, so we are comfortable extending to four weeks. In terms of why only one, it's just a matter of we really would like to see four week results if we can with several of these (15:04) so that we can compare them directly. I am not sure we need to do that in every population and so we just decided on that particular population for the study.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the quarter. Also another triple question, obviously VX-440 and VX-152 are ahead in terms of the development, but assuming those look good, we're just wanted to know what's the thought process, would you wait for de-risking data on VX-659 or VX-445 combos before you think about a pivotal or just what's the decision factor there? And I have a commercial follow-up.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sure. First of all, we're thinking about triple Phase 3 designs right now. So we're certainly not waiting even until we have data, Geoff. But the good news is because these trials are proceeding nicely, in fact some of them are ahead of schedule, we're going to have data from these, at least the first three in a relatively short timeframe. And the exact decision is going to be based on that data obviously. It just depends on what we see in terms of making a decision of pull the trigger on one or more of these compounds. But I don't \u2013 what I'm really trying to communicate to you is I don't think even in the case in which we wanted to wait, we're going to do waiting for a launch, because we're going to have the data in a relatively tight timeframe on at least three and maybe all four of the programs. And based on that data, we think we'll (16:32) make a good decision, I think I'm taking one or more of them forward.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I got you. Okay. And just on ORKAMBI, I know it's hard to say you guys reiterated for the year. Is there \u2013 are there any sort of gating factors that you're thinking about in terms of France or other country that are going to contribute to the year. In other words, as the year moves on, are you guys going to update us on the process or is it most or less just, this is the revenue guidance for the calendar 2017?","Ian F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So, Geoff, thanks for the question. Yeah, we did reiterate our guidance $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. We understand we had a good first quarter with ORKAMBI, a lot of that was actually driven by faster penetration into the 6 through 11 category in the U.S. And so, with the first quarter behind us, we are looking at that guidance and we're between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion, but there is still uncertainty as we play out the year on top of what we've already recorded in the first quarter, the run rate coming out of the first quarter, and that does mainly relate to timing of reimbursements in Europe. And the major contributor outside of the U.S. would actually be France and, as you are aware, there is a lot of uncertainty in France. One is, the political environment over there. At this point, they're going through an election. And then also, it's an unusual market in that the patients in France are already on drug and we already received the cash from them (18:05). So we don't have this huge advocacy pull to get reimbursement for the drug to ensure that the patients can then receive the drug. So it's an unusual market, it is probably the largest contributor outside the U.S. for the 2017 revenues, but there is still significant uncertainty surrounding it while we continue to collect the cash, so we felt comfortable keeping our guidance at the $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much and congrats on the strong results. So just to follow up on the question about the European reimbursement. Ian, could you talk a little bit more about various parts of the U.K. and Benelux for ORKAMBI because they could certainly move the needle. Are they in your plan for this year or is that something we should expect for next year. And then if Stuart's available, I'd love to hear where you are in terms of the uptake and the ongoing adoption in the 6 to 11 year olds in the U.S. and whether that's a template that we could look for in other markets over time? Thanks.","Ian F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So, I'll just take the front end of that, Geoff, and then Stuart is here and Stuart can take the rest of the question. But I would just say the guidance that we gave, $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion does assume that we gain approval in certain markets and they tend to be the smaller ones and they also tends to be more impactful in the second half of the year. As of now, when we look at \u2013 I'll just point out, when we look at Q2 for 2017, we actually see it to be very similar to Q1, but these other markets even the smaller ones we anticipate come up in the second \u2013 more in the second half of the year and contribute then certainly France as I just mentioned, but even the small markets as well, the ones you mentioned, and maybe Stuart could give commentary around those markets.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. So, as Ian said, the guidance incorporates are kind of ranges of possibilities because we can't be absolutely certain which countries we're going to reach agreements with and when. Certainly, we're pleased that we are beginning to see countries now strike pricing and reimbursement agreements with us, obviously Germany and Austria are already kind of online, we've added Denmark in the last few weeks, and we have an agreement in principle in Ireland.","But as Ian said, those aren't really going to kick in, in terms of generating additional patients and therefore revenue until the second half, and discussions are then ongoing in those other markets that you mentioned, like Belgium, the Netherlands and the UK, which is a particularly complicated market, not just because of the political situation there, but unlike many of these other countries, it doesn't really have a formal process that we can participate in to take it forward, and so we're really trying to develop with them kind of this thought process for ORKAMBI.","In terms of the 6 to 11 launch, Geoff, which is the second part of your question, the launch is going well here in the U.S., as Ian referred to in his prepared remarks. The vast majority of the growth we saw between Q4 and Q1, which is a result of that 6 to 11 launch here in the U.S. and the launch trajectory in terms of uptake is very similar to the ORKAMBI launch. But we're also benefiting from what we expected, which means higher persistence and higher levels of compliance than we saw in the 12 plus population and probably that's due to the profile of the drug in the 6 to 11 population that we saw in the clinical trials and partly that's due to the fact that not surprisingly these patients are managed to a large extent by their parents in terms of compliance. So that's really how the launch dynamics are going for 6 to 11 here in the U.S.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","That specifically (22:10) in our guidance for ORKAMBI for this year and the answer is no.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is actually on KALYDECO. Curious about the trends there, I mean the product is generally fully penetrated, how \u2013 where is the bump in guidance coming from with regard to the strong underlying demand and then I have a follow-up bigger picture question?","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So \u2013 thanks for the question. I'll just walk you through kind of the math as to how we think about and why we did increase the guidance. Obviously, we just recorded $186 million in the first quarter. There were some one-time items in there related to the settlement of contracts. And that's around $7 million or $8 million. But if you were to remove that amount out of the $186 and then just say that's the run rate and multiple that by four and then add in the $6 million or $7 million, you're actually at $720 million. And so we decided to move the range up. We were once at $690 million to $710 million. So obviously even at our run rate plus with the strong first quarter, we're above that guidance. So we moved it up and we put a band around it, because if there is better compliance and persistence, we have out \u2013 which we already have strong compliance and persistence there maybe a little upside and if we have less compliance and persistence, maybe a little downsize. So it was really a function of the math of the first quarter that puts you at $720 million and we just put the guidance around $720 million \u2013 being $710 million to $730 million.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Understood. And then bigger picture BD question. Now that you've out licensed the oncology asset, curious about your latest thoughts with regards to diversifying the business beyond CF and kind of how do you prioritize building outside of that core competency versus continuing to build that fence around that vertical like your recent Concert deal? Thanks.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Good \u2013 great question, Cory, and a very timely question. So, I'll answer the second part of it first. This is Jeff. There is no higher priority here than executing on our CF strategy and we're obviously making great progress there, pretty much all respects and we're not going to take that foot off the gas. We're going to put our foot down on the gas. We really believe now we are well inside of being able to find one or more triple combinations that's going to allow us to treat 80% to 90% of all patients. So that's clearly priority number one for the entire organization, as well as for the BD organization by the way. If we did see anything else out there that was complementary that we think we could make better regimen, we would certainly be interested in that.","However, we also are getting much closer to the end, again really in CF we believe. And so, it's a great time and we have started thinking quite a bit over the last even year or so about what's next in CF. And so, let me answer it from a strategic standpoint and then I'll let Ian answer maybe from a more specific BD standpoint. So, strategically, as you know, for a number of years now talk about the CF (25:18) clearance is being a model for what we want to do, meaning high unmet medical need, potentially transformative therapies where there are no therapies and specialty markets that have very low SG&A spend requirements, which allow us to funnel most of our revenue or OpEx anyway into R&D in new diseases and that's exactly the kind of diseases we're looking for, whether it's internal investments or external investments for what that for CF and I think, as you know, David Altshuler joined several years ago, he spent a lot of time, I would say, tailoring our portfolio of internal research to diseases like that and there are diseases like \u2013 that we've talked about like sickle-cell disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin disease, adrenoleukodystrophy, that they all look and smell a lot like CF in a whole variety of respects. And I think that's what you can expect our internal portfolio to look like, and we have a number of those programs that we haven't talked about as well.","The other part of the tailoring of the portfolio has been that we've out-licensed several assets that didn't fit that strategy. So you saw us out-license our flu asset, which was a really interesting drug, but a community drug, to J&J. And you saw us out-license recently our oncology portfolio, again some really interesting transformative assets that didn't really fit our commercial and development strategy.","So I'm pleased with where the internal portfolio is now, and our investments in the internal portfolio, but we've also obviously recognized that, like most companies of our size and stage, we are going to have to supplement our internal portfolio, as good as it is, with some external assets as well. And you've seen us starting to do that. I think the good news is, as our financial situation and strength, and considerably our cash accumulation has strengthened, and will strengthen, it gives us that much more firepower to go out and acquire other programs and assets to complement our internal portfolio. You're not going to see us go out and acquire revenues, products with revenues in 2018, 2019, we don't need to, but maybe I'll turn it over there to Ian to describe again our BD strategy. And with the only change over time being that we have more firepower to execute that strategy.","Ian F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff. I actually don't have too much to add to that, (27:27) said it many times on this call, number one strategy is look at everything in CF that complements our approach in CF. Number two is, continue to think about scientific platforms and different modalities that give us opportunity in other diseases that Jeff was describing. And then number three is, how do we just continue to expand our pipeline? And to Jeff's point today, we have $1.4 billion of cash. We don't have debt. We do have a revolver facility, but we \u2013 of $800 million, but we haven't drawn anything down on it. So we have a significant financial capability to continue to invest in areas that would be consistently where Vertex is focused.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk about the U.S. versus ex-U.S. revenue breakdown this quarter?","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yes, Ying. So for ORKAMBI, of the $295 million in total, the U.S. accounted for $264 million, and ex-U.S. was the balance, $31 million. For KALYDECO, of the $186 million, we recorded $102 million of that was in the U.S. and $84 million was ex-U.S.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. And then also, Stu, you mentioned that you just reached a reimbursement agreement in Denmark, and also in Ireland in principle. Can you talk about roughly, are they close to what the pricing you got from Germany? Thank you.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the question. Yeah, so we're delighted that we are reaching increasing numbers of pricing and reimbursement agreements. Denmark is one, we have an agreement in principle, as you said, in Ireland, and we're really pleased that these are coming through, and patients in these countries are now going to have access to the product, which will begin to contribute in the second half. In terms of specifically commenting on pricing, we obviously can't do that. These are confidential agreements between us and the relevant authorities, and so we can't comment on the specific prices.","Ian F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And, Stuart, (29:45) opportunity to talk about how we think about guidance going forward, that talking about the price that we're gaining, obviously, these are confidential, to Stuart's point. And so, we are thinking more about helping you understand the revenue line by providing you guidance per product. But then as we look into the future, obviously, we have the potential now, as we create more medicines, that patients that may be on KALYDECO may move on to TEZ and IVA, and those patients that once were on ORKAMBI may also move on TEZ and IVA.","So we're starting to think about, how to help you understand our revenue trajectory and other things that worth discussing here and obviously we'll get some feedback from the Street as well, but what we're thinking about here is providing you kind of total CF revenues. So at the end of the day, our objective here is to use all the medicines to treat as many patients as possible, and ultimately that's what's important, is treating as many patients as possible, which will translate to a total CF product revenue line. And so, we're giving this some thoughts about how we provide guidance in the future as well.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Ian.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tony Butler with Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Tony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks very much for taking the questions. Jeff, two if I may. In clinical trials, the size of the cohorts for VX-440 are vastly different from that of VX-152. And I'm just curious that as you roll out the press release later in the second half, will there be sufficient patients to actually make a judgment \u2013 for us to make a judgment between the two different molecules in the triple, and more importantly, whether or not there is comparative activity in het\/min as well as in homozygous cohorts?","And the second question is, very simply, does Teva bind at the same site as Luma (31:38)? Thank you.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. So let me answer both of those. So first of all, with respect to the size of the trials, it may be a little misleading in terms of what you're looking at on ClinicalTrials.gov, because we want \u2013 the VX-440 trial actually has three parts to it. The first part, Part A and Part B, are the initial smaller trials, 40 patients het\/mins, and 25 patients homozygous. Part C is the 12-week trial with 130 patients, that's what's contributing the good patient number that you're seeing there. But Part A and B are the parts that we'll be making the decisions on with the data this year and those were actually quite similar to VX-152. VX-152 has 35 patients in Part-A, and about the same number maybe slightly smaller in Part-B. And so in fact, we will have an apples-to-apples comparison. We chose the size of those trials, based upon now all these experience that we've had in Phase 2 trials, which is now many, many Phase 2 trials with CFTR modulators. And as you know, if you go back and you look at those trials, this kind of size of trial is 20 to 35 patients. Each has been very, very informative in every case essentially predicted the Phase 3 results almost precisely.","So we do have a high level of confidence that we're going to be able to compare these and make decisions based on these trial sizes. VX-659 is slightly smaller, it's one cohort of patients and VX-445 again is slightly bigger, but even there, we think we're going to get pretty good reads to be able to make good decisions about which ones to take forward.","Tony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","That's helpful. And again Teva is probably of the same size as Luma (33:14)?","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yes. Thanks for that. Again, Teva and Luma (33:17) do bind at the same site. They have the same \u2013 we believe the same mechanism of action.","Tony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you very much, Jeff.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Liisa Bayko with JMP Securities. Your line is open.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question and great quarter. I just think about rolling out tezacaftor\/ivacaftor and how will that interact with ORKAMBI? Will this be \u2013 are you thinking about sort of saving out ORKAMBI over time, and the switch strategy or how should we think about the interaction of those two?","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, Liisa, it's Stuart here. Great question, thanks. Yes, so obviously we're very pleased with the data that we saw earlier this year from the tezacaftor\/ivacaftor Phase 3 program, clearly the aging has a very positive benefit risk profile. In terms of patient populations that we think are likely to be the most interested in it, but if we start with the F508 homozygous population, we're really thinking there that as we know, there are a large number of patients who wanted to be on a CFTR modulator like ORKAMBI, but unfortunately we're unable to stay on the product after because of adverse events. We think that's going to be a population of patients and their physicians who are likely to be very keen to try the tezacaftor\/ivacaftor combination. We also know that there are a number of patients who are na\u00efve to therapy, have never tried ORKAMBI and we think they also may think more favorably about the benefit risk profile of tezacaftor\/ivacaftor.","So those populations would both be additional patients who might be taking a CFTR modulator and really that's likely to be our focus with tezacaftor\/ivacaftor, if there are patients who are already on ORKAMBI and who are doing really very well, I think that's going to be a decision for the physician and for the patient, whether they want to consider transitioning to tezacaftor\/ivacaftor.","And then the second population obviously which would also be an additional population is the residual function population, and at present in both the U.S. and in the EU those patients have no product which can treat the underlying course of their disease, and so that again would be an entirely new population, and that's why we say, that tezacaftor\/ivacaftor in addition to be the basis for the triple combination is a really important medicine and you said it right, because it's totally in line with our strategy of bringing medicines forward which allow us to treat more patients with CF.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you. And then as we move to triple, are you thinking this is a kind of one size fits all, more or less across the majority of the CF patients, where it is applicable or do you think you might have still some doublets or different triple combinations for different population?","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, Liisa, this is Jeff. That's a \u2013 it's a great question and an important one, and I think there is still not a full understanding of this, I do want to spend a minute, because our thinking has changed, honestly, too as we started to see this data. But the most important fact that sort of ground the answer in is that 80% to 90% of all patients with CF have at least one Delta 508 allele, that is rather (36:35) 50% homozygous 508\/508 or their 508 with something else on the other allele. It could a minimal function mutation, could be a gating mutation, could be residual function mutation. So, there's really only about 10% of all the patients who don't have at least one 508 allele.","And the reason that's important is because, what we are learning is, and I hope we'll see this result when we see the triple data in the second half of this year, that we believe a triple from all of our study of our data will allow us to address all of those patients maximally, that is, if you think about the homozygous population, we believe that a triple will be better than any double, that's what our cell data tells us. And if you look at the het\/min population, we believe the triple obviously will be better than the doubles or the singles, because right now those don't work. And if you look at the residual functions or the gating patients, 90% of those patients will have (37:34) so a triple will be better for them too. And so, once you get to that sort of insight, you realize that actually where this whole field is moving is away from the monotherapies and dual therapies to a single optimal triple therapy that's highly effective and tolerable, it's going to treat these 80% to 90% of patients. And the patients who are left, who don't have a 508, they'll be a small number of patients for example (38:01), they could be treated with KALYDECO monotherapy, but (38:07) very small numbers here.","And then the final 10% of those patients who don't have a 508 (38:14) likely start credence for the most part and they're going to need a genetic therapy like Gene Editing or Gene Therapy. So we believe this is going to very rapidly transition over to a single triple for 80% to 90% of the patients, a few patients less perhaps on KALYDECO monotherapy who don't have 508 and then the remaining 10% to 12% really will require genetic therapy, which obviously we're working on, but that's farther out.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you. And then I think, just my last question, just along these lines as well is, targeting CFTR is the triple kind of at the upper end or do you think there might be a quad after that or do you really have to think about another mechanism like EMAC and if there is any update there that will be great too? Thank you.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yes, that's a little bit of both. So we certainly are still interested in looking at other mechanisms, EMAC being the first one where as you know, we received some data in the second half of this year, because the reason being it is a completely different mechanism, and so one might predict that no matter how (39:16) you could add EMAC here and get some additional benefits. So, that's one way of \u2013 one important way that we're thinking about it.","With respect to we're taking a triple to acquire, just more CFTR correctors and potentiators. I think we're going to have to see the data from these compounds and also continue to get data from our new strategy second gen correctors, because we got \u2013 we continue to see improvements in those, but I've to tell you the levels we're seeing and we've shown you this from (39:45) next-gen correctors, those like VX-659, in particular, are really quite high.","And so, yes, we can probably raise the bar a little bit maybe with some others, but we're probably closing in on that single kind of therapy. I think the question will be how does that translate in the clinic, in other words, (40:04) in the clinic and we just don't know that, we haven't reached it. We know, we can get 15% improvement, for instance in gating patients, gating, 508 patients with tez\/iva. The question is, then we see it from the triples, can we go beyond that? And I think only the clinical data is going to tell us.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Adam Walsh with Stifel. Your line is open.","Adam Walsh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is on CTP-656. Can you give us some guidance around whether you think there would be any anti-trust issues on the acquisition of that molecule from Concert, given that you already have KALYDECO? And I did notice in the Concert proxy documents that you had withdrawn and re-filed your pre-merger notification in report form with the U.S. regulatory authorities there. Can you just kind of explain that to us whether or you anticipate any FDC issues and what the timing of the clearance would be. That's the first one. Thank you.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Well, we're actually \u2013 Adam, thank you for the question. We're actually in the review period now and we're working with the regulators as they have questions. But let me just be clear of why we want to acquire CTP-656. It is (41:23) which based on the earlier studies and PK work suggested it's once a day potentiator. That interests us because we have once a day correctors, the portfolio that Jeff referred earlier on this call. So ultimately, we would like to think about a combination pill to once a day regimen and CTP-656 gives us that opportunity. That would be the best regimen for patients, as long as we have safety and efficacy and it will be the most convenience for patients and that is the plan. And so, as we go through this review period with the regulators, we will be happy to understand that taking forward CTP-656, this is the best route forward for the compound.","Adam Walsh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And any color on the timing of when that might conclude the clearance?","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","It can go on for a couple of months, few months, it's really subject, we answer questions and then they make their judgment, so it could move on. We do \u2013 (42:27) also have an investor vote coming up I believe in mid-May on the approval of the transaction as well, subject to HSR.","Adam Walsh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Right. And then different question on ORKAMBI in the 6 to 11 population. You talked about strong compliance and persistence. When we think about that in 6 to 11 population, should we be thinking compliance and persistence rates equivalent to say KALYDECO, maybe even a little bit better given the parents are involved. How should we think about those rates ultimately? Thanks.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Adam, we're moving away really from diagnosing and describing every patient dynamic for every patient population for every country, but suffice to say, they are higher in the 6 to 11 population than we have seen in the 12 plus population with ORKAMBI, and they're much more KALYDECO-like and you'd expect that the profile in the 6 to 11 age group of ORKAMBI is very strong and also, as I've said, they are managed by their parents to a large degree, in terms of compliance.","Adam Walsh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That's great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Mohit Bansal - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter. Maybe a big picture \u2013 maybe a question on the \u2013 your base case assumption for the triple combination trials. So, it is fair to assume that FDA would be looking for a comparator trial against ORKAMBI for the triple combo, at least in homozygotes, and do you think it makes \u2013 it maybe makes it little bit easier in heterozygotes, given that you will have to compete against placebo as a comparator there?","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Mohit, thanks for the question. So, let me start by just reminding you of our cellular results, right, which so far have translated into the clinic in pretty much every case. And those results show that the triple is clearly superior, quite superior, and we published those results in both homozygote cells and in het\/min cells to the double, to either ORKAMBI or to VX-661 plus KALYDECO.","So, based upon those in vitro results, which as I said, have translated quite safely in the clinic. We expect \u2013 actually expect the triple will be better in homozygous patients than the double, and we expect it will effective, based on what we know so far, obviously we have to confirm all this in the clinic, in the het\/ min patients where both ORKAMBI and VX-661 (44:58).","Mohit Bansal - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with UBS. Your line is open.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Good afternoon, guys and congrats on the quarter.","I guess in the wake of the positive tez\/iva data, I was just curious on how you guys are looking at the potential development scenarios for your ENaC inhibitor in the case where there's positive Phase II data later this year. Would the plan still be to move into a pivotal on top of ORKAMBI, or would you pivot tez\/iva, or is there some other set of potential options we should be looking at? Thank you.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yes, great question. So I think the way we're thinking about it is, there are really two questions that we want to answer, and I think the timing is going to work out pretty nicely here. The first question is really a biological question, it's, if you add an ENaC inhibitor on top of CFTR modulation, do you see incremental results? That's really a biologic question that is predicted by cell biology, but this cell biology is a little bit more complicated than the simple chloride transport in HBEs. So we need to prove that, and I think we're going to get the answer to that in the second half of this year from this first trial.","At the same time, we're going to get the answer to what happens with our triples clinically, how high can we drive FEV1 in both the homozygous and the heterozygous population. And so at the end of the day, what we're going to do with ENaC is going to really depend on looking at both those results together and basically asking ourselves the question, can we get a significant benefit over triple, do we believe, with an ENaC inhibitor?","Because we do believe that quickly, where everything is going to move to triple, so I think the ultimate question will be, if you add an ENaC inhibitor on of top of triple, can you get significantly higher FEV1 responses? And that's really going to be dependent upon the magnitude of the FEV1 response to the triple and the magnitude of the improvement on ENaC. The good news is, we'll have both of those pieces of data towards the end of this year, I think we're going to be able to make a fairly straightforward decision.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Michael Partridge - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, we have time for two more questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Just maybe one that's a little bit more philosophical as well, like how many triple combinations do you kind of want to try, like in this first tranche where you're kind of going with the first four, and then you'll see and then you'll take a step back as to see whether you want to add mechanisms on top of that. Just maybe just help us \u2013 give a little bit of color about what's going on in the labs and how you're thinking about kind of progress beyond what you're doing with triples? Thanks.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yes. So, obviously, we're going to get a lot of information from these four triples, I believe, because we're going to have a very nice set of \u2013 dataset to (47:42) results with four different combinations. And that, in addition to the fact that we de-risk the tez\/iva double combination, both from an efficacy and a safety standpoint, gives me a high level of confidence that one or more of these triples will proceed into Phase III. So hopefully that answers that part of the question, and it's going to depend obviously on what we see in the second half of this year.","And to your other question on what's going on in the lab, (48:08) a very active program looking at triples, I think I've talked about this before. We, I think, have really figured out how we identify these, and we've identified tens if not hundreds of additional next-gen correctors.","Obviously, the only ones that we're going to bring forward (48:23) something that we feel has a favorable profile compared to the ones that we've already done. It could be efficacy. It could be PK. It could be tolerability. And if we see those sorts of things, it's entirely possible that we bring one or more of those new next-gen correctors (48:39) clinic towards the end of this year or next year. But I think \u2013 I don't want to give you the impression that we're dependent on that, because I have a high level of confidence that one or more of these triples, certainly (48:53) will be able to proceed with the Phase III.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Alan Carr with Needham. Your line is open.","Alan Carr - Needham & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple; one what's your expectations for timing for the iva\/tez trial in 6 to 11 patients, when that data available and then, can you give us an update on Germany, that was one that is a slow trajectory, I wonder if that's changed over time and are you still have a high level of conviction that that uptake was just restricted to Germany as opposed to some of the other countries in Europe? Thanks.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Alan, it's Stuart here. Let me take the Germany question first, so yes, as you highlighted, we did see a slow uptake in Germany and frankly, it continues to be slow, we are continuing to add new patients day after day, week after week in Germany, but it continues to be relatively slow compared to France and to the U.S. We continue to believe that we will get to the majority of patients in Germany being initiated on ORKAMBI, but it continues to be slow progress. I do continue to believe that the uptake in other countries will be much more U.S. like and France like and for instance, to give you an example, and the point, we're successful in signing a contract in Ireland where we have an agreement in principle, I'm very confident based on the level of patient efficacy, the level of physician engagement with us and belief in the product that we'll see uptake there, which is much likely so in the U.S. and in France. So I continue to believe that uptake in Germany is going to be a relative outline for ORKAMBI and to talk about tez\/iva in 6 to 11, I'll hand the call off to Jeff.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, so for the 6 to 11 tez\/iva trail, just to remind you, this is really a safety, tolerability and PK trials in both homozygous patients and patients who have (51:04) ivacaftor responsibly though, it's an open-label trial, its currently enrolling and once we see what the enrollment is, we'll be able to give you a sense of when we expect data, we actually haven't disclosed that because we just don't know yet.","Alan Carr - Needham & Co.

Actual outcomes and events could differ materially.","I will now turn the call over to Dr. Jeff Leiden.","Jeff Leiden","Thanks, Michael. Good evening everyone.","Today is a special day for everyone at Vertex and for the CF community, as it marks the sixth anniversary of the FDA approval for our first CF medicine KALYDECO. When KALYDECO was first approved in 2012, only 1,200 people worldwide were eligible for medicine to treat the underlying cause of their decease. Today, the number of people eligible for one of our CF medicines has grown to 34,000 worldwide and we will continue to expand the number of eligible patients in 2018, and beyond.","In the past few years, and especially in 2017, we have made remarkable scientific progress that has moved us closer to achieving our ultimate goal in CF. We developed highly effective medicines for all people with the decease.","In today's announcement that we have selected two next-generation correctors to advance into Phase 3 development as part of two different triple combination regimens, we've taken a significant step towards achieving that goal.","I'd like to begin by acknowledging everyone who has helped to bring us to this important milestone in our more than 15 year journey to develop new CF medicine. I would especially like to thank the patience, families, and CF caregivers, for their unwavering support, as well as employees at Vertex for their commitment to this program.","The data announced today are remarkable and demonstrate the potential for significant and consistent clinical benefits in patients with one F508del mutation and a minimal function mutation when treated with a triple combination regimen containing either VX-659 or VX-445.","We remain focused on bringing forward the best triple combination regimen to patients as quickly as possible. Based upon the totality of the data collected today from four different triple combination regimens, and more than 200 people with CF, we believe that both the VX-659 and VX-445 regimens have highly compelling profiles for late-stage development. Therefore we have decided to advance both regimens into Phase 3, one of which we plan to evaluate at a once-daily regimen.","We're having productive discussions with the FDA regarding Phase 3 programs for both triple combination regimens. We look forward to finalizing the design of these programs and remain on track to begin the first Phase 3 studies of a triple combination regimen in the first half of this year.","As I look back over the past year, we had made tremendous progress across all parts of our business and have positioned the company for further success. We continue to increase the number of patients eligible for and treated with our approved medicine which is driving significant revenue. We expect this revenue growth to continue which will in turn also drive significant earnings growth.","We reported positive Phase 3 data for the combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor and are awaiting FDA approval for this important new treatment option which will be a significant contributor to revenue growth beginning this year. The day we provided further hope for those still awaiting a new medicine, the cause of their CF with the selection of two next-generation correctors to move into Phase 3 development as part of triple combination regimen.","And beyond CF we are preparing to begin clinical development of CTX001 in two devastating disease Beta Thalassemia and Sickle cell disease, with our partner CRISPR Therapeutics.","We also expect to move one or more potential medicines from our internal research programs into clinical development in other diseases this year.","I look forward to updating you on our continued progress over the coming year and will now turn the call over to Dr. Jeff Chodakewitz to review today's announcement in more detail.","Jeff Chodakewitz","Thanks, Jeff, and good evening. I'm very pleased to share the initial results from the ongoing Phase 2 studies of the VX-659 and VX-445 triple combination regimen and to review our plans to advance these two different triple combination regimens into Phase 3 development. The initial Phase 2 data reported today are extraordinary from both an efficacy and safety perspective.","Collectively, our Phase 2 studies in more than 200 CF patients provide compelling evidence of the significant clinical benefit that triple combinations may provide the CF patients. All four of our next-generation correctors were advanced into development out of our own labs based not only on their in vitro efficacy profile, but also on their drug like property, including PK profiles, minimal drug interaction potential, ability to be co-formulated with tezacaftor and ivacaftor and others. All of the Phase 2 data generated to-date has validated the rigorous selection criteria we use.","We are today reporting top-line safety and tolerability data as well as efficacy information as measured by mean absolute within group change and percent predicted FEV1, sweat chloride, and CFQR data for the patients with a minimal function mutation from each study.","First to the Phase 2 data for the VX-659 triple regimen. This study evaluated VX-659 in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor or triple placebo for four weeks. 53 patients received one of three doses of VX-659 in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor. Across the study the combination was generally well tolerated and the overall safety profile was favorable. The majority of adverse events were considered mild or moderate. There were no discontinuations due to adverse events. One patient interrupted triple combination dosing due to a rash which resolved following interruption of treatment. The patient restarted and completed triple combination dosing without any further rash.","In the patients who received this triple combination, we observed significant improvements in lung function of 10.2, 11.6, and 13.3 percentage points across the three dose groups that were evident by the second week of the treatment period and sustained through the four-week dosing period. These data are shown on Slide 10.","With sweat chloride, we saw significant decreases of 45.8, 43.7, and 51.4 millimol per liter for the triple combination dose groups. These were the largest decreases in sweat chloride observed for any of our triple combination regimens to-date, these data are shown on Slide 11.","We also observed significant improvements in patient reported respiratory symptoms of 24.6, 19.8, and 21.8 points for those on the triple combination regimen as reported in the CFQR respiratory domain score, these data are shown on Slide 12.","I will now turn to the Phase 2 data for the VX-445 triple regimen. This study evaluated VX-445 in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor or triple placebo for four weeks. 53 patients received one of three doses of VX-445 in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor. Across the study, the combination was generally well tolerated and the overall safety profile was favorable. The majority of adverse events were considered mild or moderate. There were two discontinuations from the treatment groups due to adverse events and none in the placebo group. The treatment discontinuations occurred in the VX-445 100 milligram dose group. One of the treatment discontinuations was due to increased bilirubin with concomitant transaminase elevation which was observed on the final day of dosing. The patients' bilirubin levels returned to baseline during the safety follow-up period after discontinuation of treatment.","The second discontinuation was due to rash and following discontinuation of treatment the rash resolved.","In those who received the VX-445 triple combination regimen we observed significant improvements in lung function of 11.1, 7.8, and 13.8 percentage points that were evident by the second week of the treatment period and sustained through the four-week dosing period, these data are shown on Slide 15.","With sweat chloride, we saw significant decreases of 38.2, 33.2, and 39.1 millimol per liter for the triple combination dose groups, these data are shown on Slide 16.","We also observed significant improvements in patients reported respiratory symptoms of 20.8, 15.4, and 25.7 points for those on the triple combination regimens as reported in the CFQR respiratory domain score, these data are shown on Slide 17.","I would also note that we conducted post dose spirometry evaluations for both of the triple combination regimens in these studies. And so no evidence with Bronco construction. The Phase 2 studies of the VX-659 and VX-445 triple combination regimens are currently ongoing in patients with two F508del mutations.","An additional part of each study is evaluating a potential once daily regimen that contains the once daily potentiator VX-561 in place of twice daily ivacaftor in patients with one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation. These parts of the studies are fully enrolled and the remaining data from each of the Phase 2 studies are expected in the first half of 2018.","Data from across our portfolio of next-generation correctors received to-date show that the potential benefits of treating the cause of CF with triple combination regimens are clear, and support the rapid advancement of the VX-659 and VX-445 triple combination regimens into Phase 3 development.","Our strategy of advancing both VX-659 and VX-445 into Phase 3 gives us the opportunity to generate data from two different triple combination regimens, including one that maybe dosed once daily and picked the best regimen to bring to patients as quickly as possible.","Our discussions with the FDA regarding our Phase 3 program for triple combination regimens have been productive and we have already shared with the FDA the available data for the VX-659 and VX-445 triple combination regimen.","We are now focused on finalizing the design of the Phase 3 programs and we remain on track to initiate the first Phase 3 program in the first half of 2018, upon completion of these discussions.","We plan to conduct two separate studies for each triple combination regimen, a study of each regimen in people with CF who have one F508del mutation, and one minimal function mutation, and a study in those with two F508del mutation.","Following the initiation of the Phase 3 studies with the VX-659 triple combination regimen in the first half of 2018, we plan to initiate the Phase 3 studies for the VX-445 triple regimen in the middle of the year. We plan to evaluate VX-445 in combination with tezacaftor and the once daily potentiater VX-561 as a potential once daily triple combination regimen, pending the Phase 2 data for this regimen, and also the completion of a long-term non-clinical toxicology studies for VX-445.","In addition to evaluating each triple combination regimen in the studies I just discussed we also plan to evaluate each of these triple combination regimen in patients who have one F508del mutation and a second gating or residual function mutation. These studies are planned to begin in the second half of 2018. Once our FDA discussions are complete, we look forward to updating you with more details regarding the specific designs of the study.","Before I close, I'd like to thank everyone who took part in these studies for their commitment to helping us advance the treatment CF.","I'll now turn the call to Ian.","Ian Smith","Thanks, Jeff, and good evening to everyone.","2017 was an outstanding year for Vertex and tonight I'm pleased to review our fourth quarter 2017 financials, and our 2018 full-year financial guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A trends.","Revenues first. Total CF product revenues of $621 million in the fourth quarter 2017 represented 37% increase compared to $454 million we recorded in the fourth quarter 2016.","Our product revenues grew each quarter throughout 2017, as we increased the number of patients treated with our approved medicine. Today, we estimate we have initiated therapy in over 17,000 of the 34,000 patients eligible for our medicine. We expect eligibility and the number of patients we treat to continue to grow throughout 2018.","ORKAMBI we reported fourth quarter 2017 product revenues of $365 million, 32% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The growth in 2017 was driven by the continued uptake of the medicine globally, particularly in children ages 6 to 11 in the U.S.","Fourth quarter 2017 KALYDECO revenues were $206 million, a 44% increase compared to the fourth quarter 2016. This significant growth in 2017 was driven by the rapid uptake of the medicine by patients in the U.S. with residual function mutation following the label expansion of these patients in mid 2017.","Our fourth quarter 2017 non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were $355 million compared to $295 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily due to the continued acceleration and advancement of our portfolio of triple combination regimens with CF and the investments to support the treatment of patients with our medicines globally.","Non-GAAP net profit for the fourth quarter 2017 was $158 million compared to non-GAAP net profit of $88 million for the fourth quarter 2016. The increase in non-GAAP net profit was largely driven by the strong growth in total CF product revenue.","Our financial performance in 2017 has resulted in a full year non-GAAP operating margins of 26% compared to 17% for the full-year of 2016. And as we continue to increase the number of patients that we treat with our medicines we expect our operating margins to continue to expand in the future.","We also strengthened our balance sheet during the year, as we ended 2017 with approximately $2.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities compared to $1.4 billion at the beginning of the year. This increased cash position was after we paid down $300 million in the first quarter 2017 that was outstanding under our revolving credit facility.","Now turning to guidance. We today provided financial guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses. As we have stated previously, we expect to provide 2018 revenue guidance when we received FDA approval for the tezacaftor\/ivacaftor combination. The FDA action date is February 28, 2018. When we provide revenue guidance it will be for total CF product revenues and will not include guidance for individual products.","We do expect significant CF product revenue growth in 2018, driven by the launch of tezacaftor\/ivacaftor in the U.S for eligible patients 12 and older and who treat more patients with ORKAMBI in countries outside the U.S.","As we think about the first quarter 2018, we anticipate revenues will be impacted by higher gross to net revenue adjustments that we experienced in the first quarter of each year and by channel inventory build that occurred in the fourth quarter 2017.","Now to operating expenses. In 2018, we expect combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses of $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion. The key investment drivers are the execution of pivotal studies for two triple combination regimens, supply chain investment for the potential commercial success of the triple combination regimen, and incremental investment to support the planned launch of tezacaftor\/ivacaftor.","As we anticipate our revenue growth will significantly exceed the increase in our operating expenses, we do expect operating margins and earnings to continue to expand in 2018.","2017 was a transformative year for Vertex and the continued execution across all parts of our business has positioned us to deliver sustainable revenue and earnings growth, as we significantly increase the number of patients we treat with our medicine.","With that, I will now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","Our first question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Leerink. Your question please.","Geoffrey Porges","Thank you very much and congratulations guys on the expected results and the spectacular Phase 2 data. I was particularly struck by one number which was a 51% sweat chloride response which was quite remarkable. Perhaps Jeff could you comment a little bit about what appears to be the difference between 51% and 39% sweat chloride response and is that suggesting to you that 659 might be a little bit more active and potent? And then, could you also comment on why no 561 plan with 659 since it looks as though 659 is a little bit cleaner, a little bit more active, why wouldn't you want to be planning on doing a 561 combination? Thanks. Appreciate it.","Jeff Leiden","Yes, Geoff, this is Jeff Leiden. Thanks for both questions. Let me answer the second one first actually it\u2019s really a strategic portfolio question. And I just remind you that our approach here is to make sure that we get the best regimen to these patients as quickly as possible. And that's one reason we're taking two regimens forward into Phase 3 because as you pointed out both of them look really quite good, both of them are -- in fact all four of our regimens we feel showed results that were certainly significant enough to take into Phase 3.","But we're taking two forward because that's one way of modifying one risk and that's the risk of some rare off target toxicity due to the next-gen corrector in one of these regimens and obviously by taking two forward, we mitigate that risk.","And then to your question why take one forward with Iva, one forward potentially with VI and I say potentially because we still need to confirm that with our VX-561 results and that is our plan to take 6594 with Iva and if it's supported by the data 445 with VI, but. And the reason is the same it's a way of mitigating risk, right.","VI although is obviously very similar to Iva, is a different chemical compound. We have only seen it in tens or less than 100 patients. And so I would hate to put all my eggs in that basket and find out there is some very rare tolerability or safety issue with the Iva that would set both programs back. So mitigate that risk and the way we feel better about that is let's assume that at the end of the day, we decide VX-659 and Iva as the best regimen that's the one we're going to take forward and commercialize.","We have the opportunity we believe to quickly bridge over to VX-6561 into a once a day regimen simply with some bioequivalent type of data. And so I think we're just trying to use a portfolio approach to hedge both of those risks and we have a strategy for eventually getting to that once a day regimen whether it's 659 or 445, it turns out to be the winner at the end of the day.","Geoffrey Porges","Great, thanks Jeff. And anything in the difference between the sweat chloride and the FEV1?","Jeff Leiden","Yes, so thanks for pointing sweat chloride. As you know, we always talk about FEV1 and sort of sometimes nor a sweat chloride. One of the things that's really impressed to me about the next-gen data in general is the sweat chloride drops we are seeing. Remember this is an augmentation the most difficult to treat patients with only one 508 allele and we're seeing 40 to 50 and north of 50 millimol drops of sweat chloride which is truly remarkable.","And I think it suggests that we are really very effectively getting at the underlying cause of this disease which is what is so reassuring about the consistency of all these data. I don't think there are differences honestly between 40 and 50 millimol in this number of patients' that we put ahead on if they're both really profound.","And I would just remind you with respect to picking regimens, it's really not any one value, it's not just sweat chloride, it's not just the FEV1 response, it's the totality of the profiles. The good news is they all look very, very good. So we are picking a bit between sirloin steak and filet mignon here but it will take these in the end to take the winner based upon the totality of the profile, both efficacy and safety, tolerability.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies. Your question please.","Michael Yee","Thanks for the question and congrats on all the announcement of data today, it's two part question. First was maybe just comment on the dose response and the tolerability profile of the two programs, it seems like there's sort of a dose response but also maybe not really clinically meaningful? And then the second part of that is maybe just comment on the Bilirubin case and then as it relates to the Phase 3 design rather than ask about the duration of efficacy of Phase 3 maybe just remind us what's the precedent is for filing on duration of safety and how much safety you would need to file these types of things or win these types of things? Thanks so much.","Jeff Leiden","Thanks Mike. I'll answer the first part on the tolerability of dose response, maybe Jeff can talk to the Bilirubin, and I will come back and talk about safety and timing question there.","First of all with respect to dose response, again one of the things that's very impressive to me is we look at four regimens, we look at multiple doses, and we look at that totality across those four regimens they did remarkably well to hey considering we are talking about 20, 22, 40, 50 patient study.","I mean every case but one that will come back to is a pretty clear dose response whether you're looking at sweat chloride, whether you're looking at FEV1. So the compounds are quite well behaving that way. The one outlier which I think you're pointing out is the 100 milligrams dose of the 445 in which the FEV1 response and sweat chloride response look pretty similar to the 50 milligram dose. And then when you go up to 200, you see the jump again. So we were interested in that trying to understand it and of course what we are really interested in the end is the exposure response, right, not just the dose response. And so we went back and we looked at exposures in that -- in all the studies but in particularly that one and what you see is interesting if you look at the 50 and 100 milligram doses of 445 the exposures are quite overlapping and the FEV1 and sweat chloride, sweat chloride is quite overlapping, if you look at those confidence intervals.","When you move up to 200, you see a clear differentiation a jump in exposure and you see a clear jump in FEV1 and sweat chloride. And so actually 445 turns out to be well behaved too as long as you are looking to relevant thing which is exposure versus response.","And with respect to tolerability I will let Jeff talk about Bilirubin in a second. One of the things here that is very reassuring is that across all the doses, we are seeing excellent tolerability. There is really no evidence of a dose or exposure tolerability pattern or problem here with any one of these compounds which is what makes us feel good about the therapeutic index or window, it's going to make it I think easier for us to go in and look at these doses and pick the best doses for each compound which we will between the process of doing. Now maybe Jeff on the tolerability?","Jeff Chodakewitz","Sure. I do think that consistency across the dose range is really very, very telling. Mike in terms of your specific question on Bilirubin, I think the really key point here is that this was an isolated finding. There were no evidence of transaminate elevations or any other findings about the liver as you heard actually with interruption that rapidly resolved and the one patient actually restarted and continued on without any further elevation. So that's really a pattern that isn't clinically concerning. So we don't see it as an issue.","Jeff Leiden","And then finally, your duration of Safety day question, as you know, we don\u2019t really speculate on that's an FDA or European Regulator decision at the end of the day. I can point you to our just some of our historical data where we've been between six months and a year of safety data in most of these studies, but these are the sessions we\u2019re having with FDA.","I think the important point is this is a medicine, these medicines would be things are asking children to take for the rest of their lives. And so we do want to make sure that we have a complete safety dataset that we're comfortable with and that regulators are comfortable with. And it will be that efficacy, the ratio of course of efficacy and safety at the end of the day will be the decision making.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Your question please.","Geoff Meacham","Hi guys, thanks for the question. I also wanted to offer my congrats. Just ask two questions a little bit different way, I know the goal here ultimately is to maximize FEV1, but it's also obviously to get to a positive risk benefit as quickly as possible. So how do you guys balance those two and what do you think the upper end of an FEV1 could be. I'm just trying to think down the road competitively when you have perhaps new therapy or other combination available in development? Thanks.","Jeff Leiden","Let me answer they are a bit related, Geoff. So first of all just to be clear while FEV1 is an important indicator of acute benefit, our goal is actually bigger than that and we measure efficacy in this disease not only by FEV1 but by long-term efficacy results that we have been seeing very clearly with both KALYDECO and ORKAMBI and that includes decreases in the slope of the decline of the lung function curve, it includes hospitalization, pulmonary exacerbation, IV antibiotics all which are very favorably impacted by both KALYDECO and ORKAMBI.","And at the end of the day it's really the combination of what the acute response you can get what all of those chronic things that we would create as success to CF. And that's particularly true as you move back to the younger age patients. Remember there may be and likely will be a ceiling on acute FEV1 in a 30-year-old patient who starts with an FEV1 at 50 because they have a fair amount of structural lung disease and you are not going to be able to reverse that. It's a very different story in a young two-year-old or one-year-old who is starting with an FEV1 at 95 or 100 and you are really trying to do something different there, you are trying to prevent the disease or modify the course of the disease and that of course is our ultimate goal.","So acute FEV1 is one measurement, it depends a little bit on who you are treating as to what the ceiling will be, I don't think we have explored yet fully that ceiling, one of the things we want to do. But I do want to be really clear that the long-term goal is much more than acute FEV1, it's really modifying the course of the disease long-term, as measured by all the things that I just told you about.","One of the reasons we want to look at that with the triple is this maybe the last time that anyone can do a placebo-controlled trial of a CFTR modulating therapy and obviously those longer-term endpoints are going to be very, very useful and very interesting and important I think for us to measure.","Geoff Meacham","And Jeff just as a follow-up to that as you guys have great technology looking at cellular assays and pulmonary assays, I mean what's the once you get into the clinic with these Phase 3s what is the interest or focus level on getting some proof-of-concept data and things like IVF or COPD or something pulmonary but not quite CF or have you guys not gone down that path yet?","Jeff Leiden","Yes. I thought you're going to actually ask me a different question. I thought you're going to ask me are you still going to work on getting better correctors. So let me answer that question and the answer is yes. And the reason is because we know from sort of an experiment of nature that if you are a carrier and which means you have one mutation, but a normal allele, you have chloride transport in yourselves of about 80% of normal somewhere right around there. And we know you don't get the disease. And so if we can drive everybody to carriers' data with a triple regimen and we are getting pretty close with some of these regimens now, we believe and treat early that we can actually turn patients into carriers which of course is the ultimate goal. So we are going to continue to work on better and better next-gen correctors because we\u2019re seeing that we can still up the efficacy.","With respect to IVF and COPD, we are totally focused here on finishing the journey in CF right now. We want to get these triples to everybody who has one 508 or two 508 alleles and that's going to be plenty of work over the next couple of years and when we finish that journey of course we will consider other things that we might use these medicines for. But right now we are pretty focused on CF.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau from Cowen and Company. Your question please.","Phil Nadeau","Good afternoon. Maybe I would add my congratulations on good data in the quarter, first scientific one then a financial one. On the scientific side you mentioned that the compounds are well tolerated but you did note some pulmonary type side effects in the adverse events. Can you talk a little bit about the characteristic of those pulmonary side effects, were those kind of like where you have seen with KALYDECO where it\u2019s clear that the lungs have been cleared and that's what gives rise to the sputum and coughing or are they were different characterization?","Jeff Chodakewitz","So thanks, it's Jeff Chodakewitz. No I think you have it exactly right that in fact it was things like cough and sputum clear that really they reported as adverse events but we actually think of them almost as a marker potential effects of the underlying pharmacology that we're trying to get. So that's really the way.","I would say just one other comment that we look very specifically as we mentioned in the prepared remarks right from the beginning in these studies to be -- to look for any kind of post-dosing decreases in FEV1. We've got all that data and there is nothing there. So it\u2019s the pattern is exactly what you're describing.","Phil Nadeau","Okay. Then second one on the side effects you mentioned that there is really nothing concerning about the Bilirubin or rash. Was there anything confounding in those patients that could have giving rise to those side effects that was not trigger-related?","Jeff Leiden","No. You have to remember, which is a good thing, very small numbers of people with any of these adverse events we're talking about. I think to say were there any other confounders I think it\u2019s really too early to tell. But again the important thing is that they were generally mild to moderate, they resolve quickly, and as we told you the safety profile very favorable.","Phil Nadeau","Great, thanks. And Ian one last question for you on finances. I know you are not going to give guidance until tez\/iva is approved hopefully next month. Could you give us some general sense about how you feel about the current consensus estimates for 2018 based on my math, you seem to assume about 9% year-over-year growth versus Q4's run rate. Is that the same kind of reasonable; can you discuss maybe what the drivers of growth will be for the franchise in 2018?","Ian Smith","Sure. Thanks for the question, Phil. When you look at consensus coming to the call even though we won't any give guidance we thought that question may come up. And so firstly I would say that the number that we see in the consensus for 2018 does reflect growth which is consistent with how we think about 2018. Obviously we are waiting on the approval of tez\/iva that will be the major growth factor of the 2018 revenue line.","And so as we look at that consensus number we like where it is, it's consistent with how we\u2019re thinking about it, we will give you greater clarity once we get the approval in tez\/iva. I would take this opportunity to remind those who are on the call, that it is our intent to give 2018 revenue guidance but it would be a total CF revenue guidance. With the approval of tez\/iva we should see switches from ORKAMBI to tez\/iva, we should see going from KALYDECO to tez\/iva. So for us the guidance will be a total CF revenues.","And then also consistent with some of my remarks, I made on the prepared remarks, I would just ask people to work with our IR Group after the call to think about the models through the year. Q1 we do anticipate being affected by the inventory build that would have occurred in Q4 of 2017, although we're still committed to a growth area driven by the approval of tez\/iva.","Phil Nadeau","That's helpful. Could you give us sense of the size of that inventory build?","Ian Smith","Yes, but it wasn't very big, but I'll give you comment on the nature of it. So in the U.S. given how the New Year felt there was some inventory stocking in the U.S. and overseas there was some forward buying around Europe that would not normally have occurred in Q1 that was actually pulled forward into Q4. The size of it, it's around $10 million to $15 million. So if you think about how that gets pulled into Q4, it's has a double impact in terms of helping Q4, but offsetting in Q1. Obviously we still have a great Q4 number so the demand is strong more, more patients are going on drug and compliance is good.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alethia Young from Credit Suisse. Your question please.","Alethia Young","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the very, very telling data maybe we'll start with a triple. Just when you talk about European reimbursement and the portfolio deals, do you think the long-term data that you're kind of generating overtime in real world experience will drive this combinations or is the kind of combination of all things? And then the second question is just as far as the sickle cell program with CRISPR what is the most step may be taken in the U.S. for an IND filing and can you give us any updated thoughts around design things?","Stuart Arbuckle","Yes, Alethia it's Stuart here. I'll take the first question and then Jeff Leiden will take the question on sickle cell so. I think one of the driving factors between but behind governments being interested in these portfolio arrangements is the rapid progress they can see that we are making in developing treatments that treat the underlying course of the disease in up in 90% of patients. And so yes that's been one of the most compelling things to governments around the worldwide they've been interested because they can see the rate of progress we're making in and just how good the results are that we're seeing in these patients. So that's been a certainly a very strong drive to them wanting to talk about portfolio type arrangements.","Jeff Chodakewitz","And it\u2019s Jeff Chodakewitz just quick follow-up on the sickle cell. As you know we commented we filed the -- with CRISPR, the CTA for beta thalassemia, at the very end of 2018. We're in process with CRISPR of putting together that IND and we expect to file that IND during this year and then will be looking to initiate those studies in people with both sickle cell and Beta thalassemia. Exactly when that will happen and the timing we're going to have to be further along in that process and then we'll be able to give you a better sense.","Alethia Young","Just follow-up on that I mean is there any kind of different conversation around bringing these programs into the clients between U.S. and Europe?","Jeff Leiden","The Beta thalassemia program will be done Europe and the sickle cell will program will be done primarily in the U.S.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.","Ying Huang","Hi, thanks for taking questions. Congrats on the quarter. Maybe can I ask to you little bit differently on the FDA requirement on the Phase 3 given the data you have seen so far including today's efficacy in Phase 2 as well as the Phase 2 designation, do you guys think the FDA will require the same amount of safety data as well as same duration for efficacy analysis in the Phase 3. And then also on rash and bilirubin, did that happen in the lower dose or higher dose of those two trials. Thank you.","Jeff Leiden","Yes, it\u2019s Jeff Leiden I\u2019ll answer your first question. And I think we learned a lot about during these CF trials as the FDAs as we worked together over the last six or seven years through a number of different medicine. As you know, as an example we tend to see the full FEV1 effects within 48 weeks and everything that we're seeing here suggest that is going to be true as well.","So I think that in general the efficacy time points can be on the shorter side, in other words, you don't need six months on your data. On the other hand safety is obviously very important here as well and you don\u2019t get a read on safety data in four weeks or eight weeks, so it\u2019s likely going to be longer and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re discussing now which is what is the length of each one of those endpoints and in particular that safety database, how big should it be and how long should it be as soon as we know that we will let you know.","Jeff Chodakewitz","And it\u2019s Jeff Chodakewitz in terms of your question about dose actually with mixed across doses and so -- and an exposure there was no real linkage.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Your questions please.","Terence Flynn","Hi, thanks for taking the question. May be two for me just I was wondering at a high level if you can just give us some framework for how to think about teza\/iva pricing, what are some of the key inputs. And then as we see the data today again does this change that discussion at all as you guys think about potential pricing? And then on the triple combo Phase 3 program and homozygous patients is will it definitely include a control arm and what will that control arm will be, can you tell us at the point? Thank you.","Jeff Leiden","Terence, on tez\/iva pricing obviously not going to comment specifically on it, we'll do that at the point that we get approval from the regulators. But in terms of the considerations we're taking into account they really are the same as we've taken into account consistently for KALYDECO and ORKAMBI and that is the magnitude of the clinical benefit that we are able to deliver. And as you know, we believe we\u2019ve got a very strong profile with the tezacaftor\/ivacaftor and then consideration is the size of the patient population we're going to able to benefit. We will be taking those same considerations into account when we come to making the pricing decision on tez\/iva pending regulatory approval.","Jeff Chodakewitz","With respect to the homozygous trial we're still discussing that but will there be a control on almost certainly yes. And at that point remember most of these homozygous patients will be on either on ORKAMBI or tezacaftor\/ ivacaftor and so it will likely not be a placebo control on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please.","Brian Abrahams","Hey guys thanks for taking my questions and my congratulations on the data and the quarter as well. On the triple I guess I\u2019m wondering broadly speaking what primarily drove your selection of these next-generation correctors over 440 and 152 and what did you see with the additional dosing of 152 and could 152 and 440 still service as backups? And then on the Phase 3 plans I know these are still under discussion but just wondering if the right way to think about this is for the het\/mins group to potential, for het\/mins potentially upcoming through first just given the unmet need and possibly different regulatory barb as to homozygous or should we expect those to sort of follow through concurrently. Thanks.","Jeff Leiden","Yes, so with respect to -- this is Jeff again -- Jeff Ledien again. With respect to choosing between the four different regimens I mean those really totality of the data and that means the acute FEV1 and sweat chloride on the efficacy side, certainly the tolerability and safety profiles on the other side, but some additional factors as well co-formidability the dose that we need to give and could we get that in one pill manufacturability all those went into the decision.","As I said that it was little bit of a hard decision they were all quite good. We could have taken any of them into Phase 3 and that\u2019s obviously a good problem to have, but there were some differences. I'll give you one just as an example 659 and 445 have potentially to be once a day whereas 152 and 440 were clearly going to a twice a day. Well once a day in our mind is an advantage should put a check in that box 440 in it's preclinical data, as you know, had some 659 and 445 didn't, so you can put a check in that box on the side of 659 and 445. As we went down the whole list of benefit and efficacy standpoint safety and tolerability co-formidability and manufacturability these two went out, it was a little bit of horse race, they went out by 10 lanes, but we feel that they have the best overall profile from an efficacy, safety, and formulation standpoint.","And then your other question was about het\/mins versus homozygous. I just want to step back and remind you again that we believe the data that we have strongly supports the notion that these triple should be used in any one who has one 508 or two 508 alleles in het\/mins or homozygous and our plan has to pursue a clinical course to make sure that we get that done as quickly as possible.","You're absolutely right that the het\/mins has the biggest unmet need because today they don't have any CFTR modulation. But I would also remind you that when we looked at the triples in the homozygous patients that was a very, very significant incremental effect on FEV1 when you add an next-gen corrector to tezacaftor\/ivacaftor. And so while the acute need may not be as great we feel that the benefit may be every bit as great in those patients so we don\u2019t want to leave any patients behind or slowdown in one of these populations and we\u2019re just talking with regulators about how do we get that done most effectively and most quickly.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.","Matthew Harrison","Great. Thanks very much for taking the question. I guess I just wanted to ask one follow-up on safety tolerability here you saw some rash across both studies you commented before about GI tacts I guess what I was wondering is can you just talk us a little bit about some of the clinical side effects you\u2019ve seen versus what you\u2019ve seen preclinical with these components and do they match up at all? And I guess the basis for the question is pre-clinically you some of the chest patients before with ORKAMBI and then I was unclear you didn\u2019t see it at a high frequency in some of the initial studies, so I\u2019m just trying to understand your comfort around some of these issues? Thanks.","Jeff Chodakewitz","Hey it\u2019s Jeff Chodakewitz. Maybe a couple of comments. One at a big picture, I think that the adverse events profile that we have talked about tonight I hope it comes through that no matter how you look at it, whether you look at SAE\u2019s clinically, labs all those things it's a profile from both of these regimen is actually very favorable and that's great combining with the efficacy we\u2019re really excited about moving them forward. There is really nothing that particularly standout we try to give you a sense of the information.","I do want to go to your question and the comment about Bronchoconstriction that was actually something that we saw clinically in ORKAMBI and that's why I wanted to be sure we highlighted that even though we had no expectations about it. We think we don\u2019t see it in tezacaftor\/ivacaftor, we did look for it very specifically in our Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies and there was no evidence of that. So we feel very good.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from J.P. Morgan. Your question please.","Cory Kasimov","Hey good afternoon guys and thanks for taking my questions. I guess I would want to ask the question regarding potential duration of the Phase 3 studies another way, I'm curious if it\u2019s possible if there could be different durations from the standpoint of the tez\/iva safety data, you've already amassed relative to Tez 561. So might the first one be shorter from that standpoint? And then my second question I apologize if I missed there already on today\u2019s call but how should we be thinking about the company\u2019s tax rate in 2018 and beyond given the tax reform, thanks.","Jeff Leiden","No with respect to your first question Cory, in terms of tez\/iva and how does that influence the duration here. The clean finding that we have seen with tez\/iva are certainly major deriskers of the safety profile of the triple but as in any combination when you add a new agent, the key is what about the new agent that what drives the length and size of the safety database. And that won't be affected by the fact that tez\/iva turns out to be very good -- of a very favorable safety and tolerability profile. So the discussion is really about we have a new combination with a completely new agent basically two of them 659 and 445 what's the appropriate safety database timing and duration to look at that new combination.","Tom Graney","And Cory on the taxes kind of just walk you through this. First of all I remind you that we do have operating losses within the U.S. so as we create profits right now those operating losses offset those profits. So we have minimal tax liability, minimal cash tax liability. And at this point we are not recording an effective tax liability either.","As we work through those NOLs and we get and the accounting allows for, we will stop reporting in tax and pay taxes. And we had set up our tax structure within the company that matches our global operations and that actually results in having a tax rate that would be in the low 20s once we start to pay. And so we have been benefited like many other companies that have a U.S. presence with the tax reform and the lowering of the domestic tax rate but that benefit is smaller because we also accumulate profits outside of the U.S. as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney from Robert Baird. Your question please.","Brian Skorney","Hey good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just based on your commentary around plans to start pivotal programs for 440 and 152 should we take I don\u2019t understand that you have now completed chronic talks at this point and is there anything to speak of there and can you comment on what species and duration you have seen and what, if any, end organ talks there is?","Jeff Leiden","Brian could we just clarify the question, you asked about 440 and 152, could you --","Brian Skorney","Sorry, sorry.","Jeff Leiden","So could you just reask the question again?","Brian Skorney","Yes, yes sorry, so on the two new ones, I was wondering your chronic talks is it now complete, is there anything in terms of what you\u2019ve seen in pre-clinic studies how long have you gone out and what end organ parts are you seeing for those two outlets?","Jeff Leiden","So the chronic talk is complete for 659 and was nothing there that in anyway affected our plants take it forward to Phase 3. The chronic talks for 445 is not yet complete but it will be very shortly.","Brian Skorney","And then just also want to confirm on the go-forward strategy of combining 659 with ORKAMBI. This is a risk mitigation strategy for 561 right. There is no concern about it acuity or you looking at as acuity drug on top of tez\/iva in Phase 3?","Jeff Leiden","Yes correct. So this is all about KALYDECO being twice a day both 659 and 445 have clear once a day PK profile.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Citigroup. Your question please.","Robyn Karnauskas","Hi guys, thanks for taking my question and congratulations with I don\u2019t know why whenever we have great data, I'm working from home and my children with candy and consider to take on this call unlike last time. So I just want to ask --","Jeff Leiden","So do you have any questions, we are happy to take those two Robyn no problem?","Robyn Karnauskas","They are really expanding right now, they're lost to deposits.","Jeff Leiden","You shouldn't have said that on a public call.","Robyn Karnauskas","I shouldn't have said that on a public call. So I want to ask -- a big picture question for you. So even waiting for the state, I'm sure for like a long time and this is clearly remarkable, so exciting. When you think about your company big picture now knowing this data, knowing likely that Phase 3 could replicate this, you have two goals. How do you run the company differently does it change your -- you just gave the guidance M&A $1 million to go out and size up the deal? And secondly how you start planning for converting results? Do you -- everyone is going to go on this sort of eventually, what you do now to make that conversion fast once the sales are done?","Jeff Leiden","Yes, great questions, good questions that we ask ourselves and we are working on for a little while now certainly as we see this data, they become quite relevant as you point out. I will sort of I will give you my impression and how I think about it rather than I hope my management team agrees.","First of all we need to finish this journey in CF and as you point out that is largely an execution task where we need to move as quickly as possible to get these Phase 3 up and running fully enrolled, get the data out there, and when we finish this journey for 90% of CF patients. And that's a very responsibility; we take very seriously for this community.","As I said, we continue to work on even better next-gen connectors, at some point we need to make a decision about whether when to take those into clinics it's a good carrier like effects for everybody. And as we said before there is still 10% of patients with CF who won\u2019t be amendable do a CFTR modulatory therapies because they have minimal soft comedones they don\u2019t have any protein and those patients are going to need generic approach and we are working on that as well although we feel that that is considerably further out.","So the first mission was finished the journey in CF, see if we can get some generic therapies for 10% of patients and really just change the course of this disease or prevent this disease.","The second part of the journey is what's beyond CF. Can we do this again? And as I said at JPMorgan, I sometimes get after the question well why do you think you can do this in another disease you're sort of CF company and sort of why we start to invest in other diseases and my answer is we have already done perform many times in this company, so starting with HIV or an HCV, oncology, fluid you may seen some of the news about the fluid compound in the release today, it\u2019s obviously now with CF multiple times. So this is a company that has a very special innovation engine and can create -- can create these kinds of breakthrough drugs and although we haven\u2019t talked about it as you know we have been working on that in four or five diseases including sickle cells and AAT and [indiscernible] or more ones, some others that we\u2019ve been talking, starting to talk about, those are moving on very nicely.","So we want to use some of the revenue we have here to reinvest in our internal search programs. And then also we want to use this because as you plan out we will have a lot of financial firepower to supplement our innovation through external BD kinds of programs of many flavors. You've seen us do CRISPR; you've seen us do Moderna. You will see more of those deals and you could see some bigger ones but still focused around the same strategy, making transformative drugs for serious diseases of specialty markets, expanding our therapeutic modality capabilities and to things like gene editing and gene therapy and other kinds of modalities and supplementing our early stage pipeline. And so that's really the plan in many ways the strategy has gotten simpler, it's gotten to be more execution, we are really pleased with the way the team executes and is why we feel so confident about the future of the company.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Walsh from Stifel. Your question please.","Neil Carnahan","Hey guys, this is Neil on for Adam. Just wondering about what kind of preparations you guys are doing to ensure a successful launch of tez\/iva and then if you guys can just talk for a minute about how you expect to launch curve to play out and what you expect as far as uptake?","Stuart Arbuckle","Yes thanks Neil. Yes the commercial team I would say here has got pretty good at launching products. We have had the benefit of, as Jeff just described that incredibly productive research and development engine here, which is in CF has generated new products, new indications, new age groups, time and time again. So the team is I would say a pretty much well-oiled machine when it comes to executing these launches so they're ready to go, the teams are trained, we have scaled up here in the U.S. in our case management group because one of the most important things we can do in ensured patients are onboarded effectively that group has been trained and expanded to account for the additional patients who are anticipating seeing. So we are as ready as we can be and we\u2019re eagerly anticipating the approval in the near future.","In terms of the launch trajectory really difficult to say exactly how that\u2019s going to play out, it's going to depend on the -- obviously the timing of the approval, it's going to depend on us being able to secure access and reimbursement which I\u2019m confident we will do here in the U.S. we have done for KALYDECO and ORKAMBI and then we will have to see how some of those launch dynamics play out in the real world in terms of persistence and compliance certainly everything about KALYDECO and ORKAMBI would tell us we should expect to see great uptick, great for systems and great compliance and that's what we are anticipating.","Neil Carnahan","All right. And then I just had one other one for Tez\/Iva and the EU how do you think the agreement is going to work out with those countries, they already have agreements on ORKAMBI, how should we think about that?","Stuart Arbuckle","Well I think that really goes to the kind of the different process or the different countries, it's hard to give you one answer for kind of Europe as a whole in countries where we have an individual pricing reimbursement agreement around ORKAMBI. There is really going to be two parts either kind of the stand into the sequential approach where you apply products by product and obviously we are preparing to do that in line with getting our regulatory approval for tez\/iva in the second half of this year which is what we're planning for in the EU.","In some markets for instance like an Ireland where we have a portfolio agreement there we are anticipating in line with that agreement that we will get access for those patients at the time we get the regulatory approval for tez\/iva. And that to me is one of the great benefits for patients and physicians of these portfolio agreements. And I think as I mentioned earlier an answer to somebody else\u2019s question I think that tez\/iva data and now the triple combination data is only going to further interest in these kind of portfolio agreements.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould from UBS. Your question please.","Carter Gould","Good afternoon guys. Congrats on the data. Thanks for taking the question. First on the pivotal triple combo studies can you maybe just talk about your level of comfort that U.S. and e-regulators will be aligned on the safety duration you need to see? And then just on the internal non-CF pipeline beyond the VX150 data, and acute pain, are there any internal clinical data we should expect come out over the course of 2018. Thank you.","Jeff Leiden","Carter, this is Jeff Leiden. So we\u2019re talking with both European regulators and U.S. regulators about all the same issues that we discussed in the call. And of course our goal is to aligns those studies as much possible between those when we get agreement with both of them let you know exactly how they'll look.","And with respect to the non-CF pipeline as you know, we\u2019ve said that we expect to start Phase 1 studies in Sickle cell and beta thal program this year those regimen patients. We expect one or more other programs from our Internal Research Group to also enter the clinic this year. It's a little early to predict exactly when we will start to see the first clinical data.","Carter Gould","Thank you.","Jeff Leiden","Operator, we've got time for one more question.","Operator","Certainly. And our final question then comes from the line of Navin Jacob from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.","Navin Jacob","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Navin Jacob, Deutsche Bank. May be two quick questions here if I may. The first is which does of 659 and 445 are you taking into Phase 3 and then I have a follow-up commercial question.","Jeff Leiden","Yes, we haven\u2019t yet finalized the doses that\u2019s the one of the things that we're discussing with regulators. One of the reasons that we did the studies the way we did and that we're actually very pleased with the results. We do feel we have a very dosing exposure response that occurs for both of these compounds that will make it easier for us to pick the best dose.","Navin Jacob","And then very quickly on commercial if I may, my apologies but how do you think about the value that you\u2019re going to be generating here for het\/min patients, often times people think that as you expand populations in orphan disease you have to cut price but yet at the same time Vertex has spent significant amount of capital investing in brand new drugs for these severe diseases. And so I guess the question is that how should we be thinking about the economic value that you\u2019re providing especially given the actual efficacy that you\u2019re showing here. Should our base case assumption be flat pricing versus KALYDECO or even a discount or is there do you actually see the value that you\u2019re providing here to patients?","Stuart Arbuckle","Well, having just released the Phase 2 data announced that we're moving forward into clinical development, we're not about start speculating until specifically about pricing. Obviously the data we release today demonstrate that we think these triple combinations have the opportunity to provide tremendous value certainly for patients in the first instance based on the efficacy and safety profile that we've shown.","In terms of the economic value for them, clearly that's something that\u2019s going to be considered way down the line we\u2019ll taken into account the same considerations that I've said we always have which is the magnitude of the benefit that we\u2019re providing and the number of patients that we are able to benefit and those are the two considerations that we will continue to take in consideration as we move forward. The most important thing is with the data we released today it gives us a clear path to begin with provide CFTR modulators throughout the 90% of patients and that\u2019s our primary goal.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s program. I\u2019d like to hand the program back to Michael Partridge for any further remarks.","Michael Partridge","Thanks. I'll actually turn it over back to Jeff Leiden.","Jeff Leiden","Yes, thanks Michael. Nick may be just two remarks one an internal remark and one an external remark and I'll start with the external one.","I do want to come back and just remind you that in CF we have been working with this community of patients and caregivers and the foundation for almost 20 years now. It's been an incredible journey. And to me this is a special day because it\u2019s one more important step forward towards finishing that journey which we are absolutely committed to and I just want to thank again all the people, parents and families and caregivers and Vertex employees who stuck with us for 20 years to get to where we are today. It's a very special thing, and you don't see that often in one disease.","And then from an internal standpoint may be just echo what I said before. I do think and I'm pleased with the fact that we\u2019re seeing the strategy really play out nicely here. Meaning the investment in scientific innovation leading to further understanding disease, leading to breakthrough products that get better and better and then being able to reinvest revenues that we make those breakthrough products into more medicines in different diseases and that\u2019s a model that all of us had as a dream six, seven years ago when we started the strategy. I was certainly done with that but I think you can see the progress and we are very pleased because we think it bodes very well for the future in other disease.","Michael Partridge","Thank you, Jeff. This concludes tonight\u2019s call. I'd like to thank everybody for joining us and for your question. The Investor Relations team is in the office tonight to answering the additional questions that you have. Have a good evening.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Michael Partridge, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Michael Partridge","Thank you, operator, and good evening to everyone. Joining me on tonight's call are Dr. Jeff Leiden, Vertex's Chairman and CEO; Stuart Arbuckle, Chief Commercial Officer; and Ian Smith, Chief Financial Officer. Jeff will begin with a review of our progress this year in executing against our long-term strategy of creating innovative medicines with a focus on specialty diseases. Then, Stuart will comment on market trends for our key medicines, KALYDECO for people with cystic fibrosis, who have the G551D mutation and INCIVEK for hepatitis C. And to close, we will review the first quarter financial results and update our 2013 guidance for KALYDECO net revenues. After prepared remarks, Bob Kauffman, Chief Medical officer; and Peter Mueller, Chief Scientific Officer, will join us for a question-and-answer period. And after the call, we will be available in our offices for follow-up.","Before we begin, I will note that information discussed on this conference call includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in our 10-K reports, which have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and also in the press release announcing our financial results tonight.","These statements, including, without limitation, those regarding the commercial performance of INCIVEK and KALYDECO, our development plans and expectations and our guidance are based on management's current assumptions and are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and events to differ materially.","GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this call. The information regarding our use of these measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is available in our first quarter 2013 financial press release, which is on our website. And I would also refer you to the information on Slide 4 of tonight's webcast.","I'll now turn it over to Jeff.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Thanks, Michael. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to discuss with you the progress that Vertex has made in 2013. Earlier this year, we identified key priorities that will enable you to measure the progress of our business. In January, at the JPMorgan conference, I outlined 3 strategic imperatives for our business that would position us for long-term growth: first, prioritizing our development investments to advance our late-stage medicines. We have important late-stage medicines in development for cystic fibrosis, hepatitis C and autoimmune diseases, and our goal is to provide these therapies to patients, their families and healthcare providers as soon as possible. Second, focus on continuing to create innovative medicines for serious diseases out of our R&D efforts. Making ground-breaking new medicines is the reason Vertex was founded. It continues to define who we are today. And third, maintaining our financial strength. We recognize that we're in an important period of investment to realize sustained growth opportunities in the near future and the funding of this investment while maintaining our balance sheet's strength is an important priority.","So far in 2013, we have accomplished a great deal to advance our late-stage medicines and show the potential to bring further ground-breaking therapies to patients. We also continue to maintain our financial strength with a good financial performance for the first quarter.","In cystic fibrosis, we received breakthrough designation from the U.S. FDA for ivacaftor as monotherapy. We have multiple studies underway that could potentially expand the KALYDECO label. We are on track to have the first clinical data for ivacaftor monotherapy outside of G551D in the second half of 2013.","We also received breakthrough designation for the combination of ivacaftor with our lead corrector molecule, VX-809. With the VX-809 plus ivacaftor combination, we reached agreement with the regulatory authorities and have now begun a Phase III program that will evaluate 6 months of treatment in 1,000 patients homozygous for the Delta 508 mutation. We anticipate that we will receive Phase III data and submit an NDA for this combination in 2014.","We also reported Phase II data earlier this month with another corrector, VX-661, that has further validated the strategy of combining a corrector and a potentiator to treat CF patients with 2 copies of the Delta 508 mutation. Also, we announced that we continue to advance an additional corrector, VX-983, and we expect to start a combination study with this compound in people with 2 copies of the Delta 508 mutation in the second half of this year.","In hepatitis C, we have initiated 2 12-week studies with an interferon-free all-oral regimen of our nucleotide, VX-135, in combination with ribavirin, and 1 of these studies is now fully enrolled. Our strategy is to conduct multiple Phase II studies of VX-135 in multiple combinations with other DAAs in Phase II to position us to initiate pivotal development of VX-135 in 2014.","This quarter, we are starting our first Phase II study in HCV patients combining VX-135 with another DAA, Bristol-Myers Squibb's NS5A inhibitor, daclatasvir.","Financially, we are making significant investments, which we believe are important to position us for sustained future growth. These investments are focused in R&D for the creation of meaningful new medicines. As part of the strategy we outlined in January, we described how we would control our operating expense and reduce our SG&A investment compared to prior years and thereby, direct our investments towards our pipeline and research efforts. These actions are reflected in our Q1 results, which Ian will cover in more detail.","To maintain financial strength, we are also seeking to maximize revenues of our approved medicines. Stuart will provide some color on this in a moment, but I will say that I'm pleased with our performance this quarter, which shows our important position in hepatitis C and also demonstrates the value of KALYDECO for certain people with CF.","In summary, our strategy has created hope for people with serious diseases and has created significant value for shareholders and a platform for long-term growth.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Stuart.","Stuart A. Arbuckle","Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon. I will provide some background and commentary on our approved medicines, INCIVEK for genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C infection and KALYDECO for CF patients who have the G551D mutation.","Starting with INCIVEK. We launched INCIVEK for hepatitis C in May 2011, and now just 2 years later, we have treated more than 60,000 patients in the United States. While fewer patients are starting treatment for hepatitis C compared to this time a year ago, the hepatitis C market remains substantial, and INCIVEK continues to be the market leader with approximately 75% of new patients in the U.S., a number that is unchanged since launch.","Vertex recorded $206 million in net revenues for INCIVEK in the first quarter. We expect INCIVEK to remain the market-leading therapy throughout 2013. However, the number of hepatitis C patients starting treatment in the U.S. has been in decline since the second quarter of last year, and this trend is likely to continue in the U.S.","Outside of the U.S., Janssen markets telaprevir as INCIVO, and Vertex receives a royalty. INCIVO availability has continued to expand to additional countries, and based on Janssen sales in the first quarter of 2013, Vertex earned $39 million in royalties. Janssen has attributed the strong performance of INCIVO in the first quarter to a continued successful rollout of INCIVO in Latin America.","Moving now to KALYDECO. We launched KALYDECO in the U.S. in early 2012 for cystic fibrosis patients with the G551D mutation, aged 6 and older, and we saw rapid adoption amongst U.S. patients. By the end of 2012, we were treating the vast majority of the eligible G551D patients in the U.S. For the first quarter of 2013, we achieved U.S. sales of KALYDECO of approximately $50 million, in line with our U.S. sales in the fourth quarter of 2012.","In the European Union, KALYDECO was approved in July 2012, and since then, our key objective has been to complete the reimbursement process in the major markets so that we can make KALYDECO available to the patients who need it.","We forecasted growth for KALYDECO in 2013, which reflected our expectation regarding the timing of achieving reimbursement and the speed of uptake in the region. We achieved approximately $12 million in KALYDECO sales outside of the U.S. in the first quarter, which represents reasonable growth over Q4 2012. However, we expect this to accelerate in Q2 2013 given the progress we have made in achieving reimbursement approval in the major European countries.","Specifically in these major markets, KALYDECO began to be available during Q1 with commercial reimbursements starting in Q2. The uptake in these markets has been strong, which reinforces our confidence in the growth we can achieve for KALYDECO revenues in 2013.","In summary, I'm pleased with INCIVEK's performance within the hep C market and in the ongoing launch of KALYDECO. And now I'll turn it over to Ian.","Ian F. Smith","Thanks, Stuart. I'll start by reaffirming our business and financial strategy. That is, we're investing in the advancements of important medicines that, if successful, will drive sustained long-term business and financial growth. From a financial perspective, our goal during this period is to maintain financial strength. Stated simply, protect our balance sheet by prioritizing our spend towards R&D and balancing our expenses with revenues.","Now to the first quarter 2013 results. Total revenues were $328 million. Our total non-GAAP operating expenses, excluding cost of revenues and other charges, were $275 million, and we had a non-GAAP profit of $5.7 million.","From a balance sheet perspective, we completed the quarter with approximately $1.24 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and $400 million of 200 -- 2015 convertible debt outstanding. This debt has early conversion features based on certain stock prices.  These results are consistent with our strategy of maintaining our financial strength while progressing our medicines in development.","Now to the more detailed results. In the first quarter, KALYDECO revenues were approximately $62 million, approximately $50 million in the U.S. and $12 million outside the U.S. Uptake in early 2013 has been strong in key countries outside the U.S., and this uptake provides us with the visibility into total KALYDECO revenues for the remainder of 2013. For this reason, we are increasing KALYDECO revenue guidance today.","INCIVEK revenues in the first quarter were $206 million, reflecting continued demand for hepatitis C treatment even as the market anticipates the arrival of other regimens beginning in 2014. INCIVO royalties were $39 million, and combined with the INCIVEK revenues, we continue to anticipate significant HCV revenue contributions to our top line in 2013. Finally, collaborative and other revenues in the first quarter were $22 million, bringing total 2013 quarter revenues to $328 million.","Now to the non-GAAP operating expenses of $275 million, which excludes cost of revenues and other charges. This is similar to prior year. Within our first quarter 2013 non-GAAP operating expenses, there has been a significant decrease in SG&A comparison to our fourth quarter 2012 and also comparison to the first quarter of 2012, while we continue to prioritize our investment into R&D. In particular, our late-stage development investments into our programs for CF, HCV and autoimmune disease programs increased our R&D investment compared to prior year.","Before I move to our 2013 financial guidance, I'd like to provide a comment on our GAAP net loss of $308 million. This includes a charge of $412,900,000 for the impairment of our HCV asset, VX-222. At this stage of development of our portfolio of HCV assets and given the progression of other regimens by other companies, we are able -- we are unable to support the fair value of VX-222 on our balance sheet. And accordingly, we are taking a write-down in the value of this intangible asset. We also record a tax benefit for VX-222 of $127.6 million, results in a net charge of $285 million.","Now to the 2013 financial guidance. Today, we are reiterating our total revenue guidance of $1.1 billion to $1.25 billion that we provided in February 2013, while we are increasing the KALYDECO components of revenues to $300 million to $340 million from $280 million to $320 million we gave previously. Today, we are also reiterating our non-GAAP operating expense of $1.09 billion to $1.15 billion.","In summary, financially, we're executing on our strategy and prioritizing investment within our business to drive long-term growth.","I would now like to open up the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Geoffrey Porges of Bernstein.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So my first question is just -- is this SG&A run rate sustainable at this level after you pulled back on HCV? And -- but if you're successful with expanding in CF, would you anticipate that going back up to the prior level? Or is this the sort of thing that we should be forecasting going forward? And then I just wanted to get someone's perspective on what was presented over the weekend at Amsterdam. I know there wasn't a formal investor event, but has this changed how you look to partnering VX-135? And I'm thinking particularly about some of the issues that have come out, for example, with simeprevir and the preexisting resistant mutation. Do you think that you should be looking elsewhere for further combination studies as a result of that?","Ian F. Smith","So Geoff, we'll take the HCV and EASL question strategy first and Jeff will take that.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Now Geoff, let me take the strategy question, and then I'll turn it over to Bob for the more detailed scientific question around resistance mutants. I think you know our strategy all along has been to combine VX-135 with multiple other DAAs and actually collect the data in Phase II that we think will allow us to pick the best regime or regimens to take forward into pivotal development next year. And I think the results we saw at EASL really only reaffirmed our confidence in that strategy. So as we discussed today, we have multiple partnerships in which we can look at 135 with ribavirin and at least 3 other DAAs, and it's our plan to continue that strategy going forward. I think at the end of the day, the data will really speak to this, but I think the picture's becoming pretty clear that a nuke will be the backbone of most of these straightforward DAA regimens, and we think VX-135 is competitive with any nuke out there. So let me turn this over to Bob for your specific question.","Robert Kauffman","This is Bob. So just with specific reference to the Q80 baseline variant, we are aware of those data. In the 2 studies, the 2 Phase III studies they reported, there appear to be some decrement in SVR in the patients with those variants at baseline. It wasn't dramatic, but probably, there was some decline. On the other hand, in combination with the nuke, it may well not really be a clinical issue, and obviously, that's something we'll evaluate in the initial studies. But it certainly doesn't change our strategy of working with simeprevir as part of our combination regimens.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And Ian, on the SG&A?","Ian F. Smith","Yes, Geoff, thanks for that. I'll just kind of bring it to the broader picture. Back in February, we did give OpEx guidance, total non-GAAP OpEx guidance of $1.09 billion to $1.15 billion. We are reiterating that today. The number that you point to though, the SG&A expenses, where we're approximately $80 million for Q1, I can see what you're doing. You're taking that and multiplying it by 4, and saying that may be just under the guidance we gave of $340 million to $360 million. We're still reiterating the $340 million to $360 million. I mean, we still are launching a -- what we believe is an important drug and still expanding into Europe. And so there are marketing expenses that go along with that. So we're reiterating the components of our guidance today as well, and that SG&A component, we see $340 million to $360 million.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham of JPMorgan.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I got a CF one and then an RA one. Want to get a sense from you, the KALYDECO monotherapy trials, the R117H and the G551D in younger patients. This has been ongoing for a while. So is it that the entry criteria are narrow? Or is it the matter of just finding patients? I would have thought that these would have enrolled fairly quickly given the visibility and the clinical effects in the STRIVE study.","Robert Kauffman","So this is Bob. So for the non-G551D gating, that study is fully enrolled, so that one is well underway. The R117H study is still enrolling, although it's well along in its progress. And that, I think, is just a combination of -- it is still a pretty uncommon mutation, and so finding patients who meet the entry criteria is -- it just takes time, but I think we're making good progress there, and we expect enrollment to be finished some time soon.","Ian F. Smith","And Geoff, I'll just add, there is the other study that's in the other gating mutations, which has completed enrollment, and we anticipate seeing the first data from that in the second half of this year.","Peter R. Mueller","And in terms of the kits [ph] that you are referring to, I think you have to go through a global process that has the kit [ph] process in there in Europe, which is quite a lengthy process, which now is finalized, and now we are ready to go.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got you. Okay. And just a follow-up on a -- or second question, on VX-509. I know you guys have talked about partnering this out and maybe to get Jeff's perspective given his background, is there a data set or an efficacy sort of benchmark that you would reconsider that from a development perspective to take it on your own? Or is that going to be 100% partnering or both?","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Geoff, thanks for asking the question. I think as we've looked at what it takes to develop this asset in multiple indications and multiple geographies, which I think is what's going to be needed to be competitive, that's really a process that we feel comfortable with only in a partnership. And so that really is our plan going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Yee of RBC Capital.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","On -- a question on hep C. Obviously, you're going to get presumably some Bristol-Vertex combination data sooner than the others, and obviously, I think we can all see what a nuke and a NS5A has done out there with other collaborations. So time is of the essence, and the other studies may take longer. I mean, if the data looks really good, why would we wait? Maybe you could walk through some of the strategy and timing of that as you think about that, end of this year going to '14? And then second question is just on the CF 809 Phase III studies. Would you expect this to enroll faster than the KALYDECO studies given there are definitely a lot more patients out there than G551?","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Michael, this is Jeff. Let me take your first question, and then maybe I'll turn it over to Bob for your question on the CF enrollment. With respect to the timing of these different studies on VX-135, just to be clear, we're not necessarily going to wait. We agree with you that speed is of the essence here, and we hope to begin collecting data, actually, as soon as the third quarter of this year with some combinations, like the ribavirin study and then subsequently with the others. And as you say, if we saw a combination that was clearly a winning combination or an ultra-competitive combination, we wouldn't wait to move it forward because we agree that we want to go as quickly as possible to patients.","Robert Kauffman","And then your other question?","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Speed of the 809 enrollment versus KALYDECO, yes.","Robert Kauffman","Yes. So we haven't really given any information on how quickly we expect to enroll. I think they will be rapid, the patients are highly interested. In general, first of all, we're recruiting a lot more patients into these 2 trials than we did with the KALYDECO study, so that will be a factor. And the other is that site startup tends to be more of a limiting factor in some respects than actual patient recruitment. Once the sites are up and running, they tend to recruit very quickly, and we're obviously doing as fast as we can to get all the sites up and running, but that tends to be kind of the more rate-limiting step.","Ian F. Smith","Michael, we'll probably have a better understanding of the speed of enrollment when we're on our July quarterly conference call, and maybe we'll give some comments at that time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rachel McMinn of Merrill Lynch.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Wanted to go back to hep C. for a minute and just get a patient number. How many patients' worth of data do you think you'll have by the end of the year when you kind of add all these studies up? I think safety is kind of the big question that a lot of people have. And then also wanted to get your perspective on heterozygous, of when we could see the first studies initiated there. I don't know if that's something that you think is a next step for 661 or we'd have to wait into 2014 before you'd consider starting any of those studies. And really quick on a housekeeping question, are there any other commercial CF milestones that we should be thinking about near term? If you could give us a little bit more color on the structure of how we think about sales-based milestones, that would be helpful for modeling purposes.","Robert Kauffman","So this is Bob. I'll take the safety question. It's a little bit of a hard question to answer because obviously, these studies are ongoing, and we'll have varying lengths of safety data at any time point towards the end of the year.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Well, specifically 12 weeks then.","Robert Kauffman","Yes, we'll have 12-week data probably on the order of 40 to 50, maybe 60 patients by then.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And is that really enough to go into Phase III, then, Bob?","Robert Kauffman","Not necessarily at that point, but we will be expanding these studies and starting additional trials, so that we'll be augmenting that safety database through the end of 2013, into early 2014 in order to get enough patients to go into Phase III.","Ian F. Smith","Rachel, just on your question that you asked, you did specifically mark it to the end of the year. But the way these studies progress is we do start a smaller study and expect to expand that study in the second half of this year. So as you look, as we go into 2014 and through 2014, we continue to accumulate patient experience. That's why we've made the statement we believe we'll be in pivotal development in 2014. It's not from the initial study, and it's not marked from the patients at the end of this year, which, as we go into 2014, we will have accumulated more patients.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","And then finally, Rachel, your question on the heterozygotes -- this is Jeff. We are considering with the regulatory authorities how to approach the heterozygotes. We have a couple of different approaches. I think it's too early for us to give you specific plans, but we are formulating plans both with our current correctors, as we've said, but also with the combination with second-generation correctors. And we want to move as quickly as we can to that population of patients.","Ian F. Smith","And then to your financial question, Rachel, to the milestone payments, we did make a payment of approximately $9.5 million this quarter or the first quarter in connection with our CF revenues. There are future milestones there, but we'll disclose those as we achieve them based on certain sales levels.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum of ISI Group.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I have 2 pretty simple ones. One, the first one, would it be possible for you -- and maybe you've answered this and I just don't know, but would it be possible for you to tell us where the IP is domiciled for KALYDECO, 809 and 661 and where you'll be manufacturing those 3 drugs? Second question is, a hep C market question, do you guys -- would you happen to have the following number? The number -- roughly the number of hepatitis C patients today, if you have genotype 1, that's fine, but the number of hepatitis C patients today, who you think are under the active care of an HCV-treating specialist?","Ian F. Smith","Well, thanks, Mark, for the question. I'll take the tax question. And what I would say is, we've taken all the appropriate tax planning steps. We believe there's a lot of value in our CF franchise, and we believe that we're going to be global with the franchise. So we're taking all the appropriate tax steps at this point in time that our company should take and -- but to project out a tax rate at this point in time, I think, it's a little too early. I think as we get close to profit, then we'd be happy to start giving you some guidance towards that. But you can expect that the tax structuring for the company is that, we've taken the appropriate tax steps.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Can you tell us where you'll be making it?","Ian F. Smith","It's -- no, not at this point, and it's actually less relevant to where it's being made. The other point I'd point out just because you are asking about tax, I think it's also important to note that Vertex has approximately $3.5 billion of NOLs that do get offset against profits before you start paying cash taxes, so that will clearly benefit our cash flow in the early years of profitability. And to your other questions?","Unknown Executive","[indiscernible]","Ian F. Smith","Yes, Mark, we'll have to get back to you on that. [indiscernible] top of my head.","Operator","Our next question comes from Yaron Werber of Citi.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So I just have a kind of a few questions, a little bit all over the place, but just starting with 135, just as a follow-up to a previous question, so it will be for Bob. So Bob, it sounds like you're going to have 40 or 60 patients by the end of the year of safety. That's going to be sort of the preliminary 12 weeks of safety that you need to do with the preliminary experience with 135 with another agent. So at some point during the year, you're going to enroll that into or broaden that into an expanded sort of cohort that's going to have, probably, I would imagine, 100 or 200-plus patients. Any sense when are you going to have the 12-week safety from that? Because that's going to be really gate limiting for starting Phase III. So that's going to be the first question, and then I have a follow-up.","Robert Kauffman","So I think you can kind of add up the timing. It probably will be in the, certainly in the first half of 2014 that we'll have that information. I expect to take that to regulatory agencies to gain approval for the pivotal program.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Because one of the things that I'm trying to understand a little bit is the key to you to -- and do you think it's relevant that, I would imagine, you guys need to and want to be in Phase III before potentially AbbVie and then Gilead's going to be out there with their oral regimen because that could signify change in care. Is that something that you agree with or no?","Robert Kauffman","I agree with that, and that is our strategy.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, second question just on KALYDECO, the $12 million O-U.S., can you give us a little bit of a sense how much of that was in Scotland? And I'm trying to see. Did you get anything at all in the U.K.? And I imagine Ireland was on board. I'm trying to get a sense, that $12 million, sort of which countries were onboard already.","Stuart A. Arbuckle","Yes, so reimbursement in most of U.K. and Ireland didn't kick in right until the back end of Q1 and at the beginning of Q2, so the majority of the $12 million, the majority of the growth over Q4 was from existing markets like Germany where we're already on the market and reimbursed. We're really expecting the growth in the U.K. to come in Q2 and beyond.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And do you see any growth at all coming up sort of in the U.S. at the moment? Or do you really need to -- do we really need to wait for new mutations to really expand the market here?","Stuart A. Arbuckle","Yes, I'd agree with that. We've said a number of times, the vast majority of G551D patients over 6 in the U.S. have already been receiving treatments. So really, what's going to lead to growth in the U.S. is those new indications that we're working on with ivacaftor in monotherapy.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. And just a final question, does the CF Foundation get royalties? Just remind us on 661 and 809.","Ian F. Smith","We haven't disclosed where the royalties are actually paid, and we will at a future point later in development.","Operator","Our next question comes from Liisa Bayko of JMP Securities.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to verify what is the nature of the data you'll be presenting at the upcoming European Cystic Fibrosis Foundation -- or Cystic Fibrosis Conference? And then a quick question on your intentions for the convert.","Ian F. Smith","Great, thanks, Liisa. Well, as usual, we don't get ahead of data that would be data in presentations that would be accepted at these major medical conferences. So we will be advising you of that at a future point in time. As far as the debt is concerned, we have $400 million of 2015 convertible debt. It does have provisional call features. It has a hard call provisional call after October 2013. That's if the stock trades above $48, then we can call with that. And then it also has a soft call feature. Sometimes people aren't aware of that, but it does have a soft call feature that if the debt trades just above $63 for 20 days out of 30, then we do have the opportunity, and we'll have the intent to convert it into equity. So we're happy with maybe having that opportunity in the near future to convert the debt into equity, which is all consistent with kind of the broad financial strategy of managing the P&L, the revenues to the operating expense and then managing the cash on the balance sheet and then also managing the debt on the balance sheet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams of Wells Fargo Securities.","Brian Corey Abrahams - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","You presented a lot of preclinical tox work that you have done on 135 relative to other molecules. I'm just wondering if you can give us a sense as to maybe how comfortable the FDA is with this idea that it's the interaction with mitochondrial DNA that caused the tox for other nukes, which obviously you guys have less of with 135. And is there any other preclinical work that you might be able to do in parallel to enable yourselves to move even more quickly through the clinic? Or is the rate limiting effect here just combo PK rather than FDA?","Peter R. Mueller","So Brian, that's Peter speaking. So with respect to the Agency, we had quite intense discussion about the safety profile of 135, alone and in combination with potential other agents. And I think we, from a tox point of view, satisfied their needs. I think there's no additional tox status [ph] that we will do. And from a clinical point of view, we agreed to [indiscernible] program, which is, if successful, we'll then basically open up towards the normal enrollment as we go forward. So I think there is everything settled [ph], and I think there's no more that we have to.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas of George Bank (sic) [Deutsche Bank].","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So just one other question on hep C, so obviously, the J&J timelines have slowed, and you're saying second quarter for the Bristol study. What gets you more comfortable that you can hit those timelines with Bristol? And maybe, more specific question, what steps or interaction studies need to be taken before you start the Bristol study?","Robert Kauffman","This is Bob. Just, first of all, there are no drug interaction studies that we're required to do before we start the combination with daclatasvir. We'll just be measuring pharmacokinetics of the components in the first small cohort of patients that get started. And yes, the J&J timeline is really driven by the outcome of the drug interaction studies, which are ongoing, and once we have those data and can confirm the doses we're going to use, we'll be raring to go and ready to go into Phase II.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And as a follow-up, do you control the Bristol study? Or is that really in Bristol's hands?","Robert Kauffman","We're running the Bristol study.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Roden of UBS.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So KALYDECO in Europe and to get to the lower end of guidance, looks like you'll need to see some greater sequential gains this year than what you had in the first quarter, and presumably, that comes from expanded geographies in Europe. Can you speak to the line of sight that you have a little bit more specifically as to what regions are going to come on board in the second quarter and thereafter. That's going to enable you to get to the guidance range that you have? And then I have a follow-up on heterozygotes if I may.","Stuart A. Arbuckle","Sure, Matt, let me talk through. So in reimbursement terms, which is the key to count the accelerating growth that we're projecting, we have achieved reimbursement across the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland with the exception of Wales. The notable markets there are England, Scotland and Ireland, which have the largest preponderance of patients, so them coming on stream in addition to France and Germany where we already have reimbursement in place, that's what leads us to believe that we can be more sure of the revenue expectations in 2013. That reimbursement backed up by the reaction we've seen from CF patients and CF centers and the initial uptake we've seen since reimbursement kicked in, that's what gives us more confidence in the guidance that we are updating today.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Very helpful. And then on the heterozygotes, so we've seen that with VX-809 that the heterozygotes data weren't sufficient for moving forward as you guys talked about. When you think about 983 and 661, presumably, you guys know more about these molecules than we do. Is there anything about those 2 molecules that give you any confidence or any inkling that they may be more successful than 809 in the heterozygotes when combined singly with KALYDECO? And then a sort of follow-on to that is, do you -- ultimately, do you think you're going to need to have a triple combo, that is 2 correctors and KALYDECO, to get the results that you need in the heterozygous population?","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Yes, great questions. And so I think as we've said before, we believe, from what we know today and it's still based on a fairly small amount of data that the heterozygotes are going to be more difficult to treat than the homozygotes. Both of them are cell studies, and what we've seen, as you point out, with 809 in the clinic. We may do some more work with the single correctors, first-generation correctors like 661 and 983 that do have different pharmacokinetic and tissue penetration properties. But I do -- if you ask me to handicap it today, I think the ultimate solution to the heterozygotes will really come from the combination of a first- and the second-generation corrector with KALYDECO. And it's one of the reasons why we're trying to move those second-generation correctors forward as quickly as we possibly can.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ying Huang of Barclays.","Ying Huang - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I have one on hep C. That is assuming that everything else being equal, would you rather have an acquisition of a company where you do have API or [indiscernible] where you can have everything in the combo under one umbrella? You can get 100% economics given your stock has appreciated a lot lately. And secondly on CF, we know that you're pushing already 3 compounds in the clinics for CFTR correctors. What's your view of the competition? And we know that Novartis has one CFTR drug [ph] in Phase I as well. What's your strategy there? Can you elaborate a little bit?","Ian F. Smith","I'll take the M&A question in the U.S., and Jeff will talk about the CF strategy. I mean, first of all, M&A and licensing and other things, they're tactics to the endgame. Clearly, if you're in a position where you can control the regimen, it's easier in terms of moving through development and also control of the commercialization of that regimen. However, I'd say, at this point in time, as we progress forward, you're seeing us execute on the strategy that we think we're looking to create the best regimen of what 135 is in the middle of, and we continue to execute around that and give ourselves multiple chances. And at this point, we're just going to continue along that strategy.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","And then with respect to the CF strategy and the competition, we're in a very fortunate position here that our scientists started working on this problem, 14, 15 years ago now and clearly, established a leadership position in the science, which is reflected in the portfolio of drugs we have. On the other hand, we fully expect there will be competition. That's the way this industry always works when someone sees the successes, and we anticipate that. Our strategy is to move as quickly as we can with our portfolio, get those to as many patients as possible to benefit them. And we think in the long run, that's best for patients and best for Vertex.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Liang of Leerink Swann.","Howard Liang - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","I have a couple of questions on VX-135. One specific question on the 40 to 60 patients by the end of year, just in terms of makeup of that, would that be 20 patients each from each of the ribavirin combination studies and 20 from the daclatasvir study?","Robert Kauffman","Yes, that's approximately right.","Howard Liang - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. I guess a quick follow-up on that is, where is the GSK combo study? Have are seeing [ph] that?","Robert Kauffman","So our strategy, obviously, is to have a number of collaborations, and we're moving forward with that. We've started a number of studies so far this year, and we've had the opportunity to start the daclatasvir study more rapidly based on BMS. However, we're now evaluating the initiation of remaining studies, and we'll be getting back to you with the timeline of that as they go forward.","Howard Liang - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And a broader question is, when you make a decision next year about how to move forward, what regimen to move forward to Phase III, what profile of the combination are you shooting for is pan-genotypic coverage, specifically genotype 3 coverage important?","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Yes, it's a great question. I think we've said all along, Howard, that we believe, today, anyway, from what we've learned that we're going to need a highly efficacious regimen, which, for us means, SVR's greater than 80% certainly in genotype 1 naives. We're going to need a short duration of therapy, which we believe is 12 weeks or less, and we're going to need a very highly tolerable therapy. In addition, there are some other potential differentiating points, and they really have to do with Pan genotypic, as you point out, and they have to do with some of the sicker patient populations. And our strategy is to investigate our regimens, first, for the sort of basics, if you will, and then see if we can develop differentiated regimens around some of those other properties and get them out there quickly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Nadeau of Cowen and Company.",".","Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just 3 quick ones. First on -- a follow-up to Howard's. We've seen a couple of doublets in HCV genotype 1 already, and they haven't produced SVR rates of greater than 80%. Are you seeing something pre-clinically that suggests the VX-135 doublet could hit those -- that SVR level? Or are these largely done to increase the safety database? And second, for Ian, could you just let us know what you assume in your guidance is the timing for the launch of sofosbuvir? Does your guidance anticipate competition from sofosbuvir in the fourth quarter this year? And then third, Jeff, for you, you mentioned moving the second-generation correctors along as quickly as possible. Could you give us some updated idea when those could get into the clinic?","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Yes. That's a lot of questions. You may have to remind me of a couple of them as we go, but let me answer on the first one. So first, just to be -- I want to be clear that when you're talking about doublets, you're talking about a nuke plus ribavirin. Is that right?","Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes, that's right.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Yes, so yes, we think that a nuke -- the reason that we're really pursuing a nuke plus ribavirin first is to understand the safety profile and the potency of our nuke alone before we combine it with other DAAs. But our belief is, for the majority of patients, one will need 2 DAAs, and certainly, you can see that reflected in our strategy. So I think that's probably the answer to your first question. Now, you want to just repeat the rest of the other 3 questions so I can remember.","Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes, so the second one was for you also, and that's an update on when the second-generation correctors could get into the clinic. And then the third was for Ian, and that is what is -- what timing of sofosbuvir approval is assumed in the guidance that you reiterated [ph] today.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Yes. With respect to the second-generation correctors, what we said is our goal is to get one of them or more than one of them into the clinic by the end of next year. That's 2014.","Ian F. Smith","And Phil, to the guidance, I'll just say again, we provided total revenue guidance. The only line item guidance we provided in revenues was to KALYDECO. We have accounted for what we see as the potential decline for patients initiating treatment. I actually mentioned that in my prepared remarks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Katherine Xu of William Blair.","Y. Katherine Xu - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I have a couple of questions. So when you start the VX-135 and daclatasvir combo study, are you still going to be required to monitor the cardiac, EKG, ECG and other markers? So just curious about that. And then, are there -- is there a cap of sales in U.K. and [indiscernible] Ireland, Scotland and Wales, et cetera, for orphan drugs? Is there a cap on accumulated sales? Just those 2 for now.","Ian F. Smith","So Bob will take the first question. Stuart will follow up, Katherine.","Robert Kauffman","So hopefully, the answer is that's something we'll be discussing with the regulatory agencies once we have the initial data going forward. Our hope is that we will have made a substantial clearance of safety with those initial groups of patients, but obviously, the outcome will depend on our discussion with the regulators. So it's kind of hard to really answer that one definitively at this point.","Stuart A. Arbuckle","And on the, is there a financial cap for orphan drugs in the U.K., there isn't a financial cap in those countries. The real cap is the number of eligible patients with G551D that we can bring benefit to. The only country that kind of has a cap really is Scotland, in that KALYDECO is covered in Scotland under a rare disease fund. That rare disease fund was put in place earlier this year. There's about, I think, GBP 21 million in that rare disease fund. That's certainly more than enough to cover KALYDECO for all the eligible patients in Scotland. So I think the short answer to your question, Katherine, is no.","Y. Katherine Xu - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. If I may, just a quick follow-up. On pricing, when we look at our models for the combos, the double combos for homozygotes and potentially, the triple combo for heterozygous. How do we -- how shall we think about pricing? I mean, do we look at the similar pricing of KALYDECO right now? Or should we think...","Stuart A. Arbuckle","Well, I'm not going to tell you how you should look at pricing, but what I will tell you is it's far too early for us to be talking about pricing when we really only just begun the Phase III program for 809. And it's really much too early in the process to be making any comments on price from our end.","Operator","Our final question comes from Salveen Richter of Canaccord Genuity.","Salveen J. Richter - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","On the 661 program, I think you have additional studies reading out in the second half. Can you maybe comment on what these studies are and whether we should expect 93 data in the second half as well? And then on KALYDECO and I could be wrong here, but I think you took a price increase in January where you're looking at the last 3 quarters being flat. So just wondering what was playing out in Q1. Were there dropouts or so forth?","Ian F. Smith","So maybe I'll take the disclosure of data in the second half of the year. We don't anticipate any significant data disclosures regarding VX-661 in the second half of the year. Although, we did mention on our call the other week that we do need to take the data we received from the current or the most recent Phase II study and other studies and have a discussion with the regulatory authorities. That will, then, put us in a position to communicate to you the next steps for VX-661. But try and think about other data regarding CF in the second half of the year, it would probably be at the medical conference and specifically, the U.S.-based medical conference for cystic fibrosis. And as I said earlier on the call, we don't preannounce what we'll be disclosing at that meeting. And your second question, I'm sorry?","Stuart A. Arbuckle","It was on price, Ian, I think, let me take that one. We did take a price increase in the U.S. within the quarter, that's correct. From quarter to quarter, there's really multiple factors that can affect our revenue. There's lots of kind of puts and takes that were within one particular quarter. Let me just, though, address one thing that I think you were alluding to. Was there a dropoff or increased dropoff of patients? That didn't happen. Our persistence and compliance rates are very high with KALYDECO and have been very stable over time. What we're really focused on is the annual revenues for KALYDECO. We feel very good about the revised guidance that we provided today.","Ian F. Smith","And Salveen, I was just checking my notes. You mentioned what we will be doing for VX-983 in the second half of the year, and just a couple of weeks ago, when we had our call, we also talked about entering a combination study in patients with VX-983 and ivacaftor. So that would be in the second half as well. Whether we receive data from that, unsure at this point in time, that study has not started yet.","Michael Partridge","So Salveen, thanks very much for that, and on behalf of the Vertex team, thanks very much for joining us tonight. If you have additional questions, we will be in the office, and we will be happy to take your call. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference for today.

And that is that Vertex is well-positioned to be a global business, to help many more patients with serious diseases and to continue to generate significant cash flows.","In less than a year, Vertex received approvals and launched two breakthrough medicines in different life-threatening diseases: INCIVEK for the treatment of hepatitis C and KALYDECO for the treatment of cystic fibrosis.","Looking ahead, we have a pipeline of eight other potential medicines and expect to generate proof of concept data for many of these programs throughout 2012. This is a very exciting and deep pipeline that gives us the opportunity to launch additional new medicines over the next few years that could deliver significant benefits to patients and their families, and significant value to Vertex and our shareholders.","Launching INCIVEK last year was a crucial turning point for Vertex and enabled us to demonstrate not only our research and development expertise, but also our ability to build a commercial team that flawlessly executed one of the most successful drug launches in the industry. Prior to launch, we anticipated strong demand for this medicine from people living with hepatitis C and the healthcare providers who treat them. But INCIVEK\u2019s performance in the first seven months exceeded even those expectations. INCIVEK is now available in multiple countries including the U.S., Canada and nine countries in Europe. We believe this reflects the clinical benefits of the drug, and the outstanding work of our commercial organization.","Our fourth quarter and year-end 2011 results reflect the very rapid launch of INCIVEK and have created strong cash flow to enable investment in our late stage pipeline of medicines while also returning value to shareholders. Ian will review our financial results with you momentarily. As our hepatitis C commercial group remains keenly focused on INCIVEK\u2019s launch, we are progressing efforts to sustain our leadership in hepatitis C for the long-term. We have a number of future opportunities in this disease including an all-oral regimen in Phase 2 and two novel nucleotide medicines which are now in Phase 1.","These nucleotide compounds are pan-genotypic in vitro and we expect to obtain biokinetic data this year not only in genotype 1 but also in multiple HCV genotypes. In the area of cystic fibrosis, the team\u2019s execution on the development and regulatory submissions of KALYDECO for the treatment of a subset of patients was absolutely extraordinary. As a result of these efforts, we launched our second breakthrough medicine within nine months after the launch of our first and only three months after the submission of the NDA. Nancy and her team are working together to bring KALYDECO to CF patient\u2019s age six and older with the G551D mutation. And I\u2019m pleased to announce that just two days after approval, KALYDECO has begun to arrive at the network of specialty pharmacies.","Through our disease education initiative, we are providing doctors and nurses with specific resources to understand the science behind CFTR modulation and the importance of knowing a patient\u2019s genotype. We\u2019re also educating the community on KALYDECO\u2019s label and the patients who can benefit from this medicine to enable the successful outcomes the patients, providers and payers all want. And we\u2019re equally excited about ways to improve the treatment for other people living with cystic fibrosis.","KALYDECO is part of a longstanding and ongoing program. Our work is not done. We have a portfolio of medicines, and we\u2019re committed to doing everything we can to help as many CF patients as possible.","Specifically, we\u2019re now getting ready to start three additional studies of KALYDECO as monotherapy, which may help to address the addressable \u2013 to expand the addressable population. With positive results from these studies, we believe we could submit data to begin to expand KALYDECO\u2019s label as early as 2013.","We\u2019re also exploring combining KALYDECO with VX-809 and VX-661, two potential medicines known as correctors, which target the most common CF mutation called Delta 508. We have exploratory studies ongoing in parallel with these medicines and expect to get clinical data from these studies later this year.","Beyond the hepatitis C and cystic fibrosis areas, we\u2019re advancing our pipeline of other medicines. We\u2019re initiating Phase 2b studies of the VX-509, our selective JAK3 inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, and VX-765 for epilepsy. Also this year, we\u2019re planning to initiate a proof-of-concept study for VX-787, a novel medicine for influenza.","These opportunities in our drug pipeline are both diverse and global and could build upon the revenue base of INCIVEK and KALYDECO to provide substantial growth for Vertex in the next three to five years. We fundamentally believe that the value of our business will be driven by innovations in our pipeline, while we maintain a financial return from our marketed drugs.","In summary, only a few biotech companies are fortunate enough to go from being a drug development company to a successful commercial organization with multiple approved medicines. And fewer have done so with a broad and diverse pipeline in serious diseases like we have developed at Vertex. As we look ahead, we see 2012 as the year that underscores to many our capability to consistently discover, develop and bring breakthrough medicines to patients.","Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to Ian.","Ian Smith","Thanks, Jeff, and good evening to everyone. Financially, 2011 was a turning point for the company. It marked Vertex\u2019s first full-year of profitability and reflected the success in treating a significant number of hepatitis C patients with INCIVEK. We\u2019ve now transitioned to a business generating significant revenues and as we enter 2012, we have a financial objective to balance our investment into R&D, required for innovation and growth opportunities whilst still generating significant earnings and cash flows.","Tonight, I\u2019m going to report on our GAAP and non-GAAP income for the full year 2011, and then focus my remarks on how we\u2019re financially managing 2012. I will, of course, be happy to address any questions during the question-and-answer session.","First to our 2011 financial results, the GAAP net income attributable to Vertex in 2011 was approximately $30 million, or $0.14 per diluted share. This compares to a $755 million 2010 GAAP net loss. For the full year 2011, our non-GAAP net income was approximately $60 million or $0.08 per diluted share, which compares to $606 million of 2010 non-GAAP loss.","We achieved these results and specifically the full-year profitability due to the successful launch of INCIVEK in the U.S., coupled with a focus on financial discipline that balances the investment necessary for continued innovation.","Before I turn to the guidance we\u2019re providing for 2012, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that at the end of 2011, we had NOLs, that is net operating losses, of approximately $3 billion. Utilization of these NOLs contributed to the cash position in 2011 and will continue to reduce our tax obligations going forward.","Now turning to the financial guidance for 2012, the components of the guidance we are providing are as follows. INCIVEK net product revenues and non-GAAP total operating expenses excluding cost of revenues, stock-based compensation and the expenses related to accounting treatment of the Alios collaboration. These are important financial measures of cash inflows and reinvestment back into our business. We may provide further financial guidance in 2012 as we gain more understanding of the revenues generated from the recently approved and now launched KALYDECO and also the royalty revenues from the recent approval of INCIVO which is marketed in Europe by J&J. Both may provide substantial revenues and contribute to earnings and cash flow.","We believe our 2012 guidance reflects our ability to build value, by creating earnings while we continue to prudently invest in our pipeline of medicines to drive further innovation. It\u2019s a careful balance of priorities. First, we expect U.S. INCIVEK net product revenues to be within a range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion for the full year of 2012. This compares to 2011 net product revenues for INCIVEK of approximately $951 million, which represents the first seven months of sales for INCIVEK. Additionally, this compares to our fourth quarter INCIVEK revenues of approximately $457 million. The 2012 projected INCIVEK revenues are based on our assessment of the genotype 1 hepatitis C market, our understanding of the underlying demand, trend in physician treatment decision-making and our general market knowledge.","It also takes into account the anticipated increases in the gross to net adjustments from our weighted average cost or list price based on contractual terms with commercial and government payers.","Next, projected 2012 non-GAAP total operating expenses \u2013 specifically, those of R&D and SG&A expenses. We expect these expenses to be in the range of $1.03 billion to $1.13 billion compared to $981 million for 2011. This is an increase of approximately 10%, using the midpoint of our 2012 expense guidance. This also compares to approximately $276 million for the fourth quarter of 2011.","Now, looking at the individual components of the non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses. First, our R&D expenses are anticipated to be in the range of $690 million to $760 million. This compares to approximately $627 million for 2011 and approximately $166 million for the fourth quarter of 2011.","This spend will be focused on the advancement and the initiation of multiple clinical trials planned in several different serious diseases, including our lead programs in hepatitis C and cystic fibrosis, as well as clinical programs in rheumatoid arthritis, influenza and epilepsy.","On the commercial side of our business, we will continue to support the launch of INCIVEK and the recent U.S. launch of KALYDECO for cystic fibrosis patients. We will also incur costs associated with the initial preparation for and the potential launch of KALYDECO in the EU later this year.","To support these important areas of our business, we anticipate SG&A expenses to be in the range of $340 million to $370 million. This compares to $354 million for the year ended 2011 and approximately $110 million for the fourth quarter of 2011.","In summary, we believe the approval of our first two medicines has demonstrated our capability to develop breakthrough medicines in serious diseases, but we would not be where we are today without shareholder support in making significant investments in our pipeline to advance these innovations. We are now fortunate to have a strong capital structure, a significant cash inflows from product revenues that we believe will enable us to deliver significant return back to our shareholders while maintaining investments in our business.","Thank you for your support, and Michael, back to you.","Michael Partridge","Thank you. Tyrone, we now like to open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Geoffrey Porges of Bernstein. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Porges \u2013 Bernstein","Thanks very much for taking the questions. Congratulations on the first year of profitability. Ian, a couple of questions on your philosophy in giving us this guidance. First of all, you seem to be guiding that INCIVEK is expected to be down modestly versus the fourth quarter. And can you tell us how you thought about that?","And secondly, as you think about expenses, presuming there may be some revenue opportunities emerging from either KALYDECO or else coming from royalties, do you expect expenses would be fixed at those levels or would they ramp up if there was incremental revenue? And then lastly, could you just give us a sense of whether you think this gross margin is sustainable at this level given the portfolio? Thanks.","Ian Smith","Okay, Geoff, how you doing? I think I got all five of those questions, seriously. So, let\u2019s start \u2013 and if I miss any please take me back. So, first of all, why guidance? Well, as I said in my prepared remarks, we do think it\u2019s important to give the investors and analysts a good understanding of the cash inflows that are coming into our business and then how we choose to reinvest them versus align them to drop to the bottom line. The key line items in terms of those coming into our business are in the INCIVEK net revenues. We feel as though we have a good understanding of the hepatitis C market and the range that we gave of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion is a range that we\u2019re confident of achieving in 2012. Other line items on the revenue though, it\u2019s a little more difficult, because we\u2019re at the earlier stages of launches of products. So, the KALYDECO revenue stream for 2012 we have to see how that goes and then also the same with INCIVO, which is of course INCIVEK in Europe but that\u2019s also at its early stage of the launch. As we go through the year, we get a better understanding, we may provide further guidance.","Those are two line items that could provide significant cash inflow to the business. And as we go through the year, then, we may give further guidance on those line items. But at this stage, it\u2019s just feels too early. From an expense base, clearly the trajectories in our business of R&D which have been questioned a number of times; we want to give the guidance on how we\u2019re managing the business financially on the investment side and as you see the total operating expense guidance that we\u2019re giving. It is a 10% increase on the prior year but from an SG&A perspective, it is being held fairly constant to 2011.","There is slight growth in the R&D side but that\u2019s because of the progression and advancements of development programs. So, we wanted to give that kind of financial structure to the business and that\u2019s the reason we gave the guidance and we have the confidence to give that guidance. To your other questions, you asked about the INCIVEK trajectory. I assume you are comparing it to the Q4 number. We were fortunate in Q4 to benefit from this rapid uptake following launch where there was a high volume of patients flowing into the system, which we clearly benefit from a revenue perspective, as we went into the fourth quarter.","As we go into 2012, we\u2019re establishing where we believe the run rates of the patients are flowing through the system, and that\u2019s reflected in our guidance of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. I would point out we did benefit early on by patients that were waiting for therapy, then came our approval and they came into the system. We do feel as we give guidance of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion that we have the confidence of achieving that.","As far as the other revenue, as I mentioned, those are the INCIVO royalty revenues and also the KALYDECO revenues. Expenses in terms of how the business performs through the year \u2013 we\u2019re holding ourselves accountable internally to the numbers that we\u2019ve provided to you. So, we do not see those flexing, and we have a number of programs internally ongoing in the company that maintain those expenses and in some parts of our business, actually take the expense away.","As far as the gross margin on the products, we see it remaining fairly similar to 2011. We\u2019ve always mentioned that the gross margins for the products we sell should be above 90%, including the royalties that are attached to some of those products. So, we\u2019re still in good shape, as we go into 2012 on the gross margins of the two products that are now in the market.","Geoffrey Porges \u2013 Bernstein","Thank you very much. I appreciate that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Terence Flynn \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the progress. I just had a question on the ongoing KALYDECO 809 trial. I was wondering, first, if you can give us any update on enrollment; and then, two, maybe you could help us frame what you guys would view as a go\/no-go decision for taking that combination forward into a larger Phase 3 program?","Peter Mueller","Hi, Terence. That\u2019s Peter speaking and Bob will also maybe say a couple of words to that. So, first of all, cohort II enrollment is going as expected, no delays or anything. We are expecting midyear to have data that might be available for broader communication. Everything so far is on track and there is no stoplight that I can see at this given point in time. So, what was the other question?","Robert Kauffman","This is Bob. I mean your second point is sort of our benchmarks for going forward into Phase 3. We\u2019ve been asked this many times and it\u2019s very hard to put an exact number on it. I think a lot will depend on what we see in the trial. Obviously, looking at sweat chloride results and lung function results and it\u2019s just pretty hard to really pin ourselves down to something. And \u2013 yeah.","Peter Mueller","The other comment that I want to add, the decision is not solely on 809. We have two correctors, the other one is 661. It\u2019s not a binary, yes or no. It is choosing the best regimen as we go forward. And we will get data in the course of the next couple of months to get a better insight, as Bob said, what that is. So, don\u2019t see that stuff as an 809 type of event, see it as a broader approach to identify a viable regimen that treats this broad population.","Terence Flynn \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And can I just ask one follow-up on the design of the KALYDECO 809 study. I was wondering I know you\u2019re enrolling both patients, homozygous and heterozygous for F508del, is that a pre-specified stratification criteria? I know there is set numbers of patients for each of those you\u2019re going to enroll.","Robert Kauffman","Yes. There is specific subgroups. The majority of the trial is the homozygous patients and then there is one cohort of heterozygous patients and enrollment is obviously separately into those groups.","Terence Flynn \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rachel McMinn of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, two questions, one very specific, a broader one. On the specific one, I\u2019m wondering even though you can\u2019t give us guidance for INCIVO, can you give us a sense of what INCIVO royalties really were in the quarter? Whether there were one-time stocking effects in 4Q? Just want to make sure we don\u2019t overestimate the run rate going into 2012?","And then the broader question on capital allocation, the exiting CEO had kind of previously articulated that R&D investment would kind of be first into the pipeline, second into kind of small M&A and deals and then third, a distant center would be share repurchases. Jeff, I was wondering if you could \u2013 if I could take your temperature on your view of that \u2013 that capital allocation strategy. Thanks.","Ian Smith","Hi, Rachel, it\u2019s Ian. So, the royalties from INCIVO in the fourth quarter were approximately $16 million. There is a little bit of stocking in there but it\u2019s also right at the beginning of the approvals and launches of INCIVO in the various European countries. It has been approved in the major European countries now, we would anticipate that the run rate of that royalty to pick up significantly, frankly, as we go into 2012.","Jeff Leiden","And Rachel, this is Jeff. On your question on capital allocation I think Matt and I were and are in complete agreement about that. As you know, I\u2019ve told you before, we\u2019re quite excited about a number of opportunities in our current pipeline, including our Alios nucs, our triple oral in HCV, our KALYDECO label expansion in CV, and then of course the combination studies and behind that, the flu, the epilepsy and the JAK compounds. So, there are a lot of exciting things to invest in. We plan to invest in them, because not to do so would be to starve the future growth of our business.","With respect to M&A activities, I think, like most companies, we keep a careful eye on what\u2019s going on in the outside. We\u2019re in the fortunate position of not having to do deals because of our pipeline. On the other hand, we\u2019re always looking for interesting things that can complement what we have internally, and we will continue to do so.","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And I\u2019m sorry, just a quick follow-up to that. Anything specific on HCV or do you feel comfortable with your HCV portfolio as is?","Jeff Leiden","Yeah. We feel very comfortable with our HCV portfolio. In fact, I would say, as I look at it \u2013 and I\u2019ve been looking at it for a while now \u2013 it\u2019s the broadest and deepest portfolio that allows us the most swings at the ball, Rachael.","And I think \u2013 again, I\u2019ve talked with you about this before \u2013 I don\u2019t think anybody knows exactly what the winning combinations are going to be yet for the different patient subpopulations. And what I like about our pipeline is we have many different swings at the ball.","With the two Alios nucs, which can be combined with each other, ribavirin, obviously, our non-nuc, VX-222, and INCIVEK. So, I think when I look at our pipeline, we have the component parts to create a number of winning regimens. And we plan to pursue several of those to understand how they are going to work and how it\u2019s going to play out in these different patient subpopulations.","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Perfect. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Geoff Meacham from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Ulz \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. This is actually Mike in for Jeff. Just wondering if you\u2019d maybe break out for us INCIVEK patient numbers in terms of the dynamic between those that are na\u00efve and experienced and maybe sort of what you\u2019re seeing and how that\u2019s sort of changing over time? Thanks.","Nancy Wysenski","Sure, Mike. This is Nancy. Actually, when we first launched the drug, we saw a slight tip toward the na\u00efve patient group at about a 60\/40 split and to date that really hasn\u2019t changed. And I think that\u2019s an indication of the fact that there are a good number of patients who are out there, who are still coming into offices that are seeking treatment from all types of backgrounds and contributes to some of the facts that Ian mentioned in our guidance for this year.","Michael Ulz \u2013 JPMorgan","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Schoenebaum of ISI. Your line is open.","Wesley Nurss \u2013 ISI","Hi. This is Wes sitting in for Mark. I just had a question about the SG&A guidance. I noticed that the fourth quarter SG&A expense annualized is larger than the 2012 guidance. So, I was just wondering if you could just talk about how the split of SG&A expense will occur over the quarter, and also \u2013 over the year, excuse me \u2013 and also if you could explain the variance of that annualized 4Q SG&A number? Thanks.","Ian Smith","Sure. I appreciate the question. I actually appreciate you pointing it out, something financially we\u2019re actually very proud of. So, we have a number of initiatives as I mentioned in answer to an earlier question within our business where we\u2019re looking at processes and efficiencies and we have set ourselves some objectives and we are going to be going about some things different this year than we have in the past. And we expect those to result in expense savings.","There have also been a few costs that have been of a one-time nature in 2011 that we will no longer be incurring. But we are at that stage of our business where we have gone through our business, how we operate, look at processes and we\u2019re trying to find out how we can operate our business efficiently, while maintaining our priority and key focus on investment and R&D that will drive the future of the company. And that\u2019s \u2013 I appreciate you asking the question because it\u2019s coming through in the SG&A line.","Wesley Nurss \u2013 ISI","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Yaron Werber of Citi. Your line is open.","Gloria Woo \u2013 Citi","Hi. This is Gloria on for Yaron. He wanted to know whether or not you would consider buying back CF royalties from the CF Foundation? And also if I can ask a second question, for Q4 20\u201911, it seemed that you had a tax rate of 10.7%. We were wondering if you can sustain that through 2012.","Ian Smith","Yes, thanks for the question. Couple of questions there. First of all, we don\u2019t comment on potential business development type transactions. All I would say that if there is something that is interesting for our business and makes financial sense, we\u2019ll give it consideration. As far as the tax rate concern, I understand your question, it is a little confusing. The number that you\u2019re referring to is actually the tax line that we have to consolidate from Alios and it\u2019s actually not our taxes. The accounting for Alios is that we actually have to consolidate Alios into our financial statements. We then remove them on the bottom line.","So, it\u2019s actually not our tax line item. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we actually have NOLs that allow us to offset the income that we make and our tax obligations are actually minimal. So, cash tax obligations are minimal. We do have some small state taxes but it really is minimal. If you look to the non-GAAP financials that we disclosed in our press release, you\u2019ll see that the true \u2013 kind of the true tax cash rate.","Michael Partridge","Thank you, next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Howard Liang of Leerink Swann. Your line is open.","Howard Liang \u2013 Leerink Swann","Did you say anything about the contribution from inventory changes to the sales in the fourth quarter and whether there are any sales to a third party for clinical supply?","Ian Smith","Okay. Could you say that again? It didn\u2019t come through quite clearly. Please?","Jeff Leiden","Inventory changes and any sales for clinical trials.","Ian Smith","Okay. There was \u2013 in terms of \u2013 if you measure from September 30 through to December 31 and look at the levels of inventory, it was negligible change, Howard. So, it didn\u2019t have an impact on the revenue recognition.","Howard Liang \u2013 Leerink Swann","Any contribution from sales to third party for clinical supply and whether that may continue in 2012?","Ian Smith","There have been pieces within our revenue line where third parties have been buying INCIVEK for their own clinical trial. But as you might expect, it\u2019s \u2013 a majority of sales are to patients.","Howard Liang \u2013 Leerink Swann","If I can follow up on a separate question, you\u2019re interferon-free regimen, how you make the determination to move forward? What would it take for you to move to Phase 3 for the 222\/INCIVEK\/ribavirin combination? When would you consider a trial specific for subgroups of genotype 1 patients, 1a or 1b?","Robert Kauffman","Yeah. This is Bob. We are awaiting the results of the SVR4 data from the ribavirin triple. And clearly, that will be the most important piece of information that we get in order to decide whether to go forward.","Obviously, the bar is set really quite high in the field for \u2013 certainly, for expectations for what SVR rates are and obviously, we\u2019ll be looking to see that we have a competitive regimen based on the data that we obtain. We have multiple, potential non-interferon-based regimens and we will have to spend some time thinking about sort of allocating resources to those various options, including the ribavirin triple and then coming a little later in the year, the possibility of combinations with the Alios compounds. And there is a lot of mixing and matching within our own portfolio that we believe can occur. So, it\u2019s going to be a bit of a complex equation but it will surely be data driven.","Howard Liang \u2013 Leerink Swann","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Kantor of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jason Kantor \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Yes, a couple of questions, first of all, congratulations again on KALYDECO. And in terms of the launch, I know that awareness for this drug was really high and genotyping was also something that\u2019s been done a lot and there\u2019s a lot of interest in those trials. So, I\u2019m wondering, should we be thinking about this as a real bolus of patients that could come on very quickly following the approval?","And also on the HCV market, if you could give us some sense of what you think the market dynamics are right now in terms of capacity, warehousing and any kind of seasonality that we can expect in Q1? Thanks.","Nancy Wysenski","Great, Jason. Let me see if I can hit all that. So, first of all, on cystic fibrosis and KALYDECO; this is a very well-known patient community and as you know, the majority of them are children and they are in routine care at a predictable number around just slightly more than 110 CF centers across the United States. What that means is that they all show up for care at least once quarterly. And since the vast majority of them have already been genotyped, either the patient, their caregiver or the physician is clearly aware of which patients KALYDECO will be used in. You know we\u2019ve heard a few early rumors that in some cases, they are actually canceling their routine clinic appointments in order to open up days just to be dedicated to bringing in these patients. But I think from those comments, you can probably begin to think through what that uptake is going to look like. Switching over to HCV, capacity and warehousing.","Well, first of all, to talk about the market in general as it relates to capacity, last year as we launched, we saw a really huge spike in treatment because prior to the launch of the PI, there really weren\u2019t any medications that were nearly as efficacious. So, what that meant was that we really had a jump and then some of the offices realized that stretched them a little too far and the general capacity has calmed down a little. Following that, we saw the holiday effect. We talked about that holiday effect in advance. I think what we saw was consistent with what we expected and what the historical use even with the pegylated-interferon showed. And then typically, what happens is in January, you see a re-stabilization and we believe that re-stabilization will \u2013 well, it\u2019s already beginning to occur. It will continue and that \u2013 the slope of that curve for next year is going to again be consistent with what we\u2019ve seen with the pegylated-interferon and being a pretty steady sort of state.","In terms of warehousing, we\u2019re not quite certain that we burned through all the warehousing that occurred prior to the launch of the PI. We see those patients continuing to come in. And although every physician makes some unique determinations in a patient\u2019s first call \u2013 kind of, patient\u2019s first visit \u2013 they tend to put a patient aside here or there.","We don\u2019t think that there is any significant impact from their thoughts about future therapies. And really, there is not that much information out there yet. So, it\u2019s too early to even begin to think about quantifying an impact like that. But we\u2019ll be watching it through the year and keeping you apprised as we see things develop differently.","Jason Kantor \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Roden of UBS. Your line is open.","Andrew Peters \u2013 UBS","Hi, guys. This is actually Andrew in for Matt, and congratulations on the quarter. I was wondering if I could ask, I guess, your general interest on partnering, specifically for 509 and 787. Those are pretty sizable markets, and I think the clinical requirements for a trial in flu as well is in RA are pretty significant. So, what are your thoughts on how you would manage those kind of Phase 3s on your own as opposed to kind of getting a partner to help manage some of those costs? Thanks.","Ian Smith","Thanks for the question. I\u2019ll start by saying that if we have the opportunity to run a Phase 3 with these drugs and these diseases, I think, that\u2019s a rare opportunity for a company. So, you can see where we\u2019re leaning as a business. And the hardest thing to do is actually get the molecule all the way through ready to start the Phase 3 in these diseases.","So, if we are successful with the next stages of these two compounds that you refer to, we look forward to running a Phase 3. We think we have the capacity in our business both from resources and financial resources to run this through a Phase 3 and they\u2019re big opportunity for us. And as if we look into the future, if we have the ability to run those Phase 3, what it says is, we actually have that opportunity for continued revenue growth in the middle and latter part of this decade. As far as considering the compounds going outside of the company, we don\u2019t comment on those kind of transactions. We are running the studies as Peter has mentioned and Jeff has mentioned and we look forward to getting the results from them.","Andrew Peters \u2013 UBS","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ted Tenthoff of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Ted Tenthoff \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Thank you very much. I have to say looking into 2012, I\u2019m very excited about where the company is and congratulations on launch of \u2013 approval of KALYDECO. I actually had two quick kind of housekeeping questions. Ian, you said about the tax rate, that it would be \u2013 remain kind of low. Will it be \u2013 can you give us any guidance on what that actually might be, because I know there is a lot of different parts to that. And also, and I have to \u2013 you have to excuse me if I missed this, but I recall that you got the EU milestones for payments for approval of INCIVO last quarter but I didn\u2019t see where that came out in this quarter. So, I just wanted to see if you had any comment on that?","Ian Smith","Sure. So, have a little patience on this. If we don\u2019t get through it, Ted, then I\u2019ll certainly catch up with you off-line on the taxes, but I\u2019ll just ask you to refer to the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP and what you\u2019ll see on the left-hand side where you\u2019ve got the GAAP numbers, you will see a provision for income taxes. And somebody mentioned earlier, that is up around 10%-ish. But that actually is a somebody else\u2019s tax line that we\u2019re consolidating unfortunately. When we do our reversals for the Alios transaction and other kind of deferred type tax assets, we end up with minimal taxes. That is the tax position and the cash tax position of the business and it\u2019s because of the NOLs. The NOLs aren\u2019t just federal NOLs, we have state NOLs as well. So, we take advantage of those.","As you think about a cash tax for our business, certainly as we work through the $3 billion worth of NOLs, they will continue, the cash taxes will continue to be minimal in our business. So, I would just ask you to take a look at that GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation, as I say, we can do it off-line. As far as the INCIVO milestones are concerned, we did have milestones that were recorded earlier in the year and we actually reversed those at the non-GAAP and I think those were reported if I remember correctly in Q3. And that\u2019s why they do not show up in Q4 \u2013 yeah, the milestone that came in in Q4 was the Mitsubishi milestone and you\u2019ll see that, that $65 million.","Ted Tenthoff \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Yeah. Okay, perfect I appreciate the comments there. And I\u2019m looking forward to a good launch for KALYDECO.","Ian Smith","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Abrahams of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Matthew Andrews \u2013 Wells Fargo","Yeah, good evening. This is Matthew Andrews calling in for Brian. Thank you for taking the question. On Tuesday, you noted that there were 190 patients in the PERSIST long-term follow-up KALYDECO study with about 100 of those being in the U.S. Can you discuss the EAP? How many patients are in that? How many are enrolled in the U.S. and Europe and how quickly the ones that are in the United States could transition over to commercial therapy? Thank you.","Nancy Wysenski","Yeah.","Peter Mueller","So, I think, currently \u2013 so that\u2019s Peter speaking, Matthew \u2013 in the U.S., that\u2019s correct. There is currently about 100 patients on that will trickle off in the next \u2013 starting Q2 and lasting all into first quarter of 2013. And in Europe, it is set up, for now, sort of as an inpatient program with about 100 patients overall, but there\u2019s not 100 on right now. It\u2019s about 30 or so. That\u2019s about what we have right now. But we are in negotiations with different countries and to see whether we can reach out there and launch the program.","Matthew Andrews \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ying Huang of Barclays Capital. Your line is open.","Ying Huang \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thank you for taking the question, and congratulations on the quarter. First question \u2013 you commented on you\u2019re still burning through the warehouse patients from the peg-interferon base. But are you guys seeing actually warehousing of these patients again for the next wave of interferon oral regimen? And if yes, do you actually figure in that when you provided the guidance for $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion this year? And secondly, I have a follow-up on the financials.","Nancy Wysenski","Okay. Let me take the first part of that, Ying. That\u2019s a great question. So, you\u2019re right. There are two different issues around warehousing. And the comment that I made earlier when I was trying to explain is that when a patient comes in and a physician decides to treat, they always sort of triage them in their own mind and as they believe that there are new therapies that may come down the road, they begin to add those into their thinking. However, at this point in time, it\u2019s really too early for us to think about any key quantitative impact from what we\u2019re seeing in the market. And we believe that if there is any warehousing like that that has occurred, it\u2019s really very minimal. So, we\u2019re not very concerned about that at this point and our current view is baked into our guidance of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion.","Ying Huang \u2013 Barclays Capital","Great, thanks. And then, Ian, I just calculated your cost of goods sold for 4Q, it\u2019s only 5%. If you look at the whole year 2011, it\u2019s about 6.7%. When you commented that for 2012 your costs will be consistent to 2011, did you specifically mention that it was closer to the whole year average of 2.7%, or it\u2019s actually going to be consistent to the 5% you recorded in 4Q here? Thanks.","Ian Smith","Ying, I always appreciate your accuracy of comparing 5% to 6%. I mean internally we are very focused on that, but I\u2019m not going to go beyond the comments that I made earlier. I think the past cost of goods line is a pretty good indicator of how 2012 will go as well.","Ying Huang \u2013 Barclays Capital","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Liisa Bayko of JMP Securities. Your line is open.","Liisa Bayko \u2013 JMP Securities","Hi. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on a great quarter as well. Can you maybe just talk about \u2013 I\u2019m just trying to figure out the gross to net adjustment for KALYDECO and then maybe a follow-up question in the same regard is just on changes in stocking that occurred for INCIVEK in the U.S.? Thanks.","Ian Smith","Sure. I\u2019ll take the latter first, Liisa, thanks. Which is the stocking between September 30 and December 31, there was minimal change, so there wasn\u2019t a change in the levels of inventory at the wholesaler, so, it didn\u2019t really have an impact on the revenues that we recorded in the fourth quarter. As far as the gross to net adjustment is concerned on KALYDECO, we explained this on the call the other day which is that this is primarily driven by the split in patients which are either on commercial insurance or supported through the government. We anticipate this market is split 60\/40, 60% being commercial insurance and 40% being government and there is minimal discounting, minimal discounting on the commercial side. And on the government side, there is a statutory or mandatory discounting that ranges between 15% and 25%, which will give you an idea of if you blend those patient flows, it will give you an idea of the gross to net adjustment.","Liisa Bayko \u2013 JMP Securities","And then how do we think about for KALYDECO, where any payment for free drug or co-pay assistance runs through and what \u2013 how do we think about that as a percentage of the cost?","Ian Smith","It\u2019s very small.","Liisa Bayko \u2013 JMP Securities","Okay.","Ian Smith","Really doesn\u2019t impact the \u2013 our estimate.","Liisa Bayko \u2013 JMP Securities","And just one follow-up if I may, were there \u2013 was there any change in patient discontinuations for INCIVEK in the quarter from past? I\u2019m just trying to reconcile what the demand looks like from the prescription audit versus what you actually reported?","Nancy Wysenski","We are not aware of any changes at this point in time, Liisa.","Liisa Bayko \u2013 JMP Securities","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Friedman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","David Friedman \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just two quick ones. The first is, can you let us know gross sales for INCIVEK for the quarter? And then the other is, in the combination CF study that you ran in the past with 809 and 770, could you just describe any PK-related drug-drug interactions between the two drugs?","Ian Smith","So, I actually don\u2019t have the gross sales number available, David. But if the question is referring to what was the gross to net discount in the fourth quarter...","David Friedman \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yes.","Ian Smith","...it was slightly above that of the third quarter. It approximated 13% \u2013 approximated. The reason why I give that number is it gives you an indication of how we go into 2012. I did mention in my prepared remarks that we anticipate a widening of the gross to net margin. That\u2019s because we have more covered lives with our insurers these days, and we\u2019re also maybe seeing more flow through the government channel as well. So, I give you as a marker, and as we go into 2012, the gross to net adjustment is built into the guidance we gave of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion.","David Friedman \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks.","Peter Mueller","And I might \u2013 so, that\u2019s Peter speaking. So, with respect to your question of the earlier 770 and 809 study, I think, we didn\u2019t release any data around PK in any specificity. However, I want to say, just to remind you, it was a viable regimen. It was safe. It was a safety study. And it basically has proven the concept or at least the mechanism to the point that we saw action on the channel which is basically proof that the target basically gets to the surface and does something. And the chosen dose at those days was maybe not high enough to see a therapeutically relevant outcome. It was sort of borderline. But we will \u2013 and that\u2019s the part of the cohort II study \u2013 investigate different dose regimens in different concentrations and then basically have maybe a better inroad into that patient population.","David Friedman \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. But you can\u2019t say whether there is any drug-drug interaction or PK change from 809?","Peter Mueller","David, there is nothing out of the extraordinary and we will study that as we go forward.","David Friedman \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Marko Kozul of ThinkEquity. Your line is open.","Marko Kozul \u2013 ThinkEquity","Hi. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question and I also echo my congratulations. A few quick cystic fibrosis questions, part A is, if we were to assume encouraging data from cohort II, mid-2012 for the combo KALYDECO with 809, what might Phase 3 designs look like? And part B, you announced I think today the start of the VX-661 KALYDECO study, I was wondering if you could outline its design? Thanks.","Peter Mueller","So, let\u2019s assume that data come positive, that\u2019s always a good optimistic view. I think we cannot really 100% speculate what the design finally is because it needs regulatory authorities to approve that. We have to have a type C meeting to go into that and those discussions are basically partly ongoing and we will go from there. It is still to be determined how long those studies have to be and how much and how big the safety \u2013 the patient populations have to be to require particularly the safety database that is wanted. So, I can\u2019t really speculate on that because you have to have on a case-by-case basis a regulatory interaction. And that you have to have that not just in U.S. but also globally. This is a global program and I think we have to align sort of regulatory views in the world and we are currently doing that.","Robert Kauffman","So, in terms of \u2013 just one last comment is obviously the endpoints, of course, are likely to be the same as the ones we did for the 770 program. Those are the standard end points. In terms of 661, obviously that program is at an earlier stage and so the study is really looking at 661 individually in homozygous delta F patients and then 661 in combination with KALYDECO in the same patient population. And so, we\u2019re kind of working our way through the monotherapy part of it and then we\u2019ll be doing some of the combination work.","Peter Mueller","Right. And the data you might expect sort of in the fourth quarter for 661 study in combination or alone with 770.","Marko Kozul \u2013 ThinkEquity","And maybe just a quick follow-up, the 661 dose, is that dose escalated as 809 is in the current ongoing combo as well? Thanks.","Robert Kauffman","Yes, we\u2019ll be looking at multiple dose levels of 661 in that study.","Marko Kozul \u2013 ThinkEquity","Thanks again for taking the questions.","Michael Partridge","Operator, we have time we think for two more questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Skorney of Brean Murray. Your line is open.","Daniel Brims \u2013 Brean Murray","Hi, yes. This is actually Dan Brims in for Brian today. I have one quick question I think I might have missed it. Did you mention what the gross to net was going to be for KALYDECO as well as what your gross to net is for INCIVEK right now?","Ian Smith","Well, Dan, I\u2019ll start with INCIVEK. We gave guidance of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion for 2012, and that incorporates a gross to net adjustment. That is the net INCIVEK revenues. In the fourth quarter, we were at a gross to net adjustment of around 13%. It may widen slightly from there into 2012, but not significantly.","As far as the KALYDECO is concerned, the gross to net adjustment is made up of a mix of patients whether they\u2019re commercially insured or supported by the government. On the commercial side, which we anticipate is maybe 60% of the cystic fibrosis patients, the discounting is minimal \u2013 really minimal.","And then on the government side, there is a \u2013 which would be 40% of the patients, there is mandated and statutory discounts and support that is between 15% to 25%. So, I\u2019m sure you can do the triangulation from there.","Daniel Brims \u2013 Brean Murray","Okay. And one other quick question. With Japan, I guess, you\u2019re getting milestones in place of royalties there. What would be triggering those royalties, and when would you \u2013 when might you be seeing some of those or those milestones \u2013 excuse me?","Ian Smith","So, a while ago \u2013 in fact, years ago, the collaboration we struck with Mitsubishi Pharma was actually we did not have royalties once the drug was on the market. It was actually a sales milestone. We received that sales milestone in the fourth quarter of 2011. It was $65 million, and that was recorded in the financial statements of this fourth quarter 2011.","Daniel Brims \u2013 Brean Murray","And that\u2019s all you\u2019re going to be getting from that collaboration then?","Ian Smith","Yes.","Daniel Brims \u2013 Brean Murray","Okay. Thank you.","Ian Smith","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from George Farmer of Canaccord. Your line is open.","George Farmer \u2013 Canaccord","Great, thanks for squeezing me in. I really appreciate it. I was wondering if you could give us any feel for duration of activity you\u2019re seeing with KALYDECO, at least without going too much into detail in the PERSIST trial? And do you think that duration can continue on based on what you know now? And also, when do you think you\u2019ll be able to disclose more about the Alios nucs and Phase 1 trial design? Thanks.","Peter Mueller","So, George, this is Peter speaking, the first is about duration and longevity of the KALYDECO activity and efficacy in patients. As you know, we have patients on trial which is sort of about 60 weeks to 90 weeks. And those are all basically still performing the same way as they did sort of when they kicked in the benefit of the regimen which is sort of after two weeks. So, it\u2019s a long-lasting type of thing.","Anecdotally, we also have patients that we know on KALYDECO now for up to three years and I think \u2013 and they are still performing well and actually, you also to look at the other way around. Some of those patients anecdotally had to basically, because of some other circumstances, let out KALYDECO for couple weeks in their regimen because of antibiotic situations and other things. And they deteriorated quickly down to from FAV 92 down to FAV 40 or so or even less. And then when they came back on KALYDECO, they\u2019re basically reaching the high levels again that they had seen sort of beforehand. So, what that tells you is there is a true, long-lasting efficacy of that. I cannot say more than three years but that\u2019s for a stage when you launch a product quite an amazing timeframe.","George Farmer \u2013 Canaccord","Yes, it\u2019s wonderful.","Peter Mueller","And I must say there is a high hope that it will last even longer. So, that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s to that point so it\u2019s not like a one day (inaudible) when everything is over. So, it\u2019s long-lasting, at least in my view.","Now the other thing is the Alios compounds. Basically, as Jeff said, we will do a couple of different studies with them. So, there is a G1 population, obviously, the genotype 1A and B, which is sort of the first cohort that we basically look into. Those data you will see in the course of second quarter towards sort of midyear. We also are about to initiating another arm which has pan-genotypic regimens in there, so we will basically evaluate genotype 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and then all those so that we have real data and not just speculations.","And then basically we also will look into let\u2019s say a combination of each of them with ribavirin and see what that does and this will all come in the course of this year. And you will see it either maybe start the first set of data from our other all-oral regimen which is basically INCIVEK 222 and ribavirin. We might come at that point in time with some data. We\u2019ll try at least as we are poor data and then as I said midyear, you will see what Alios does. I\u2019m really convinced it will be exciting, and then comes ASOD. You have a bunch of other data that will help you to make a good judgment about that program. I\u2019m really excited. Those molecules are behaving very well so far, and I\u2019m looking forward for a good outcome.","George Farmer \u2013 Canaccord","Great. Thanks very much.","Michael Partridge","Well, thank you very much. We appreciate your participating tonight. We\u2019ll be happy to take additional questions in our offices. Thank you and look forward to seeing you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.

I would also refer you to Slide 4 of tonight's webcast.","I will now turn the call over to Jeff Leiden.","Jeffrey Leiden","Thanks, Michael, and good evening, everyone. 2014 was a year of continued success in delivering on our vision to be a leader in discovering and developing therapies for cystic fibrosis and other serious diseases. And we made significant progress this past year in establishing a foundation for sustainable growth. First, we expanded the number of patients with KALYDECO through geographic and label expansion efforts. Second, we announced positive data from our Phase III studies of lumacaftor\/ ivacaftor and submitted an NDA in the U.S. and MMA in EU paving the way to treat significantly more people with CF.","Third, we continue to manage our financial position ending the year with approximately $1.4 billion in cash to support the future of our business. These accomplishments have fundamentally changed the outlook for our business and increased their confidence and the company\u2019s plans for the future and for people with CF and their families.","I had the opportunity to meet with many of our investors and analysts of JPMorgan Healthcare Conference earlier this month and to talk about our strategy. So let me remind everyone about our priorities for 2015. First, approval and successful launch of the lumacaftor\/ ivacaftor combination while continuing to increase KALYDECO revenues enabling us to treat even more people with CF and to accelerate our revenue growth.","Second, significantly advancing our CF pipeline with a focus on next generation medicines that have the potential to create regimens that may increase the benefit for CF patients, and third, expanding and diversifying our pipeline into other areas as evidenced by multiple programs advancing into the clinic during 2015. If we are successful in meeting our goals we expect to deliver the Vertex and its shareholders a long term financial profile that includes significant revenue and earnings growth.","Before turning the call over to Stuart I wanted to take the opportunity to mention how proud we are at Vertex to be at the forefront a new approach in developing medicines, broadly referred to as precision medicine. KALYDECO and hopefully soon the combination of lumacaftor\/ ivacaftor are benefitting CF patients around the world and demonstrating the potential of this approach and developing medicines. We are pleased that our success had provided part of the basis for newer search initiatives, discussed for the first time in the State of Union address last week to apply precision medicine approaches across a broad range of diseases. And we look forward to working closely with regulators and other government entities to apply the learnings of precision medicine so that we can help more patients and do it faster.","With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Stuart.","Stuart Arbuckle","Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Tonight, I'll review the sales performance of KALYDECO in 2014 and outline our expectations for KALYDECO in 2015 that reflects strong underlying demand and the positive impact of label and geographic expansion. I will also discuss our progress in preparing for the approval and launch of the lumacaftor\/ivacaftor combination.","KALYDECO has shown rapid growth since it was approved in 2012. Product sales increased 25% in 2014 to $464 million. At the start of 2014 nearly all eligible patients with the G551D mutation in the U.S. and Europe were being treated with KALYDECO. Growth in 2014 was driven by both additional patients initiating therapy in new and existing international markets and the U.S. approval of KALYDECO for use in eight additional mutations.","Turning to 2015 there are again multiple potential growth drivers based on achieving reimbursement approvals and further label expansions. In the first half of 2015 we expect rapid uptake of KALYDECO by eligible patients in Australia following the completion of reimbursement discussions in late 2014. There are more than 200 children and adults with CF who are expected to be eligible for treatment.","In the U.S. KALYDECO was approved for use in children and adults ages 6 and older with the R117H mutation on December the 29th last year. The first patients have already initiated treatment and we expect to see continued uptake in the months ahead. In the second half of 2015 we expect to see the revenue impact from achieving reimbursement or Gating mutations in some European countries. We also anticipate a potential approval in children with CF ages 2 to 5 with the G551D or other Gating mutations in the U.S. which would be a growth driver in the second half of 2015.","As a result, we expect the number of patients eligible for KALYDECO to increase from 3,100 today to more than 3,700 by the end of this year. Although all eligible patients will not be on treatment by the end of the year and the enrolment of the VX-661 pivotal study in gating patients will have an adverse impact on patients receiving commercial product we expect another year of significant revenue growth and KALYDECO net sales in the range of $560 million to $580 million in 2015.","Now to the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor. We submitted the NDA and MAA in the U.S. and EU respectively in November 2014 that children and adults with CF ages 12 and older who have 2 copies of the F508del mutation. In the U.S. we received priority review with the PDUFA date of July the 5th 2015.","In the EU we were granted accelerated assessment and we anticipate EU approval around Q4 of this year if discussions with regulators progress as expected. All in regulatory approval in the EU individual reimbursement discussions will begin on a country by country basis.","I am pleased to report our launch planning is on track. There are around 8,500 F508del patients ages 12 years and older in the U.S. who are treated at approximately 275 CF centers. This represents an order of magnitude more patients than we currently treat. A key priority for us ahead of launch in the U.S. is to scale up our patient services team so that we can help providers and patients navigate the reimbursement process and also help with patient education and compliance.","We have been adding case managers and we are also working to understand how CF centers plan to manage patient initiations. We are investing in disease education to help payers estimate the number of eligible patients they may have in their plans and also from a medical perspective to understand cystic fibrosis as a disease. It\u2019s impact on patients and caregivers and the systemic effects of CFTR modulation.","Internationally we are building out the required infrastructure in new and existing European markets to support the lumacaftor\/ivacaftor launch. Infrastructure for each new country consists of a small number of medical and commercial staff. In summary, geographic and label expansion will continue to drive significant growth in KALYDECO sales and we are well positioned for long term revenue growth as the number of people we treat with CF significantly increases with the launch of the lumacaftor\/ivacaftor combination later this year.","I will now hand the call over to Ian.","Ian Smith","Thanks, Stuart, and good evening to everyone. Tonight I would like to discuss our 2014 results, then our 2015 guidance and how that puts us on track to long term sustainable revenue and earnings growth. I\u2019ll be brief on the 2014 results and for a more detailed discussion of these results please refer to our press release we issued earlier today.","2014 financial performance was marked by the continuing growth in KALYDECO revenues controlling the level of our operating expenses and completing the year with a strong balance sheet. As we look to 2015 and beyond we see revenue growth continuing based on treating more patients with KALYDECO and then accelerating this revenue growth with the potential approval and launch of the lumacaftor\/ivacaftor combination.","As we anticipate this growth in our CF revenues we also expect to control the level of operating investments into our company. We anticipate that this will enable us to deliver a future financial profile that includes high operating margins and significant earnings growth.","Now to the 2014 results. We generated $536 million in total non-GAAP revenues in 2014, including $464 million in KALYDECO revenues. This was a significant increase over 2013 KALYDECO revenues and we expect this growth to continue. We also recorded $72 million in royalty and collaborative revenues including $35 million in revenue from the outlicense of VX-787, our novel flu medicine, to Janssen.","Then looking at the main components of our non-GAAP operating expenses, our combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses were $920 million in 2014 a decrease of $177 million compared to the prior year. This decrease reflects our prioritization with CF medicines and continued focus on managing operating expenses.","The non-GAAP loss was $511 million or $2.17 per share compared to the prior year loss of $203 million. This increased loss was the result of significantly reduced HCV revenues from 2013 and they are now excluded from our 2014 no-GAAP financials.","With the expectation of increasing CF revenues in 2015 and controlling our operating expenses, we see 2014 as a transition year into revenue growth and future profitability. ","Now let\u2019s turn to our 2015 and our financial guidance for the year and specifically KALYDECO revenues and the main components of our operating expense. With the recent regulatory submissions and approvals for reimbursement, KALYDECO is well positioned for 2015. We expect KALYDECO net revenues to be in the range of $560 million to $580 million as we continue to expand the number of patients we tweet.","Next to the lumacaftor\/ivacaftor combination. We look forward to this midyear launch to further accelerate our revenue growth; however the revenues from this launch will be primarily U.S based in 2015. Based on regulatory timelines in the EU and the subsequent reimbursement timelines we anticipate the first commercial revenues from ex U.S. territories will likely occur in2016.","Now to the main components of our operating expenses. As previously announced we expect combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense will be in the range of $1.05 to $1.1.billion for the full year and we expect these expenses to be fairly consistent each quarter of this year. We expect the non-GAAP R&D expense to be in the range of $770 million to $800 million an increase of $75 million to $105 million compared to the prior year. Now breaking down the R&D spend into its principal components. We expect to spend approximately $200 million investing in our or basic research to support the creation of future transformational medicines and specifically in CF we expect to progress the next-generation correct into the clinic later this year. This is very similar to basic research spending in prior years.","Now to the deal development spend which we expect to be between $570 million or $600 million and is primarily driven by CF clinical program. More specifically, the Phase III pivotal program of VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor and the ongoing investments in lumacaftor\/ivacaftor combination with patients who remain on long term extension study.","Other areas of focus for Vertex in research and early development are programs in oncology and neurology and expectation that certain programs will enter and advance in the clinic in 2015 is incorporated into our guidance.","Turning now to 2015 SG&A guidance. We expect to spend $280 million to $300 million which is an increase of $55 million to $75 million compared to 2014. The increase reflects cross functional investments in supporting ivacaftor\/lumacaftor combination launch and establishing a larger international presence as we significantly increase the number of patients we expect to treat with our medicines.","I\u2019ll close by stating that we are in a strong financial position today and focused on delivering a financial profile consistent with our large cap biotech peers and we look forward to updating you on the executional [ph] strategy throughout this year.","With that, I'll ask the operator to please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Geoffrey Meacham from Barclays.","Geoff Meacham","Afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Obviously everyone is focused on the upcoming 661 date. I guess I wanted to get a sense from you guys when you\u2019re planning your Phase III where you look at the opportunity in heterozygous patients?","What population I guess would you estimate would be eligible for perhaps 661 plus KALYDECO and from your basic research what population may need a second corrector? And then I have follow-up.","Jeff Leiden","Geoff, this is Jeff Leiden. Thanks for the question. The way we\u2019re thinking about the heterozygous in terms of 661 and KALYDECO really in two bucket. You\u2019ll remember that last year we published a Phase II study and adding 661 to KALYDECO in patients who had a 508del mutation on one allele and some sort of gating mutation in that case G551D and the other allele.","And we\u2019re able to show if you remember that, one those patients once they were stable on KALYDECO, if we added 661 we saw greater than 4.5% improvement in an absolutely FEV1.","And so the first part of the heterozygous strategy that we\u2019re going to test in the Phase III program is basically a pivotal program around that population where we\u2019re trying to maximize the benefit that we can bring by adding 661 to KALYDECO and patients were heterozygous for 508 in the gaining will.","And so if you think about that population, it\u2019s about 80% of all gating patients who have 508 and the other allele. The other population is what we call heterozygous men population, not a very good term I admit, but its patients who have 508 on one allele and basically a non-KALYDECO responsive mutation on the other allele.","About 17,000 patients worldwide, as we\u2019ve said this is s hardest to treat population because those express half of the amount of the Delta 508 protein that Delta homozygous expresses, and so they need better correction.","We know for example that 809 plus KALYDECO doesn\u2019t work in that population. We look that in our traffic and transport trials you remember. So we\u2019re taking two prong approach to these patients, because today they don\u2019t have any CFTR correction therapy. We\u2019re going to taken admittedly high risk, but more rapid approach and try them with 661 plus KALYDECO, the two drug combination as part of our pivotal program and we\u2019ll start that program as we said in the first half of this year.","The idea there is if we can see an effect, than we\u2019ll be able to get the medicines to patients much more quickly. But the high probability approach that we\u2019re taking is the three-drug combination and that\u2019s where we take 661, KALYDECO and the next generation corrector.","Our cell-based data suggest that will work in this population with the higher probability, but of course that\u2019s slower, because our next generation correctors are in lead optimization now and our goal is to put the first to those and perhaps multiple in the clinic this year. And so that\u2019s the high probability but longer term approach.","Geoff Meacham","I guess that was more of my question of if you get the next gen corrector in clinic, you don\u2019t necessarily have to have 661 on the market. You\u2019ll be able to look at two unapproved drugs and proof-of-concept studies and get an answer pretty quickly?","Jeff Leiden","Well, we\u2019ll be able to look at two unapproved drugs but getting an answer quickly, I want to clear about, we\u2019ll have to take these first generation correctors into the clinical by themselves first of course to a Phase I study in normal than we\u2019ll able to begin to explore combination So as compared to the 661 KALYDECO trial which we\u2019re going to start in the first half of this year and quickly enroll. It is a significantly longer approach.","Geoff Meacham","Right. I got you. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Jeff Leiden","Thanks, Geoff.","Operator","Thank you next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn","Hi, thanks for taking the questions, maybe one follow-up on Geoff question then second one. So first just from a strategic standpoint I was just wondering the benefit of developing 661 plus KALYDECO in the patients that already benefit from KALYDECO, is it higher barriers to entry, is it greater revenue per patient, just maybe helped frame for us to strategic thinking there. And then, I would love your latest thoughts on partnerships and\/or BD within and outside of CF? Thanks.","Jeff Leiden","This is Jeff Leiden. And I\u2019ll now take the first part and then Ian will take the BD question. The strategic plan here is really simple. It\u2019s to bring the best benefit we can to those patients and that\u2019s our number one priority. And as we talked about less, so we were very pleasantly surprised actually by the Phase II data that showed the significant improvement over and above KALYDECO when we added 661 to those G551D on 508 patients. And that was one of things that really push us to go quickly into a pivotal program, so we could get those patients maximum benefit.","Ian Smith","And Terence to your second part of your question. In the last year we\u2019ve had a fairly active and broad business corporate development focus three main areas. One being to understand the landscape of other CF technologies and medicines that may combined with what we\u2019re doing here at Vertex to enhanced benefits from regimens.","Second area to focus has been to consider other technologic or research based approaches to creating medicines. I mean Vertex\u2019s has been very successful over the year with small molecule development and targeting certain molecular targets. But there are other things that are going on there right now that we need to involved in, so, with considering expanding our significant footprint as well. And then the third area of focus has been \u2013can you we diverse by our pipeline and by that it both out licensing non-core assets which we\u2019re been successful with.","While also considering bringing on other opportunities into our pipeline that where Vertex\u2019s further. I hope to update you with regard to 2015 in terms of where we\u2019ve been spending our efforts. And as I would outline cystic fibrosis is our number one priority.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Yee","Yes. Two quick topics. one is one the Phase IIb 661 study that you\u2019re finishing and then you move into a Phase III both Homozygous and heterozygous. I guess how did you go about being certain on your 100 milligram QD dose. Why didn\u2019t you go with higher BID dosing and how could you do all and take all that if you haven\u2019t even seen the full Phase IIb data. And then my second question as it relates to the over heterozygous populations that we\u2019ve been discussing on last couple of questions.","I guess you talk little about what it was high risk population, as the heterozygous population where we did see in the population where you did have 551, 508 and it was additive by 4.6%, even with only half protein [ph] expression. I\u2019ve been in the heterozygous admins you will have the protein expression with the mutation, so wouldn\u2019t work on that half \u2013 somewhat similar effect.","Jeffrey Chodakewitz","Mike hi, its Jeff Chodakewitz. So let me take this, let me take this first one. I think that really have to step back and remember that in the fall of last year with the Phase II data that we had, both the data in the 508 homozygous patients. And the patients that Jeff Leiden referred to with the 551D 508 patience. We already had 4-week data from those patients. So we had a fair amount of information.","What then the 12 weeks study really contributed is real the \u2013 its primary objective which was safety. It\u2019s a small study 40 patients, only 20 on active and in fact they\u2019re actually dividend across the couple of different doses. So that gave us the information at the interim to accelerate, because we knew from the DSMB revenue and our view that nothing \u2013 it was nothing there on safety that fundamentally changed our profile. So, that\u2019s really how we look at and it was really the preponderance of data that we had at the 100 milligram dose that gave us that confident using the opportunity to move faster.","Michael Yee","Got it. Okay.","Jeff Leiden","Yes. Then and your other question which is a good one, can we just extrapolate from the G551D 508 heterozygous to heterozygous men, I really think the answer is no.","We don\u2019t lot of things about those heterozygous patients for G551D for instance, we don\u2019t know the effect of 661 on that G551D protein as well and so they could be a beneficial folding effect on the G551D protein getting more protein to the surface and contributing to the 4.5% or 4.6% increase we saw when we had 661.","So we don\u2019t and I really wouldn\u2019t extrapolate from that G551D 508 data to 508 has been patient. And that\u2019s why we think its particular high risk.","Michael Yee","Yes, in other words it\u2019s helping -- it could help the 551 as well, I think? ","Jeff Leiden","Correct.","Michael Yee","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden from UBS.","Matt Roden","Great. Thanks very much for taking the question and congrats for getting the shot up the President in the State of Union address. Just to follow-up on the last question. Jeff you commented on the 661 Phase IIb data that you see in terms of safety and indorsing as a necessarily getting faster for moving into the phase III, but what can you tell us about what you saw in the efficacy if anything. Should we be thinking about this compound is being advantages relative to 8 or 9 because of the drug like proprieties and lack of invest interaction or is actually something to look at on the efficacy side is potentially better.","And then shifting gear, second question would be one ATR inhibitor program in cancer and I use to see that coming forward, looks like the approach here increase the sensitivity to the chemotherapy if I understand it correctly. So the question would be, do you need chemo combos for this to work. Or could the approach work with the targeted agents or immunotherapy, just trying to get a sense of where we going with that program?","Ian Smith","So Matt, I think in terms of the interim results, they really aren\u2019t just bad and there is really just no way to comment on those results. I think I do go back to the prior data that and it was really the totality of the data from those multiples cohorts across the different populations that we been referring to and then getting that information at an interim basis on say primarily safety that is really what contributed to our decision making.","Jeff Leiden","Yes, I can take the second part. This is Jeff Leiden. And that I think I actually like the way you said. I think you should think about 661 as the foundation for multi-drug regimens going forward because of its pharmaceutical properties. And that its best attribute if you will. Now we\u2019re going to find out more about what it does in some of these populations from the Phase III certainly not from 12-week study because of course there were no headwinds [ph] for example and no 551Ds in that 12-week study.","But number one is it really has pharmaceutical properties that allow us to make combination regimens including the three-drug regimen which is going to be so important I think in the headwinds.","With respect to the ATR, yes, you\u2019re right, this is a DNA repair pathway and so the hypothesis here is that by simultaneously disrupting a DNA repair pathway, while you\u2019re also providing DNA damage to the cell in the form either cytotoxic chemo agent or radiation. You\u2019re going to potentiate the radiation of cytotoxic chemo agent and that will be the real basis that which we\u2019ll look at the drug rather than looking at it by itself.","Matt Roden","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Bernstein.","Geoffrey Porges","Thanks very much. And hope you guys both warm and free of snow up there now. I wanted to ask a couple of more questions about 661. Could you give us a sense of the \u2013 your expectations enrollment of the trials, knowing [indiscernible] or is it realistic that any of these trials could give us read out that you will disclose by the end of the year or should we be expecting them to all come next year?","And then we sort of seeing to be dancing around this Phase IIb efficacy results, but when my bat [ph] come. And then lastly related to that Jeff could you comment on the pharmaceutical properties of what you\u2019re seeing in the next gen corrector. Do you have optimized candidate there or you just sort of really establishing proof that you can target the particular half way that you\u2019re going after?","Ian Smith","So, Geoff thanks for it. I\u2019ll take the first question in terms of timing of results from the pivotal Phase III program and then also the 12-week study VX-661 that\u2019s currently ongoing. Firstly, just chronologically, the 12-week study that\u2019s currently ongoing, we anticipate towards the end of the first quarter we\u2019ll provide you top line data from that study. I\u2019ll just reiterate that Jeff has mentioned that it is a small study primary endpoint to safety and lot of the data that we\u2019ve gathered around 661 already has provided with the green light heading to this broad Phase III program. And I\u2019ll also add to that data was discussed with the regulatory authorities to allow proceeding to that Phase III program.","As far as the timing of the results from the phase III program, we would anticipate 2016, will provide with a more clear update once we get an understanding of the rate of recruitment to the studies, but we don\u2019t anticipate results within 2015.","Geoffrey Porges","Great. Then the second corrector?","Jeff Leiden","So, I think that really I think as we\u2019ve talked about we\u2019re really focused on those markets both driving the efficacy but also having the pharmaceutical properties that are going to allow to be used in the three-drug regimen. That\u2019s really our goal. And we do have as we\u2019ve talked about multiple compounds in lead up. Exactly what those properties are going to be it\u2019s really \u2013 to you actually already and we\u2019ve tested them in the clinic. I think it\u2019s really too early to say.","Geoffrey Porges","Okay. Thanks very much, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI.","Mark Schoenebaum","Hello gentlemen. Thanks a lot for taking the question. I had reasonably simple question, when I look at the design that you\u2019ve chosen for Phase II trials, I\u2019m particularly struck by the design of the heterozygous men population where you plan to enroll 270 patients, mainly serves that\u2019s only about half the size of the traffic and trans \u2013 each of the traffic and transport trials which were adequately powered trials in and of themselves.","So presumably the power of 270 patients to this CB benefit is substantially less than it was in traffic and transport. If I were the company designing a trial and choosing that I would interpret that as having great confidence. I\u2019m going to see a big benefit. Why am I correct or incorrect in that line of logic so to speak?","And then, finally just a follow on the Phase IIb coming out for the 661 combination. Is there reason biologically or study design wise and the length is different just to assume or postulate that the data, the FEV data would be significantly different from the roughly 4.8% improvement and absolutely we saw in the prior experience. Thank you.","Jeffrey Chodakewitz","Hi. So, its Jeff Chodakewitz, so again in terms of the ongoing Phase II study with 12-week, we really just can\u2019t comment, that is in a interim analysis and we are \u2013 as Ian just said, we\u2019re going to really have the results at the end of the first quarter.","In terms of your question around comparing the 661 admin study versus traffic and transport, I do thing there are couple of very important considerations that differ between them. One is that in the traffic and transport we had two doses in that study, which obviously complicate the sizing of studies and that\u2019s a very big difference and we are very pleased to be able to focus on one dose as we move 661 into Phase III.","The other piece of that is that another consideration and important consideration in attracting transport that is was around secondary endpoint and being able to detect secondary endpoint. The 661 study and the admin population is really focus and powered around [Indiscernible] so it does explains the differences that you were noting.","Mark Schoenebaum","And why wasn\u2019t that paradigm secondary and then I\u2019ll drop back in the queue. Thanks.","Jeffrey Leiden","So again I think that we also have the study in I believe homozygous patient that is powered both in terms of size and duration for those secondary endpoints and we think that\u2019s really going to be able to anchor our program and so that\u2019s how we construct to be the program overall.","Mark Schoenebaum","All right thanks a lot. Great job, congrats.","Jeffrey Leiden","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Deutsche Bank.","Mohit Bansal","Great. Thanks. This is Mohit Bansal filling in for Robyn. Thanks for taking my question. Moving aside from cystic fibrosis and looking at your pipeline, you have asset in oncology and neospace [ph] could you please help us understand your strategy with these asset. Do you expect to develop these indications in house or you think partnership or out licensing is the way to go. I guess my real question is do you see these assets as non-core assets or your core asset? Thanks.","Jeffrey Leiden","Thanks for the question. I think as you, its Jeff Leiden as we outlined our strategy a couple of years ago which is to make transformational medicine for very serious diseases with large unmet need and scientific opportunity. And so if you look across our pipeline whether it\u2019s in neurology or whether it\u2019s in oncology each of the programs fulfilled those criteria in different sorts of layers. So it is our strategic assets. In terms of plans for how to commercialize them obviously we\u2019ll be able to make detailed decisions once we begin to see clinical data from Phase II and Phase III studies, but we are very confident that these kinds of asset, these transformational assets are high value assets for the company and they do fill with our corporate strategy.","Ian Smith","And Mohit I would just add that we faced this question a lot when we engage with investors and analysts. And it appears as though there is always a category that we want to fit these assets in including maybe some of our really neurology assets as well. And the categories tend to be you are either in the area or you are not in the area and what I would like to be clear on is that we\u2019re committing to the studies and we want to find out the results and we want to see where there is a potential for this transformational medicine as Jeff Leiden has explained.","But we\u2019re in the area until we got the data and that doesn\u2019t mean that the company is committed to the oncology space for the next 10, 15 years but it doesn\u2019t mean we are committed to these studies in finding out whether we have the potential to create new medicines. And I wish there was a third \u2013 that I could give you but that\u2019s \u2013 we are actually in that third category.","Jeffrey Leiden","Ian and I talked about and we are not an oncology company or a neurology company, we are transformational medicines company and that\u2019s what we are trying to do it here.","Mohit Bansal","This is helpful. Thanks a lot","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Liisa Bayko from JMP Securities.","Liisa Bayko","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. And just to follow-up on some discussion earlier. If we see a better treatment effect, a larger treatment effect in the 661 KALYDECO combo study on the homozygous, by extension does it make us feel like the heterozygous study is going to have more robust effect than with seamless lumacaftor\/ivacaftor, is that the right way to think about it?","Jeff Leiden","Yes. Thanks for the question. I know what you\u2019re trying to get at here in terms of \u2013 will this really read out in the admin study and our impression about chance of success? And the answer is really no. We won\u2019t have single admin patient in this study that they\u2019re obviously the relevant patients and as I don\u2019t think our mind will change in the terms of the risk and the speed of these two approaches we\u2019re going to take. There\u2019s no doubt no matter what we see that the two drug combination is a high risk but more rapid way to get to these patients who today the don\u2019t have any therapy.","There\u2019s also no doubt in my mind that the three-drug combination from everything we\u2019ve seen, the much higher probability approach, but unfortunately its going to take us a bit longer.","Liisa Bayko","Okay. Fair enough. And then can you maybe talk about the presentation of the combo, how many pills it would be and sort of what would be the packaging be roughly for the lumacaftor\/ivacaftor combo?","Jeff Leiden","Yes, Liisa. So the presentation is a fixed dose combination, so you\u2019ll take the 400 of lumacaftor that\u2019s combined with ivacaftor. You\u2019ll take that in the morning and then 12 hours later you\u2019re also taking fixed dose combination tablets than as well. So it\u2019s completely co-formulated product.","Liisa Bayko","And then just final question from me on the trajectory that you anticipate for the combo, can you maybe compare or characterize how we should think of it compared to what we saw for G551D population? Thank you.","Ian Smith","Yes. Great question, Liisa. So in terms of the destination if I can describe it that way in terms of the overall level of update we\u2019re anticipating. We expect the level of uptake, the peak penetration if you want to think that way to be very high for the lumacaftor\/ ivacaftor combination based on the things that you already know. It\u2019s incredibly serious disease.","The F508del mutation is a serious form of disease and there aren\u2019t another treatment options currently available that treat the underlying cause of the disease. And so everything we know about the profile of lumacaftor and ivacaftor and the reaction you have had from patients and providers since Phase III data became available is very positive","So we\u2019re expecting the peak uptake to be very significant. In terms of the rate of uptake I\u2019m anticipating its going to be lower than with G551D and really that\u2019s just driven by the sheer volume of patients. I think about here in the U.S. there\u2019s about 1000 G551D patients they are treated about 250 to 275 CF centers that\u2019s on average three or four patients per center.","You think about the F508del homozygous population 12 and above is about 8,500 patients, so nearly an order of magnitude greater. That\u2019s more like 30 patients per CF center on average. And so just the sheer volume of patients and the efforts that goes into initiating a new patient on therapy, the education, the counseling, navigating the reimbursement, process is going to take a significant amount of time and this is the sheer volume of patient I think its going to lead to the absolute rate of uptick to be somewhat lower than we saw with G551D which as you well know was virtually vertical.","Liisa Bayko","Great. Thanks for taking the question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ying Huang","Thanks for taking my question. So, can you categorically talk about the futility analysis after the first 120 patients will be enrolled in the headwind cohort, what would be hurdles for you to continue to enroll the 150 patients? And then I think you made comment before that maybe shall we assume that the 12-week trials of that cohort in case we would not be low enough to capture any benefit in weight gain or exacerbation reduction, is that the right assumption? Thank you.","Ian Smith","So its \u2013 let\u2019s talk about the futility analysis which I think really reflects what we\u2019ve been talking about in terms of the low probability for the population with the two drug combination. We don\u2019t have an exact final rule that we\u2019re going to use, so we can\u2019t specifics. But let me take a moment and walk you through how it\u2019s going to work to put it in perspective.","As you noted that we are going to roll about 120 patients in the initial cohort. We\u2019re going to then pass enrollment and clinical data from those patients will be collected and be reviewed by the DMC. We won\u2019t actually even Vertex be seeing that will be conducted independently by the DMC.","And the goal of that is actually to assess the probability whether we can actually know from that amount of data that it is low probability unlikely that that combination is going to be beneficial for the patients.","If that\u2019s the case the SMB will tell us and we\u2019ll stop the study. If they see something that we cannot conclude that then we will restart enrollment and complete the study. And that\u2019s really the way it\u2019s going to rollout. I would also note that the \u2013 even if the study continues we don\u2019t know fore sure and we really won\u2019t know that the study is going to be positive until we get to the end. It\u2019s just that at that interim point, do we have enough information already to know that it\u2019s not working, that\u2019s the way the analysis is structured.","And then your other question about the pulmonary exacerbation and so forth, we will certainly collect that data, we\u2019ll look at it. There\u2019s a different between saying that we have size study to fully power for versus that we will try to look and get all the information that we can out of this value.","Ying Huang","That was very helpful Jeff, can I just ask one follow-up. When the futility analysis conducted, is it at the end of 12-week or in the interim?","Jeff Leiden","We haven\u2019t gotten to those details, but again its going to be and its of course going to depend on the rate of enrollment as well when we get to that 120, we have get the patients through some of that, get collect the data and allow time for the DMC to do the analysis.","Ian Smith","And Ying it gives me the opportunity to help you understand with disclosure around this as well, so we do not anticipate that there will be a disclosure top line or anything around the futility analysis at least positive. We\u2019ll just continue to expand that study and recruit more patients, so that we will not making that announcement.","The only announcement that you would hear around this futility assessment is if it was negative than we had said this, and we decided to curtail the study, and so before the question comes that our plan of disclosure around this as well.","Ying Huang","Thank you, Ian.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from Wells Fargo Securities.","Brian Abrahams","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions, commercial question on ivacaftor\/lumacaftor, it seems as if there\u2019s a large number F508del Homozygous patients under age 12. And I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019ve gotten a sense as to whether clinicians might treat any of these patients age 6 to 11 at launch and whether the drug might or the combo might be reimburse and when you have the results of that upcoming Phase III in patients age 6 to 11 and potentially expand the label into this younger population?","Ian Smith","I\u2019ll let Jeff Chodakewitz answer the question on the timing of the study in the 6 to 11 population. In terms of whether we might see usage in that population post approval now that\u2019s really very much a decision of the physician and the patient, but you raised one of the most important limitations there which is likely to be whether it would be reimbursed and given that the speciality products like CF products are managed with a pretty rigorous prior authorizations to the label my anticipation would be that it would be relatively few patients if any who are likely to be able to get access to the product until we\u2019ve got an FDA approval for that here in the U.S. That\u2019s not to say that certain patients and that physicians may seek to appeal that with their payer [ph] I\u2019m sure that will happen but I think it\u2019s likely to be a very small number who actually are likely to get reimbursement after the launch later this year.","Jeffrey Leiden","And it\u2019s Jeff,[Indiscernible] just to follow up. I think it\u2019s really too early until we see what the rate of enrolment is for the to predict when the studies would be completed and be able to try out. I will note that there is a little bit of a difference as you probably remember between the U.S. and Europe and there is a smaller study, its focused primarily on pharmacokinetics and safety to support piling and ultimately approval in the U.S. while Europe has historically required larger studies with independent FXC [ph] data, so just to set the stage that the timing in the two areas will likely differ.","Brian Abrahams","That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks so much.","Michael Partridge","Operator, we have time for two more questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Hassemar [ph] from JPMorgan.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey good afternoon guys thanks for squeezing me in. Most of my questions were asked already, but I have two quick ones for you. So first of all with the launch of the 809 KALYDECO combo expected later this year, what kind of impact do you expect this to have on enrolment in the Phase III study of 661 in homozygous patient if any. Do you open more sites in Europe to avoid a disruption given the different timelines there?","And then secondly I\u2019m also curious how much of an impact FX has on your 2015 KALYDECO guidance? Thanks.","Jeffrey Leiden","Hi, so it\u2019s Jeff I\u2019ll take the first one. One of the benefits of actually being able to accelerate the start of the 661 program particularly the homozygous study is that we do plan to enroll patients in the U.S. but we think now are starting this coming month. We are going to be able to get enrolment completed and actually hopefully have patient well into this study. So we don\u2019t, we think that that\u2019s really very consistent and then we can manage those issues. And we don\u2019t see it as a big breadth [ph]","Going to the FX question I know it\u2019s much a broad topic at this point. We actually gave guidance back at JPMorgan beginning of January we looked at the spot right to that point. We then did look to see what the ex U.S. revenues that were at potentially at risk to currency fluctuations. We don\u2019t see a big impact to our revenue line, we have a hedge program for our ex U.S. revenues both hedge against those revenues but also the natural hedge here for our investments in the different countries as well. And so we don\u2019t see a big impact to the revenue line because of that hedging program and we also compared it \u2013 at the beginning of the year.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of [Indiscernible]","Unidentified Analyst","Well thanks very much. I have a question on expense thanks for the color. But given the development cost I think it was $570 million to $600 million mostly for CF. Could that line item potentially decline in 2016 and so Phase III you may have mostly completed 661?","Jeffrey Leiden","Thanks for the question, Howard. It helps me talk more broadly about let\u2019s say the direction of our operating, our expected direction of the operating investment. Clearly there is a great expectation on our revenue line which is significant growth. But as we look at the operating expense line moving from 2014 into2015 but then onwards we see this increase from 2014 into 2015 as I described in my remarks earlier today and that\u2019s because we are doing effectively two phase three studies through a long a lot of 2015. But then also we are supporting the launch of ivacaftor\/lumacaftor to treat many more patients. And those are driving the increase between 2014 and 2015.","However, as we look at 2015 into 2016 and 2017 we see a relatively little additional cost and the reason for that is because the company is now starting to move into a steady state. And when you look at all the different aspects of the company that drive the resulting operating expense we start becoming a steady state in the \u2013 we are committed to our levels of research. We like what we\u2019ve got going on in research, we like the product and the production of the molecules that comes from our research investment.","Our development pipeline or our clinical pipeline is phased now Phase I asset through to Phase III assets and we expect that to continue to roll so as a Phase III program comes to an end we had hoped that a Phase II program enters Phase III. So it rolls and then as far as the SG&A is concerned well our infrastructure is already exists to support the company at the scale it is and as Stuart has mentioned with the launch of ivacaftor\/lumacaftor we are building out commercial infrastructure globally but that starts to hit steady state as well this interpretations that we think we will treat in the future.","So it helps you understand why we look into 2016 and 2017 and talk about controlling of the operating expense once we make this increased investment from 2014 to 2015. For that reason bringing it back with a growth of a revenue line we do believe that in future years and the successful launch of ivacaftor\/lumacaftor that we do actually turn the profitability and growth in earnings and cash flow. And we look to high operating margins.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you very much.","Jeffrey Leiden","Thank you very much. That will conclude our call. We appreciate everybody joining us tonight. The Investors Relations team is going to be available tonight on [ph] the call if you have additional questions. Have a good evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. And you may now disconnect.

Actual outcomes and events could differ materially.","I will now turn the call over to Dr. Jeff Leiden.","Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Michael, and good evening, everyone. 2018 is an important year for Vertex, and in the first few months of this year, we have continued to build on our established track record of innovation to discover, develop and deliver transformative medicines to more people with CF. The approval of SYMDEKO, our third disease modifying CF medicine, offers many patients an important new treatment option. In particular, for those F508del homozygous patients who never started or who discontinued ORKAMBI.","The SYMDEKO launch is off to a strong start in the U.S. and we anticipate approval in the EU in the second half of this year. Today, the number of people eligible for one of our approved CF medicines has grown to 34,000 worldwide and about half of these patients are currently on treatment. With the launch of SYMDEKO as a new treatment option and the completion of additional reimbursement agreements outside the U.S., we are positioned to see continuing significant revenue and earnings growth in 2018 and beyond.","Our belief that we can treat many more patients in the future as well as to further enhance the benefit of CFTR modulators is based on our rapid progress in developing triple-combination regimens that include a next-generation corrector. Earlier this year, we announced that we had initiated Phase 3 studies to evaluate VX-659 in triple combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor in two groups of patients, those with one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation, and those with two F508del mutations.","The first sites are open for the Phase 3 study in patients who have only one minimal function mutation, and we have begun to dose patients in that study. Today, we also announced the start of Phase 3 development for our second next-generation corrector, VX-445, as part of a triple combination regimen in the same groups of patients that we're evaluating with VX-659. This marks important progress toward our goal of advancing two different next generation triple-combination regimens to allow us to choose and bring forward the best regimen to people with CF as quickly as possible.","We're also making important progress in our research and development pipeline beyond CF. We are preparing to begin clinical development of CTX001, an investigational CRISPR\/Cas9 Gene Editing Treatment in two devastating diseases, beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease with our partner, CRISPR Therapeutics.","We also continue to make important progress with the selective NaV1.8 inhibitors VX-150 and VX-128 for the treatment of pain. We look forward to generating additional data from ongoing studies of these potential pain medicines to inform future development plans.","In 2018, we also expect to move one or more potential medicines from our internal research programs into clinical development in other disease. I look forward to updating you on our continued progress during the year.","Tonight on the call, I'm pleased to have with us Dr. Reshma Kewalramani, our newly appointed Chief Medical Officer. Reshma joined Vertex in 2016 and her depth of medical knowledge, paired with her experience and proven track record as a clinical leader, make her an ideal successor to Dr. Jeff Chodakewitz, who will remain with us through early 2019 as a senior adviser as he transitions to his planned retirement. I'd like to personally thank Jeff for his extraordinary leadership and dedication to improving the lives of people with CF and other serious diseases.","I'll now turn the call over to Reshma to review the status of our CF clinical programs in more detail.","Reshma Kewalramani - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff, and good evening, everyone. Tonight, I'm very pleased to review our progress in advancing VX-659 and VX-445 triple combination regimens into Phase 3 development and to share the initial results for once-daily triple-combination regimens that include VX-561, a once-daily potentiator.","First, to the VX-659 triple-combination regimen. During the first quarter of 2018, we announced the initiation of two Phase 3 studies of VX-659, tezacaftor and ivacaftor, as an investigational triple combination regimen for people with CF. The first study is evaluating the VX-659 triple-combination regimen versus placebo in approximately 360 patients ages 12 and older who have a minimal function mutation. A schematic of this design is shown on slide seven.","The key feature of this study is that the efficacy assessments at four weeks and a safety assessment through 12 weeks will form the basis of a potential NDA submission. The 24-week assessment will generate data on key secondary endpoints as well as safety. But these data are not required to complete the NDA submission. As Jeff mentioned, sites are open, patient enrollment in the study has begun and the first patients have been dosed.","A second study will evaluate the VX-659 triple-combination in approximately 100 F508del homozygous patients ages 12 and older. The design of this study is shown on slide eight. The key features of this study are a four-week run-in where all patients receive tezacaftor and ivacaftor and then a primary efficacy assessment after four weeks of additional dosing where VX-659 or placebo is added to tezacaftor and ivacaftor.","To support a regulatory submission in the U.S., to treat the F508del homozygous population, we anticipate using the four-week efficacy data from this study in conjunction with 24-week safety data from the study in F508del minimal function patients.","Data from these studies of VX-659 will also be used to support planned regulatory submissions in Europe and other regions.","Turning to VX-445. Today, we announced the initiation of two Phase 3 studies of the VX-445 triple-combination regimen for patients with CF. The study designs are similar to the Phase 3 program I just discussed for VX-659 and are shown on slides 9 and 10, respectively. We recently obtained results from the non-clinical toxicology studies for VX-445, and we expect the FDA's review of these data prior to the start of our Phase 3 studies.","Initiating Phase 3 studies with both VX-659 and VX-445 gives us the opportunity to generate data for two different triple-combination regimens and pick the best regimen to bring to patients as quickly as possible. In addition to evaluating each triple-combination regimen in the studies I just discussed, we also plan to evaluate each of these triple-combination regimens in patients who have a gating or residual function mutation. Earlier this year, we announced Phase 2 results from VX-445 in F508del minimal function patients that support advancing VX-445 into Phase 3 studies for that population.","Today, we are reporting the initial Phase 2 data for VX-445 in triple combination in F508del homozygous patients. Once again, the efficacy observed was impressive and the safety profile of VX-445 was similar to that observed in previously reported parts of this study. This Phase 2 study evaluated VX-445 or placebo in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor for four weeks after a four-week run-in of tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor.","In the patients who received this triple combination, we observed a significant improvement in lung function of 11 percentage points over what was obtained with tezacaftor and ivacaftor alone. This improvement was evident by the second week of the treatment period and sustained through the four-week dosing period. These data are shown on slide 11.","The VX-445 triple combination was generally well tolerated and the safety profile is consistent with what we've learned previously with this regimen. Today, we are also reporting the initial results for the once daily potentiator, VX-561. When dosed as part of a triple-combination regimen with VX-659 or VX-445 and tezacaftor in people with one minimal function mutation.","In these Phase 2 studies, mean absolute improvements in ppFEV1 of 11.7 and 12.2 percentage points from baseline through week four of treatment were observed for the VX-445 and VX-659 triple-combination regimens, respectively. The once daily triple-combination regimens were generally well tolerated and the safety results were consistent with what we have observed in triple combination studies that included ivacaftor.","While we believe that the results clearly support the hypothesis that VX-561 has a role in future once daily triple combinations, the FDA has requested additional dose ranging for VX-561, including potential evaluations of monotherapy before allowing evaluation of VX-561 in late-stage development. We look forward to updating you on our progress with our triple-combination regimens as we advance these programs.","I'll now turn over the call to Ian.","Ian F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Reshma and good evening to everyone. 2018 is off to a strong start and tonight, I'm pleased to review our first quarter 2018 financials, the SYMDEKO launch in the U.S., and our 2018 full year financial guidance.","Revenues first, total CF product revenues of $638 million in the first quarter of 2018 represent a 33% increase compared to the $481 million we recorded in the first quarter 2017. Our total product revenues have continued to grow each quarter as we increased the number of patients treated with our approved medicines. Today, we estimate approximately 34,000 patients are eligible for our medicines of which about half are being treated. We expect the eligibility in the number of patients we treat to continue to grow throughout 2018, and therefore continue to drive revenue growth.","I'll make some brief comments on SYMDEKO launch in the U.S. Since the FDA approval on February 12, we have been educating healthcare providers on the medicine, and working with payers to secure reimbursement. We are seeing broad coverage and access to SYMDEKO, as the majority of commercial and government payers are reimbursing for the medicine.","For the first quarter 2018, we reported SYMDEKO revenues of $34 million, which reflects the initial seven weeks of sales. We continue to prepare for the anticipated approval of this medicine in the EU in the second half of 2018.","Our first quarter 2018 non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses were $360 million compared to $313 million in the first quarter of 2017. This increase was primarily due to the advancement of our portfolio of triple-combination regimens for CF and the investment to support the treatment of patients with our medicines globally.","Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $196 million compared to non-GAAP net income of $101 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in non-GAAP net income was largely driven by the strong growth in total CF product revenues.","During the first quarter 2018 we also strengthened our balance sheet as we ended March with approximately $2.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities compared to $2.1 billion at the beginning of this year.","Now turning to the guidance, we continue to expect full year 2018 total CF product revenues in the range of $2.65 billion to $2.8 billion comprised primarily of combined revenues from countries where our three approved medicines are currently reimbursed. The midpoint of this range represents approximately 26% growth over 2017 driven by the launch of SYMDEKO and an increased number of patients treated with our approved medicines.","As we have commented on previous calls, we are focused on total CF product revenues in our guidance, given that some patients on KALYDECO and ORKAMBI will switch to SYMDEKO. The timing and the amount of the switching is not yet known.","We believe the overall growth of CF product revenues is the most important metric because it reflects revenue growth from treating more and more CF patients. We also continue to expect combined non-GAAP, R&D and SG&A expenses of $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion.","The key investment drivers are the execution of pivotal studies for two triple-combination regimens, supply chain investment for the potential commercial success of a triple-combination regimen and the incremental investment to support the launch of SYMDEKO.","Our financial profile has strengthened significantly over the past two years. Our continued execution across all parts of our business has positioned us to deliver sustainable revenue and earnings growth and to continue to expand our operating margin in 2018 and beyond as we significantly increase the number of patients we treat with our medicines.","With that, I will open the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Leerink. Your line is open.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much for taking the question, and congratulations on the strong results. The only surprise really is that you're not going ahead with a pivotal trial with VX-561, and I wonder if you could give us a little bit more understanding as to the basis for the FDA's decision. It seems a little unusual given that it's just one of the isomers of \u2013 well, actually it's only a deuterated version, I beg your pardon, of KALYDECO. What's the basis for that caution? And should we assume that that same standard of single drug dose finding is going to be applied to every potentiator that might potentially enter the class?","Ian F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Hey Geoff, it's Ian. Maybe we could actually separate that question into two parts, which maybe we have Reshma talk about the data and Jeff Leiden talk about how we intend to incorporate VX-561 into our regimen as we go forward. I would remind you, back in earlier this year, we look forward to getting results from VX-561. It was pending data and pending discussions with the FDA and maybe we can give you a little more insight into that. So Reshma, do you want to talk about the data first, and then Jeff on the strategy to incorporation?","Reshma Kewalramani - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sure, sure. So, as you know, in both the VX-659 and the VX-445 proof of concept studies, we had one part that included VX-561 in place of ivacaftor. And let me walk you through the results in terms of efficacy and safety. On the efficacy side, as you heard in the prepared remarks, we had an improvement in ppFEV1 of 11.7 and 12.2 percentage points, respectively, for VX-445 and VX-659. Really impressive results that we were very pleased with.","On the safety side, the results were remarkably similar to what we've seen in our ivacaftor studies. And when we looked at these results, both on efficacy and safety, we were very impressed with what we saw and impressed with the consistency of the safety profile. Jeff?","Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yes. So Geoff, as you said, we've got those results, and obviously, you need to have the Phase 2 results before you go and discuss Phase 3 design with the FDA, which we did over the last several weeks and months. And it became clear to us that the way the FDA was looking at VX-561 despite the fact that, as you say, it's really a deuterated version of KALYDECO is that's a new chemical entity. And the kinds of information they're asking for, for instance, some of the dose ranging and potential monotherapy is exactly the kinds of things that they would typically ask for a new chemical entity, particularly before it goes into a combination regimen. And so our decision was \u2013 because our goal has always been to get the best regimen to patients as quickly as possible, we decided to move forward with VX-445 with KALYDECO because that's the quickest route and we didn't want to take a delay.","Having said that, I also think that the decision was probably a bit influenced by the fact that KALYDECO has been so well studied in so many thousands of patients and, frankly, it set a very, very high bar, both in terms of efficacy and safety. And so they have a lot of comfort with it, and that made it, I think, easier to enable us to move forward more quickly with that regimen.","Having said all that, as Reshma said, the data for VX-561 is quite compelling. We do plan to take it forward into a once a day regimen. We're still in discussions with the FDA about exactly what data they are going to need in some of these, Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies. But we think that's highly doable, we just don't want to wait. So as soon as we know that, we'll progress those studies and we'll work out a bridging strategy that allows us to bring VX-561 along with either VX-659 or VX-445 whichever one we choose to patients.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks for that background. I appreciate it. I'll get in the queue.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey guys and thanks for the questions. I just have a commercial one and then a clinical one. For SYMDEKO, when you look across the O-U.S. approval trajectory including Europe and Australia down the road just what are lessons to be learned from ORKAMBI? Can you help maybe abbreviate the process, reimbursement process I'm speaking about, and then I have a couple of follow-ups on the clinical side.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Hey, Geoff. Thanks for the questions. So on SYMDEKO ex U.S. what can we learn from our experiences with ORKAMBI. Obviously, in many countries we've been successful with getting ORKAMBI priced and reimbursed and, clearly, we'll be looking to build on those successes.","In some of the markets where we haven't yet secured reimbursement for ORKAMBI, which we continue to very, very actively pursue, we have also begun discussions with some of those authorities about potential portfolio like agreements where we may be able to get accelerated access for patients to SYMDEKO.","Obviously, those discussions with ORKAMBI are very, very active, and obviously, with SYMDEKO they'll pick up more steam, when as we anticipate we get the approval ex U.S. certainly in Europe in the second half of this year.","What I would stress though, Geoff is that we're not kind of waiting for SYMDEKO, and then only really going to try and get reimbursement for SYMDEKO. That's not how we're thinking about it. As you know, patients with CF have a relentlessly progressive disease.","We know that treating them as early as possible is incredibly important, certainly with disease modifying agents like ORKAMBI. And so, we're continuing to pursue with every degree of urgency that we can, reimbursement for ORKAMBI.","The other thing to remember, which I think is an important point, is that the SYMDEKO approval is likely to be for people 12 and over. And as you know, in recent years we've expanded the indications for ORKAMBI first to six to 11, hopefully subsequently down to two to five. So ORKAMBI is going to continue to play a very, very important role for those younger children with CF.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And then just on the \u2013 that's helpful. Thanks Stuart. And then on the pipeline side, when you think about the future triples, beyond VX-659 or VX-445, I get the strategy with VX-561, but what would be the real objective here? Are you guys still actively pursuing more novel combinations in Phase 2? I'm trying to figure out if you have an assay as predictive of FEV1, is it worth it to go into larger studies for just a few points of FEV1? In other words, is there an upper end that's kind of worth your investment or not?","Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. It's a great question, Geoff. As I said before, we have now reasonably large number of additional next-gen correctors that are flowing through research and into late preclinical development. And so the decision that we're going to make, and we'll have to start making it soon because some of those are moving along quickly is, are they significantly better, do we believe than the two that are currently moving forward, VX-445 and VX-659. And significantly better is really the whole profile of the medicine, right? So it's certainly efficacy, but it's also once a day formulatability, dose, for instance, potency. All those things will go into our decision. But at the end of the day, the decision will be if we feel we have a molecule that's significantly better than the other two, we'll take it forward into Phase 1, and certainly into early Phase 2. That's easy and quick to do. If we don't, we won't.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got you. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks. And congrats on the good SYMDEKO launch as well to start off. Two, two part question, I guess. Just to follow up on the whole concept of more dose ranging studies needed for VX-561. I mean, I guess it would seem to be an important read-through to what the regulators are saying on novel compounds. So just to clarify. You're implying that you need to actually prove it out as a full potentiator and run it as a monotherapy program and prove that it's an active potentiator for new compounds. Just wanted to clarify that.","And then the second question was on the Phase 3s that are ongoing, and it sounds like you started dosing patients. I mean I presume that would be pretty fast. So while I wouldn't want you to necessary guide on data, would you actually announce data when it's done after four and 12 weeks, or do you need to file? Just what would be your disclosure policy beyond these Phase 3s that we're all looking forward to? Thanks.","Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, Mike. This is Jeff. I'll take the first part. Maybe Ian will take the second one, was your disclosure question. With respect to the first part, I never comment on what the FDA is going to want for other people's programs. I do think it's informative that they view VX-561 as a new chemical entity, because as Geoff Porges mentioned, it's quite similar to KALYDECO, but clearly different. So I don't think it's unreasonable. Obviously, as compounds get more and more different and newer and newer, I think that they're going to have the same expectations for new chemical entities pretty much across the board, but obviously that's up to them.","Ian F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And Mike, to your question on disclosure, I don't really want to design the disclosure and what we include in that at this point in time. So it will be \u2013 we'll complete the study, we'll gather the data, what does the data inform us in terms of a filing strategy. And I think that's what you could imagine us disclosing. And the timing to that, we'll let you know when we're further into the studies. But as usual, it will be what can we do with the data and we'll provide you that action and we'll provide you the data that supports it. And we'll let you know when we have that.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe ask one on the clinical trial designs for the Phase 3s. You are testing the Phase 3 for homozygous patients in about 100 patients, while you are testing the I guess triple combo in the heterozygous patients in \u2013 I mean, sorry \u2013 the 180 patients for the het\/min trial. So I was wondering if the trial for homozygous patient is sufficiently powered to show superiority in efficacy or it's most likely a supplemental trial to compare the efficacy.","And then secondly, maybe commercial side on the SYMDEKO launch. Can you tell based on early experience, who are the patients taking SYMDEKO today? Are those mostly patients who were not tolerant of ORKAMBI before, or you're seeing also some other patients switching to SYMDEKO? Thank you.","Ian F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Hey, Ying, just before Reshma gives you the answer, I just want to correct one of your points, and we are obviously doing two different Phase 3 trials, one in het\/mins, one in 508, 508 patients. The het\/min Phase 3 study does have 360 patients in, and the 508, 508 Phase 3 study has 100 patients in. And now maybe Reshma can help you understand how the het\/min study will lead and how 508, 508 would follow.","Reshma Kewalramani - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sure, sure. So for each of our programs, VX-659 and VX-445, the programs are actually very similar. So I'll use VX-659 as an example but it's very similar to VX-445. In each program, there's going to be a study of 360 patients total for het\/min patients and 100 patients total for homozygous F508del patients.","Now the 360 patients for het\/min, that comes from a desire that we have to look at things like pulmonary exacerbation which is going to take more patients. With regard to the 508 homozygous study, that is well powered. Indeed, if you just look back at our proof of concept studies, you can see the fairly substantial improvement in things like sweat chloride, ppFEV1 and even CFQ-R.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And Ying, on the SYMDEKO launch, obviously we're just seven weeks into the launch at the end of Q1, but we are able to tell in this early stage of the launch where those patients are coming from. And we're seeing a mix. We are certainly seeing patients transition from ORKAMBI and KALYDECO based on the strength of the clinical data, but perhaps more importantly, we're also seeing use in patients who were not being treated with CFTR modulator prior to the approval of SYMDEKO, and that's really in two areas.","One you mentioned, which is those homozygous who had been initiated on ORKAMBI but unfortunately had to discontinue the medicine. And then we're also seeing use in patients who were na\u00efve, who had never been initiated on a CFTR modulator, and we're also seeing SYMDEKO being used in those. And obviously, those last few patients groups are incredibly important because those are patients who were not being treated with a disease modifying agent prior to the launch of SYMDEKO.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Maybe I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on the couple cases of rash that you saw in the triple combo Phase 2 that you just closed. And just any idea of what sort of agent it might be tied to, and anything you can say on that front? And then, a question for Ian, just on SYMDEKO, can you quantify any inventory for the quarter? Thanks.","Reshma Kewalramani - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sure. So let me start with the question that you had on the clinical side. Where we are right now is that we've completed our proof of concept studies for both VX-659 and VX-445, and what that means is we've treated about 200 patients.","In that 200 patient experience, we have a low incidence of rash overall and the low severity. We have no serious events. These rashes have resolved with discontinuation of treatment or interruption. And interestingly on that latter point we've had a couple of cases where patients have interrupted their therapy for a period and then restarted and completed their course without trouble.","To give you some context for this, KALYDECO and ORKAMBI, the rashes that we're seeing in our next-gen program are very similar in incidence and quality is what's been seen there, and you can look in the USPI and you'll see ORKAMBI is about 7%, and KALYDECO is about 13% or so.","Ian F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Terence, to your question on SYMDEKO, I'd first draw you to the kind of the top line revenues, CF total revenues and comment on that, which is the inventory in the channel at December 31, 2017, was similar to the inventory in the channel at March 31, 2018. So what that tells you is that the channel has remained even between those two periods, and therefore, the revenue number is real demand in Q1.","As to your question to SYMDEKO, there was some slight channel build, but that was offset to some channel decline on KALYDECO and ORKAMBI from December 31 period. In summary, total CF revenues in Q1 were the real demand and it was not channel build.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Thanks very much for taking my questions. I guess, first off, on the triple combo Phase 3s. Obviously, a lot of enthusiasm amongst sites, and we're hearing about sites needing to really filter patients as to who is eligible for the study. So, I guess, my first question is really how are you managing that, operationally, the potential for healthier or more highly motivated patients to come into these Phase 3s and maybe perhaps skew the results or reflect the different population studied in Phase 2. And then I had a quick follow-up on VX-561.","Reshma Kewalramani - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sure. So you know we have the benefit of having worked with CF patients in this community for some time now and executing not only Phase 2 studies, but Phase 3 studies as well, in the patient populations that we're studying now in VX-659 and VX-445. And the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the discussions with sites, the way that the sites are screening patients and such, are fairly well described, and what we're doing in Phase 3 is similar to what we ourselves just completed in Phase 2. So I feel very good about how the operations are running and the timelines on which we are enrolling these studies.","Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And then, actually maybe a question on VX-445. You mentioned you're awaiting the FDA review of non-clinical tox. Just wondering if you could say whether there was any \u2013 were any notable observations there or if that's just a box check? Thanks.","Reshma Kewalramani - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sure. You know that the preclinical talks, the chronic talks results are standard fare. We've looked at it. We don't see anything in there, but of course, the agency has to review that.","Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks so much.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Company","Good afternoon. Congratulations on the progress and thanks for taking my question. First, one question on VX-445 and the homozygous data. It did look like there were some liver enzyme elevations in that study. Is there anything to be concerned about there? Or are those rates similar to what you've seen for other agents in the past?","Reshma Kewalramani - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sure. So we've looked at the safety, as you can imagine, in great detail. And no, we don't see anything interesting or different there, very much what we've seen with our other trials.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Company","Okay. And then, second on the QD regimen and when it can move forward. Do you have a rough sense of how long the dose exploration that you need to do will take? Is that something that you think you could finish in 2018, or is this possibly a multi-year process?","Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. We're still in discussions with the agency, and so it's a little too early to give you a precise answer. I think we'll know very soon. And when we do, we'll let you know what the plan is. But most of what we're hearing about is fairly straightforward so far. But until we finalize those discussions, I don't want to give you precise timelines.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Company","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, great. Good afternoon. I thought I'd change it off and ask about the CRISPR program for a second. So you've mentioned and I think CRISPR has mentioned that you filed the CTA, you've gotten one approved. It sounds like some are still pending. Can you just talk a little bit about what the next steps are in terms of starting dosing and what items are left pending to get the other CTAs approved and open some more sites?","Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, Matt. This is Jeff. Thanks for the question. Maybe just to give folks a little background. I know you're aware of this. We're actually planning to study CTX001 in two related but different diseases, beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease. Beta-thal, we submitted multiple CTAs, as you mentioned, for beta-thal, one of those has been approved. And we expect to begin dosing later this year for beta-thal in Europe.","In the U.S., we are on track to file an IND for sickle cell disease and we'll also file outside the U.S. And again, depending on exactly when we do that, we anticipate starting dosing soon thereafter. So my hope is we'll be dosing in both diseases this year, and that should allow us to start to generate some data in patients.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks.","Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","As you know, it will likely be the first gene editing trials in people. We're pretty excited about that.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And I would just actually add to it. We are very excited that it's the first gene editing trials in patients. But I'll also say that this one came from a collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics. Part of, let's say expansion and growth opportunity is how we form these collaborations and give us product opportunities, and I just want to say that we're very happy with that collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics, the progress we've made there, and the partnership to progress this opportunity towards the clinic is, pretty exciting for us at this stage in a very different disease than CF.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Shawn Fu - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys, this is Shawn on for Cory. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking my question. Just another one maybe on the once daily. So understanding that the absolute difference for VX-445 and VX-659 was similar, but when looking at the placebo adjusted data for VX-659, it looks to be quite a bit better, at least on ppFEV1, since the placebo did quite poorly. Maybe if you could just comment on that.","And then, did this contribute at all to the decision not to move directly forward with VX-445 in the once daily. Just kind of thinking that given the 240-milligram dose for VX-659 is being used for the other trials, was there maybe a desire to look at the specific dose rather than the 400 before making the final decision in addition to all the things that the FDA is asking for?","Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, thanks for the question. Actually, as we look at the data, the thing that's impressed us most, Shawn, is the consistency of the data. It's pretty remarkable to me to see four to six different Phase 2 trials with different agents and different combinations that are all generating almost identical results, not only in terms of ppFEV1, by the way, but in terms of sweat chloride, in terms of CFQ-R, et cetera. And it's obviously very important that these are placebo-controlled studies and that we're seeing statistical significance in very small numbers of patient.","So I guess, our interpretation is what's remarkable is the consistency across the board between different regimens. We don't see a difference between VX-561. Any of those small differences are really just due to the patient numbers. And so, no, that didn't drive any of our decision-making nor do I believe it drove the FDA's decision-making about how to proceed with VX-561. It's really just a matter of their view that this is a new chemical entity and their desire to have the appropriate early data set before we move into Phase 3 and we'll get that.","Shawn Fu - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then sort of just a modeling question. Can you maybe refresh our memories on the breakdown for the number of residual function patients worldwide? It looks like the number of residual function mutations listed on their KALYDECO and the SYMDEKO labels are about the same, 16 for KALYDECO, 17 for SYMDEKO. So kind of just based on your announcements in conjunction with the approvals for KALYDECO in residual patients, it looks like there should be about 1,500 patients that are currently covered ages 2 plus for KALYDECO in the U.S. Just wondering roughly how many patients is this for SYMDEKO given that this in 12 plus and then how many additional residual function patients are there O-U.S.?","Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So Shawn, we'll get back to you after the call. You did ask for the \u2013 just want to make sure what your ask was. You want to know the total RF patient population. We'll get back to you after the call on that.","Shawn Fu - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough. Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Dane Leone with BTIG. Your line is open.","Dane Leone - BTIG LLC","Hi. Thank you. Congrats on starting the studies. I wanted to ask kind of follow-up to an earlier question. Regarding the rash appearance generally in your commentary about seeing it in around 13% of patients with KALYDECO. I was just curious, could you elaborate any more in terms of the safety profile that you're seeing with VX-561? And is there any reason to think that the extended half-life of the molecule could exacerbate some of the safety profile that we've seen with KALYDECO? Thank you.","Reshma Kewalramani - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sure. So when we looked at the data from VX-561 in either the VX-659 program or the VX-445 program, what we see is real consistency with regard to efficacy as well as a safety profile.","Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And just to be clear, as Reshma said before, both the incidence and severity of rash are very low here. They're similar to what we've seen with the other medicines. And as you know, that hasn't in any way affected the uptake or utility of those medicines. So we're very pleased with the overall benefit of this profile.","Dane Leone - BTIG LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carter Gould with UBS. Your line is open.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Congrats on the quarter results and impressive data. I guess two, I guess, for Jeff. Now that you got clarity on the Phase 3 design and entering a little bit more of a execution phase right now, any shift in focus or attention on the BD front? And then just on the VX-445 once a day combo, just the quality of life data, the placebo arm looked a bit anomalous. Maybe you could just add some context around that. The active arm seemed relatively consistent with the prior studies. Thank you.","Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, thanks for the questions, both good questions. First one on BD. Really, there isn't a shift. As Ian said in his prepared remarks, we have been accelerating, revving up our BD efforts for the last several years with the same consistent strategy around CF platforms and early-stage transformative products.","We continue to look and be very active in that space. You can expect to see us to do more deals similar to the ones that we've done already, say, with a CRISPR or Moderna, Parion, et cetera. And because we have more firepower, we have more flexibility in terms of the size of those deals. And so some of them may be even larger than the ones we've done already. So I don't think there's really a change, but there's certainly a very active effort. It's just part of our focus on diversifying our pipeline beyond CF, both through internal research and external collaborations or acquisitions. Maybe, Reshma, do you want to comment a little on the placebo arm and the CFQ-R?","Reshma Kewalramani - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sure. So as we looked at the CFQ-R results across VX-659 and VX-445, actually across all the doses that we studied, and in all the populations that we studied, what you see is big double-digit improvements in CFQ-R. In the study, the one VX-445 study, you rightly point out that there's anomaly in the placebo group. In essence, there are two patients that are just plain different and that difference is what drove that CFQ-R value there. But you're right. It's an anomaly and it comes from two patients out of eight, small numbers.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alethia Young with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on all the progress. One on the NaV1.8, the VX-150, I just wanted to talk a little bit more about your strategy there. I know you have the data. Where do you plan on presenting it, and how do we think about moving forward in the Phase 3 and commercializing? And then just kind of also, can you just talk about if there's a preference at this point between true M&A or kind of doing more partnerships like you've done in the past. Thanks.","Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yes, this is Jeff, Alethia. Thanks for the questions. With respect to pain, as we said before, we don't really think about pain as one disease. It's multiple diseases that are a little bit different, inflammatory, acute, neuropathics, et cetera. Nor does our pain program have one compound in it. We have VX-150, as you know, for which we have positive data in both OA and in acute pain. We have VX-128, which is a fast follower that we're also very excited about. And I'd also remind you that in pain, both oral formulations and IV formulations are important, particularly for acute pain.","So this is sort of a complicated chess game where we have to decide what's the best medicine for the best indication and the best formulation out of our pipeline, which is growing. And the way we're doing that is to do some exploratory studies in Phase 2 in these multiple indications. And I think we should have the data from those later this year and early next year. And that would allow us to make a decision about how to move forward.","And I know some folks have asked me, wasn't that going to slow you down, actually assertion would be it's going to actually speed us up, because if we do Phase 2 correctly and we really understand the right dose, right medicine, right disease, and right formulation, it's going to allow us to move much more quickly in Phase 3. And we're particularly excited about that because, obviously, in areas like acute pain, we're sitting in the middle of this horrible opioid epidemic. And if we can demonstrate new oral agents, for example, that have the potency of opioids without the addictive potential, we think there's going to be a very favorable regulatory environment. But we want to make sure we have all the data. We need to take advantage of that.","Ian F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Alethia, I'll take your second question, which is I'll first say that M&A versus licensing, we just view those as a tactic in terms of execution. And so, as Jeff said earlier, we have three broader strategies in how we think about the outside world to Vertex and that is look at everything in CF to see whether it complements our own approach.","Secondly, to have the possibility of expanding our scientific footprint beyond small molecules and maybe beyond gene editing now. And then secondly \u2013 thirdly, sorry, what product opportunities are there. And if those product opportunities come in the way of licensing or M&A, again, that's just a tactic of how you incorporate those into the company.","To Jeff's comment earlier, also, we do have more capital available today. As you saw in first quarter, we added close to $500 million of capital. We went from $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion of cash. We have no debt. So we do have more capability today to add to our pipeline.","The question is also, do you think you're going to get involved in large M&A, and utilization of our own share count? No, we don't believe that. We're focused on more earlier stage, high science ideas. As a company, we have lots of growth in front of us with CF, and that's what our focus is in trying, in terms of driving revenue growth and capital accumulation. And we'll look at earlier stage opportunities in other disease areas.","Michael Partridge - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, this is Michael Partridge, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Certainly. And our last question will come from Robyn Karnauskas with Citi. Your line is open.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and don't worry my kids are not in the closet this time.","Unknown Speaker","We look forward to that on every call, Robyn.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I know even though there's bring your kid to work days, I saw that ironic. So I guess, the first question is just a follow-up, where you were asked about what exactly, when will we see the data. You're saying when you complete the study, you'll assess. When you say complete, is that four weeks or could that be 12 or could that even be 24? Just a sense of like what do you find as complete? And how do you keep those placebo patients on the triple placebo for het\/min?","And the other question I had was, you had a great quarter of SYMDEKO, what are you thinking about in the back end like reasonable assumptions can get you above your guidance. So I was just kind of thinking when you see a great, strong, robust seven weeks of sales, how can you temper expectations going it to the back of the year? And that's the reason why you didn't raise guidance this quarter?","Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Robyn. I'll echo that I'm glad you didn't lock your kids in the closet again. So firstly to \u2013 your first question, just to remind you that the het\/min study, which is the lead study with VX-659, our anticipation is that we'll provide you the data based on what we expect to file upon.","And so when you look at the design of that study as a four-week efficacy endpoint to the 12-week safety endpoint. So we would want it to run through the 12 weeks because that's the basis of the filing. So you'd anticipate that we would run through that period of at least 12 weeks. We would collect the data. We have to obviously analyze it. And we'll provide a disclosure on the VX-659 study in the het\/min patients, which would complete using the four and 12-week data.","As to your question regarding revenue expectations, we reiterated our guidance on the call tonight, $2.65 billion to $2.8 billion. We did have a strong first quarter. We've got to see how the year progresses. We have built in growth into that guidance. The main growth, we do anticipate, will come from those markets that we see that are already reimbursed from all three products and the main growth in terms of adding patients we see will be through SYMDEKO.","And so we're holding on our guidance at this point in time, and we'll see how the year goes and potential drivers of growth outside our guidance could be getting some of the markets where we're not currently reimbursed, actually reimbursed and launching in those markets, and we'll update you at that time.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great.

You've joined the Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated First Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference may be recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Michael Partridge. Sir, you may begin.","Michael Partridge","Thank you, operator, and good evening, everyone. Joining me on tonight's call are Dr. Jeff Leiden, Chairman and CEO; Dr. Jeff Chodakewitz, Chief Medical Officer; Stuart Arbuckle, Chief Commercial Officer; and Ian Smith, Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda tonight is as follows, Jeff Leiden will begin by reviewing Vertex' strategic business priorities for 2014. Then, Jeff Chodakewitz will review our clinical progress on cystic fibrosis, including the results of the study of VX-661 in combination with KALYDECO in G551D, F508del patients. Dr. Chodakewitz joined Vertex at the start of 2014 and we are happy to have him join us on this and future calls. Next, Stuart will discuss KALYDECO product revenues and provide some commentary on the outlook for KALYDECO growth in 2014. To close, Ian will review the financial results and discuss our updated financial guidance. Joining us for Q&A are Dr. Bob Kauffman and Dr. Peter Mueller.","We plan for the call to run for a total of 1 hour. [Operator Instructions]","This conference call will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in detail in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our 10-K and 10-Q. These statements including, without limitation, those regarding the performance of KALYDECO, our development plans and expectations and our guidance, are based on management's current assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and events to differ materially. Information regarding our use of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is available in our first quarter 2014 financial results press release. This press release is on our website, and I would also refer you to Slide 4 of tonight's webcast. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Jeff Leiden.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Thanks, Michael, and good evening, everyone. Vertex is, in many ways, a company in transition. We have made cystic fibrosis a clear focus of our business and we've made a decision to no longer invest in hepatitis C. At the same time, we're continuing to invest in early-stage research to identify compounds in CF and other areas that could become transformative medicines for patients with serious diseases, as well as opportunities for Vertex growth. This transition in Vertex business represents our continued execution against 3 strategic priorities for 2014. I talked about these priorities earlier this year, and I'd like to review them again now.","First, focus on driving forward our cystic fibrosis development programs to enable the launch of multiple transformative CF medicines globally. Our clinical and commercial teams have made significant progress in CF already this year. For example, we have expanded the U.S. KALYDECO label to include additional patients. We have now completed dosing in the Phase III studies of VX-809. We have recently received orphan status for VX-661, and we are today reporting positive clinical results for the study of VX-661 in patients heterozygous for G551D and F508del. Second, continue to invest in research. Internal research is a critical growth engine for Vertex, and we expect that it will produce more transformative medicines to provide sustainable growth in the future. And third, maintain financial strength so that we can continue to invest in the discovery and development of our new medicines.","We ended the first quarter with more than $1.3 billion in cash and with KALYDECO revenues of approximately $100 million that we expect to grow through the year and in future years. This financial position supports our investments for future growth. Our goal in CF is to treat as many people as possible and to enhance the benefit for those that we treat. Jeff Chodakewitz will give you more detail on our recent CF clinical progress. But before I turn the call over to him, I would like to acknowledge that today marks the start of CF Awareness Month and we recognize all of the patients, families, doctors, nurses and caregivers who are involved in the treatment of CF. Thank you for your continued support as we seek to improve the lives of more people with this devastating disease. Our continued progress in CF clinical development is a strong sign that our commitment to people with CF is unwavering.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff.","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","Thanks, Jeff, and good evening. It's a pleasure to speak with you all today. I'll provide an overview of some important progress we've made with our 3 CF development programs, specifically, ivacaftor monotherapy, lumacaftor and ivacaftor combination therapy and VX-661 and ivacaftor combination therapy.","Let me begin with ivacaftor monotherapy. Our clinical and regulatory efforts are focused on demonstrating clinical activity in additional patients that may benefit from this medicine. In February, following approval from the U.S. FDA, we began treating patients with 8 additional mutations with KALYDECO. These are all mutations for which in vitro data predicted critical responsiveness to KALYDECO. We've submitted an MAA variation to the European Medicines Agency and expect to receive an opinion from the CHMP for these additional gating mutations around midyear.","An additional mutation for which we are seeking ivacaftor label expansion is R117H. As you may recall, we announced results in December from a Phase III trial in this population. We did not achieve statistical significance in the primary endpoint for the overall population of this trial, but ivacaftor did produce a statistically and clinically significant improvement in FEV1 and other measures in a prespecified subpopulation of participants 18 years of age and older. We plan to submit an sNDA and MAA variation for people with CF, ages 18 and older, with at least 1 copy of the R117H mutation. The sNDA submission is planned for midyear, with the MAA variation to follow in the second half of 2014. We expect to continue our discussions with the FDA following our sNDA submission. We estimate that there are more than 700 patients, aged 18 and older, worldwide with the R117H mutation.","We also believe that ivacaftor may be able to help other patients who have residual CFTR function. We are conducting a proof-of-concept study in these patients, and we are on track to report results later this quarter. In our view, a successful result in this study of approximately 20 participants would lay the groundwork for pivotal studies of ivacaftor in patients with residual CFTR function.","Finally, we expect to report results from our pediatric safety study of ivacaftor use in 2- to 5-year olds with gating mutations in the third quarter, while patients in the pediatric study who have completed 24 weeks of treatment have now progressed into the rollover study.","Moving to our lumacaftor-ivacaftor combination program. The 6-month dosing period is complete for the Phase III TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT studies in patients, aged 12 and older, who are homozygous for the F508del mutation. We are on track to report 24-week results from these studies around midyear. If these studies are successful, we expect to file an NDA and MAA later this year. In TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT, we are seeking to demonstrate a statistically and clinically significant improvement in absolute FEV1, the primary endpoint of the study, and also benefit in important secondary endpoints, including weight gain, pulmonary exacerbations and CFQ-R. We estimate that our studies are more than 90% powered for absolute improvement in FEV1 of 3% from baseline compared to placebo at week 24.","In addition to lumacaftor, we are developing another first-generation corrector, VX-661. Our principal strategy with VX-661 is to develop it as part of a future triple combination therapy with a next-generation corrector and a potentiator. Dosing has begun in our 12-week study of 661 plus ivacaftor in patients 18 and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation. We expect to enroll approximately 40 patients who will be treated with 661 plus ivacaftor or placebo. Our goal of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of 661 plus ivacaftor over a longer duration of treatment. If successful, this study would be enabling for future development of VX-661 from use in a triple combination or potentially to progress it as part of a dual combination.","Today, Vertex announced results from a proof-of-concept study of the corrector 661 in combination with ivacaftor in CF patients who have achieved 551D mutation on 1 allele and the F508del mutation on the other allele. The basis for exploring the VX-661 plus ivacaftor combination in this population is based on in vitro observations from HBE cells, in which adding VX-661 to ivacaftor improved chloride transport. The purpose of the trial was to see if the improvement in CFTR function that we observed in the lab could translate into a signal of clinical efficacy in the G551D, F508del heterozygous population. We dosed VX-661 as 100 milligrams daily in patients who were already taking 150 milligrams of KALYDECO twice daily for an average of 1 year. We were testing this clinical hypothesis for the first time and we're not sure if we'd be able to detect the signal. The patients that we enrolled were G551D patients who had already been receiving commercial KALYDECO and, therefore, were likely to have already seen a significant clinical benefit from taking this medication. Also, the study was small. We enrolled just 18 patients. And the duration of therapy was short, just 28 days, for which VX-661 would be added on top of ivacaftor. The results do, in fact, show a clear signal of efficacy. There was a mean 4.6 percentage point absolute improvement within group in ppFEV1 through 28 days. The relative FEV1 improvement was 7.3%. These improvements were both statistic -- were both statistically significant. We also saw a small reduction in sweat chloride on treatment within group, with a p value of 0.053. FEV1 and sweat chloride returned toward baseline in the 4 weeks following completion of the 661 treatment period. These off-treatment effects were statistically significant within group as well. In this study, 4 patients already receiving KALYDECO were randomized to placebo to maintain study blinding. From a safety perspective, the regimen was generally well tolerated over 28 days and all 18 patients completed the treatment period. The most common adverse events in the treatment group were pulmonary exacerbation, headache and upper respiratory tract infection. And we expect to present more details on these results at a medical meeting in 2014.","For us, there are really 3 important takeaways: first, once again, in vitro data with our CFTR modulators has been predictive of a clinical benefit in the specific patient population; second, correctors like 661 appear to be clinically active on a single F508del allele; and lastly, these results suggest to us that treatment for heterozygous patients may be further enhanced with CFTR modulators that are tailored toward each allele. Based on the data announced today from this study and pending the results of the 12-week study, we could decide to develop VX-661 as part of a dual combination for certain heterozygous patient groups. Also based on these data, we plan to discuss with global regulatory authorities the potential approval pathway for VX-661 in combination with KALYDECO for people with CF who have the F508del mutation and another mutation known to respond to KALYDECO alone.","In summary, I'm pleased with our progress with our CF development programs and I look forward to updating you throughout the year. With that, I'll turn it over to Stuart.","Stuart A. Arbuckle","Good evening, everybody. Tonight, I'll report our first quarter product revenues and outline our expectations for KALYDECO revenue growth in 2014.","KALYDECO generated $100 million in worldwide net revenues for the first quarter, including U.S. sales of approximately $56 million and international sales of approximately $44 million. This represents an increase of 61% from revenues of $62 million that we reported for the first quarter of 2013. The reason for the decline from the $109 million that we reported in the fourth quarter of 2013 was the favorable impact of stocking and other nonrecurring business adjustments in the fourth quarter that we discussed on our quarterly call in January. We continue to see a very similar level of underlying demand and strong patient adherence to treatment. We expect KALYDECO revenues to grow through 2014, beginning in the second quarter, based on the following anticipated key factors: first, label expansion. Since receiving approval from the FDA in late February for 8 additional mutations, we are seeing strong uptake similar to what we saw in patients with the G551D mutation. We expect uptake to continue as we seek to reach the vast majority of the approximately 115 newly eligible patients in the U.S. by year-end. We have filed an MAA variation with the EMA for a similar label expansion and currently anticipate approval in the second half of 2014. Following EMA approval, we will seek reimbursement for these new patients, both in countries where KALYDECO is already formally reimbursed, such as France, and in new countries like Italy where, because there are so few G551D patients, the medicine has not yet been formally reviewed. There are approximately 250 eligible people with these additional mutations living in the EU. Our second key factor of KALYDECO growth is geographic expansion from securing public reimbursements in Canada and Australia. The reimbursement process is unfortunately taking longer than we and, more importantly, people with CF wants it. Reimbursement discussions in both countries are active and ongoing and our goal remains to get this transformational medicine to all eligible children and adults as quickly as possible. There are approximately 300 people with the G551D mutation in Canada and Australia, and we know they and their families are anxiously awaiting a positive outcome from these discussions.","To summarize, we expect label and geographic expansion to enable us to grow our KALYDECO revenues beginning in the second quarter and continuing throughout the year. This growth is reflected in our KALYDECO net revenue guidance, which we are maintaining. I look forward to updating you on our continued progress throughout the year, and I'll now turn it over to Ian.","Ian F. Smith","Thanks, Stuart, and good evening to everyone. Tonight, I would like to discuss our current financial position, our first quarter 2014 results and our updated 2014 financial guidance. During the first quarter, we've further prioritized our development activities toward cystic fibrosis. Our financial results and guidance reflect this prioritization. As we entered the second quarter, we are a business primarily funded by CF revenues and a strong cash position. We are investing in the discovery and development of medicines for CF and the creation of new medicines in other areas.","Now to our cash position. We finished the quarter with over $1.3 billion in cash. This balance sheet strength, combined with the expected growth in our KALYDECO revenues, supports our business investment and still allows us to exit 2014 with a strong balance sheet. We continue to manage this cash position as the priority, as it enables the transition of our business to growth and profitability driven by our CF medicines. An example of our prioritization to protect our financial strength is shown by our decision not to proceed with VX-135 in hepatitis C, amending our arrangement with Alios and our decision to out-license the compound. This is all reflected in our updated 2014 financial guidance that I'll discuss in a moment.","Now to the first quarter 2014 results. We generated $108 million in total non-GAAP revenues in the first quarter. $100 million of this was KALYDECO. Based on our decision to end further investments in hepatitis C I've announced this evening, the HCV-related revenues, totaling approximately $10 million, are excluded from non-GAAP revenues.","Now to our operating expense. Our first quarter total non-GAAP operating expense was $234 million, down $41 million or 15% from Q1 2013. The first quarter non-GAAP operating expense includes $182 million of R&D expenses compared to $195 million in the first quarter of 2013, and $52 million of SG&A expenses compared to $80 million in the first quarter of 2013. These reductions of 7% and 35%, respectively, reflect our commitment to prioritization towards the CF medicines and the protection of our financial position.","Our GAAP net loss for the first quarter was $232 million or $1 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP net loss was $151 million or $0.65 per diluted share.","Turning now to our financial guidance and, firstly, our revenue guidance for the full year 2014. We are maintaining our KALYDECO guidance of $470 million to $500 million that we provided earlier this year. Achieving this guidance depends on 3 key drivers of growth: the continued uptake for the 8 additional mutations in the U.S. and achieving reimbursement for the G551D patients in Australia and Canada, and the approval for other additional gating-type mutations in the EU. With the exclusion of our HCV revenues, we are revising our total non-GAAP revenue guidance to be in the range of $520 million to $550 million. This range includes some revenues for the potential R&D collaborations. Based on our move away from HCV and further focusing our investment towards CF, we are reducing our operating expense guidance. We now anticipate 2014 non-GAAP operating expenses to be $890 million to $930 million. Additionally, I would just note that Q1 non-GAAP OpEx for R&D and SG&A provide a reasonable basis for modeling our expenses during the rest of the year. Total spend may decline slightly towards the end of the year based on clinical development activities.","In summary, we are committed to completing 2014 with a strong balance sheet and managing our operating expense at a decreased level compared to prior years, while we grow our CF revenues.","With that, I'll ask the operator to please open the lines to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Geoff Meacham of JPMorgan.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got a couple on the 661 KALYDECO combo study. I'm assuming that the patients on the placebo arm on just KALYDECO monotherapy were stable. Are you -- that data isn't in the slide, but I'm assuming that, that is largely unchanged over the evaluation period.","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","Geoff, so it's Jeff Chodakewitz. I think it's important to step back and say why those patients were in there. It's really -- it was only 4 patients, as we mentioned, and they were really there for blinding. So we really focused on the within-group analysis that you saw. It wasn't really intended as a controlled trial with the placebo group. They were just there sort of maintaining the integrity of the blind.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I see. Okay, that makes sense. And then does this data change your view ultimately about the need for a second corrector? And I joined the call a little bit late, so I wasn't sure if you guys gave an update on the next-gen corrector behind 661?","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Geoff, it's Jeff Leiden. I think our view of 661, first of all, has been enhanced by this data. We're learning about as we progress 661. And I think from this trial, we learned a couple of things: one, that it's possible to correct a single Delta 508 allele, at least, to these patients with a G551D allele; and secondly, you could do that on top of patients who have been stabling on KALYDECO for quite a bit of time. Most of the patients have been on for a year or so, and that was an important finding. I think we're still thinking about 661 as part of a potential triple regimen to get enhanced benefit for everybody that's homozygous and heterozygous. But I think what this data tells us is that 661 may also have a role in certain of these heterozygous patients, and that's worth exploring. And if you'll remember, we talked about this being an interesting trial from that perspective a while ago.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoff Porges of Bernstein.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I just like to follow up on the 661 combination. So first, Jeff Chodakewitz, you mentioned the control group. But could you tell us whether there was a difference in the cough exacerbations and other adverse events between the control group and the treatment group? And then secondly, the G551 patients, are they typical G551D patients? They seem to have a pretty low FEV1 as a starting point in this trial. And then just to push a little bit more, why wouldn't you be contemplating now taking 661 with a standard dose of KALYDECO into a larger study in the homozygous Delta F508s?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","Great. Thanks, Geoff. So in terms of the placebo patients, again, it was really there for blinding. That's really what our intent was. And in terms of the severity, I think that it was a little bit lower as you said, than perhaps what we've seen in some other studies. But I think it is well within the range and the groups were -- it was pretty balanced, and it was really just a -- we think it was really pretty representative of what we've seen in our 551D studies. I'm sorry, your last question was around...","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes. Why wouldn't you...","Stuart A. Arbuckle","Make sense of 661, Jeff, and whether we'd consider going into a larger study for the Delta F508 homozygous?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","Yes. So I think for us, really, we think we're just getting this data. We really have to understand it a little bit better, it's early days. We also have the ongoing 12-week study for 661 and ivacaftor in the F508del homozygous population. And what we're going to do is really step back when we get those results and really say what's the right path forward for 661.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank.","Alethia Young - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Alethia for Robyn. And just another 661 question, but just curious if this information that you have about 661, how does this change your perspective on acquiring or looking at complementary assets for your CF program?","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Jeff is going to take that question in terms of our portfolio approach.","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","Yes. I think we've said all along that we want to continue our leadership position in CF, and that's going to come in 2 forms. One is to continue to develop our expanding portfolio of medicines, so not only 809 and 661 but next-gen correctors, which we think are going to be very important in both expanding the region, expanding the benefit. But the other thing is we have a very active, as you can imagine, ongoing surveillance program of all of the potential, other assets out there in CF. And we'll continue to watch that and make sure that we're either partnering, acquiring or doing whatever we can to get the best regimens we can in combination with our drugs.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum of ISI Group.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to -- on the placebo issue, would you guys be willing to characterize behavior? I know it's only 4, but would you guys be willing to characterize the behavior of the 4 placebo patients? Maybe give us some reassurance that they didn't behave as well as the treated patients or something like that? And then my second question was -- in the data where you removed the drug, were both drugs removed, or was that just 661?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","Great. Thanks, Mark. So sure, let me try to give you a little more color. Again, it's 4 patients. I'd say that what we observed in those patients was really that there were modest shifting around. It was variable, as you'd expect, in this disease with 4 patients getting placebo. And it was very typical of what we've seen in general with smaller cohorts of patients receiving placebo. So hopefully, that gives you a little better flavor of that.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So modest would not be 4.6% on an absolute basis, I would imagine?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","Correct, it's modest changes. So I think that the -- the other piece, in terms of the study design, was really that we started and then stopped the VX-661. KALYDECO, which our patients were receiving in a marketed setting, was continued throughout the study. And in the follow-up period, they just stayed on their KALYDECO.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Mark, it's Jeff Leiden. We've obviously had a number of questions on this and on the placebo group. And maybe let me take a step back, if you will, as I often do on this Phase II data, and tell you how we look at those data, which is we always look at the entirety of the results, and we try to look at it from every direction to see if we're seeing a consistency of the CF, we're seeing statistical significance. I guess when I look at this data, the thing that is very convincing to me is that when you start by looking at what we saw in the lab themselves, which was this additive effect of 661 on KALYDECO in exactly these cells, G551D, Delta 508, that again has translated into what we're seeing in the clinic. And obviously, now with 5, 6, 7 trials, relate that with the in vitro results, translates into in vivo results. Then we saw the on-effect when we added 661 to patients who were stable on KALYDECO and, honestly, with only 14 patients, surprisingly, we saw a statistically significant on-effect. And then, of course, the off-effect is important. So we removed the 661, left the patients on KALYDECO, and we saw a statistically significant decrease. And that pattern, I think in a Phase II trial, is always very important. And then, finally, correlated with sweat chloride, which always gives us confidence that what we're seeing is an on-mechanism effect. So when I look -- when I walk around the trial and look at it from all perspectives, I see a consistency of statistical significance and this nice correlation from in vitro to in vivo. I think that's what's really gives us the high level of confidence.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Yee of RBC Capital.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A quick question. First, I will ask a question not related to placebo, which is in your ongoing TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT study, I know they're still thinking about secondary endpoints and Wall Street's looking at how to evaluate that. Have you done any work around correlating waking and exacerbations and how that correlates to FEV1 effects? Obviously, we know what the results were in the KALYDECO monotherapy studies and the effects there and what that translated to for waking and exacerbations. But given potentially less effects in the Del 508 homozygous population, how do you predict what would happen there, or we're flying a bit blind? Then I have a follow-up.","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","So it's Jeff Chodakewitz, let me take a start at your question. I think -- I don't think we looked recently, at least, in a formal way, correlations between these different measures. But I do think you raised a couple of important points. First of all that we have to really understand the totality of the disease and, really, we're assessing the benefit for patients on all of those endpoints. It's really not just about any one of them. But as you imply, it's really about understanding all of them and understanding the pattern and seeing what benefit the drug brings. We do have a set of secondary endpoints that we have preplanned and prespecified, and that's going to include a number of important outcomes like BMI, as you're talking about, in terms of pulmonary exacerbations, as well as patient-reported outcomes like CFQ-R. So we're really going to take a good look at all of that and take the time to really understand all the results.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then a follow-up is -- I'm sorry, I have to sneak in one more on the placebo, but I mean these patients in the study, they knew it was a randomized study versus placebo. They didn't know the exact randomization. I'm just trying to think about how much placebo effect there really would be given the randomization of 7:2?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","Right. So people did -- were informed, of course, that it was a placebo-controlled study. Patients do, then they form a consent. But as is the intent, we were very careful with the placebo so they would not be able to detect which one they were on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First, just was wondering on the -- again, I'm sorry to go back to the placebo group in the 661 combo trial. Can you give us any sense of the sweat chloride data in those patients? I know you said it was -- that it sounds like the data bounced around a little bit. But just wondering if you could characterize that on a basis versus what you saw in the treatment group. And then maybe just remind us, I know you guys changed the endpoint of the Phase III combo study for KALYDECO-809. Can you give us maybe give us some background there? What drove that decision?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","Sure. So again, in terms of the sweat chloride and the placebo patients, it was quite -- it was variable. There were modest changes. Again, very typical of what you'd expect to see with a small number of patients receiving placebo. And that was true across all the metrics.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Receiving KALYDECO as placebo.","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","Sorry, yes. Well, they received placebo on top of KALYDECO. So in terms of the Phase III endpoint change, just so I -- just maybe so I'm clear, which -- can you say a little bit more about which aspect of that, that you wanted me to comment on?","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sure, just -- I think you guys had switched from a relative to an absolute improvement on SAE and was just wondering again what drove that decision.","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","Right. So we think, in fact, both measures are important. We -- specifically shifting to absolute was based on a request that we got from the FDA, but we are going to have relative as a key secondary measure. So that's really the basis for our change.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Abrahams from Wells Fargo.","Brian Corey Abrahams - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","The first question, on biology, do you believe that the increase in group FEV1, the 661-KALYDECO study, is due to enhancement of the G551D-CFTR function or an action of the combo on the F508-CFTR? And then just another question on the placebo. I'm sorry about that. But I realized the study wasn't powered or designed this way, but if you were to do a statistical test on the 661 group versus placebo, just given the variability you described for the placebo and the statistical significance on the in-group different for the drug arm, would it be safe to say that placebo-adjusted mean FEV1 improvements would've also been statistically significant?","Peter R. Mueller","It's Peter speaking. I answer the biology question. And so the belief that we have in there is some in vitro trial that justifies that this -- that adding a corrector to the mix enhances trafficking of the CFTR protein to the surface. So part of the additional increase in activity that you see here is basically enhancing the amount of CFTR protein to the surface. Now when it is on the surface, it also gets potentiated by KALYDECO. So therefore, you get basically a double effect, sort of enhancing, trafficking and...","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Well, I think, Peter, the question was do we believe the effect was predominantly on the G551D allele or the 508 allele? And we believe the effect is predominantly on the 508del allele from everything we've seen in vitro.","Peter R. Mueller","That's correct.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","And Jeff, do you want to take that second question?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","Yes. So I actually think that probably we've covered this quite completely. I think that the -- we think that the important analysis that we've talked about and that Jeff Leiden referred to is really the within-group analysis and both in terms of the sweat chloride and FEV1, the on and the off.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ying Huang of Barclays.","Ying Huang - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So first of all, can you tell us -- you plan to file the R117H indications here. Is that based on the recent feedback from FDA and also EMA? And then secondly, also, I noticed that in this trial, you only tested 100 milligram dose for VX-661. Have you determined that that's going to be the dose you will take VX-661 forward, going to a potential pivotal trial? And then lastly, KALYDECO, can you talk to us about the underlying demand by, for example, bottles decent [ph] in 1Q over 4Q last year? And also, maybe patients on therapy even though we know there's inventory drawdown out here.","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","So it's Jeff Chodakewitz, let me take the first couple of those and I'll pass it on to Stuart. In terms of the R117H, we can't comment on our discussions with the FDA, or speak on behalf of the FDA, as we presented, we think that the data coming out of that study in -- for the patients who are greater than 18 was both statistically and clinically significant, recognizing that we did fail on the primary endpoint. And we plan to file based on that analysis and we'll have ongoing dialogue with regulatory agencies. In terms of the dose of 661, it was very early in our program. That was the dose that we studied. But I don't think we're in a position yet to say that we've decided on what VX-661 dose would be.","Stuart A. Arbuckle","And on the revenue. The fourth quarter of 2013 was inflated by some one-off business adjustments. The first quarter was negatively impacted by some of those same impacts, such as increased stocking in the fourth quarter. The underlying patient demand is absolutely rock solid and was very similar in terms of total patients, in terms of compliance, persistence and all those sort of things between the 2 quarters.","Operator","We'll go to the next question from Howard Liang of Leerink.","Howard Liang - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","I have a couple of questions, one science question, the other one, commercial. In the lab, can you remind us, did VX-661 have a bigger effect in the G551D, 508del heterozygous cells or F508 homozygous cells? I guess, how do you think about the difference between G551D, 508 heterozygous versus homozygous? Why a positive signal that you saw here may or may not have read through for the upcoming TRAFFIC\/TRANSPORT studies?","Jeffrey M. Leiden","So Howard, it's Jeff. And we don't mean to imply that this signal has implications directly that we can read out in the upcoming TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT. So if we -- if you heard that, that's certainly not our implication. We believe that there's a lot of data that supports the upcoming TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT results from the in vitro data to the in vivo data, and that's really where our confidence comes from for TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT. And what we did learn here, and I think was very, very important, is the patients who were stably treated on KALYDECO, with all of the benefits they get on the G551D allele, will also have 508 on the other allele, can see enhanced clinical benefit by treating -- by adding in a corrector. And that was obviously the big question on our minds, could you translate that out into an improvement in FEV1, once you've already fully treated the 551D allele? And I think the answers from the study is clearly yes. And that does have implications for how we think about developing 661, but not the TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT.","Howard Liang - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Can I just follow up? I guess why wouldn't you have a readthrough to TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT?","Jeffrey M. Leiden","The readthrough that we have -- we had before, right, in other words, we know that corrector plus potentiator is effective in patients who have Delta 508 alleles, and we've seen that in 809 in multiple studies, I think 5 Phase II studies, and we've seen it now with 661. So I guess, if you said we have yet 1 more study that shows a corrector plus a potentiator can enhance 508 function, yes, it does. But I think we had a lot of evidence there. Where we didn't have a lot of evidence is, what happens when you add a corrector on top of KALYDECO in a 551D with 1 508 allele? We just didn't know what was going to happen, and that's really what we learned from this trial.","Howard Liang - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. It makes sense. Can I just follow up on -- commercially, I think most G551D patients have delta 508 on the other allele. So when you add 661 to KALYDECO, do you expect to realize more revenue per patient? And do you think the market can bear a higher cost than KALYDECO?","Stuart A. Arbuckle","So you're correct about 70% of them have 508s on the other allele, the G551D patients. In terms of pricing, much too early to talk about that. We literally just got this data in the last few days. The thing we're really excited about is the fact that we appear to be able to be bringing additional benefit to the patients who are already doing well on KALYDECO, but that's about the maximum take-home, I think, you can take right now. It's really much too early to comment on what pricing implications that may have.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Roden of UBS.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So if you integrate everything you know about the correctors, all the preclinical and clinical data, do you have any basis for thinking about how the benefit, assuming there is one, changes over time once you get out past 4 weeks? So we have 2 4-week observations of combination therapy. So I'd like to get your thoughts as to whether or not you think there's a basis for believing the benefit can increase, stay the same or maybe wane as you go out to 24 weeks past the full week readout? I know we have to do the experiment, but I'm just wondering if you have a basis for a view on that?","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Yes. I wish I could give you a real data-based answer, I just can't. At this point, what we have is 4-week data. And that the only relevant piece of data I can give you is what we know about KALYDECO, right, which is now we have multiple years, up to 4 or 5 years with some patients, and some of which has been recently published, in which we're seeing a tremendous stability of the response starting at 2 weeks and going up multiple years. But obviously, that's KALYDECO, that's a potentiator. And unfortunately, we just don't have longer data than that. But we'll see the first evidence when we file this year our TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT. And then as Jeff said, I think the 661 plus KALYDECO 3 months' trial is going to be very, very important. First, obviously, for safety, but also because it's the first time we're going to see that 3-month data with 661. And rather than speculate, I'd rather just show you the data when we have it.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then on the multiple sclerosis, remyelinating program, I think you previously described this as further along in your other pre-clinic programs. Just wondering if this is something we could see in the clinic this year?","Stuart A. Arbuckle","So Matt, I think you asked the same question on the last call as well. But yes, we do have a program in this area. It is early and there will be a time when we'd give you more information on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Liisa Bayko of JMP Securities.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","You talked about now exploring regulatory pathways for the combination of 661 and KALYDECO in sort of that ideal situation where you have someone that responds to KALYDECO on one -- an allele that responds to KALYDECO and another allele that's 508 -- I'm sorry, another allele that's -- yes, 508. Can you maybe talk about what the patient population size is for that, just so we can have a better sense?","Jeffrey M. Leiden","So there's 2 ways to think about that, right? One is in the G551D patients, where I think Stuart mentioned before somewhere between 65% and 70% or so of patients who are G551D on one allele or 508 on the other allele. So that's directly applicable to what we showed today. The other one though would be KALYDECO -- other KALYDECO responsive alleles, such as gating and residual function. And so, I think the math is a reasonable thing to do is to assume around 65% to 70% of all of those patients with the KALYDECO responsive allele on one side, we'll have 508 on the other side. The thing we don't yet know is what is really the numerator there, how many of all those residual functions are going to be responsive to KALYDECO. And that's what we're going to figure out as we begin to get the results from these NF1 trials. Did that answer your question okay?","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","It does.","Michael Partridge","Operator, I think we'll take 2 more questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Skorney of Robert W. Baird.","Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess the only thing I'm questioning, I sort of thought this was going to be a high hurdle because the patients were already on base one KALYDECO. I would've expected them to be relatively healthy. But just on the FEV1 measurement, I mean, actually it looks like they're sicker than patients who enrolled on the original KALYDECO Phase III study, who were on nothing. So can you just help us put this in context, how sick these patients really were even though they were on KALYDECO and how meaningful the improvement winds up being from the addition of 661?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","So it's Jeff, Brian. I think that the -- first of all, I think it is a high hurdle, as you said, we were not sure given that. And the fact that's very high proportion of patients who get KALYDECO response, we were not sure that we'd able to show an improvement. I think that in terms of the baseline, when we look back, we do see some variability. Again, in terms of where patients end up after a period of time. I think this -- the patients' baseline characteristics here were a little lower, but really not out of the range that we might expect to see. And again, I think the fact that they were on stable KALYDECO for average of about 1 year, as we talked about, that's really, I think, just emphasizes the high hurdle that the small study had for showing a benefit. So -- and that's why we're enthused about the results.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ravi Mehrotra of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Koon Ching","This is Koon actually asking a question on behalf of Ravi. I just wanted to know if you'll comment on the range in the changes you saw in the absolute FEV1 and sweat chloride?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","I think so. No, I really think -- as we said, this is really very early results. It's a small study. We're really going to have to continue evaluating it. We will be presenting the data in a scientific form in the coming year.","Michael Partridge","Thank you.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Now I'll turn the conference over to Michael Partridge, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please begin.","Michael Partridge","Good evening and welcome to Vertex's second quarter 2012 conference call.","Vertex continued to make progress in the second quarter of 2012 to build our global business. With our approved medicines, in its first full quarter, Kalydeco achieved $46 million in US sales, reflecting increased uptake in people with CF who have the G551D mutation. We also announced on Friday that we have received approval of Kalydeco in the EU.","Incivek, for the treatment of hepatitis C, reported sales of $328 million in the second quarter. We continue to lead the market in hepatitis C, approximately 70% to 75% of new DAA prescriptions written in the US are for Incivek. However, the number of patients initiating treatment for hepatitis C has declined compared to late 2011 and early 2012. Therefore, we have revised our 2012 guidance for total Incivek net revenues today.","Highlighting our progress in R&D, in cystic fibrosis, with clinical results and study initiations, we advanced our efforts to be able to expand the number of CF patients we may ultimately treat. And in hepatitis C we today announced promising seven-day viral kinetic data for our first nucleotide analog ALS-2200 that we licensed from Alios BioPharma.","To discuss these and other developments on the call tonight, we have Dr. Jeff Leiden, CEO and Chairman; Ian Smith, CFO; and Dr. Peter Mueller, Head of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer. After the prepared remarks, Bob Kauffman, Vertex's Chief Medical Officer, will join us, and we will take your questions.","We expect to conclude the call as close to 6:00 p.m. as we can manage. To help us do that, we would ask that you please limit your questions to one with a related follow-up.","I will note that information discussed on this conference call includes forward-looking statements which are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in our reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q reports, which have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These statements, including without limitation those regarding the market launch of Incivek and Kalydeco and our guidance are based on management's current assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and events to differ materially.","GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this call. Information regarding our use of these measures and a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP is available in our second quarter 2012 financial press release which is on our website.","Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Leiden","Thank you, Michael. Good evening, everyone.","2012 has been a very dynamic and productive year for our business. During the last seven months we have delivered a series of important advancements. For cystic fibrosis, the approval and successful launch of Kalydeco in the US, m more recent approval of Kalydeco in Europe, and positive Phase II data for the VX-809 plus Kalydeco combination in delta 508 homozygous patients that supports progressing to a pivotal program; and now in hepatitis C, very impressive seven-day viral kinetic data for ALS-2200, our nucleotide analogue.","With these advancements, all made since the start of this year, we are demonstrating our consistent ability to discover, develop and commercialize multiple transformative medicines, which in turn represents a strong foundation for the sustainable long-term growth that we expect to create with our business.","During the last few months I've been working closely with the cystic fibrosis and hepatitis C franchise teams at Vertex. I'll provide a perspective on how we are positioned in these markets and also strategically how we are planning on extending and enhancing our presence in the treatment of these diseases. I'll also highlight for you what I think are the tangible markers for our progress as a business that we will ask you to focus on in the months and years ahead. After that, Ian will review our financial performance, our 2012 guidance and discuss how we're prioritizing investment in our business. Then Peter is going to provide you with a more detailed update on data and recent developments in our pipeline.","Beginning with cystic fibrosis, Vertex is seeking to fundamentally change the outlook for people with this disease, and we have made excellent progress toward the goal this year. Kalydeco, which was approved earlier in the year in the US for G551D CF patients age six years and older, has been rapidly adopted in the US as a groundbreaking new medicine that addresses the underlying cause of the disease in these patients.","The launch of Kalydeco has exceeded our expectations. We are currently treating a significant number of G551D patients, and we expect additional G551D patients to begin treatment in 2012, including patients who are rolling off the PERSIST Phase III extension study. Our field teams have done an excellent job with the launch, working to educate physicians and caregivers about Kalydeco and helping eligible patients and their families get the medicine. Last week we received approval in the EU for Kalydeco for G551D patients, and our team there is working to make Kalydeco available as soon as possible in multiple countries.","We also believe that we can significantly expand the CF population that is addressable with Kalydeco alone. And towards that end, we have initiated additional monotherapy studies that Peter will discuss in his remarks. If our strategy is successful, these studies could increase the addressable population from the current 4% to 8% to 10% of the CF population, and potentially more as we consider the applicability of Kalydeco to certain other people with CF.","During this quarter we also produced clinical data that provided convincing insights into how we may be able to treat a much greater number of people with CF, the homozygous delta 508 population. Specifically, we reported Phase II combination data for VX-809 and Kalydeco, which support moving into pivotal development, targeting delta508 homozygous patients early next year. If successful with these development efforts, we could potentially address 60% or more of the cystic fibrosis population with our different medicines.","CF is a serious genetic disease, and I'm very proud that our team is at the forefront in developing potentially life-changing medicines for patients and their families. We're committed to being a leader in cystic fibrosis and continuing to work closely with the CF Foundation, patient groups, physicians and patients and their families around the world to develop additional breakthrough medicines and to provide hope.","Let me now turn to hepatitis C. We are leaders today in the treatment of this disease, and with the portfolio of novel medicines we have in development, we think we are well-positioned to continue to deliver new regimens to the treatment of hepatitis C. I'll make comments on Incivek's recent performance and near-term outlook. We've learned about this evolving market in recent months and I want to share our thinking in terms of how we're approaching our commercial efforts. I'll also talk about our ongoing plans to develop all oral treatment regimens for the future, which I think is very promising based on today's announcement about our new program.","Let me start with Incivek and two things that have not changed in the first half of this year, Incivek market share and persistence rates. First, market positions.","Incivek has been and remains the leading direct-acting antiviral or DAA. Seventy to 75% of Genotype 1 patients who initiate therapy with a DAA in the Unites States continue to initiate treatment with Incivek. This position, which we have maintained since the launch of the drug, and which we expect to maintain, speaks to strong execution by our commercial team as well as to the benefit that this treatment provides to those with hepatitis C.","Second, persistence rates, that is the number of patients completing 12 weeks of treatment with Incivek. Persistence rates for Incivek remained strong, and this has been consistent since launch, which once again speaks to the benefit of Incivek and the execution of our commercial team. What has changed in this market is the number of hepatitis C patients initiating treatment, which I'll refer to as the treatment rate. This treatment rate is changing faster than we expected compared to earlier this year, and this is the reason for our revised guidance that Ian will talk about during his remarks.","I'd like to describe the pattern that we've observed to provide some perspective for you on the 13 months since Incivek was approved. Soon after launch in the fall of 2011, the annualized treatment rate for all Genotype 1 patients had increased to approximately 90,000 to 105,000 patients per year, due in large part to the influx of warehouse patients seeking treatment with the newly approved DAAs.","During the first four months of 2012, this treatment rate stabilized at approximately 70,000 to 75,000 Genotype 1 patients per year. The guidance range that we set in February and reiterated in April was based upon this relatively stable treatment rate, adjusted downward for anticipated seasonality and potential for fewer patients to start treatment as the year progressed as well as on our stable share of this market and our persistence rates. However, in May and June, the number of people with hepatitis C initiating any type of therapy substantially decreased by 20% to 25% when compared to the first four months of this year.","We attribute this decrease in the overall hepatitis market to two main factors. First, physicians deferring treatment of patients, especially those with less advanced liver disease, following the presentation of multiple sets of mid-stage results for oral combination therapies at this year's EASL conference in April. And second, an increase in the number of ongoing and planned clinical trials in hepatitis C, which has drawn in increasing numbers of patients.","The timing and impact of these factors has been difficult to predict and forecast, especially the deferral of treatment in some patients. Based on this change in treatment pattern, we are adapting our marketing efforts for Incivek and we have also revised our 2012 Incivek revenue guidance. As I mentioned, we believe that expectations of future all-oral regimens are an important factor in the decreased treatment rates we are seeing over the last few months. Therefore, I would also like to provide some perspective on Vertex's potential to participate in the evolution of these all-oral therapies.","Based on the Alios data we reported today, we are moving quickly to develop all-oral regimens for hepatitis C that we believe could make a major difference for patients and be highly competitive as hepatitis C treatment continues to evolve. We're very encouraged by the clinical potency of ALS-2200. The compound has shown excellent tolerability to date. Therefore, we believe ALS-2200 could be a central component for future all-oral combination regimens. Our guiding principle in the development of all-oral regimens is that we want to do what's best for patients.","Our new Alios data, coupled with the evolving regulatory pathways, opens the field for us to pursue multiple options. Our key imperatives with our all-oral development program are, first, evaluate combination regimens with our own DAAs and consider combination regimens with other companies' DAAs. And second, gather as much Phase II data as quickly as possible and in parallel to enable us to pick the best regimen or regimens to take forward into a pivotal program next year.","Most specifically, our approach will be to initiate smaller Phase II studies of ALS-2200 plus multiple other therapies this year to design -- to guide the design of a pivotal trial. Given the many unknowns concerning different all-oral combinations, we believe it will be important to design our pivotal program based upon efficacy and safety data from these Phase II studies. With these Phase II data in hand in the first half of next year, we will then target the initiation of a pivotal program starting in late 2013, which we believe represents the best and shortest duration regimen or regimens for people with hepatitis C. Peter will talk more about our data and our plans in a moment.","In summary, during the last year, we have seen a significant evolution in our business at Vertex. Our teams have produced a series of major clinical and commercial achievements that have markedly enhanced the foundation of the business going forward. These achievements which speak to Vertex's ability to consistently discover, develop and commercialize multiple breakthrough medicines are the foundation upon which we will build a sustainable, growing global business over the years to come. I look forward to updating you as we go.","I'll now turn it over to Ian.","Ian Smith","Thank you, Jeff. Good evening to everyone.","Financially, 2012 is demonstrating that we have a diverse revenue base with multiple sources. These revenues remain significant and are important to enable reinvestments in our pipeline for future growth and value-creation in multiple diseases.","Now to the results. In second quarter 2012, total revenues were approximately $418 million compared to approximately $114 million in the same quarter of last year. The key components of these second quarter revenues are as follows.","First, we reported approximately $328 million of Incivek net product revenues. This reflects a strong April, and then a decrease in the number of new patients initiating treatment, most notably in May and June, as Jeff has already described.","Second, we recorded $46 million of net product revenues from Kalydeco, which reflects the first full quarter of sales since launch in February earlier this year. This reflects strong patient demand, the connectivity of the CF community, and the broad awareness of the importance of Kalydeco. We expect this revenue stream to grow as more people start and maintain treatment with Kalydeco. We have now received approval in Europe to add to this revenue base and provide further growth. We foresee a sustainable, long-term and growing revenue base from Kalydeco.","Third, we received $33 million of royalty revenues, including $28 million of Incivo royalty revenue from J&J. We expect our Incivo royalties will continue to contribute positively to our financial results during 2012 given that Incivo is now available in more than 25 countries.","And finally, we received collaborative revenues of $12 million. These revenues primarily fund R&D activities where we have relationships in the areas of hepatitis C and cystic fibrosis.","The GAAP net loss attributable to Vertex was $65 million in the second quarter of 2012 or approximately $0.31 per share. The non-GAAP net income was approximately $100 million or $0.46 per diluted share. The non-GAAP income includes three charges, $31 million excludes three charges -- my apologies, $31 million in stock compensation, $56 million related to increase in the fair value of the expected future payments under our Alios collaboration following the positive viral kinetic data announced today, and a $78 million charge in the cost of product revenues to reserve against the potential excess Incivek inventory.","And now to 2012 financial guidance. Based on the recent decline in the number of hepatitis C patients initiating treatment, we have revised our 2012 forecast for a total annual Incivek revenues to $1.1 billion to $1.25 billion. This range reflects recent decline in patients initiating treatment, which Jeff noted.","Now, to our operating expenses. Based upon the achievements of multiple successful proof-of-concept studies in cystic fibrosis, HCV and RA, respectively being VX-809 and Kalydeco combination results reported in the second quarter, the viral kinetic results in ALS-2200 announced today, and the results of the X-509 in rheumatoid arthritis last year, we have increased and accelerated our investment into these high-priority programs. These monies were significant.","Despite this increased investment, we have maintained our operating expense guidance for 2012 of $1.03 billion to $1.13 billion, which we provided on our February 2 call. We accomplished this by prioritizing and reducing expenses, specifically with significant reductions in G&A spend and aligning our commercial spend to follow future demand in the markets we\u2019re in. These expense reductions have enabled us to reallocate resources towards and within R&D to support the acceleration of these programs yet maintain our operating expense guidance.","In summary, we continue to derive a significant revenue and cash flow from Incivek sale and Incivo royalties. Kalydeco continues to exceed our expectations, and with the clinical results in hepatitis C and CF, we hope to expand our presence and the number of people we can treat over the long term.","Now with viral kinetic data announced today for ALS-2200, our nucleotide analog for hepatitis C, we have the potential to participate in the high-value HCV market with all-oral combinations. We accomplished all of this while generating earnings and cash flow to end the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion of cash and equivalents.","I will now turn the call over to Peter.","Peter Mueller","Thank you, Ian, and good evening, everybody. My remarks will cover some of the pipeline advances that we have made in recent months, most notably in the areas of CF and hepatitis C. In cystic fibrosis, during the second quarter we announced results from a Phase II study of the corrector VX-809 in combination with Kalydeco. We are very pleased with the results we obtained, and they support the start of a pivotal program early next year.","To briefly summarize the key data again, the top dose of VX-809, 600 mg once daily, showed a mean absolute improvement in FEV1 of 3.4% over the 56-day course of the study compared to baseline, and a 6.7% improvement in FEV1 over the placebo arm for the same time period. Both of these were statistically significant with P values of 0.03 and 0.002 respectively.","To us, the most important data comes from the period between Day 28 and Day 56 which was when the patients were actually receiving VX-809 and Kalydeco in combination. A distinct pattern emerged between Day 28 and Day 56. All the dose arms involving VX-809 and Kalydeco in combination improved over this time period while the placebo arm declined. The 600 mg dose showed the best response of its in-subject mean absolute improvement in FEV1 of 6.1% over this time period with a P value of less than 0.001 and a mean absolute improvement in FEV1 compared to placebo of 8.6%, also with a P value of less than 0.001.","More than half of the patients in the 600-mg once daily arm experienced the greater than 5% absolute improvement in FEV1 during this period. VX-809 was better tolerated as a single agent and in combination with Kalydeco. Adverse events and severe adverse events were similar between VX-809 and placebo groups.","We have analyzed the data many different ways, by dose, versus placebo, versus baseline, and on an individual patient basis. All of these analyses performed in combination with Kalydeco was well-tolerated and associated with significant clinical activity. We expect that the investigators will present additional Phase II combination data at a medical conference this fall.","We continue to make progress in designing a pivotal program in the delta 508 homozygous patients 12 years and older, and are on track to initiate a global pivotal program in the early part of 2013 pending discussions with regulatory authorities. Our goal is to confirm the results of cohort two of the Phase II study by evaluating 600 mg once daily of VX-809 and potentially other doses in combination with Kalydeco twice a day.","We have also initiated two important new Phase III studies of Kalydeco monotherapy. The first is a 40-patient study in patients with at least one copy of the R117H mutation and the second is a 20-patient crossover study in patients with a non-G551D gating mutation.","These are both six months studies, with primary endpoints of FEV1 and safety. We anticipate having results of both studies next year, with the goal of generating data that will support an expansion of Kalydeco's label to address these populations. Just last week, we received approval of Kalydeco in the EU for G551D patients aged six and older. I'm proud of the efforts of our team to achieve this first European approval for a Vertex medicine.","I would also like to comment on our second CFTR corrector, VX-661. A Phase II study is ongoing exploring the corrector VX-661 in combination with Kalydeco in CF patients who are homozygous with delta 508. This study is designed as a dose escalation, placebo-controlled study. Part A of the study, which we initiated earlier this year, is evaluating different doses of VX-661 alone or in combination with Kalydeco for 28 days in approximately 100 patients in total. The design is different than the Phase II VX-809 study, reflecting the earlier state of development for VX-661. This is our first trial of VX-661 in patients. We expect to conclude all dosing and follow-up in Part A of VX-661 study before we discuss results publicly and we anticipate that this will take place in 2013.","Now, turning to hepatitis C. Today we announced seven-day viral kinetic results for ALS-2200, a nucleotide analog that was licensed from Alios last year. These are very encouraging results that allow us to move rapidly into Phase II all-oral studies later this year. We achieved a median reduction of 4.54 log in HCV RNA from baseline in the seven-day trial with a 200 mg once-a-day dose. The activity was consistent among patients, with a range of 3.81 to 5.08 logs after seven days of treatment. The initial drop in viral load in this dose group was steep, 3.85 logs after three days and ALS-2200 was also well-tolerated. There were no FAEs or dropouts.","From here, we are advancing rapidly to all-oral, interferon-free combination studies. We expect to begin two clinical studies with compounds within our own portfolio in the second half of this year. First, a Phase II 12-week study of ALS-2200 in combination with Incivek in Genotype 1 patients. Second, also a Phase II study 12 weeks of ALS-2200 in combination with ribavirin in Genotype 1 patients. These studies will evaluate safety and efficacy as measured by SVR 4 and SVR 12 and should enable us to move into advanced studies.","As Jeff mentioned, we will consider regimens with our own compounds as well as the merits of combining ALS-2200 with other leading direct antivirals currently in development. We will work towards the best target regimens for the different patient populations in hepatitis C.","In summary, our efforts in cystic fibrosis reflect the conviction that we can leverage our R&D experience, scientific knowledge and capabilities to make a big difference in the lives of many patients with cystic fibrosis, and our ongoing efforts in hepatitis C demonstrate our commitment to continued innovation in this area. I would like to thank our development teams who have executed extremely well to advance and broaden our pipeline in the last 12 months.","Before I finish, I will just highlight one more high-priority program, our JAK3 inhibitor VX-509. We established proof-of-concept to rheumatoid arthritis last year and advanced this program now into Phase IIb to study VX-509 on a background of methotrexate. We are enrolling now and we expect to initiate studies in other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases beginning in 2013.","Beyond hepatitis C, CF and RA, we have important programs in development targeting flu, epilepsy and other diseases. I look forward to reporting on our progress in those areas in upcoming quarters.","I will now turn it back over to Michael.","Michael Partridge","Thank you, Peter.","That now concludes our prepared remarks. Tyrone, we\u2019d like to open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions].","We have a question from Geoff Porges of Bernstein. Your line is open.","Geoff Porges","Thank you very much, and congratulations on another important discovery or at least development program. Well done. Just a few questions on the Alios nukes. The first is just, and they\u2019re all sort of technical questions. It\u2019s the first we learn much about them. Peter, can you tell us whether there's any CYP3A or CYP4A metabolism there or likely interactions?","Secondly, if you would soft of cast a wide net, what would be your preference for a combination with the nukes given the profile that you've seen so far? You conspicuously didn't mention 222, and I wonder if we should read anything into that. And lastly, is there any dose response worth pursuing to a higher dose than the 200? Thanks. I'll get back in the queue.","Bob Kauffman","Jeff, this is Bob. I'll try to take those questions, not exactly in the order that you gave them. But let's just say for 222 it was not knowingly omitted, for sure. We're certainly looking at ways of folding that into our development. We've mentioned the two potential Phase II studies that we're planning. There may well be other Phase II studies in more difficult to treat populations where somewhat larger number of compounds combined together might be useful, and that's likely where you'll see 222 come in. We also could combine it with one of the nukes, and there would be no reason not to do that. It's just that we've chosen Incivek as the initial one that we're going to pursue.","In terms of dose response, yes, we're going to be exploring that more with some PK\/PD analysis to try to figure out if it makes any sense to go higher, and we certainly could do that if we choose to.","In terms of CYP metabolism, at this point we don't know that much about these compounds. They've just obviously been in very short-term studies. But in general, nukes have not really had major drug interactions with other compounds, and we would expect these to be similar. Obviously we'll see what we get in future studies.","George Porges","Thanks very much. I'll jump back in the queue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rachel McMinn of Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Yeah, thanks very much. And I also had a couple of Alios questions. I guess I wanted to better understand why you're interested in doing separate studies, one with telaprevir and one with ribavirin, but not looking to do triple? And just make sure that the ribavirin study is going to be in Genotype 1 and understand that rationale.","And then is this nuke, the adenosine, can you just tell us what the base is? And should we presume that because you've made the decision to go forward, that if you're -- I guess are there any inferences to make on the other Alios nukes? So if the data looks just as strong, are you planning on, you know, how would that influence your clinical decisions going forward? Thanks.","Bob Kauffman","So, Rachel, this is Bob. Maybe I'll take the last one first, and just say that clearly we have the data for ALS-2200 in our hand right now and our plan is to move as quickly as we can with that compound. If all goes well with the 2158 and we have another compound, obviously we'll fold that into development when it comes along, and that could be in the setting of either nuke combinations or combinations of each one with other compounds. I wouldn't otherwise read anything into it except just the two studies are just not running completely in parallel with each other. In terms of the structure, we haven't revealed that, so I won't say much more about that.","In terms of the ribavirin study, yes, we do plan to do all of our work in Genotype 1. We see that as where the biggest unmet medical need is at this point, and so we would pursue that. One of the reasons to do the ribarivin plus 2200 study is obviously part of the goal of Phase II is to gather some additional well-needed safety data on the compounds and longer duration, and we just want to clean the system we can to be able to tease out the safety profile of 2200 from the other compound. And just the recent separate studies is really just convenience rather than folding everything into one humongous thing. It just is easier to manage separate studies.","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","And I guess I don\u2019t -- yeah, I'm still unclear why you wouldn't just run triples. If you have an arm without PI-1 with PI, then why wouldn't you run all three together?","Bob Kauffman Just our preference to do it this way.","Jeff Leiden","Rachel, this is Jeff. Obviously we've just received this data and we're thinking through it. It gives us a lot of optionality, as you pointed out, with respect to our own compounds, and as we've said, we'll consider combining 2200 with other folks' compounds as well. And so I just want to be clear that part of what you're hearing is an evolution of our thinking as we understand what the true optionality here is. And I think the important thing to take away from this is that our plan is to do multiple Phase II studies quickly in order to pick the best combination that we can take forward into Phase III based on actual efficacy and safety data.","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Schoenebaum of ISI Group. Your line is open.","Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. A quick one, do you guys have the data in-house for 2158? I don\u2019t know if you -- you may have mentioned and I may have just missed it.","And then on, maybe on CF, on the 661 trial, can you just be really clear, is there an interim or is there not an interim in that trial? And what changed that caused you guys to move the timelines out from this year to next year? And also on that, can you remind us of the design? And give us -- and then also on the combo, can you give us an update on when you're actually going to meet with the FDA to talk about a Phase III design? Thanks.","Bob Kauffman","I'll take the 2158 question, and that is the study is ongoing, it's still blinded, so there's nothing really much that I can say about it.","Peter Mueller","So with respect to 661, Mark, it's a complicated study, it's adaptive trial design. So we will have some data as we go along, and we want to see the entirety of the data before we basically make any statement to the outer world obviously, and that takes a while. So it's not a linear type of design. It's an adaptive trial design to make sure that we look at the compound from different angles and get sort of a good feeling about dosing and combinability with 809.","So we hope that if everything goes well, that we can provide you data in 2013. That's for this piece. In terms of -- what was the other question that you had?","Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","Oh, just the Phase III on the combo, when you may meet with the FDA?","Peter Mueller","Yeah. So, basically towards the fourth quarter this year we will have a meeting and then talk about how we go forward that is needed to initiate the trial at the beginning of 2013.","Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","And can I just slip one, for Ian? Ian, if revenues decline next -- I know you're not giving 2013 guidance, but just a general philosophical question, if revenues continue to decline into 2013, what -- how should we be thinking about our 2013 expense modeling?","Jeff Leiden","Actually, to the expense question, Mark, I think you can expect us to look at it the same way that we have this year. What we're trying to communicate on this call is a very active program, specifically in our G&A area this year as well as being nimble as we see markets change and adapt to our marketing programs as well. That's allowed us to maintain the guidance that we have this year despite the increased investments in the priority two programs.","As we go into 2013, we have to have a good understanding. We'll get more data and more understanding of the market. But in terms of philosophical question, we're trying to minimize the G&A, the SG&A in our business to the extent we can to prioritize our investment into R&D into these high-value programs.","Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","Thank you.","Jeff Leiden","Mark, this is Jeff. Maybe just to add even a bit higher level view, because Ian reviewed the pure financial considerations, I think our vision and our strategy has been quite consistent, which is that we're trying to build a global, multi-product business that can produce long-term growth. Obviously we've made some important and impressive progress this year on our late-stage pipeline. As we go into 2013, I think we want to continue to invest in that pipeline to maximize value, and we'll do so. But we've also said that we're going to be financially very disciplined, both in terms of prioritizing programs and in terms of controlling our expenses. And that's our plan, and we'll give you more insight on that as all the pieces of the puzzle from both the revenue and expense side come together later this year.","Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Yaron Werber of Citi. Your line is open.","Jeff Leiden","Yaron, are you there? Are you on mute?","Operator","He has two lines in. Let's try the next line.","Jeff Leiden","Yaron, are you there?","Yaron Werber \u2013 Citigroup","Yes. I'm here. Can you hear me okay?","Jeff Leiden","Yes. We can.","Yaron Werber \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, great. So, a few questions, if you don't mind, on the Alios nukes. One, any sense you can give us what was the breakdown between 1A and 1B in that study? Second question, did you see any breakthrough at all on therapy? And then three, what's the metabolism of the nuke? Are they metabolized by the liver at all? Just give us a little bit of sense what you're seeing in animals.","Bob Kauffman","Yeah. So this is Bob. As you saw in our release, the patient population was primarily Genotype 1B. That's likely just geographically based. The study was conducted primarily in Eastern and Western Europe.","In terms of breakthroughs, there were none on therapy. Yeah. There were no breakthroughs on therapy. And metabolism we haven't really talked about very much, so there's not much to say about those. These are nucleotide pro-drugs, and so they are metabolized as they get into the liver through first-pass metabolism into the active compounds.","Just in terms of the 1A\/1B breakdown, I'll just say that in general for the nukes there really hasn't been any real difference in activity between Genotype 1A and 1B clinically. In vitro for these compounds there's no real difference between them. And when you look at the data and the trial, even though there were just a couple of people with Genotype 1A, the viral declines were really indistinguishable from the Genotype 1B patients. So we don't really anticipate there being any big difference there.","Yaron Werber \u2013 Citigroup","And maybe just a last question, how do you -- give us a little bit of a sense, I mean, you have a lot of work to do. I mean this data is fantastic, but you have data on eight patients at seven days. At this point you need to do the drug-drug interactions, you need to have several hundred patients on drug before you can move into pivotal. We're just trying to understand how is it possible that you can start a pivotal study within 16 months or so?","Jeff Leiden","Yeah. So the way we do it is to move as quickly as we can into a broad Phase II program that will give us the safety database that we need. And we don't disagree with your numbers that it'll be hundreds of patients required, and we anticipate gaining those in various combinations in a series of Phase II studies, perhaps in different patient populations, to basically try to define the right regimens for the right patients. And that is how we will go forward, and we anticipate to be on move quickly. There's a great demand for patients to enter trials with nukes because of their potential advantages. We don't expect any difficulties with recruitment. And so we'll move along quickly.","Peter Mueller","Yeah. And Yaron, as we go forward. Now when you really look into how those drugs normally proceed, we have really an option here by end of next year to basically enter into a pivotal program. And the nice thing, as Jeff alluded to, is we will have numerous evaluations of different combinations in different patient populations that gives us a good sense what is the best regimen for a particular population if you want to move forward. And I think our decision will be data driven and safety data driven, and so we go forward by end of next year with a solid pivotal program, and I think that gives us an option to be a player in the field.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Geoff Meacham of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Yaron Werber \u2013 Citigroup","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. For Kalydeco and the R117H pivotal, it looks to be a six-month study. I'm curious if there's an interim, say, three months, and then if you guys are thinking initially that your delta F homozygous combo study will also be six months, or have you any preliminary discussions with the FDA that it still will have to be a 12-month pivotal? And I have one follow-up.","Peter Mueller","Okay. So, Geoff, hi. This is Peter, so I'll take that. With respect to the monotherapy Kalydeco labeled extension studies, 117 and the gating, the non-551D gating, both of them will be six-month studies without any interims. So we are not doing interims here, it's a small patient population, you don't want to disturb the integrity of the trial by doing interims, so we are not doing this. So the data will be available in the course of next year. And then we will basically file an SNDA to get a label extension. So that's for this part.","In terms of the combo 809 for 12 years and older, we are currently planning a study that has, from a global point of view, the ability to produce one-year safety and one-year efficacy data. And we might, depending on and pending on discussions with the regulatory agencies, we have an option in GS maybe to start an earlier rolling submission as we did with Kalydeco, and that could be on the base of half-a-year data point. But I think that needs to be discussed with the regulatory agencies.","Yaron Werber \u2013 Citigroup","Got you. And just the follow-up is on the hep C franchise. So I'm curious if you guys have some sort of ROI target for hep C. I'm just trying to get a sense maybe at a higher level, I mean what magnitude investment you're willing to make given the current dynamics of the market and the landscape. Thanks.","Jeff Leiden","Yeah, it's a good question. Obviously this is a very dynamic, very competitive market. And rather than going to ROI details, I would say what we've said before, which is that we need to be convinced that we have winning regimens that will allow us to address large parts or large portions of this market going forward.","I think as you probably remember, we said that our new data needs to be competitive with anything out there in order to move forward. We feel it is, which is why we're going to move forward. And we'll make the same kinds of decisions as we go and collect our Phase II data prior to moving into Phase III to make sure again that we're not chasing the market with a second-rate or non-competitive regimen. But we think that the new data we provided today is a good start.","Yaron Werber \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Roden of UBS. Your line is open.","Matt Roden \u2013 UBS","Great. Thanks very much and congrats on the Alios data here. So on the hep C program, a couple of quick questions here. Can you talk about the baseline characteristics a little bit, maybe the IL-28 genotype, BMI, things like that, just so that we can maybe help assess the degree of difficulty if you will in this study? Secondly, if you can speak to any treatment emergent adverse events in the study.","And then for planning purposes, as you move into a pivotal study, is it your assumption that if there is a new standard of care established by that time in the overall space, whether or not you would actually have to run up against an active control or whether or not you'd sort of take advantage of the progressiveness that the FDA is taking forward in the current hep C studies.","Bob Kauffman","So, Matt, this is Bob. I'll take those. In terms of baseline characteristics, there's nothing particularly notable about them. The IL-28B genotype distribution was as you would expect, but we have not yet analyzed the study by IL-28B individual subject, so I can't really say too much about that, nor by any other baseline factors. So that will be coming as we look at the data. Obviously it's very fresh so we don't have a whole lot of additional analyses.","In terms of adverse events, they were sort of typical for a Phase I study, is all I can say, and obviously we'll provide more information when these data are presented at a medical conference.","In terms of the regulatory strategy, I think it's just a little bit early to say at this point. The FDA, as they have done publicly in a number of settings, has indicated a great deal of flexibility in the development of all-orals. We hope to take advantage of that. It may help us to speed up our program, but it's really premature to think about comparators and sort of all that part of it. Obviously we'll gain more information as we go along.","Peter Mueller And I want to just add two comments to that. So first of all, from a baseline point of view, viral RNA, it's pretty high, it's six-point-ish something. That means it's hard to treat patients in general. So that means we really pick hard to treat people. That's number one. And on top of that, I want to just make sure that we all understand there were no severe adverse events in the entire study, which is actually an important outcome too.","Matt Roden \u2013 UBS","Okay, great. And then related -- I guess as a follow-up on the last question, and that is, is it safe to assume or should we infer that since you're continuing to invest in hepatitis C with an early stage asset here, that it's your view that the commercial market will be more sustainable under sort of all-oral standards of care as opposed to the sort of rapid rise and rapid decline of the treatment rate both ten years ago and again in your experience with peg, ribavirin and telaprevir.","Jeff Leiden","Yeah, this is Jeff. Our view is that this is a large market that will likely evolve into multiple segments, some of which will be large, and that one or all would come, there's a very nice commercial opportunity, there's also a great opportunity to treat more patients which is very, very important. And so as we look at it, as I said, once we see our Phase II data, I think we'll be in a good position to conclude whether we have, let's call it winning or first-rate regimens that can address some of these large patient populations. And if we do, that's a worthwhile investment for us and it's a worthwhile investment for patients.","Matt Roden \u2013 UBS","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Liisa Bayko of JMP Securities. Your line is open.","Liisa Bayko \u2013 JMP Securities","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. When we think about the combination with Incivek and the Alios nuke, could you maybe talk about the type of regimen or dosing that you're thinking about for Incivek? Are you going to be considering daily dosing and lower doses than currently available? How should we think about that?","Bob Kauffman","This is Bob. We'll likely be dosing Incivek twice-a-day dosing in the combination studies. In general, principles of the antiviral therapy are that you don't generally lower the doses of each of the agents. You obviously need them to cover the variants for the other. So I would not anticipate any different dosing of Incivek than we're currently using.","Liisa Bayko \u2013 JMP Securities","And along with the lines, timing wise, I guess 12 weeks is -- I'm just trying to think about if there's a way to make the safety or tolerability a little bit more tolerable in the combination?","Bob Kauffman","Yeah. So just a quick word on that, obviously we had a little bit of a window into the safety profile of Incivek without peg-interferon and [disease] study dual arms. And it was actually quite a bit more favorable, as you'd expect, than what we saw with the triple therapy and it gives us some amount of confidence that we'll be able to design tolerable regimens. And clearly we'll confirm that when we combine them with the nukes. But that is one of the goals, of course, of Phase II is to get that information. And we are looking at 12 weeks as our primary development path.","Liisa Bayko \u2013 JMP Securities","Okay, thanks. And then just a question on the CF program, are you considering higher doses of 809 currently? Are you exploring any? And then I just wanted to understand the launch plan in Europe. In what sequence will you be rolling out in countries, sort of timing, and how should we think about price? Thanks.","Peter Mueller","So I take, Liisa, the first thing with the dosing. So as we said, I think there are two aspects of the pivotal trials. Number one is you have to confirm what they have seen in cohort two in Phase II, just the 600 mg once-a-day and Kalydeco 250 mg twice a day. And we actually plan, because we see from the response that we might not have maxed out yet. We will try several other dose regimens that are higher on the VX-809. And one of them, as we always said, could be a BID 400 mg. So that gives you a higher exposure and hopefully then a better translation into the correction. But that's what we are trying to do.","Jeff Leiden","And Liisa, this is Jeff. I'll take your question on the commercial launch in Europe. First, as I think we mentioned before, we've been planning for this launch, so the entire commercial organization is in place in Europe. We're focusing on the four major countries with most of the G551D patients, which is Germany, France, UK and Ireland, initially, although we may roll it out in additional countries over time as we identify these patients, or they identify to us.","As I'm sure you know, the way reimbursement works in Europe is a little different. It's negotiated country by country. And we are just beginning those discussions now with each of the countries. It's therefore early to talk about price, and we'll keep you informed as we go. But as I've said before, we view the value -- the pricing of our medicines with respect to their value to the patient, and we think that, based on our data, this is a very valuable medicine for G551D patients.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Terence Flynn \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just was wondering if you can give us any update on how many of the patients have rolled over from PERSIST onto commercial Kalydeco, and if all of them have rolled over? And then any details on the gross to net this quarter for Kalydeco? And then I have one follow-up.","Jeff Leiden","Yeah, this is Jeff, so I'll take those two first. With respect to the rollover, we're not providing a detailed information on the patient numbers. They started rolling over in May and they will continue to roll over, most of them actually, in the third and the fourth quarter. So far the rollovers are going well, Terence, in the sense of it's been a fairly easy process to move patients over.","Your other question was on the gross to net for Kalydeco. And again, we haven't disclosed the number. The gross to net for Kalydeco is really based mostly on payer mix, and the payer mix is about 70% commercial, 20% government, 10% other. That may change a little bit over time as we get more government-funded patients on the drug, but we don't anticipate it'll be a major change.","Terence Flynn \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then, have you guys looked at any of the PK\/PD data yet from the Kalydeco-809 Phase II trial? And where are you on that front, I guess?","Peter Mueller","Obviously, we're looking at those data constantly. We will basically present some of them most likely in a conference later this year.","Terence Flynn \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. Any details you can share with us?","Peter Mueller","No. Not at this given point in time. I think what I indicated is that we go for higher-dose regimens, which gives you an indication that we have a confidence that we'll reach exposure levels that are covered by our safety ranges. And that's I think the most we can say at this given point in time.","Terence Flynn \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tom Russo of Baird. You're line is open.","Tom Russo \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Good afternoon and congrats on the great results for the nuke. First question, and then a follow-up, I just wanted to get a little more granular thoughts on cross-company collaborations, maybe the appetite that you have, mechanisms that you'd favor, how advanced any conversations you've already had are, and whether one or more of the Phase II trials that you're talking about could be adapted to accommodate outside compounds?","Jeff Leiden","Yeah, this is Jeff. We're not going to comment on any sort of specific discussions or strategies there. I would really just go back to what I said originally, which is our goal is to find the best regimen or regimens per patient. We think there's still a fair amount unknown about what those regimens are, and our goal is to learn more about that. And I think the classes of molecules one would combine with the nuke are pretty obvious at this point. So they don't bear really reiterating.","But it is our plan to go forward with our own drugs in combination with the nukes. And as I said, we would consider combining them with drugs of other companies as well.","Tom Russo \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay. And then, the other question, I don't think we've really seen or heard much on the preclinical for the nukes yet. Is there anything that you can say on the dose-limiting talks or how close -- how much coverage you have in terms of the therapeutic window versus the 200 mg that we're seeing today?","Peter Mueller","It's Peter speaking, Tom. I think there will be data in the upcoming conference that basically describes the preclinical profile. We have spoken a little bit about that in the earlier days and I want to repeat that. So we did a careful evaluation quickly before we made a decision to pursue Alios nukes. And on that base safety was an important component. And as I said then, I say now, it was, from a preclinical point of view, one of the safest, if not the safest, nukes that we have sort of seen in the landscape out there. And I think it was part of the decision to go forward.","Tom Russo \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay. Thanks, Peter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ying Huang of Barclays. Your line is open.","Ying Huang \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thanks. Congratulations also on your nuke data. My first question is for Bob. Can you confirm that in the Phase 1 trial, for the placebo-treated patients, they're also predominantly Genotype 1b?","And then I have a question for Ian. The excess I guess inventory, $78 million, is that all accumulated from 2Q of this year? Thanks.","Bob Kauffman","So, just a quick answer, yes, the placebo subjects were predominantly 1B.","Jeff Leiden","And Ying, to your question on inventory, it's actually the inventory we built over quite a long period based on our expectations of the market and consistent with how we've communicated on this call. We have seen a change in that market and decline in treatment rates which has resulted with us reserving against potential for excess inventory.","Ying Huang \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thanks. And then if I can squeeze one more for Peter. You guys have sufficient toxicology data to support 12 weeks study in human now?","Peter Mueller","Yes, we do. Twelve weeks is all basically ready to go, and as we go forward we will provide actually six months tox data to have longer treatment regimens possibilities if we decided so.","Ying Huang \u2013 Barclays Capital","Great. Thanks.","Jeff Leiden","Thanks, Ying.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Abrahams of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Brian Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions, and my congrats as well on the Alios nuke data. Question on the Kalydeco-809 combo, recognizing that the design is still evolving, I was wondering if you could talk about how you might be thinking about inclusion criteria for a Phase III versus a Phase II. I guess I'm just wondering if there's anything you're seeing as you continue to look at the Phase II data that might be suggestive of ways you might further reach the population. And then just on Kalydeco pricing, can you confirm that the ultra-orphan status whether or not with the ultra-orphan status Kalydeco you still need to go through the value assessment processes in Germany and the UK? Thanks.","Peter Mueller","So, Brian, in terms of inclusion and learning something from a Phase II towards Phase III, I think there is a broad population that we will include it. Obviously as we said, first, homozygous and we will not have any particular, let's say, exclusions, and just it's probably for all homozygous delta 508 patients in a certain age group. That's sort of basically what drives the selection of the patients. We have to go with 12 years and older to go on a fast track because that's what we have tested in Phase II. That's the only sort of marker in a way that we have, and then that's the usual selection of people that have sometimes contraindications in terms of their co-medication which they can go, that's normal.","But I think broad population for almost everybody in the age group for 12 years and older. That's sort of what I can say to this process.","Jeff Leiden","Yeah, Brian, in terms of Kalydeco reimbursement in Europe, again, as you know, whether it's orphan or not, it does need to go through the German value process. And you may have seen that recently the UK has been changing its rules around the value process. And we're just talking with the UK about whether we will come under the new rules or the old rules since they're literally changing over the last couple of weeks. So I just can't give you a final answer on that yet.","Brian Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Friedman of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","David Friedman \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks for taking my question. It's actually just around the R&D. Is there any way that you guys could discuss or in just general buckets what the R&D breakdown is in terms of hep C, CF, basic research and other?","Jeff Leiden No, we haven't actually broken it down that way. And so I think what we said today is that our philosophy, our strategy, if you will, is to reinvest in the most promising late-stage programs and we consider CF, [HC\/B] and [JAKB] to be promising programs. We clearly need to continue to invest in research, otherwise we won't have future late-stage programs. And then we take a very, very careful look as we get to proof-of-concept with the earlier development compounds to make sure that we have transformative medicines that we're bringing to the late-stage pipeline.","David Friedman \u2013 Morgan Stanley","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Katherine Xu of William Blair. Your line is open.","Katherine Xu \u2013 William Blair","Great. Good afternoon. I'm just wondering, so if you look at the hep C competitive space, you have Gilead already having a co-formulated double combo going into Phase III in the end of this year. So if you are going to Phase III a year later, are you targeting a profile of a pan-genotypic combo or do you think you can still go with Genotype 1 only combo that your analysis can still be successful?","Jeff Leiden","Yeah, obviously we don't comment on what Gilead is doing, so I can just tell you what our strategy is. And as I said, we plan to test multiple all-oral regimens in Phase II between now and the first half of next year in multiple small studies, and based on both safety and efficacy results, we think that's going to allow us to design a single or multiple pivotal trials which will go in parallel with a high probability of success. Aand we can do that by that end of next year.","Katherine Xu \u2013 William Blair","But do you think that'll be a pan-genotypic combo or is that a target profile you're going with, or you're just Genotype 1 only is okay as well?","Bob Kauffman","Katherine, this is Bob. I mean, our initial strategy really is Genotype 1 specific that we still believe is the major unmet need. I think if you look around the world at all the markets and all the various genotype distributions, it still comes out that Genotype is probably still the most valuable proposition.","Katherine Xu \u2013 William Blair","Got it. And then a follow-up if I may, for 25 -- is that 18, the other nuke, what is taking so long --","Peter Mueller 2158.","Bob Kauffman","2158.","Katherine Xu \u2013 William Blair","2158, thank you. What is taking so long? I'm just curious. I thought both studies were started around the same time. And then what is taking longer for the other one?","Bob Kauffman","It's not so long. Basically the studies -- the 2158 study started about a month later than the 2200 study. Obviously running one program on time is hard, running two programs exactly in parallel is almost impossible. And recruitment has been just a little bit slower than we expected in the countries where it's being run. So we do expect the data sometime in the next couple of months.","Katherine Xu \u2013 William Blair","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Howard Liang of Leerink Swann. Your line is open.","Howard Liang \u2013 Leerink Swann Thanks very much. The Incivo royalties down quarter over quarter, can you give some color where your partner is in European launch and whether we should expect our line to increase over time?","Jeff Leiden","So, hi, this is Ian. As I mentioned in my remarks, we've been -- well, Incivo has now been approved in over 25 countries, in most of the major European countries and certainly in the major countries. So they're at that early stage of launch, a lot of those approvals have been this year. So we'll look to see how they perform in those markets.","Howard Liang \u2013 Leerink Swann","Great. And I think you said that you're interested in combining 2200 with other nukes. Would that be with 2158 or other experimental nukes?","Bob Kauffman","This is Bob. Our goal would be potentially to combine 2158 and 2200 together. We haven't really thought of that other nukes at this point. And obviously, we won't know the feasibility of that till we have the 2158 data.","Howard Liang \u2013 Leerink Swann","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Michael Yee \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thanks. On 661, I don\u2019t think the answer was fully clear. Can you just better describe the adaptive design? You got a lot questions on that and I'm trying to understand what actually triggers a read-out. Is that safety, is it an efficacy time point? Maybe explain a little bit better, because I thought as you -- it was [dose] question, so the longer it goes, the higher doses you're going at.","Michael Partridge","Michael, this is Michael. I'll just point out that there is a slide in the webcast that has a bit of a graphic that describes kind of how the doses escalate a little bit, and other features in the design. But I'll let Peter...","Okay. So Peter says the slide describes it pretty well.","Michael Yee \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Then let me ask one last question then. On the 809 combo on Phase III, you said you could look at higher doses. What data do you have to support higher doses? They were never touched on in Phase II. So, just wondering how that's possible in Phase III.","Peter Mueller","We have obviously Phase I data that basically measured exposure levels. And that is linked to safety in humans but also in animals. And that gives us basically, by using PK\/PD modeling, the opportunity to select different doses that are within that safety range.","Michael Yee \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks.","Peter Mueller","And Michael, we'll give you a call and walk you through the slide and describe for you how 661 works. And we find that most of the questions regarding the 661 study is once data are available, and the design will help you understand that the final data will be available in 2013.","Michael Yee \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","That's why I asked. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We have a question from Ed Tenthoff of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Ed Tenthoff \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Thank you very much for taking the question. In first quarter of Kalydeco launch, you said that estimated roughly 60% of patients were, of G551D patients in the US, were on drug. How has that changed in the second quarter? Has that increased, and can you provide what that level is?","Jeff Leiden","Yeah, this is Jeff. As we said on our first quarter call, we are not going to provide numbers of patients going forward. Just to clarify what we said, we said 600 patients in the US at the end of the first quarter. And as I said today, the number has increased, and we anticipate it will continue to increase both as we identify new G551D patients and as G551D patients roll over from PERSIST.","Ed Tenthoff \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Great, thanks. And then, for Ian, just real quickly, with the focus of more on R&D, does that change the breakdown in R&D in that $690 million to $760 million guidance that you've given?","Jeff Leiden","The relative weighting of those two remains similar.","Ed Tenthoff \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Phil Nadeau of Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Phil Nadeau \u2013 Cowen and Co.","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just to, Jeff, at the risk of asking something that you just said you're not going to answer, as you've launched in the US, have you found, or is there anything that has changed your mind on the number of G551D patients in the US? Do you still think that's about 1,100 patients? And a similar question about the four companies you, four countries you mentioned earlier, is 1,000 to 1,100 patients approximately the right number of G551D patients in those four countries?","Jeff Leiden","Yeah, good question, Phil. So in the US, nothing has changed our estimate of 1,000 to 1,100. Our best estimate in Europe is also around 1,000 to 1,100, although I always put the caveat on this, Phil, that, as you know, the genotyping in Europe is not as advanced as it is here and so the precision of the 1,000 to 1,100 in Europe is a little bit less than what we know in the US.","Phil Nadeau \u2013 Cowen and Co.","And did you have any compassionate use program in Europe that has enrolled patients? Are there any patients on drug today?","Jeff Leiden","Yeah, there are. We have a program in France that's enrolled some patients as part of an ATU program, and we anticipate those patients will roll over to commercial drug now that it's approved.","Phil Nadeau \u2013 Cowen and Co.","Okay. Would you care to tell us how many patients that is?","Jeff Leiden","No. We haven't disclosed how many patients that is. It's a small number.","Phil Nadeau \u2013 Cowen and Co.","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Skorney of Breen Murray. Your line is open.","Brian Skorney \u2013 Brean Murray","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the data from the Alios nuke. I guess just to kind of dig in a little bit more on the molecule with the understanding you're not ready to talk about the structure, but just in terms of maybe a little bit of a comparison to the resistance of this drug compared to the other nukes which I think are -- all have the two [meta] nucleoside backbone. I'm just wondering what -- is it a totally different structure than that? And in preclinical studies, have you been able to select for resistance? And what sort of mutations would confer resistance to this drug? Thanks.","Bob Kauffman","This is Bob. I really can't talk at all about the structures. I will just say that these compounds have a very high barrier to resistance and therefore, are excellent combinations for other drugs, much like the other nukes that have been described.","Brian Skorney \u2013 Brean Murray","Thanks.","Bob Kauffman","There will be a bit more detail coming out at a medical conference later on, on some of these issues.","Brian Skorney \u2013 Brean Murray","Okay. I'll wait for them.","Bob Kauffman","Okay.","Michael Yee \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Operator, this is Michael. We're now about 10 minutes past our planned stop time for the call, so in the interest of everybody's time we will take just two more questions. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ravi Mehrotra of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Unidentified Participant","Hi. Congrats on the data. This is actually [Kuhn] calling on behalf of Ravi. I just had a quick question regarding your -- one of the trials for the Alios nukes which is the -- with ribavirin. I just wanted to know if there was anything in the data that you'd seen that would suggest that your nuke with ribavirin might give you better results than what we've seen so far. Thanks.","Bob Kauffman","This is Bob. That's obviously why we're going to do the study, is to find out. Clearly, the properties that we've seen so far, very high level of antiviral activity would make it potentially a good companion with ribavirin. As I said, both efficacy wise and safety wise we think it's a good trial to do.","Unidentified Participant","Okay. Thanks.","Peter Mueller","The other things that's impressive what we said in the call is it had a very steep decline from a viral kinetic point of view, is 3.85 log drop in three days, which is a good indicator that you might have a good chance for a combination and good trial outcome at the end of the day.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question, final question, is from Alan Carr of Needham & Company. Your line is open.","Alan Carr \u2013 Needham & Co.","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Any sense of off-label use, other genotypes, patients using Kalydeco? Thanks.","Jeff Leiden","Yeah, this is Jeff. As you know, Alan, we only promote Kalydeco for labeled indication, which is G551D greater than six, and we don't track or keep track of any off-label use. So I really don't have any data on off-label use.","Alan Carr \u2013 Needham & Co.","Thanks.","Michael Partridge","So, thanks very much, everybody, for joining us tonight. I think everybody got to ask at least one question. If you didn't get your follow-up or you have additional questions, we're in the office, happy to talk further tonight.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. Now I'll turn it over to your host, Michael Partridge, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please begin.","Michael Partridge","Thank you. Good evening and welcome to Vertex's first quarter 2012 conference call. We're off to a great start for 2012. INCIVEK for the treatment of hepatitis C continues to lead the market in the U.S., and our collaborator, J&J, has now also achieved the leading share in major European countries with INCIVO. In the area of cystic fibrosis, we are making strong progress early in the launch of KALYDECO. The launches of INCIVEK in North America, INCIVO in Europe and KALYDECO in the U.S. are driving strong financial performance while we also continue to advance our broad pipeline of medicines for serious diseases.","Vertex is now a multiproduct, profitable global business, generating significant revenues that enable investment for future medicines while delivering significant earnings and cash flow for our shareholders.","With me on the call tonight are Dr. Jeff Leiden, who will provide a perspective on Vertex's recent progress; and Ian Smith, who will review our first quarter financial results. After the brief prepared remarks, Nancy Wysenski, Bob Kauffman and Peter Mueller will join us to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] We expect to conclude the call at 6:00 p.m. Once the call concludes, we will be in the office to answer any additional questions.","I'll note that information discussed on this conference call includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in our reports, including our 10-K, which have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These statements, including those regarding the market launch of INCIVEK and KALYDECO are based on management's current assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and events to differ materially.","GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this call. Information regarding our use of these measures and a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP is available in our first quarter 2012 financial press release, which is on our website.","Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Thanks, Michael. Good evening, everyone. The approval of our second medicine, KALYDECO, in January of this year, the continued strength in the global launch of INCIVEK and INCIVO, the financial performance we've achieved while advancing our pipeline of medicines are all important measures of the success of our business model. We're particularly pleased that Vertex has grown rapidly into a global business with multiple approved medicines that are changing the lives of thousands of patients.","My remarks today will cover 3 main areas: First, product revenues and earnings; second, our pipeline of additional medicines in development; and third, our business model.","Starting with our approved medicines. The strength of the global launch for INCIVEK in North America and INCIVO in Europe and other countries. We launched INCIVEK in the U.S. in May 2011, and our partner, Janssen, begin launching INCIVO in the second half of 2011 in its own territories. INCIVEK and INCIVO are now generating a very significant revenue stream for us, approximately $390 million in the first quarter, including $357 million from INCIVEK and $33 million in royalty revenues from INCIVO.","In the most recent months, we've observed a steady flow of people beginning treatment with INCIVEK, which to date commands a greater than 70% share in the U.S. INCIVO has also achieved a majority of share in the major European countries where the medicine is available. As INCIVO becomes available in more countries throughout the coming months, we expect to see continued significant growth in our royalty revenues.","We move to KALYDECO for cystic fibrosis. We obtained FDA approval for KALYDECO and launched this breakthrough medicine just over 2 months ago for people with cystic fibrosis who have the G551D mutation. Reimbursement has gone smoothly and the launch is going very well. Approximately 600 people have started treatment with KALYDECO since approval, and we recorded approximately $18 million of net revenues in the first quarter. Again, we expect these revenues to grow as more patients begin and maintain treatment with KALYDECO.","In the last few months, we've heard from many patients and their families, and this is one of the most gratifying aspects of bringing a medicine like KALYDECO to patients. Specifically, we've heard how much this medicine has impacted their lives, how they feel better, are healthier and are for the first time, optimistic about their futures. A young man with CF and his mom recently visited Vertex to share with us their experiences with KALYDECO, an experience that was truly life changing for their family in many ways.","This young man told us that, thanks to KALYDECO, CF no longer defines him but is just a part of him. He's looking forward to applying to colleges. We are happy to hear that he visited one of our neighbors, MIT, during his trip to Vertex.","It's these kinds of real-life experiences that inspire us and motivate our team to continue in our efforts to help others with this disease. I particularly want to give credit for the remarkable efforts of the CF community who have made it possible for so many people with CF to get KALYDECO so quickly following approval. This includes the CF Foundation, treatment centers, advocates in the CF community, families and friends of people with CF, as well as our own internal and field teams whose performance and commitment to this disease have been absolutely exemplary.","We're also preparing for the potential approval of KALYDECO in Europe later this year. In addition, we're planning to initiate 3 pivotal studies of KALYDECO in 2012 that will enroll people with CF who have certain CFTR mutations not evaluated in the previous Phase III studies, as well as children with CF as young as 2 years of age. ","A study in people with the R117H mutation and a study of people with other gating mutations are both expected to begin in the middle of this year. And the third study in children with CF as young as 2 years of age who have gating mutations is planned for later this year, pending final feedback from regulatory agencies.","If successful, these studies could expand the number of people with CF who could benefit from KALYDECO monotherapy to approximately 8% to 10% of the estimated 70,000 people with CF worldwide. ","Now I'd like to turn to the progress of our pipeline of developing medicines. Our next wave of potential new medicines could expand and extend our opportunities in CF and hepatitis C, and we're making very nice progress with potential treatments for diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and flu.","In addition to the 3 pivotal studies of KALYDECO monotherapy that I just mentioned, we're also conducting 2 Phase II exploratory studies that combine KALYDECO with a CFTR corrector, either VX-809 or VX-661, and people with CF who have the most common CFTR mutation called Delta 508. The goal of combining KALYDECO with the correctors is to provide the majority of the CF population with a new treatment option. We expect to get the final results from the study of KALYDECO in VX-809 in mid-2012, followed by data from the KALYDECO on VX-661 study in the second half of this year. ","Because we have a deep knowledge and understanding of this disease, we have high hopes for what we may be able to do for the many children and adults living with cystic fibrosis. ","Now moving to hepatitis C, where the future goal in the treatment of this disease is to create well-tolerated, short duration, high viral cure regimens and specifically, interferon-free all oral regimens. Towards this goal we're in the process of initiating an interferon-free combination study with INCIVEK plus VX-222 and ribavirin. We'll also have the first day -- first 7-day viral kinetic data from the Alios nucs in the next couple of months. Pending these viral kinetic data, we're focused on starting additional combination studies with the nukes later this year.","Now this area is moving very fast. However, based on our most -- the most recent data in the field, we believe we have several excellent opportunities to play a leading role in the future evolution of new all-oral treatments for patients with hepatitis C.","We also continue to make progress in other areas of the pipeline with our medicines in development for rheumatoid arthritis and flu. In RA, we're in the process of starting a 6-month Phase IIb study with VX-509, our selective JAK3 inhibitor, and a background methotrexate. And in flu, we have now begun a proof of concept study for VX-787, where we will have data in the second half of the year. ","Let me close by stating that our business is strong and growing, with revenues from 2 marketed products and a significant royalty income that together allow for reinvestment to create future medicines, earnings and cash flows. What I highlighted for you this evening are the key ways to understand the positive trajectory of our business and the markers on the horizon for how we will drive growth in the future.","I look forward to updating you as we go. Thanks, and over to you, Ian.","Ian F. Smith","Thanks, Jeff, and good evening to everyone. Financially, 2012 is proceeding as we expected. And we have demonstrated that we now have a significant revenue base, one that is both diverse and has multiple sources. These revenues enable investment in our pipeline while also generating significant earnings. ","Now to the financials. In the first quarter of 2012, total revenues were approximately $439 million compared to approximately $74 million in the same quarter of last year. The key components of these revenues are as follows: Firstly, we reported approximately $357 million INCIVEK net product revenues, which were affected by a reduction of approximately $22 million in inventory levels by wholesalers between December 31, 2011, and March 31, 2012. The current wholesale inventory level for INCIVEK at the end of the quarter is now approximately 2.5 weeks. In recent months and early April, we observed a steady flow of patients beginning treatment with INCIVEK.","Secondly, we recorded $18 million of net product revenues for KALYDECO, which reflected the first 2 months of sales. As Jeff mentioned, approximately 600 people with CF have now started treatment with KALYDECO since the approval in late January. This reflects the strong patient demand, the connectivity of the CF community and the broad awareness of the importance of KALYDECO for these patients. We expect this revenue stream to grow as more people start to maintain treatment with KALYDECO. Later this year, we expect approval in Europe and this will add to this revenue growth. The strength of the launch in the U.S. and potential future European approval put us in a position to quickly build a significant and  sustainable long term revenue base from KALYDECO.","Thirdly, $39 million of royalty revenues, including $33 million of INCIVO royalty from J&J. This is a very important and growing revenue stream for the company and contributes significantly to the bottom line. It reflects the fact that we start to see leadership extends beyond the U.S. and into Europe and other countries. INCIVO is now available in more than 15 countries worldwide and more launches are planned this year by our collaborator. We expect our INCIVO royalties will grow significantly in 2012 given the early stage of launch in these European countries and other markets. ","And finally, collaborative revenues of $24 million, a portion of these revenues provide funding for R&D activities where we have relationships in the areas of hepatitis C and cystic fibrosis.","As total revenue resulted in the GAAP net income attributable to Vertex of approximately $92 million in the first quarter of 2012 or approximately $0.43 per diluted share, which includes stock compensation charge of $28 million. For the first quarter of 2012, our non-GAAP net income attributable to Vertex was approximately $119 million or $0.55 per diluted share. ","On the basis of $439 million of total revenues this quarter, our non-GAAP income from operations represent an operating margin of approximately 28%, and we expect this operating margin to grow significantly during the rest of 2012. We anticipate the growth of our operating margin to be driven by increases in total revenues and continued cost control over the top total operating expenses. The operating margin is an important financial measure that is consistent with our business model. ","In summary, we continue to see steady demand for INCIVEK. We are seeing significant and growing revenues from INCIVO royalties and we now have the first revenues for KALYDECO. Taken together, we are well positioned to advance our pipeline while generating significant earnings and adding to our current cash position of approximately $1 billion. ","Thank you. And, Michael, back to you.","Michael Partridge","Thank you, Ian. That concludes our prepared remarks and we'd now like to open the call to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","First question is from Geoff Porges of Bernstein.","Aleksandr Rabodzey","This is Aleks here for Jeff. Congratulations on a great start with KALYDECO. Could you please clarify to us what was the general inventory for KALYDECO? And I understand that all 600 patients are on the commercial drug, but then how many patients do you still expect are all off the trial to commercial drug? And then I have a quick follow-up question.","Ian F. Smith","Okay, thanks for the question, Aleks, it's Ian. Just to confirm that the net sales that are recorded for KALYDECO for the first quarter are actually -- they're representing the sales to the patient. There is no significant inventory stocking that occurs with KALYDECO.","Nancy J. Wysenski","And Aleks, to the second half of your question, as you noted, we were very pleased that we have approximately 600 patients who are taking KALYDECO right now. We expect that there are approximately 100 patients in the U.S. on the PERSIST trial, and sometime between late second or early third quarter, in the beginning of next year, those patients will be completing that trial, and rolling over on to commercial supply.","Aleksandr Rabodzey","Got it. And a quick follow-up question. Just thinking about the combination trial and we're getting a lot of questions on that, what percentage of patients do you need to see to have a response about a certain sweat chloride threshold level to decide to proceed to a Phase III trial?","Peter R. Mueller","Aleks, the ongoing trial is sort of a second cohort out of a longer existing exploratory Phase II setting. And basically, what we are looking into is predominantly safety and tolerability, that's number one. Then we look at a bunch of parameters, like sweat chloride and FEV and everything else. And then out of the combination of all of those, we will make a decision how we move forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Congrats on another strong launch. I was wondering if you can just tell us how many -- remind us how many centers you're targeting with KALYDECO and how many of those centers have already initiated patients on drug? And then on the European front, I was wondering if you guys have gotten the day 120 questions yet for KALYDECO and if there was anything new in there that you can tell us about?","Nancy J. Wysenski","To start with the question on KALYDECO, it all depends on -- the answer is really it all depends on how you count a center. So there are adult centers, there are pediatric centers, and if you want to literally go through an accumulated total count, you're looking at over 250 centers. But of those, there are probably 120 or so that are really critically important and we have penetrated and have prescriptions coming out of the vast majority of those critical centers across the U.S. Peter?","Peter R. Mueller","Well, Terry, with respect to the regulatory pass, we have submitted in time the MAA and our process is well on track. And as we said in our earlier, we will not comment on particulars on the regulatory path and we still are believing and are optimistically believing that we will be approved in third quarter of this year.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Schoenebaum of the ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","This is Omar filling in for Mark. Just a couple of questions on KALYDECO. Number one, are there any patients among these 600 that are currently on drug that have some gating mutation other than G551D? And a quick follow-up to that, and in Europe, how does tier [ph] confirmation of G551D status differ just in terms of the mechanics versus how that plays out in U.S.?","Nancy J. Wysenski","Okay, Omar. Let me answer the first half and then I didn't quite literally understand the second half of your question in Europe. But in the U.S., we are very, very firm about the fact that we are promoting KALYDECO totally and only on label, which is only for the G551D mutation in patients who are 6 years old and over. Because of that, we have no real way to understand all the different genotyping mutations that would account for patients being put on the drug, but that's where we focus our promotion. And what was your -- the second half of your question relative to Europe?","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Sure. So just trying to understand the mechanics -- just in the market, how do pairs verify that the patients that just initiated the drug had G551D? How does the process, just the mechanics of the process differ in Europe versus how they are in the U.S.?","Nancy J. Wysenski","I think that the general mechanics of reimbursement in Europe differ significantly from the U.S. in that you essentially have government-sponsored systems, so it's pretty much a one-payer system in the major countries and particularly the 4 driving countries that we'll be launching into for the G551D mutation. We really don't have insight into, in the U.S. or in Europe, how many plans will be asking to validate or if those that are, how they're going about that, I'm sorry.","Operator","Your next question is from Yaron Werber of Citi.","Gloria Woo","Gloria Woo in for Yaron. I just had a question about  INCIVEK actually. I was wondering if you guys are going to update your guidance on INCIVEK based on your current run rate.","Ian F. Smith","Thanks for that question, Gloria. We actually reiterated our guidance in our press release this evening, the guidance for the full year that we provided on February 2, that reiteration of guidance is a reflection of our experience this year with INCIVEK. January sales, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, were affected by a drawdown of inventory of around $22 million. But for February, March and April, we saw a steady trend of scripts and billing, based on all of this, plus we did provide a 7% price increase effective April 1. We remain comfortable with our guidance for the remainder of the year.","Nancy J. Wysenski","And maybe to add to that, Gloria, this is Nancy. On the demand side, we've had a real steady stream of new RXs since the beginning of this year. If you look at your IMS data, you'll see that there have been between 850 and 1,000 prescriptions generated weekly, and that's been in a pretty tight range there. Just to add confidence to the information that we have related to sales to date, in visiting what several thought leaders, well more than several, last week at EASL, it's clear that there continued to be a good number of patients who are coming in to practices, who are requesting and need treatment for their hepatitis C, and based upon the information we have at this point in time, we continue to be confident that patients will be seeking treatment.","Peter R. Mueller","And Gloria, just to the other piece of our operating guidance, which is the operating expenses, we have an understanding and a controllable aspect of those operating expenses and based on that and the trajectory that we see for the rest of this year, we remain comfortable with the guidance we set earlier this year.","Operator","Our next question is from Rachel McMinn of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have a couple of questions. When you talked about the Alios nucs, I might have missed this but you said the next couple of months, the data would be available? Does that mean we shouldn't be expecting it for sure in 2Q? And then on KALYDECO, can you talk about where you think a penetration is with the 600 patients. Does that include any off label use? And then, you might have just answered this but I might have missed it, on the price increase, how much of the 7% price increase is actually effective?","Ian F. Smith","So Rachel, I'll take the first piece with the disclosure question. As we said in our proposed remarks, we expect the first data from the Alios nucs to be available in the second quarter of this year and then I'll refer to Nancy for the remainder of your question.","Nancy J. Wysenski","Sure. On the KALYDECO question, again, we're really pleased with the fact that we've got approximately 600 patients on drug. Because we're only promoting KALYDECO in the G551D patients who are over 6 years of age and those are the only patients that we interact with in the support of our patient support system, in helping them with reimbursement, we can't really speculate about any off label usage, we don't have insight into that. Moving along to the price increases, I'm sure you're aware, Rachel, we can't give you a specific number. But at any point, in a manufacturer's or in a product's life, when we take a price increase, not all of that drops to the bottom line because of agreements that you have with both, some commercial, as well as government payers.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So maybe the half of the price increase, somewhere around that?","Ian F. Smith","The majority of the price increase drops to the bottom line, Rachel.","Operator","Our next question is from Geoff Meacham of JPMorgan.","Unknown Analyst","This is John in for Geoff Meacham and I have a question more about the correctors, 809 and 661. Since they're coming in so close to each other at the end of this year and I'd assume with 809, what's the plan or the tag going forward since they're 2 similar mechanisms? If you could just elaborate on that.","Peter R. Mueller","John, that's actually a very good question. So here's Peter and the answer to that is, there is a differentiation between the 2 molecules and so 661, yes, has the same mechanism of action. It acts as the same type of corrector, but it has a different distribution profile as we have stated in earlier days. And what that could do is, it could give you an opportunity, because of higher exposure potentially in the lung to go with a lower dose regimen and a smaller pill burden and all those type of things in patient populations. If it materializes, based on data we will make a decision how we compared it to molecules, to each other and then go forward. I think it's too early to say something because those studies are ongoing and we have no data to make a decision at that point in time.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","John, this is Jeff. I think you're probably asking the question, do we plan on waiting until we have all of the data before we choose between the 2 and the answer is no. Not necessarily. We're going to evaluate them independently. As we've said, we'll have the 809 data first. We'll look at all that data and make a decision on how to proceed with 809. We'll then have the 661 data, we'll look at all that data and make a decision independently. Is that your question?","Unknown Analyst","Yes, that does. And since they're so similar, I don't assume that you would use them in combination with KALYDECO? Both of them?","Jeffrey M. Leiden","You mean 3 drugs at a time?","Unknown Analyst","Yes, exactly.","Peter R. Mueller","No, there's no intention to have a 3-drug regimen. So even the similarity from a mechanism point of view, they bind basically at the same binding site in a way. There's no other additivity expected.","Operator","Our next question is from Howard Liang of Leerink Swann.","Howard Liang - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Can you just -- do you have an estimate on how many G551D patients there are in the U.S.? I know you talked about 600 patients. I think normally, we think about 4% of the population has G551D, that was assuming that you already have half of the patients on the drug within 2 months?","Nancy J. Wysenski","Yes, Howard. This is Nancy. You're right. We think about 1,000 G551D patients in the U.S., but we have to keep in mind that as we don't yet have an the indication for those who are under 6 years of age, that does remove a small subset. So we're pleased and we believe that we have already reached a majority point of the appropriate potential patients.","Howard Liang - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","And which countries has INCIVO been launched in?","Nancy J. Wysenski","INCIVO has been launched in more than a dozen countries in Europe, additionally in Canada. I don't know if you're looking for a list of those, but all the major countries in Europe, and they have already achieved the -- a dominant market share.","Howard Liang - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","So the revenue -- or sorry, royalty from this quarter is already from those countries or is it only a subset of those countries?","Ian F. Smith","It is from the countries that Nancy is referring to, to the launch, Howard. However, as you can imagine, it's really at the first stages of the launch. I made the comments in my prepared remarks that we do anticipate a growth from the royalty stream and that's because as they gain critical mass in each of the countries that should drive an increased royalty to us on a quarterly basis.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason Kantor of RBC Capital Markets.","Jason Kantor - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Another congratulations on KALYDECO. I'm just wondering, so you got 600 patients really fast and you said you have another 100 patients in clinical trials that could roll off later this year or early next year. But is that gap, the remaining market share, is that something we should expect to also come on the therapy in sort of the same rapid trajectory? Or is there some portion of this population that's hard to get to for whatever reason?","Nancy J. Wysenski","Yes, Jason, as you might expect, every launch is unique. You typically start out with a really strong show when you've got a great product like KALYDECO and we're delighted that, that is exactly what is happening here. I can't really tell you. We'd all be speculating about where we'll be by a certain point in time or how many patients we'll have under treatment, but we're delighted with the fact that we've already gotten a majority of patients only 3 months into the launch and we know that there are another 100 imminent.","Jason Kantor - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Now the 600 patients, that was as of the end of the quarter or that was as of today? And if you're giving us, INCIVEK kind of April trends, can we get the same for KALYDECO?","Nancy J. Wysenski","The 600 patients are as of last week, so in through the majority of April. And, no, I think the last number we've used is more than 35,000 patients on INCIVEK, but we don't have plans to update that number.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Roden of UBS.","Andrew Peters - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","This is actually Andrew in for Matt. And let me add my congratulations on the good KALYDECO number. I guess my question is a bit of an extension from the one just asked. You mentioned earlier the 120 or so critical centers. Of the 600 patients that are on drug right now, how many of those are coming from the critical centers? And I guess, I have a short follow-up.","Nancy J. Wysenski","I actually don't have those data. You may also recall that this launch came 3 months earlier than anticipated and everyone's moving at a pretty rapid clip here. So I can tell you that we have gotten prescriptions from all the major centers and in fact, from a majority of centers generally.","Andrew Peters - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And I guess the follow-up would be, are the scripts coming 1 or 2 at a time? Or are docs putting the majority of their patients on drug?","Nancy J. Wysenski","Yes, I don't have insight into that.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Abrahams of Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew J. Andrews - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","This is Matthew calling in for Brian. In light of the macro economic situation in Europe and some of the recent technology assessments by European countries for some recently approved pharmaceuticals, can you discuss your general thoughts about what clinical data from the KALYDECO studies do you believe will provide compelling evidence for the drugs benefiting in these G551D patients that will help enable strong reimbursement?","Nancy J. Wysenski","That's a great question, Matthew. And of course, speaking for Peter and Bob, we never know exactly what a label will read like until it's granted. But clearly, with the data that were involved in the U.S. label and how things are progressing in Europe, we feel confident that there will be significant information and that, that will enable us to approach the appropriate authorities in the 4 major countries, where 80% of the patients exist.","Operator","Our next question is from Ravi Mehrotra of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Koon Ching","This is Koon actually calling on behalf of Ravi. I have 2 quick questions here. First of all, how quickly could you move into a Phase III trial, depending on how the Alios nucs data looks, how quickly could you move into Phase III interferon-free combo trial? And a question on INCIVEK. Have you seen any indications of doctors warehousing patients in light of the recent development in HCV?","Peter R. Mueller","The first question was how fast can you move on the Alios. I think the first thing is we have to go in Phase II. We are currently in viral kinetic studies which is in Ib, and this will happen in the second half of this year. Shortly after, we have thought [ph] available. So I think we are preparing for that and then moving hopefully, one or several, depending on data outcome, regimens into a Phase II setting. And then basically from there, so it's not a question of Phase III, it's a question of pivotal drugs in general and you have to develop a development strategy basically that takes care of it. The only thing we have said is, which I will now reiterate is, we have a change with our regimens to basically come by the end of 2014 to the first submission for regulatory approval in an all-oral setting, whatever that setting might be.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","This is Jeff, I guess the other one, other thing that I would add is obviously, we are -- as are others, are aiming for shorter and shorter trials with these all-oral regimens and hopefully getting down to the shortest 12 weeks, and that does have a major impact on the timing and the speed at which one can move in these trials, which is quite different from the previous trials containing peg and riba.","Nancy J. Wysenski","And the question related to warehousing, this is something we talked quite a bit about during our fourth quarter call and we had done some fairly extensive research looking into this. So although we're delighted and that we are also participating in the development of potential all-oral therapies, at this point, we don't have any data to suggest that there is additional secondary warehousing beyond what goes on all the time as physicians triage patients into appropriate therapies.","Operator","Our next question is from Ying Huang of Barclays.","Ying Huang - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I want to also echo my congratulations on the KALYDECO launch. First question, can you give us the gross to net adjustments for both the INCIVEK and KALYDECO last quarter? And then, Ian, you mentioned inventory drawdown for about $22 million for INCIVEK. Do you expect that to bounce back in the future quarters?","Ian F. Smith","So just as a statement, the gross to net, first on INCIVEK, it actually did move up slightly in the first quarter, so the net revenues were affected by that. It moved from approximately 13% in our fourth quarter to 16% in this first quarter. We would anticipate that, that 16% around there will be maintained for the rest of the year. We've now completed the majority of our contracting process. On KALYDECO, we're still getting the better understanding of that margin or the net of the discount. It's early on in the launch so we're still setting up our contracting. For this quarter though, it was mid-single digits, maybe slightly above that, and we do expect that to increase slightly. And the -- oh sorry, the inventory question. Yes, so the inventory did reduce from December 31 to March 31 for INCIVEK inventory holding by approximately $22 million. So of course, that affects the revenues that we would accrue in the first quarter. As it affects going forward, we ended the first quarter with approximately 2.5 weeks of inventory, so that's a pretty low level of inventory. So as we go forward we're not sure where it will go, but it shouldn't have a significant impact as we move forward given that the drawdown has pushed the inventory levels to a low of 2.5 weeks.","Operator","The next question is from Liisa Bayko of JMP Securities.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Congratulations on the good launch of KALYDECO. As we think about the combination moving forward, what's really going to drive your decision about this particular combination? Is it really the FEV data or are you going to be thinking more about the sweat chloride? I'm just trying to anticipate the data that comes out.","Peter R. Mueller","Well, Liisa, that's Peter again. I think it's not the one or the other. You have to look at the overall pattern that you basically get in those exploratory trials, which is a smaller number of patients to make a decision. Obviously, from a therapeutic point of view, FEV is the one that is accepted by regulatory agencies and that has the major impact and so if you don't see anything in FEV, that's never a good thing.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just an additional question about -- on a different topic related to R&D. The Alios nucs, I'm just curious, obviously you have 2 and that prevents, I think some unique opportunities for development. But as you think about interferon-free regimens and the Alios nukes, what's really your strategy to develop these? Are you thinking new nuc combinations or combinations that are classes and might you consider looking outside of your own pipeline there?","Peter R. Mueller","Liisa, that's a good question. I think there is many different aspects that you have to consider in our HCV strategy. Given the fact that we believe, and I think are more and more sure that, that different patient populations might benefit from different regimens and that there is not a one size fits all regimen. And that will drive sort of how we basically go forward. The nice thing in the Vertex world, outside of having INCIVEK being the leading drug, is that we basically have a plethora of molecules that we can combine in many different forms and fashions. And there's not just a one regimen that we are looking into, and that's driven by patient populations that we select that we go forward. So I think we have here a very good opportunity. And so this is what it is. And then obviously, we will not stop here. We constantly also are looking for other opportunities and as you have seen companies partner in 2 things and we are completely open to consider those type in our strategy too.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Yes, Liisa, this is Jeff. I totally agree with what Peter said, and just to perhaps add a couple of things. I think we are in a uniquely advantageous situation because we have multiple swings at the ball inside, as Peter said, and we know they're combinable, and that's very important I think. The combinability has, in some cases, I think been lost in the discussion, we've done a lot of work on that. The second thing is, I think because we have some unique assets in particularly the nucs, that also would place us in a more powerful position with respect to partnering with other outside assets. And so our plan is to fully explore our internal pipeline, as well as once we have begin to understand that to explore partnering possibilities that might work for both parties.","Operator","Our next question is from David Friedman of Morgan Stanley.","David Friedman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","It's in regards to, I think something that was mentioned earlier around off label use of 770, and you said that because you don't have, you're not promoting off label, obviously, and therefore you don't have interactions with people. Does that mean that there's no co-pay support or any other services that you are allowed to provide for patients who do not have G551D until they're labeled or is there some amount of interaction that you're allowed to have just to facilitate what was the physician's decision to put the patient on drug or not?","Nancy J. Wysenski","So David, that's a great question. And no, we have no -- we don't have any of our support programs extended to patients beyond the G551D 6 and over indication in our label.","David Friedman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then just as a quick follow, do you have an estimate or have you gotten any sense of what an average co-pay is for a patient with this and what percent you've needed to provide some support to?","Nancy J. Wysenski","As you can imagine, the majority of patients do look for co-pay support, but those are usually in a very reasonable range. I know that some questions have come up about free drug and the provision of free drug occurs at an extremely low level. And so far, the data we have on co-pays is not at a very high rate. Ian, would you like to expound?","Ian F. Smith","Yes. And David, just as I mentioned, a gross to net adjustment for KALYDECO earlier on this call, it's approximately 6%. That includes a lot of the patient support. So as you can see, there's not a significant discount on the gross to net due to patient support programs.","Operator","The next question is from Marko Kozul of ThinkEquity.","Irene Lau - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","This is Irene in for Marko. When you present the first cystic fibrosis combination trial for KALYDECO and VX-809, what kind of data do you plan to report? In other words, do you plan to only provide mean FEV1 and sweat chloride data? Or might you consider also providing subgroup analysis and potential correlation data between FEV1 and sweat chloride?","Ian F. Smith","At this time, we can't really prescribe the press release that we'll be putting out. What I could say is that when we have the data and we're in a position to release it, we'll provide you with the top line data from that study. But I can't go beyond that to this point in time because we don't know how we'll be providing it.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","We have time I believe for 2 questions.","Operator","Next 2 questions is from Katherine Xu Ju of William Blair.","Y. Katherine Xu - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I'm just curious for the INCIVEK launch, what is the ratio between naive and experienced patients? Do you have a sense of that? And the other one is, do you have any pricing information on the ex U.S. countries that you have launched to date?","Nancy J. Wysenski","On the INCIVEK split, Katherine, we continue to see a majority of the patients coming in to the naive descriptor, about 70%. And Ian, do you want to comment on pricing in Europe? That's totally out of our control, as you know, and it's decided by Johnson & Johnson.","Ian F. Smith","Yes. I mean, my comment is that towards the INCIVO royalty. We don't comment on J&J's pricing decisions. But the royalties, it's a significant royalty stream, as you can see in the first quarter, and that's just at the first part of this launch. So we anticipate that, that will growth and the majority of that royalty goes straight to our bottom line. So it's a very healthy cash flow for us given the scale of the European market and also the lead position that INCIVO seems to be in early on in the launch.","Y. Katherine Xu - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Great. And for KALYDECO so far, what is the percentage of reimbursed -- successful reimbursement decision?","Nancy J. Wysenski","I guess, Katherine, that's a really hard question to answer because the launch is so young, and in an orphan disease state, one typically expects that it might take as long as 2 to 3 months to receive reimbursement once the paperwork is put into place. So we're delighted that it's going as fast as it is and that the majority of patients have already received reimbursement, but of course, there are others who are still waiting and we believe that's probably part of why we're seeing a high ratio of commercial pays because typically, the commercial plans make quicker reimbursement decisions.","Operator","Our next question is from Alan Carr of Needham & Company.","Mark Vignola","This is Mark Vignola on for Allen. I was wondering if you guys could talk a little bit about the royalty expenses and what portion of that might be due to KALYDECO?","Ian F. Smith","So we do have a royalty payment to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation on the KALYDECO revenue stream. It's an escalating royalty that starts in kind of mid to high single digits and goes into preteens royalty once the product gets significant scale.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","And it actually appears in the cost of product revenues line, the KALYDECO royalty that we pay out. It does not appear on the royalty payout revenue line.","Are there any additional questions?","Operator","No further questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Okay. Thank you very much for joining us tonight. We will be in the office to take any additional questions that you have. Have a pleasant evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

The press release is on our website and I would also refer you to Slide 4 of tonight's webcast.","Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Thanks, Michael. Good evening. We received approval for KALYDECO for patients 6 and older with the G551D mutation nearly 2 years ago. And since that time, we've made significant progress toward our broader goal of treating the vast majority of people with cystic fibrosis. KALYDECO is a transformative medicine, and I'd like to thank all the patients, families, doctors, nurses and caregivers, who are involved in the treatment of CF for their continued support, as we seek to help more people with this devastating disease over the coming year.","Our strategy is to reach as many people with CF as possible with our medicines and to enhance the benefit for those that we treat. This will be a very important year for patients, for Vertex and for our investors.","I'd like to briefly review Vertex's strategic priorities and goals for the year. The management team and I see this year as a year of execution for the company. If we're successful, this should deliver revenue and earnings growth for Vertex and its shareholders in 2015 and beyond. This execution has 3 main components. First, we must remain focused on investing in priority development programs, particularly CF, in order to launch multiple transformative medicines globally in the near future. Secondly, we will continue to invest in early-stage research. Research has been a growth engine for Vertex for many years, and we expect that it will produce many of our future medicines, including new clinical candidates in 2014.","Finally, we're committed to maintaining financial strength to support investments to create new medicines. We enter 2014 in a strong financial position to invest in our future. We have approximately $1.47 billion in cash, no convertible debt and KALYDECO revenues that are expected to grow in 2014. During 2013, we worked on each part of our financial platform: revenue, expenses and the balance sheet. On the revenue side, we were able to launch KALYDECO successfully in Europe, and we're now reaching nearly all of the eligible G551D patients ages 6 and older in both the U.S. and Europe. We expect further growth this year pending KALYDECO geographic and label expansion.","From a balance sheet perspective, we converted all $400 million of our convertible debt in 2013. We start 2014 with a significantly stronger net cash position.","Finally, at the end of the year, we restructured the business to provide significant expected savings in our operating expenses going forward, with a reduction of approximately $150 million to $200 million in non-GAAP OpEx in 2014 compared to 2013.","We expect our current financial strength to allow us to invest in our key development programs, particularly in CF, and still maintain a strong balance sheet as we exit this year.","Looking back at 2013, I am proud of the execution that enabled us to meet or exceed these key goals, which are shown on Slide 7 that we shared with you at the beginning of last year. We're outlining our key priorities for you at the start of 2014 so that you can again measure our performance as the year progresses. You can see these on Slide 8.","I'll point out a couple of things in particular. The KALYDECO label expansion efforts and related clinical data will be an important marker of our progress in helping more people with CF. Results from the Phase III TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT studies in the Delta F508 homozygous population that we expect to see midyear are a key milestone for the company, potentially enabling us to begin to treat an additional 28,000 patients or more.","We plan to conduct a 12-week Phase II study of VX-661 plus ivacaftor in Delta F508 homozygous patients in the first half of this year. Our goal is to potentially position VX-661 to play a role in a triple combination with a next-generation corrector in the future. We're pleased that VX-661 has now been granted breakthrough therapy designation from the U.S. FDA.","I had the opportunity to meet with many of our investors and analysts at the J.P. Morgan conference earlier this month, and I returned from the conference confident that investors and analysts are aligned with our key business priorities for the year. I look forward to speaking with you and updating you as we progress.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Stuart.","Stuart A. Arbuckle","Good evening, everyone. Tonight, I'm pleased to report our fourth quarter product revenue, and outline our expectations for KALYDECO in 2014. First, KALYDECO generated $371 million in worldwide net revenues for the full year, and approximately $109 million in net revenues in the fourth quarter, including U.S. sales of $56 million and international sales of $53 million. These results are a testament both to the transformative nature of the medicine and the benefit it brings to patients. It's worth noting that our fourth quarter sales include approximately $8 million of inventory build and onetime business adjustments that we do not expect to be repeated in future quarters.","We are now treating nearly all the eligible G551D patients in the U.S. and EU. We're forecasting growth for KALYDECO revenue in 2014 as outlined in the guidance we provided at J.P. Morgan, based on the following anticipated key drivers: First, geographic expansion, from securing public reimbursement in Canada and Australia. We estimate that there are approximately 200 eligible G551D patients in Australia and 100 in Canada. Secondly, label expansion into 2 potential patient populations: other non-G551D gating mutations and R-117H patients. For the non-G551D gating population, we have submitted an sNDA to the FDA with a PDUFA date of March 27. We've also submitted an MAA variation to the EMA for a similar label expansion in Europe and we are in discussions with regulators about that label expansion. We estimate there are approximately 150 patients in the U.S. and 200 patients in the EU who are 6 years and older with these gating mutations. We also see the potential to treat additional patients if we can successfully agree a regulatory path for people with CF who have the R117H mutation. To summarize, we expect these drivers to enable us to grow our KALYDECO revenue beginning in the second quarter and continuing throughout the year. Our goal, as always, is to enable patients who could benefit from KALYDECO to access the medicine as fast as possible.","Turning briefly to INCIVEK. Fourth quarter revenues in North America were approximately $19 million, bringing the total revenue for 2013 to $466 million. The continued decline in revenue throughout 2013 can be attributed to a decrease in new patient starts, inventory drawdowns throughout the extended channel, and a decrease in the realized price due to a change in the payor mix. In summary, I'm pleased with our results in making KALYDECO available to more patients who may benefit from this medicine, and I look forward to updating you on our continued progress in this area in 2014. I'll now turn it over to Ian.","Ian F. Smith","Thanks, Stuart, and good evening to everyone. Tonight I'd like to discuss our current financial position, our 2013 results and our financial strategies, including our 2014 financial guidance. For a detailed discussion of our 2013 financial results, please refer to our press release we issued earlier today.","First, to our financial position and the progress we expect to make through this year. As Jeff mentioned, we are entering 2014 with approximately $1.47 billion in cash. This balance sheet strength, combined with our expected growth in KALYDECO revenues and other revenue sources, enables us to both invest in our pipeline and products and still exit the year with a strong balance sheet. Additionally, pending success with our late stage CF products, we have the potential to generate substantial cash flow and earnings in 2015 and beyond.","Now to the 2013 results. We generated $1.2 billion in total revenues in 2013, including $838 million in product revenue. This was made up of $371 million in KALYDECO revenue, and $466 million in INCIVEK revenue. There were also approximately $157 million in royalty revenues, which includes $131 million in INCIVO royalties.","Lastly, we recorded an additional $218 million in collaborative revenues, including the $152 million HCV royalty sale to J&J that we announced in November. Going forward, we will no longer receive INCIVO royalties.","Turning now to 2014. We expect our total revenues to be in the range of $570 million to $600 million. We anticipate that this total revenue will be made up of approximately $470 million to $500 million in KALYDECO revenue, which Stuart discussed earlier, and approximately $100 million, which includes committed and contracted collaborative revenues and INCIVEK revenues. Now to our operating expense guidance.","We anticipate 2014 non-GAAP operating expense to be $900 million to $950 million, a decrease of $150 million to $200 million from our 2013 non-GAAP OpEx of approximately $1.1 billion. The operating expense will vary quarter-to-quarter. However, we expect Q1 2014 to be lower than Q4 2013. And we expect the amount of lower in the second half of this year, given the timing of planned clinical trials and the realization of our previously announced cost reductions.","The main components of our non-GAAP operating expenses are R&D expenses and SG&A expenses, and our guidance for these items is $665 million to $695 million and $235 million to $255 million, respectively.","I'd now like to give you a breakdown of the R&D investments of the company. First, we plan to maintain our investment in basic research at approximately $200 million to support the creation of future medicines. This is very similar to our 2012 and 2013 levels. Second, we expect to spend between $380 million and $410 million on late-stage development programs, mainly related to our multiple cystic fibrosis programs.","This amount includes significant supply chain investments to prepare for commercial supply for the potential clinical success of lumacaftor and ivacaftor combination. Finally, we expect to spend approximately $85 million on activities and obligations related to KALYDECO. These include safety pharmacovigilance, medical affairs, quality and post marketing commitments.","Turning now to 2014 SG&A guidance of $235 million to $255 million. We expect a significant reduction in SG&A compared with $309 million in 2013. This is the result of reduced U.S. sales and marketing expenses for INCIVEK, as well as a continued focus on limiting spend to only necessary investments to support our CF medicines.","Before I close, an item to note in our 2013 results is the asset write-down of VX-135 and the related deconsolidation of our relationship with Alios. We are required to review all assets recorded on our balance sheet for potential impairment on a regular basis. Based on the information we have today, including the clinical data and market data, our assessment was the $250 million carrying value of this asset was no longer justified.","This impairment and deconsolidation actually results in a gain of approximately $68 million attributable to Vertex, which represents the net of all amounts expensed to date, versus the actual cash payments to Alios.","Regarding the development of VX-135, our goal is to determine the best way to bring this medicine to patients and maximize the value. We remain in discussions with our 2 principal collaborators in HCV, Alios and BMS. Discussions are principally focused on the best way to advance this compound as part of our all-oral combinations and the financial arrangements of each party. We recognize that time is of the essence in this area, and we hope to reach a conclusion on development plans soon.","In summary, we are committed to managing our operating expense at a decreased level compared to prior years, while maintaining our R&D investment to support future product creation, revenue growth and earnings. We're committed to exiting this year with a strong balance sheet. We're optimistic that 2014 will be a transformative year for patients, for Vertex and for investors. With that, I'll ask the operator to please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Geoff Meacham from JPMorgan.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So when you looked at the data coming up in CF for KALYDECO monotherapy in one of the bigger populations, is the patients with residual function. My question is, what does your early data tell you about the treatment effect in this population relative to G551D? And then looking forward, how should we think about what a Phase III would look like depending on the Phase II outcome?","Robert Kauffman","So this is Bob, Geoff. We haven't really looked at the data from that trial yet, it's not yet been analyzed, and so I can't really comment on what we've seen so far. You're familiar with the population of patients who are either pancreatic sufficient, or have only a modest sweat chloride increase, and we'll be anxious to see the results and I think our plans will come from there.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","The earlier data I meant, when you look at some of your in vitro data, we thought that we could measure the effect size in the sweat chloride activity, relative to other mutation.","Robert Kauffman","Yes. I mean, the effect size is, in many cases, comparable to what we see with the G551D with KALYDECO monotherapy, in vitro. So we expect that to be in many of the mutations that result in residual function, that we'll see a similar level of activity. I will remind you though that we also saw this in our R117H and the results of that study were somewhat complicated, so we're waiting to see the results of the clinical trial of residual function to really get a sense to how to proceed.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then, just last one on that, just because of the population being much bigger than G551D or R117H, do you imagine that a Phase III would have to be a lot larger? Would this potentially be, say a 500 or even a 1,000 patient population, in terms of the design of the Phase III, or do you feel like you can get this done in a relatively, sort of narrow study that would be, for example, like 12-week? [ph]","Robert Kauffman","Yes, I can't really speculate on that, but I will point out, obviously we have a fairly large safety database already on KALYDECO monotherapy that we'll be able to utilize to support the safety in this indication also. So it's something we'll have to discuss with the agency.","Operator","And our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges from Bernstein.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just a quick follow-up question on R117H, and then a financial question, Ian. The boundaries of R117H's contribution, is it -- are they in or out, is R117H in or out of guidance for 2014? And what are the potential outcomes of those discussions, in terms of revenue contribution? And then Ian, could you just clarify how much, you were very clear about what was in the OpEx, but how much incremental cash burn will you have on top of the OpEx during the year, so we can back into where cash might be at year-end?","Ian F. Smith","I'm going to answer the second question first, Jeff. So we haven't given guidance, as you can see, on where we expect our cash position to be, end of the year. The way that we manage our balance sheet is looking to cash from multiple sources, and if you look at the 2013 financials and then also, when we file our 10-K in a couple of weeks, you'll be able to see that we do get our cash from multiple sources. The way that we'd like to measure our cash burn, and it's one of the reasons why we give non-GAAP guidance is that the non-GAAP lost tends to be a very good proxy for our cash burn. There are some noncash items in there, but they're both positive and negative. Things like option exercise money or capital expenditures. And when you step back and look at our financials, what you tend to find is the non-GAAP guidance that we provide equates or gives an approximation to our cash burn, because we're managing the balance sheet in that way. So I would take a look at the K and understand it that way, and then also understand that the non-GAAP is a reasonable approximation.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Right, and R117H?","Ian F. Smith","Could you just remind me of that question again, Jeff?","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes, my -- is R117H in or out of the guidance for this year? And regardless, what are the potential sort of boundaries of what you might get from your regulatory discussions with R117H, and how much that revenue opportunity could be?","Ian F. Smith","Yes. So there is a piece of R117H and consistent with the communication we made at the end of last year, we want to have a discussion with the FDA regarding a filing opportunity, regarding patients 18 and older. So we're proceeding ahead there, and somewhat optimistic. So we would look forward to a contribution from that patient population financially in 2014. So -- but it's small, because you've got to go through the review period and the approval and then you've got to launch in that patient population, it's US-based principally, there is a slight delay of timelines in Europe, so it's a small contribution. And then, I'd take the opportunity of your question, actually to hand it over to Stuart, to maybe, Stuart just can give you an idea of how the revenue for KALYDECO builds through the year, so you can understand how we get to where we provided the guidance.","Stuart A. Arbuckle","Yes, so Jeff, I think -- first thing, is probably to ground people on what the run rate is as we exited 2013 and as I said, we did $109 million in the fourth quarter. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, about $8 million of that was some inventory build towards the end of the year, and some other onetime business adjustments. So our run rate as we exit '13 is just north of $100 million a quarter. And as I outlined, we've really got kind of 2 ways that we think we're likely to grow KALYDECO in 2014. The first one is kind of geographic expansion, and we have ongoing discussions regarding reimbursement in Canada and Australia, they've been ongoing for a while, and we continue to be in very active negotiations with both of those reimbursement authorities. We also have label expansions in the non-G551D gating, that's filed, both in the European Union and here in the U.S., and if successful, we'd expect that to contribute to future growth. And as Ian said, R117H is in the range of possibilities encompassed by our current guidance. But clearly, we have to have discussions with the regulatory authorities, we have to put filings in and then certainly in Europe, we've then got to secure reimbursement. And so as a contributor to our overall revenues in 2014, that's likely to be a very small contribution compared to some of those other growth drivers that I've mentioned.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from ISI.","Unknown Analyst","[indiscernible] sitting in for Mark. Just maybe change the topic a little bit to VX-135. A few questions that come to mind, but just to sort of stick with one. Maybe perhaps you can give us, if there is sort of an understanding as to the relapse that occurred in the 200 milligram post-daclatasvir arm, whether there's an understanding as to the reasoning, whether it was deep sequencing, whether a possible mutation was seen?","Robert Kauffman","This is Bob. Sequencing is ongoing in that study, we don't have any results yet. So I think we'll report those likely at a medical meeting.","Operator","And our next question comes from Rachel McMinn from Merrill Lynch.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I was a little bit surprised by the R&D numbers. It looks like there's a pretty big step down there, just the split in OpEx, not the total OpEx. But I guess I wanted to, can you maybe walk through in a little bit more granularity what the color -- how to think about that over the course of the year? And then, as a follow-up to that on the HCV side, if I'm understanding your comments there, should we assume at this point your guidance contains no HCV expenses, either legacy telaprevir expenses or for 135? And I guess, in your ongoing discussions with Bristol, is that like a non-starter for you, you're just -- you're not spending anything on Hep C?","Ian F. Smith","Yes, I'm just scribbling down the questions, so I can get to all of them. So first of all, the trend of our operating expense, I'll start by saying that what you see is our operating expense in Q4 2013. You should see a 5% to 10% decline as we go into Q1 of 2014. And then, when you look through the year, it oscillates around, based on the timing of certain clinical trials. However, it's not significant. And we do anticipate -- and we also just anticipate, it might be a slightly lower run rate in Q3 and Q4, and that's just given that the timing of our major trial that we have ongoing with TRANSPORT and TRAFFIC. So in summary, there should be slight tickdown in Q1 compared to the prior quarter. And then, as we go through the year, you should anticipate less in Q3 and Q4, but not significantly. As far as the questions on HCV, we have some small costs that we still incur in HCV, relating to telaprevir and those are like post-marketing commitments that unfortunately, we're still contracted with the FDA to perform and complete. We actually exclude those as part of the restructuring of HCV, so that they don't get charged to P&L. And also, they do not have any future benefits in our perspective, and that's why we don't incur them. And then as far as marketing and sales, to the ones supporting INCIVEK, that is absolutely negligible at this point in time.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Ian, you might want to comment on the -- how we're treating R&D expense for HCV, in and out of the budget. You talked about that part, I think that's really [indiscernible].","Ian F. Smith","Yes, I'm not sure, Rachel. But did that -- was I -- did I answer your questions? Hello, Rachel?","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So HCV, though, with 135, is that completely out of your future...","Ian F. Smith","I see. Thank you for clarifying. So as we discussed at JPMorgan, our OpEx operating expense guidance of $900 million to $950 million includes $40 million to $50 million. But that's still in there. We're not spending against that though, I want to be clear on that. We're not spending against that at this point in time as we decide on the direction for the program. As I've said, in some of my earlier remarks, we are in discussions with both our principal partners in this area, both BMS and Alios. And so as we work through that -- those discussions, we'll be back to you, not only just with the direction, but the impact on our operating expense, if any. And we hope it to be soon.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I had a question on 661, and obviously, you're starting a Phase II study in homozygous there, it's almost, sort of like a small replication of a Phase III. But I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on how you view the profile of that drug, and whether you'd expect it to be any different from an efficacy profile, versus 809, which we're going to get a Phase III reading on, and the value and readthrough, and what can we glean from that data, and whether you'd expect that to be after the Phase III data, maybe you can sort of run through your thoughts on 661.","Robert Kauffman","So this is Bob. So the study that we're about to start is a 12-week study, safety, efficacy and PK, 661 plus ivacaftor. And I think our thoughts about the profile of that compound really haven't changed at all. This is just the next step in the process, and we continue to be quite pleased with the results that we've seen so far with 661. I wouldn't describe it as sort of a prelude to Phase III, it's a standalone Phase IIa study, and the results will obviously help us going forward. In terms of activity, it's very hard to speculate without seeing the data, but certainly, we were pretty happy with the outcome of the 28-day study that we reported last spring. And at the same time, in vitro, we think the activity of 809 and 661 are relatively similar in homozygous HBE cells. But until we see the clinical data with the longer dosing period, I think it's a little bit hard to speculate on that.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Michael, just strategically, this is Jeff, remind you that how we're thinking about 661, as part of the portfolio. The primary way we're thinking about it is, eventually, it's part of a triple, with a first and second-generation corrector that will allow us to both increase activity in homozygotes and potentially, of course pending the data, reach heterozygotes as well. The other potential use of 661, I guess, is as a so-called backup for 809, in double therapy. And once we see the results of 809 mid-year, and then we see the results of this Phase II trial, we'll be in a position to give you a lot more strategic information about how we're going to proceed.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Let me just ask that quick follow-up. Obviously, we're planning for success. Were 809 not to work, there is some thinking that 661 would ultimately, could still be used in a homozygous setting if you had dual corrector. Not just hetero, but homo, so you'd just be delayed, is that the thinking there?","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Correct.","Robert Kauffman","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Roden from UBS.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's kind of a logical extension of the earlier question on the R&D spend. Presumably, if the CF program is positive, you'll have more financial flexibility going forward. So I was wondering if you can describe, bigger picture, how you see a ramping up of R&D efforts again, and where do you get the programs, how fast can you ramp? Generally, what's your vision for R&D, longer-term?","Ian F. Smith","So vision for R&D, I'll leave it to Jeff and Peter to talk about that. But in terms of the investment profile for the company, we don't see -- we get asked this question frequently, which is, that if your revenues increase and increase significantly, do you spend more of them in R&D? The way that we view our financial investment in the area of R&D in the company right now, on a research basis is, we're very comfortable with the level of investment in research. And it's been productive and it's produced the pipeline that we have today, and hopefully will continue to provide new clinical candidates. We see it as a nice profile that we have multiple sites, they're smaller sites, they're highly focused in certain areas. And so we don't see a significant change in research investment. From a development perspective, development is a function and really, only changes if you're moving into late-stage development with significant trials. And again, it's not a function of a potential revenue, it's more of a function of opportunity. And so if there is the opportunity there that we believe can translate into future medicines, then we will be investing in those drugs. Overall, when you roll this into how we look at the operating expense profile for the company, we see the ability to drive revenue growth, pending the success of the important trials this year, but we really see the opportunity to drive significant revenue growth while not seeing a significant increase in operating expense. We just don't see that. Which therefore, gives us the leverage from the revenues on top of something that's -- may marginally grow on operating expense, but it gives you the opportunity to generate significant earnings and cash flow. That's the profile that we're trying to manage to and be very selective about where we place our investments in R&D. I don't know whether Jeff or Peter wants to comment on R&D vision.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Yes, Peter has been doing a lot of nice work on R&D vision and strategy going forward. So maybe Peter, you have a few comments on how you're thinking about that. It's been a productive organization, but the environment's changing in very interesting ways, and we're going to change with it.","Peter R. Mueller","So I want to be brief, because there would be many things to be said to know what's going on. I think #1, I think Ian phrased it nicely, I think we have a productive R&D or research engine that basically produces on a continuous basis, molecules. And I have high confidence that, that will also happen as we go forward. Now in terms of focus, I think there is a change in the landscape out there that makes some adjustments necessary as you go forward in the future. It is not symptomatic regimens any longer that basically drives the show, it is transformational regimens that will drive the show and driven by outcome and health care. Visibility to outcome is basically sort of the new hallmark that you have to shoot for, and it drives us into diseases and disease approaches that deliver transformational outcome. That's our key focus. And that's our security, what's transformational, depending what disease you are in. We will be very specific to basically look into those type of approaches and mechanisms. And as we go forward, that will not be just limited to fundamentals, more molecule approaches. There will be broader efforts, in terms of cell therapeutic approaches, gene therapies and any of those that you can imagine. We are currently looking into what might play a role here, and that sort of, I would say high level of vision. So there is a broader platform into transformational outcomes in diseases of specialty need that's I think what we are shooting for.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I appreciate the perspective there. Ian, a quick financial follow-up. You mentioned in the release a couple of weeks ago, $60 million in interest expense in 2014, if I'm not mistaken, but I didn't see it in today's release. Does that still stand? Can you clarify if that's GAAP or non-GAAP?","Ian F. Smith","Yes, that still stands. And it is a GAAP and it's an interest charge that relates to -- well, it's actually a net interest charge because it's partly, it's an interest return from our invested capital, it's on our balance sheet, but it's principally driven by an interest charge on the lease of our building. And that's still there.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. But it's going to be non-GAAPed out?","Ian F. Smith","No, we will leave it in, it is a GAAP number.","Operator","And your next question comes from Brian Abrahams from Wells Fargo.","Brian Corey Abrahams - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just for Bob, about the long-term strategy in F508del and the role of potentiators. What's the latest understanding of the channel open probability in F508 CFTR? I'm sort of just wondering if your view is multiple correctors, such as those within your portfolio, could ultimately get to comparable activity without the need for KALYDECO. And to that end, I'm wondering if you can give any more specific updates on the second, the next-generation correctors you're pursuing, in terms of timeline number we'll see move into the clinic this year. Thanks.","Robert Kauffman","So, this is Bob. So, just the last question first is, our timeline remains what we've said before, how we expect to have a clinical candidate by the end of 2014, depending on how things go, there could be more than one clinical candidate, but that's likely the earliest one. In terms of the channel of improbability, I think our general outlook at this point is that for F508del, with homozygotes and heterozygotes, kind of the rate-limiting piece of this is the amount of correction that one can obtain, since potentiators are quite active on F508del CFTR once they get to the cell surface. I think our general thinking is, we likely will always be in a situation where we're going to be wanting to use a potentiator in combination with a corrector. Since I think, just our looking at the additive effects of all these molecules on one another, in order to really get substantial CFTR activity, we're probably going to need basically, 3 drugs, 2 correctors and a potentiator.","Operator","And our next question comes from Liisa Bayko from JMP Securities.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to get some commentary on what combination you think might be adequate to start targeting the heterozygotes?","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Yes, Liisa, it's Jeff. As we've said before, the -- our thinking about this is really informed by the cell biology experiments. And you'll remember that in those experiments, double correctors, I'm sorry, corrector plus potentiators, single correctors, 809 plus KALYDECO, or 661 plus KALYDECO, really doesn't get you to the chloride transport that has been predictive of good clinical activity, and that's been borne out even in the clinical experiments we've done in the heterozygotes. So in contrast, when you use a first generation corrector, a second-generation corrector in KALYDECO, you get to levels of activity in the heterozygous cells that are similar to what you see with a single corrector 809 plus KALYDECO, and that does read out in the clinic. And that's really the basis of our assumption that 3 drugs, as Bob said, a first gen corrector, a second gen corrector and KALYDECO, are going to be necessary to reach the heterozygotes. The only exception being those heterozygotes who might be 508 on 1 allele and KALYDECO-responsive on the other allele. And as you know, we're testing those with a combination of 661 plus KALYDECO right now, in a 4-week study.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","And then, just, can you remind us when we might see usage of KALYDECO in patients below age 6 for the G551D population? Thanks.","Robert Kauffman","So that was -- that study is supposed to read out in the second quarter, and it's on track for that. That's a 2- to 5-year-old study.","Operator","Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was just wondering if you can update us on the IP for the combination, with respect to maybe just remind us on composition for 809 and 661, and then any combination patents that you might have?","Ian F. Smith","Firstly, the patent protection goes to mid-2020s, but I can get the precise years for you, Terence, after we get off of the call, but it's principally in the mid- and late-2020s.","Peter R. Mueller","I think that's correct and in terms of composition, in terms of combination, I think we have filed in each of those patents, combination patents.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And when would those go out to? Like, what would be the latest, those -- the combo patents would cover to?","Ian F. Smith","Yes, it covers through the mid 2020s, Terence. But I can take a look at the dates and get back to you later.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ying Huang from Barclays.","Ying Huang - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Quick one is, what should we expect from the 4-week Phase II study for the KALYDECO and 661 combo, in one allele of G551D and then one allele of 508del. And then, can you give us your thoughts about the importance of secondary endpoints from the ongoing TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT studies, in terms of regulatory approval, and also reimbursement from the payors, such as exacerbation reduction and weight gain?","Ian F. Smith","Ying, thanks for the question. I'm going to get Bob to talk to the 508, 551, 661 study, and maybe Stuart will follow-up with the secondary markers that we're measuring.","Robert Kauffman","So again, we expect to have data in the second quarter on the, that Phase II study with KALYDECO and 661, and F508del, G551D heterozygotes. These are people that are already on KALYDECO commercially, and are enrolled in the study to add 661 on top for 4 weeks, and a 4-week off period. And then the assessment, and we'll have results in the second quarter.","Stuart A. Arbuckle","Yes, on the secondary endpoints, I mean, they are clearly going to be of interest to the regulators. Just to remind you, in TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT, we have things like exacerbations and weight gain, hospitalizations, quality-of-life. So they're clearly of interest to the regulators, whilst they still maintain a firm commitment to FEV1 as the primary regulatory endpoint. As far as reimbursement authorities go, I would say they're even more important than FEV1 for a couple of reasons. Firstly, some of these secondary endpoints are of even more importance to providers and patients. And from a payor's perspective, they are also very important as they are important from a cost avoidance perspective. If you can reduce exacerbations, if you can reduce hospitalizations, if you can be reducing concomitant medications, then clearly, those are important cost offsets. So the secondary endpoints are incredibly important, both from a regulatory point of view and from a reimbursement point of view.","Ying Huang - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then Bob, if I may just have a follow up. So I guess we shouldn't expect additional FEV1 from the 4-week study, right? Maybe it's some incremental secondary benefits here?","Robert Kauffman","Not to speculate, but obviously, we're clearly looking at FEV1 as one of the readouts to determine if the combination actually has a benefit over the individual agent. We'll see how the results come when we get them.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So quickly, so just to be clear, if you hit your primary endpoint, I'm talking about that 809 combo trial, you hit the primary endpoint but miss secondary endpoints. And you maybe believe you won't field a secure, strong reimbursement or good pricing because you missed the secondary points, would you just wait to file with maybe the combo or the triple? And the second question is, Ian, you mentioned at JPMorgan, talking about looking at products that are synergistic and additive and competitive. Given the cash position, what kind of deals are you thinking are optimal? Licensing, partnerships, M&A ?","Ian F. Smith","I'll look for Bob to take the first question in terms of filing with -- when we meet the primary -- if we meet the primary endpoints, and Bob?","Robert Kauffman","Yes, I mean, obviously, we're hoping to hit on more than just the primary endpoint. But certainly, if we hit the primary, we will file, and bring this medicine to patients who need it.","Ian F. Smith","And Robyn, on types of transactions or collaborations that we're looking for, clearly, our focus right now is on what the VX-509 and VX 787, 787 being the molecule for, potentially, to help with flu. So we'll continue to have discussions. In particular, we've just recently received the 24-week data for VX-509, that allows us to continue those discussions. And as those progress through this year, we'll advise you appropriately.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just as a follow-up, just to be clear, if the 809 combination trial. So say, you don't hit your secondary endpoints, would you then potentially begin exploring another homozygous trial with the other combo, to maybe secure -- get a drug on the market or a combo on the market, in that population that maybe does have better value to the patient?","Ian F. Smith","Yes, and if I misunderstood your first question, I'm sorry, I thought that's where you focused. But also, a part of our approach to this area is to, as we mentioned back at NACF, back in October, we're more active than we've ever been, in terms of scouring the landscape. Yes, we want to look for technologies, assets, molecules, approaches, that can be complementary, as well as maybe competitive. And so we have a kind of a learning in this space, when we were once [ph] in prior disease. And today, as we go out and we look around, we do see some opportunities to enhance our position in CF. As far as the particular question you're asking me about, the 809, well, Jeff mentioned about the strategy with 661, but not only can that be -- play a role in the triple regimen where you've got the dual correctors, but we also see that as a potential to play as a backup if needed. And I think that strategy, if you have more shots, it's better. We're committed to this disease, long-term. We think we've got a good understanding of the mechanism of actions and how we can get these medicines to patients. And so, we're going to keep going. We're committed to this space and we think we're doing some incredible things for these patients, and we want to broaden our efforts.","Michael Partridge","Operator, it's now past our planned stop time for the call. We think we have time for 2 more questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ravi Mehrotra from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ravi Mehrotra - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can you give us any more color on your neurological disorder research efforts, in particular your MS program, specifically whether this program looks at remyelination?","Ian F. Smith","I'll just quickly answer that, actually, Ravi, yes it does look to remyelination. It's an early stage program, it's in preclinical. As we progress in all these different areas that we have in research, we'll decide to take the cover off at the appropriate time. We look forward to doing that, but yes, we do have a program in MS, and it is a remyelination approach.","Operator","And our next question comes from Katherine Xu from William Blair.","Y. Katherine Xu - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I just have a very quick question. Now, you have patients over 6 years old of G551D, they're pretty much all on drugs. Just curious, can you disclose the number of patients in the U.S. versus Europe?","Stuart A. Arbuckle","Yes. We think overall, there's about 2,200 patients, 6 years and older in the U.S. Europe, and also in Australia or in Canada. And as we've said, nearly all of those have started therapy in the U.S. and Europe, and we would hope to be able to do something similar in terms of bringing benefit to about the same number of patients in Canada and Australia, once we've been able to secure public reimbursement.","Y. Katherine Xu - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","How much -- how many U.S. versus in Europe, each?","Stuart A. Arbuckle","It's roughly a 50-50 split for G551D.","Michael Partridge","Thanks, everyone, for tuning in tonight. Kelly Lewis and I are in our offices if you have any additional questions. Have a good night.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes our program for today.

Sir, you may begin.","Michael Partridge","Thank you, operator, and good evening, everyone. Joining me on the call tonight are Dr. Jeff Leiden, Chairman and CEO; Dr. Jeff Chodakewitz, Chief Medical Officer; Stuart Arbuckle, Chief Commercial Officer; and Ian Smith, Chief Financial Officer.","Our agenda tonight is as follows: Jeff will begin by reviewing key priorities for our business, then Jeff Chodakewitz will discuss our progress with our cystic fibrosis development programs and our strategy from here. Next, Stuart will discuss second quarter product revenues and the outlook for KALYDECO growth, and will also review preparations for launch of the lumacaftor and ivacaftor combination. To close, Ian will review the second quarter financial results and provide commentary on our expected financial profile moving forward.","We plan for the call to run for approximately 1 hour.

The press release is on our website, and I would also refer you to Slide 4 of tonight's webcast.","I will now turn the call over to Jeff Leiden.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Thanks, Michael, and good evening. Last month, we shared positive results from our 2 Phase III studies of lumacaftor and ivacaftor in people with cystic fibrosis who have 2 copies of the F508del mutation. These results have given great hope and optimism to patients and families with this disease and to the physicians and health care professionals who treat them. As a company, we have also greatly increased our understanding of CFTR correctors and the assays we used to evaluate our medicines during the last several years.","Together, these developments provide us with further scientific validation for our ongoing efforts to develop transformative medicines that provide increased benefit for the vast majority of cystic fibrosis patients.","The Phase III results also increased our confidence that we can achieve our vision to be a leader in developing therapies for cystic fibrosis and innovative new medicines to treat other serious diseases, and to achieve our financial goals of delivering long-term sustainable growth in revenue, earnings and cash flow.","Today, I will review our 3 strategic priorities for achieving our vision as a company. Priority one is to transform the treatment of cystic fibrosis with medicines that address the underlying cause of the disease. CF affects 75,000 children and adults in North America, Europe and Australia and is one of the most prevalent orphan diseases.","Slide 5 outlines our strategy to treat the vast majority of people with CF and also to further enhance the benefit for those we treat. With the clinical data we have today, we believe we are on track with this strategy.","KALYDECO is available today for people with the G551D and other gating mutations, and we have the potential to treat many more people based on our label expansion efforts for KALYDECO monotherapy. Jeff Chodakewitz will describe the details of these studies in his remarks.","With the positive Phase III data for the lumacaftor and ivacaftor combination announced in June, we are now in the cusp of significantly expanding the number of CF patients who can benefit from our medicines. But even with the success of the TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT studies and the momentum that we have created, our work in CF is far from done. We are evaluating the potential of our medicines in younger children and new groups of people with CF. And as we expand the number of people our medicines treat, we continue to seek ways to enhance the clinical benefit with next-generation medicines and other combination regimens. We are deeply committed to being the leader in CF therapies, and we'll maintain and build on our leadership by continuing to invest in our CF programs and by pursuing external opportunities that complement our internal efforts.","Our second strategic priority is to invest to advance our pipeline. We have a productive research engine that has created numerous innovative medicines over the last decade. We will seek to bring new medicines from our research labs into the clinic in the months and years ahead in a number of key specialty disease areas outside of CF. We are also continually surveying the landscape for potential medicines outside Vertex that create transformative opportunities in other serious disease areas of interest.","Executing well on our first 2 priorities will enable our third strategic priority, which is to achieve sustainable long-term growth in revenues, earnings and cash flows to allow us to continue to both invest in our business and to deliver superior returns for our shareholders.","We have a strong financial position, nearly $1.5 billion in cash. And even as we grow our top line, we see our overall expense profile remaining roughly similar to where it is today. The strategy that we articulated 2.5 years ago has remained consistent, and we have continued to execute against that strategy. This execution has fundamentally changed the outlook for our business, increasing confidence in our plans for the future and for people with CF and their families.","Now I'll hand it over to Jeff.","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","Thanks, Jeff, and good evening. In my remarks, I will review the progress we've made on advancing our development programs in cystic fibrosis and highlight further potential developments we anticipate in the coming months. We have learned a lot from the clinical results we've obtained from numerous studies over the past year, and this knowledge positions us to further advance our CF pipeline and treat more people with this disease.","Stepping back, what differentiates our CF program is our CF research platform. This platform has enabled us to select molecules that, in human bronchial epithelial cells isolated from CF patients, restore CFTR protein function and address the underlying cause of disease. The in vitro results have turned out to be highly predictive of clinical benefit across many studies. And the mechanism of action restoring CFTR protein function has proved to be differentiated in terms of the breadth of clinical benefit that patients experience. Now numerous clinical results over the past year have both further validated the predictive ability of our CF research platform and opened the door to treating many more patients, including those homozygous for the most common mutation F508del.","First, I'll highlight our progress in establishing the benefit of KALYDECO monotherapy for more people with CF. We have confirmed KALYDECO's clinical benefit in patients with 8 additional mutations similar to G551D, and we received regulatory approval for these patients in the U.S. earlier in 2014. We anticipate EU approval in the second half of this year. We submitted an sNDA in June and an MAA variation in July for KALYDECO monotherapy in patients 18 years of age and over with the R117H mutation.","Additionally, we announced in May positive data from a proof-of-concept study in 24 people with CF who have residual function mutations. We plan to initiate a Phase III study this year in people with residual function mutations that will evaluate longer duration treatment with ivacaftor and perhaps treatment with combined therapy, pending the progress of VX-661 and discussions with regulatory agencies.","As we seek to expand KALYDECO use in younger patients, we have now conducted a PK and safety study in people with CF ages 2 to 5 with gating mutations. We expect to report the data from that study in the third quarter of this year and potentially file an NDA, utilizing a child-friendly formulation of KALYDECO in the fourth quarter of this year.","I will just close with KALYDECO by mentioning that one of the most interesting and encouraging recent findings has been long-term data in G551D patients. At ECFS in June, we showed that KALYDECO reduced the rate of decline in lung function over time by nearly 50% in G551D patients, which suggests that CFTR modulation can change the course of the disease. It is important to remember that people with severe forms of CF, such as those with G551D or F508del, typically lose nearly 2% of lung function each year. Thus, these results for KALYDECO give a broader view on the importance of our CF medicines over time.","With combination therapy, we reported the positive results in late June from the Phase III TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT studies, which showed improvement in FEV1 and other measures, including pulmonary exacerbations in patients homozygous for the F508del mutation. We devoted a call last month to discussing these results, and I won't review the data here but we are very encouraged by the positive feedback we continue to receive from the medical and patient communities. We will submit the NDA on a rolling basis. We expect to submit the first sections this week and to complete the submission for ages 12 and older in the fourth quarter.","As part of the registration program for the lumacaftor\/ivacaftor combination, we conducted an exploratory study in patients who have one copy of the F508del mutation and a second mutation that is not responsive to either ivacaftor or lumacaftor alone. We reported data today from an 8-week study of lumacaftor plus ivacaftor in this population. Although we did not see efficacy, this was consistent with our expectations and belief that a triple combination will provide us with the best chance to benefit these patients. Importantly, the safety results are consistent with the homozygous population and support our NDA and MAA filings. These results confirm our belief that we will need a different combination to be able to treat the F508del heterozygous patients who have a second allele that doesn't respond to a corrector or potentiator.","Behind lumacaftor is another first-generation corrector, VX-661, which may have a role in helping to treat 3 different populations: KALYDECO-responsive patients with F508del on the other allele; F508del homozygous patients; and patients with F508del on one allele and another mutation on the other allele that is not responsive to a corrector or potentiator.","We are currently conducting a 12-week study of VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor in F508del homozygous patients, and we expect to have results in early 2015. We could consider clinical studies of a dual combination of VX-661 with ivacaftor for any or all of the 3 previously mentioned groups.","Additionally, we anticipate pursuing a triple combination in the future with VX-661 and ivacaftor, along with the next-generation corrector. We currently have several next-generation corrector compounds in the lead optimization stage of research. Significant work remains to be done to move these into the clinic. But based on our progress, we plan to begin clinical development in 2015.","In summary, our CF development over the first half of 2014 has taught us a great deal about the clinical validity of our research platform, the ability of our approach to fundamentally change the course of the disease and the potential to optimize therapy by treating each allele. We believe we are poised to treat many more patients and enhance the benefit for the patients we treat.","With that, I will hand it over to Stuart.","Stuart A. Arbuckle","Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Tonight, I'll talk about our second quarter sales performance and the key drivers of KALYDECO growth for the rest of the year. I'd also like to discuss the priorities for the commercial organization as we prepare for the approval and launch of the lumacaftor\/ivacaftor combination.","Total product revenues were $122 million in the second quarter. The vast majority were KALYDECO, but I will note that INCIVEK generated $9 million in the quarter.","So turning to KALYDECO. KALYDECO generated $113 million in product sales in the second quarter, including U.S. sales of approximately $63 million and international sales of approximately $50 million. This represents an increase of $14 million over Q1 2014.","Underlying demand and adherence in G551D patients continue to be strong, both in the U.S. and internationally. The growth was primarily a result of the expansion of the KALYDECO label by adding 8 additional mutations in the U.S., as well as treating some more people with G551D in Europe. The uptake in patients with the additional mutations is in line with what we experienced in bringing G551D patients onto therapy, and the majority of the eligible patients are already on therapy. We hope to reach nearly all of the approximately 150 eligible children and adults in the U.S. by year end.","Label and geographic expansion remained the key long-term growth drivers for KALYDECO. We were pleased to receive a positive opinion from the CHMP in the second quarter, recommending the approval of KALYDECO for people with CF ages 6 and older who have one of 8 non-G551D gating mutations. The CHMP's positive opinion will now be reviewed by the European commission, and we anticipate approval in the second half of this year. There are approximately 250 children and adults ages 6 and older who have one of these additional mutations in Europe.","In Canada and Australia, making KALYDECO available to the approximately 300 people with the G551D mutation was and remains an important objective this year. We've made good progress in Canada. The letter of intent signed in June with the pan-Canadian Pricing Alliance is an important step toward eligible Canadians receiving KALYDECO through public reimbursement. However, our work is not complete until each province has added KALYDECO to its individual drug program, which has to happen before people can get access to this medicine.","Ontario and Alberta have added KALYDECO to their product listing agreements, and patients are beginning to be initiated in these 2 important provinces that account for over 1\/2 of the G551D patients in Canada. We share the urgency of the CF community to bring this process to a successful conclusion, and we will work as quickly as the other provinces are able so that people can receive KALYDECO without delay.","In Australia, it has been 16 months since our first reimbursement submission and the CF community is unfortunately still waiting for access to KALYDECO. Despite being offered a price equivalent to the best in the world, Australia is unique in not providing reimbursement. And in addition, seeking to impose criteria, which would effectively lead to 1\/2 of patients not having access to KALYDECO. We believe that all eligible Australian children and adults should have the opportunity to receive KALYDECO. We remain committed to trying to reach an agreement and are waiting to hear back from the Department of Health on our proposal submitted in May.","Turning now to the lumacaftor\/ivacaftor combination and our launch preparations. We expect to add additional positions to our commercial team toward the end of the year to support both the increased number of patients in existing countries and expansion into new countries. One area of build-out is here in the U.S. where we'll be adding more case managers to our patient services team who help providers and patients navigate the reimbursement process, as well as help with education and compliance.","Internationally, we will need to establish a presence in some new countries: in Central, Southern and Eastern Europe, and also Latin America, in order to meet the needs of people with this more prevalent form of CF. Although we will be expanding to many more countries, the incremental investment is relatively small given the limited sales and marketing infrastructure needed in each country.","In summary, we are pleased with the progress we are making with KALYDECO as it continues to be made available to more patients who could benefit, and we are maintaining our KALYDECO net revenue guidance for the year. Also, our launch preparations for the lumacaftor\/ivacaftor combination are well underway, and we are focused on bringing this transformational medicine to as many CF patients around the world as soon as possible.","I'll now hand the call over to Ian.","Ian F. Smith","Thanks, Stuart, and good evening, everyone. In my remarks tonight, I will review our financial results and then discuss near-term financial metrics that reflect our longer-term financial expectations of the business.","First are the financials. This quarter, we generated $122 million in total non-GAAP revenues, which included KALYDECO revenues of $113 million. The KALYDECO revenues are up 15% versus the second quarter of 2013 as we continue to expand the number of patients we treat.","Our second quarter non-GAAP total operating expenses were $237 million, a decrease of $44 million compared to the second quarter of last year. Within our operating expenses, our non-GAAP R&D expenses were $179 million for the second quarter of 2014, a reduction of $11 million compared to the second quarter of 2013. And non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $58 million for the second quarter of 2014 compared to $90 million in the second quarter of last year. As we have stated, these reductions in operating expenses, overall, reflect Vertex's decreased investments in hepatitis C and a refocus towards CF medicines.","Our non-GAAP net loss was $142 million or $0.61 per share compared to prior year net loss of $6 million. This increase loss was the result of significantly reduced, now excluded, HCV [ph] revenues in 2014.","The key priority entering this year as we move through an investment period was to maintain financial strength and position the company for future revenue and earnings growth driven by the success of our CF medicines. I'm happy to report that at the end of the second quarter, we have achieved both: a strong financial position; and the successful progression of our CF medicines that position us for our future financial growth.","Additionally, following the positive Phase III data for the ivacaftor\/lumacaftor combination, which provided greater confidence in our future growth, we signed a credit agreement for $500 million; $300 million of which we added to our balance sheet in July, giving us now nearly $1.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on our balance sheet. This additional cash strengthens our balance sheet and provides added flexibility as we work to further enhance treatment of cystic fibrosis. Specifically, we expect to utilize this financial position to support collaborations in priority programs in CF and in other areas.","Now to our financial guidance. It remains unchanged for 2014, reflecting our expectations of growth in KALYDECO revenues and management of our operating expenses. Our KALYDECO net revenue guidance of $470 million to $500 million for 2014 anticipates the following: revenues from Canada following the recently signed letter of intent to enable public reimbursement; revenues from Europe following the potential approval of KALYDECO for use in additional gating mutations; and revenues from Australia following the potential completion of reimbursement in the second half of 2014. Reimbursement in Australia is the key risk in achieving our KALYDECO revenue guidance for the full year.","We are maintaining our non-GAAP total revenue guidance to be in the range of $520 million to $550 million, of which $470 million to $500 million relates to KALYDECO. Our total revenue guidance also includes royalties and other collaboration revenues, including those from our recent out licensing of VX-787, our novel flu medicine to Johnson & Johnson, for which we expect to recognize the majority of the $30 million upfront payment in the second half of 2014.","We are also maintaining 2014 non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $890 million to $930 million. SG&A expense will increase incrementally going into 2015 as we seek to support label and geographic expansion for KALYDECO and prepare for the potential launch of ivacaftor and lumacaftor combination.","We currently anticipate the R&D expense will decrease somewhat in the second half of 2014, reflecting the completion of the Phase III TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT studies.","Positive Phase III data for a lumacaftor and ivacaftor combination has provided us greater business confidence in terms of our ability to treat many more people with CF, which puts us on a pathway to profitability and financial growth. To echo Jeff Leiden's comments earlier in the call, our 3 strategic priorities are: one, transform the treatment of CF by a continued internal investment and exploring external opportunities; two, invest internally and externally to advance the development of innovative medicines to treat other serious diseases; and three, deliver long-term sustainable growth to enable continued investment in the business. Successful execution on these priorities will enable us to realize our vision to be a leader in developing therapies for CF and other serious diseases and to deliver meaningful return for our shareholders.","If successful, we will achieve a financial profile consistent with our large-cap biotech peers, specifically a growing revenue line based on the expansion of the number of patients we may treat with high-value medicines; total operating expenses relatively similar to current levels; high operating margins given significant leverage from the revenue opportunity; and significant cash flow generation. We look forward to sharing additional development and regulatory milestones in the coming months.","With that, I'll ask the operator to please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to ask you about the lumacaftor at KALYDECO, the Expanded Access Program. What can you tell us about it? And will you be able to provide access to patients that are younger than 12 years of age? And I have a follow-up.","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","Geoff, it's Jeff Chodakewitz, thanks for the question. We are working with our investigators, the CF Foundation, patients, to move forward on Expanded Access. But we really feel that what we need to do next is gain more experience in patients who have FEV1 less than 40, and so we're actively working on developing a protocol that we can put in place and get the drug to patients in that category. And then once we have that data, we'll understand more and see how to proceed from there.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just on the data today for heterozygous delta patients. A, was it a surprise to you guys? And B, does it sort of validate your view that you'll have to have 2 correctors plus KALYDECO? And can you tell us anything about the next-gen corrector that you guys are still working through preclinical?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","Sure. Thanks. So first of all, no, it was not a surprise. And given the Phase II data, it really is essentially as we expected, but we did want to be sure that we understood this given the medical need and the importance for patients. In terms of the -- your question about the next generation and what else for that population, as we mentioned, we are making progress on our next-generation compounds. We have multiple compounds in lead op and things that are -- in terms of even greater activity that we're finding. And so we are anxious to bring one or more compounds forward next year. In terms of whether this population will require 3 drugs, I think that is really still a question. We understand that probably is the best chance, but there are some aspects of VX-661 that has slightly different characteristics like the lack of a drug-drug interaction that affects ivacaftor levels and penetration into the lung. And so we'll have to think about whether we need to understand; what the 2 drug combination might be able to achieve. That's how we're thinking about it right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets.","John Chung - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This is John on behalf of Michael Yee. First, a quick one. Based on -- on the results today, in the heterozygous study, given that the exacerbations in the TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT were so strong, do you have any details on that? And I have one follow-up.","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","So we're -- this is still early data. We're still trying to understand all the information. But remember, this was only a study for 8 weeks in 120 patients. So whatever data we have, it's not going to be very meaningful.","John Chung - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. Then as a follow-up, as you think and plan for the potential launch of the combo 809 drug for homozygous patients, how do you think the uptake of this would be similar or different from your experience with KALYDECO given if you think about how KALYDECO managed to be well saturated within 3 quarters? But that -- this is only in target population of approximately, I believe, around 1,000, while for the new indication, could be almost as big as 15x that.","Stuart A. Arbuckle","Yes, it's a great question. It's really too early to provide specific guidance around the launch trajectory and peak penetration. We do know that patients are waiting with great anticipation for this combination product because there's no other medicines that treat the underlying cause of the disease. But as you said, in comparison to the G551D population, that's a significantly smaller population than people who have the F508del homozygous mutation. And that is going to present a kind of a logistical challenge to CF centers.","John Chung - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just one more. Along those lines, how many of those F508del homozygous patients are well identified and within the system?","Stuart A. Arbuckle","If given the prevalence of really very robust CF registries in, certainly, most of the major markets, I would say that the vast majority of the 508del homozygote population is well characterized.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I've kind of a company-building question. You guys talked about your objectives of advancing your internal pipeline and also looking outside the company for what assets may be relevant to you. And at the same time, it looks like you've bolstered your balance sheet a little bit. You talked about the $1.2 billion that you have on the balance sheet right now plus access to more. Does that -- should we take that as a signal that you've moved closer to deciding what directions you want to go in outside of CF? And what sorts of verticals should we be thinking about longer term for Vertex? I know you guys have spoken kind of vaguely about the types of programs that you'd be interested in, but I'm just wondering, are you getting any closer here? Is there any update that you can give us?","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Yes, thanks for the question. This is Jeff Leiden. So; I think we've been pretty consistent in our strategy over the last couple of years in saying that we are interested in serious specialty diseases where we think we can actually make transformative medicine. Certainly, CF is a beautiful example of that. And we plan to do that both internally and externally. So from an internal standpoint, we haven't talked a lot about it yet, but we do have programs in cancer and progressive MS, for example, in Huntington's disease, and all of those. If you think about it, are very much like CF, right? Very serious diseases without much treatment, where we think there's a scientific opportunity to make a difference. And similarly, we are looking outside. And one of the reasons we strengthened our balance sheet is to allow us to do certain kinds of strategic transactions, starting in CF, where we want to complement our internal resources, but also in other serious diseases outside that fit that kind of mode.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And maybe just a quick follow-up on the heterozygous results today. Obviously, minimal effect on FEV1 here, but it looks like you did observe something on CFQ-R and sweat chloride. Is there anything to conclude from that? Does that give you any maybe confidence that adding another piece of the puzzle with the triple combo is going to help?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","So it's Jeff Chodakewitz. I think in terms of the sweat chloride, we think that it is an important marker. I think that -- and I don't think this is new, it's really about saying, \"Are we hitting pharmacologically the target?\" And \"Is it driving at pharmacological activity?\" We think that's important for how we think about compounds, and that we're on the right track. I think that, that will be valuable information. I don't think the fact that we didn't see an FEV1 really changes that. In terms of the CFQ-R results, I think we're really interpreting that with caution. We're going to -- we'll look at that, but it was a somewhat variable response, and I think we just have to learn more.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo.","Brian Corey Abrahams - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just wondered if you had any clarity on the dose you plan to file on for 809 in combination with KALYDECO. And do your regulatory plans for ivacaftor or lumacaftor include a fix to those combo, the 2 components?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","It's Jeff Chodakewitz again. So we're still analyzing the data, but we do plan to make our dosing decisions this quarter. We think it's going to be soon. And if the -- we have those opportunities, we do anticipate trying to deliver fixed dose combinations.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.","Alethia Young - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's Alethia for Robyn. Maybe 2 questions: One, what -- can you give us a little bit more granularity in Europe about where kind of the most prevalent populations are on the F508del just so when you think about modeling? And I have a follow-up.","Stuart A. Arbuckle","I can talk about where the populations are in Europe. Actually, they're pretty broadly spread. I mean, this is the most prevalent form of CF, and so pretty much follows the CF population and the population overall in those markets. And so it's a much less concentrated form of CF in something like G551D oversee the Celtic mutation. So it's more broadly spread, more evenly distributed and that's the reason why we are going to need to expand into some new countries to be able to reach those children and adults with this form of CF.","Alethia Young - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And just as a follow-up on the -- your residual function trial on Phase III. Like what do you -- how are you thinking about duration on that trial? And do you think that 661 could help the duration be a little shorter in that trial in Phase III?","Stuart A. Arbuckle","So can we just clarify the question? It's -- to be honest, you're not going through real clear. If you could just clarify the question, was it regarding how we think about those residual function patients with...","Alethia Young - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","How long the trial should be run? Like how do you think a reasonable Phase III would be for the residual function population?","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Hey, Robyn, I think -- this is Jeff Leiden. I think the question you're asking is the length of the trial and also the role of 661 in residual function, if I heard you correctly?","Alethia Young - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Yes. So I think we are learning a lot, as Jeff Chodakewitz said about the length and size of these trials. And I also think we're learning a lot about the different combinations. And we do plan to take all of that into account, as well as our residual function data when we go to the regulators and talk about size duration of the trials. And also about monotherapy versus a combination therapy. So I think you can anticipate hearing about more about all of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein.","Wen Shi","This is actually Wen Shi here for Geoff. Two questions. The first one is for Stuart. So in preparation for the combo launch, what sort of payor discussions have you had both in the U.S. and outside the U.S.? Right, so we've heard that you've already gotten some press mention for U.S. with Medicaid. And then also outside of U.S., you are having some difficulties, for example, in Australia, all right? So now with the G551D homozygous being a significant step up in patient population, so how do you anticipate that reimbursement and pricing is going to happen both in the U.S. and ex-U.S.?","Stuart A. Arbuckle","Yes, so we really haven't spoken to payors about the combination product because we didn't really have the Phase III data to be able to have those really meaningful discussions. They would've been purely theoretical. So now that we've got the data, we are beginning program of research to go out and talk with payors, both in the U.S. and internationally. That process is really just beginning. In terms of what challenges we may have, I think what we know is that we've got a medicine, which has a really impressive benefit for patients. It works really well on things that are important to payors, to physicians, to patients. We know there's a high level of anticipation for the product because nothing else treats the underlying cause of the disease. And whilst it is a larger patient population, the G551D patient population, it's still -- patients 12 and over with this form of CF still only accounts for 22,000 patients in the U.S., Europe and Australia. And so it's still a very targeted patient population. So whilst it's a bigger population, it's still a very ultra orphan population. Then the other thing I would say is I'd use some caution extrapolating from one particular instance issue that we're having with Arkansas Medicaid. That's one isolated incident here in the U.S. And whilst Australia, we have yet to reach an agreement, we've reached agreement and are getting reimbursed in 18 other countries around the world. And so I'd just caution you against extrapolating from those exceptions to projecting those to be the rule.","Wen Shi","Yes. As a quick follow-up, can you speak to your -- and if any plans for R117H in the children patient population, as well as patients with nonsense mutations in CFTR.","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","So it's Jeff Chodakewitz. Our -- as you know, our pivotal trial in R117H actually did enroll children, as well as adults. I think we understand that data well. Even though we missed the primary endpoint in the study, we believe we have a strong argument and have filed that. And so -- and that will include potentially data, or will include the data from children, and I think the data have to be a dialogue because we studied a large number of patients. We studied a significant percentage of all the patients with R117H globally. So we expect to -- we don't expect to do additional studies in R117H. We really do anticipate trying to understand the data that we have and make our best arguments. In terms of young children, are you -- I want to be sure I understand your second question. Are you talking about...","Wen Shi","Nonsense mutation is about 10% of the patient population. Are you thinking about some internal or external combinations to address that?","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Yes, I think the patients with not -- true nonsense mutations on both alleles obviously are not going to be helped by our current corrector therapies. And that's one of the areas where we're going to need to look outside as well for additional kinds of therapies to address those patients. As you say, it's about 10% or less of the total population.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Liisa Bayko with JMP Securities.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","First question is for Ian. I just wondered if you could quantitate in some way the revenue that might be at risk if -- for 2014 if Australia doesn't pull through with reimbursement. Or maybe tell us how many patients there are and when you are expecting reimbursement? Just some way to quantitate that component.","Ian F. Smith","Yes. Thanks, Lisa, for the question. I'm not going to go down to the specifics to Australia. We're involved in, as you might expect, an interesting discussion down there in Australia and I don't want to go into a lot of detail, specifically for the revenue from that country.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Could you tell us how many patients there are at least or something like that with the G551D?","Ian F. Smith","Yes, there's approximately 200 patients.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","200, okay.","Ian F. Smith","Yes. And therefore, you can apply a normal uptake to it. But I would just add, though, as you try to kind of pinpoint the kind of the revenue within our guidance, I would just add that given that we are dependent on Australia coming through, it helps you understand where we are in the range of our guidance that we set earlier this year, which pushes us towards the lower end of that range that we've provided earlier this year.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then my next question is just one on pricing of the combination. Now that you've sort of had a little bit more time to think about the data, what's the right way for us to think about pricing? Is it sort of pricing that's lower than current KALYDECO? Or do you think that this can command more than that given there's 2 drugs? Or just what's the right way to think about really pricing for the combination for the homozygous 508 population?","Stuart A. Arbuckle","Yes, Lisa, it's Stuart here. It's too early to make any comments on pricing. As you say, we do have the Phase III data now. Now that we have that data, as I referred to earlier, we can begin to build the clinical and economic evidence and begin to test that with payors to develop the support we're going to need for the pricing and reimbursement discussions that will happen down the line here. But we're not in a position to make specific comments on pricing at this time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.","Unknown Analyst","This is [indiscernible] sitting in for Mark. Just a couple of questions. One of them, just curious, wondering about the long-term data from TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT when we might get an update on that? And then the other question, just sort of following up on the discussion about pipeline development and acquisitions and perhaps, you touched on it and I missed it. But just trying to better understand the features of those products, programs that make them attractive to, specifically to Vertex.","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","It's Jeff Chodakewitz, I'll take the first part of that. So in terms of the ongoing long-term extension study from TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT, we do have planned interim analysis and that will include safety evaluation, as well as FEV1. I guess I'd note that we have submitted abstracts on the 24-week TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT studies to NACFC and hope to be able to present those there. And our goal will be to include information coming out of the interim analysis at that meeting as well.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","And then on your second question on attributes of assets that might be interesting to us. Obviously, the first set of assets would be those that could complement our own internal CF assets. We certainly understand now the combination therapy is going to be the rule for most patients, particularly as we move to higher and higher levels of efficacy. And so as you might expect, we're looking very closely adding 4 assets that could complement our internal assets in CF. Beyond that, as we've said before, we're very interested in disease -- in very serious specialty diseases where we see an opportunity to make or acquire transformative therapies. Therapies that make the same kind of difference that our CF medicines have made in CF. And so as we move forward, you can expect to see us looking at those kinds of assets.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi.","Kumaraguru Raja","This is Kumar Raja in for Yaron. So have you seen any changes in U.S. reimbursement? And are payors evaluating the response to KALYDECO-class benchmark to support ongoing payment? And for the CF collaborations which you are planning to do, is that going to hit R&D? And when will that happen? Whether it will hit this year or next year?","Stuart A. Arbuckle","Yes, on reimbursement here in the U.S., the reimbursement for KALYDECO has been excellent from the moment the product was launched back in January, 2012, and continues to be very broad. All eligible patients are able to access KALYDECO with the one notable exception that's been referred to in Arkansas. But other than that exceptional circumstance, KALYDECO is widely available to all eligible patients.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Katherine Xu with William Blair.","Y. Katherine Xu - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I'm just curious about a recent paper. They did some in vitro experiments in F508 deletion cells and then found antagonism between KALYDECO and lumacaftor, whereas in [indiscernible] experiments, they were additive. Can you just comment on why that was the case, just in the preclinical setting? The cells, design, the readouts, what are the differences?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","So it's Jeff Chodakewitz. I think it's really hard for us to speak about somebody else's work. I think I really would just refer back to the experience we've had as you noted in our systems. And as we talked about in our prepared comments, really, the fact that the assays in our labs have really been such important value in terms of identifying compounds and the translatability to the clinic. And ultimately, we have the kind of clinical data that we spoke about on our last call.","Y. Katherine Xu - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then if you don't mind, just a quick follow-up. See, in Canada, if you could remind us how many G551D patients are there?","Stuart A. Arbuckle","Yes, there's about 100 G551D patients in Canada, roughly evenly split between those that have private reimbursement and those who have public reimbursement.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Friedman with Morgan Stanley.","Brienne Kugler - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Brienne Kugler in for Dave. Just wanted to clarify some of your earlier comments. So will you be filing with KALYDECO 809 on fixed dose co-formulation? And will you need to run any additional studies to support the co-formulation?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","So it's Jeff Chodakewitz. We obviously still as we talked about -- have to decide on the dose, but we do plan to file. And with a fixed dose combination, we don't have -- need to do additional studies.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney with Robert Baird.","Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess -- certainly, it seems like payors push back on KALYDECO pricing. To some extent, it reflects their concerns about combination pricing. I just -- Jeff, if you could characterize, is this explicit in any of your payor discussions? Or is this something that you're just kind of talking about to general media outside of that? And if it is part of the payor discussions on KALYDECO pricing, how are you addressing that with them?","Stuart A. Arbuckle","Yes, I think the payor discussions we've had have been centered on the approved product. And while there is an awareness that we are looking to develop a pipeline of products, the conversations we've had with payors have been about providing access for patients who have the specific forms of CF that we currently labeled for.","Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And just on a housekeeping item. The INCIVEK revenue that you booked non-GAAP of $9 million, what's driving that? Is that just an accounting figure? It doesn't seem like demand sales based on IMS.","Ian F. Smith","[indiscernible] accessible phase. It's not accounting. There are actually real sales, and maybe Stu wants to give a little bit of background behind that.","Stuart A. Arbuckle","Yes, exactly. As Ian said, this isn't really an accounting adjustment. It is the impactive residual demand for INCIVEK. And so we thought it was notable to reference it. We're not necessarily predicting that there'll be meaningful INCIVEK sales going forward, but we thought it was useful to reference it, seeing that it's part of our non-GAAP revenue.","Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Do you have any idea in what sort of paradigm is that being used? Is that being used on a peg [indiscernible] backbone [ph]?","Stuart A. Arbuckle","We really don't have any insight into how that is being used as we reduced our investments and all of our support for INCIVEK some time ago. We really have little insight to what's going on in that market. We just thought it was worthwhile noting it as it's a part of our non-GAAP revenues.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen.","Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple. First, on the children study ages 2 to 5, you said the primary endpoint is safety and then the secondary endpoint's more efficacy related. Are there any criteria for those secondary endpoints to be hit in order for you to file? Or is it really just if you show safety you'll be able to extend the label down to H2?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","No, it's really PK and safety, just to be clear. It's -- as you'd expect, most of measures can't even use in children that age. So it's -- and the submission is really just focused on PK and safety.","Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that you might investigate 661 and heterozygous patients. Are there any ongoing studies going on at 661 and heterozygous patients? What data, I guess, will you have at the time that you design a Phase III program from 661 and heterozygous?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","We do not have any ongoing studies or data specifically in that population with 661 right now. The only ongoing study is really the 12-week study that we've referenced in the homozygous patients.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","The only thing, maybe to remind you of is, that we do have the previous data on the heterozygous patients very specific subset of those who have Delta 508 on one allele and a KALYDECO responsive mutation on the other allele. And that did show a significant, incremental benefit of adding 661. That will be an important part of our exploration of 661 going forward.","Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Would it -- just trying to get a hang on, it's our process. Would it be that if the 12-week study for 661 in homozygous patients produces somewhat better than 508, maybe you'd be willing to extrapolate that to the heterozygous patients and that would be sufficient to go forward with the Phase III? Is that kind of -- is that sort of the thinking?","Jeffrey M. Leiden","It's a good question. I think it's maybe even a little broader than that. As Jeff said, we really think about 661 in at least 3 or 4 settings. One is obviously in the homozygous patients and asking is it -- does it show benefit over and above what we see with 809. One is in the special population of heterozygous, which would really be a way of improving efficacy in those patients with the KALYDECO responsive allele and 508 in the other allele, and that's the number 70% of those who have a KALYDECO responsive allele. Then, of course, there's -- they are the what we call the hatmins [ph]. That is patients who have a Delta F508 on one allele and a non-KALYDECO responsive mutation on the other allele. And as Jeff said, there are some different properties of 661 from 809 that we do want to explore in that population to see whether we would see incremental benefits there. And then, of course, there's just the basis of a 3-drug regimen with our next-generation corrector. So 661 is really a way that we see lots of different potential uses, many different options, and our plan is to explore those as quickly as possible in parallel.","Michael Partridge","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Yigal Nochomovitz with Oppenheimer.","Yigal D. Nochomovitz - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to clarify something on the next-generation corrector program. Should we expect the next-generation correctors are going to get slotted into the combo regimens from day 1? Or is there going to be a period where we see some initial monotherapy work to establish efficacy and safety? And I have a quick follow-up.","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","It's Jeff Chodakewitz. So I think from the -- when we first go into [indiscernible], I think we have to, as you noted, to really understand that -- to be sure we understand the performance of the drug itself. We have to start with at least some limited studies with monotherapy, not necessarily in patients, but at least in healthy adults. And then we would take it from there.","Yigal D. Nochomovitz - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then, just very quickly, following up on Brian's question from earlier in the call on the homozygous combo filing. Have you done any further data analysis on the TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT results to point -- to 1 dose as potentially preferable over the other? As well as if you could comment on any considerations regarding regimens, simplicity and manufacturing requirements that are playing into your decision as to which dose to file on.","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","So I think that the -- as I mentioned, the -- our analysis is really still ongoing and what we're really trying -- the biggest driver, as Stuart talked about, was really about the clinical data. We hope to be able to get there soon. Certainly, from a patient perspective, we think that the match regimen where patients take both drugs twice a day and could use one kind of image has advantages for patients in terms of simplicity. But we're really still looking at all the information.","Operator","That brings our question-and-answer session to a close. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will open the lines for questions.","As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and a replay will be available following the conclusion of tonight's call on our website. Joining me on tonight's call are Dr. Jeff Leiden, Chairman and CEO; Stuart Arbuckle, Chief Commercial Officer; Ian Smith, Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. David Altshuler, our Chief Scientific Officer.

Good evening everyone. Three years ago we outlined a clear strategy designed to establish a foundation for sustainable business growth. This evening I'm pleased to report that we continue to make excellent progress toward achieving our long-term vision for 2016 and beyond, significant revenues and revenue growth from multiple high-value medicines, high operating margins and a pipeline of additional transformational medicines.","Our goal in CF is to reach the vast majority of people with this serious disease and to continue to enhance the benefit for the patients who we treat, and we continue to build on a track record of innovations discovered, develop and deliver transformative medicines to more people with CF.","Let me summarize our recent commercial success and development progress in CF. In July ORKAMBI became the first FDA-approved medicine to treat the underlying cause of CF for the approximately 8,500 people in the US 12 years and older with two copies of the F508del mutation, and as of September 30, 2015, we already were treating more than 3,000 of these patients.","Our sNDA has been accepted by the FDA for the expanded use of KALYDECO in people aged two and older with one of 23 residual function mutations that result in CF. This may accelerate access to KALYDECO for more than 1,500 patients in the US.","The European Union CHMP recently issued three positive opinions for KALYDECO and ORKAMBI, all with the potential to significantly expand the number of eligible patients for our CF medicines. In fact, at this time last year, we were approved to treat approximately 2,600 people with CF worldwide, whereas today there are more than 25,000 patients approved or under regulatory submission for our medicines.","We are currently conducting two Phase 3 clinical studies of ORKAMBI in children ages 6 to 11 years old and plan to submit an sNDA to the FDA in the first half of 2016. There are approximately 5,500 children with CF in the US and Europe with two copies of the F508del mutation.","Following closely behind ORKAMBI, we have the VX-661 plus ivacaftor pivotal Phase 3 development program underway, which is expected to enroll more than 1,000 people with CF across four studies. We expect to complete enrollment in mid 2016.","At the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference we announced that we are advancing two next generation correctors, VX-152 and VX-440, into the clinic, and we expect to dose the first healthy volunteer with VX-440 this week. We believe these new correctors hold tremendous promise as part of a triple combination regimen for the 80% to 90% of CF patients with at least one F508del allele, thereby possibly allowing us to treat patients we are not yet treating and also to enhance the benefit for those we already treat.","The strength of the ORKAMBI launch to date and the continued expansion in the number of people eligible for KALYDECO are further evidence that we continue to execute against our key goal to become a company that can reinvest to create future medicines and deliver returns to shareholders.","As I noted at the NACF conference we also continued to advance early stage development programs outside of CF for the treatment of cancer, pain and other diseases, which represents an important diversification of our development portfolio. Dr. David Altshuler, our Chief Scientific Officer, will discuss our research strategy and some of our emerging compounds later on this call. As you know, David was one of the four founding members of the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT where he served as Deputy Director and Chief Economic Officer. David is an experienced physician and human geneticist and we tapped him to lead our research organization earlier this year so that we can bring his experience to bear as we continue to deliver transformational medicines to more people.","Before I turn the call over to Stuart, I wanted to mention how delighted we are to have entered into a research collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics to discover and develop potential new treatments aimed at the underlying genetic causes of human disease. Gene editing represents a new and powerful technology platform that could represent a future paradigm shift in the treatment of CF as well as other genetic diseases, and we're excited to be working with CRISPR, a company at the forefront of using gene editing to create new treatments.","With that, I'll hand it over to Stuart to discuss Vertex's third quarter sales performance.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Thanks, Jeff, and hello everyone. Tonight I will review KALYDECO performance in the third quarter and our progress in making ORKAMBI available to eligible patients in the US. Global sales of KALYDECO this quarter were $166 million, comprised of US sales of approximately $95 million and ex-US sales of approximately $71 million. This represents a 31% increase over the $127 million we recorded in the same quarter last year. The growth of KALYDECO is a result of continued geographic and label expansion. We have seen strong uptake in patients with the R117H mutation following approval in the US in late 2014, and in children ages 2 to 5 with eligible mutations following US approval at the end of March 2015.","Internationally, there has also been rapid uptake of KALYDECO, by eligible patients in Australia and in patients with non-G551D gating mutations in several European countries where these mutations are prevalent. We've made significant progress in securing reimbursement in Europe this year. As a result, the vast majority of eligible gating patients in Europe now have access to KALYDECO. We expect that growth in the number of patients receiving KALYDECO globally in the fourth quarter of 2015 and into 2016 will be tempered by enrollment in the VX-661 pivotal program, as previously described.","Now turning to ORKAMBI. Since the FDA approval of ORKAMBI on July 2, we have been focused on educating healthcare providers on the medicine and working with payers to secure reimbursement for the approximately 8,500 eligible patients in the US. Sales for the third quarter totaled $131 million. More than 3,000 patients have started treatment in the US, underscoring the important advance this medicine represents in the treatment of CF and the strong interest from both patients and their doctors. Our field teams around the country have visited all of the 275 CF centers in the US since approval, and virtually every center has initiated patients in ORKAMBI. As we anticipated, interest in the medicine is very high, which has put a significant administrative burden on centers as they work to initiate patients on treatment.","As expected, we are seeing broad coverage of and access to ORKAMBI, which reflects payer understanding and appreciation of the seriousness of the disease and the significant value of a medicine that treats the underlying cause of CF. The majority of commercial and government payers with eligible patients are reimbursing for ORKAMBI. In those plans with published policies and\/or defined prior authorization criteria, almost all are reimbursing to label. There are a small number of plans not yet allowing access to ORKAMBI and we anticipate they will complete their formal ORKAMBI reviews and define their final policies in the coming months.","Our patient support team has been working diligently to help patients navigate the reimbursement process and is working to reduce the time it takes for patients to get their prescriptions filled. For any chronic medication, compliance and adherence are important facets of patient care, so they will be increasing their focus to ensure that patients are able to take ORKAMBI as prescribed and so benefit from the medicine.","Outside of the US, we continue to expect approval in the EU in the fourth quarter of this year. Our EU commercial infrastructure is largely in place and upon approval, we will then begin pricing and reimbursement discussions on a country by country basis to secure reimbursement for eligible patients who may benefit from ORKAMBI. With KALYDECO, the completion of reimbursement discussion took nine to 20 months following approval.","In summary, geographic and label expansion continue to drive significant growth in the number of patients we treat with KALYDECO, and with the launch of ORKAMBI, we are significantly expanding the number of eligible CF patients we treat.","I'll now hand the call over to Ian.","Ian F. Smith - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Stuart, and good evening everyone. Firstly to the financials. Our CF revenues were $297 million this quarter as we significantly increased the number of eligible people we treat with KALYDECO and ORKAMBI. KALYDECO sales of $166 million were up 31% versus the third quarter last year and up 7% versus the second quarter of 2015.","Now ORKAMBI. The launch in the US is off to a strong start. We recorded $131 million in net revenues. Inventory levels are normal with one to two weeks in the channel. Gross to net adjustments were in the high single digits due to a more rapid uptake for patients within commercial plans as compared to government pay plans. We continue to expect Medicaid mix to be 35% to 40% in the longer term, which will increase gross to net adjustments into the mid teens by late 2016. We expect continued revenue growth into 2016 as we approach peak penetration in the US market in the second half of 2016","As for Europe and other ex-US countries, we expect to recognize the first ORKAMBI revenues in Europe in the first half of 2016. These revenues will be mainly generated in Germany given that pricing and reimbursement approvals in other countries will take some time to finalize. We do expect French regulatory authority to grant an ATU, or temporary authorization for use, for ORKAMBI in 2015 but we will not recognize revenues from these sales until we receive formal reimbursement approval in France.","Our third quarter non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses were $278 million, an increase of $66 million compared to last year. This increase is mainly attributable to an increase in sales and marketing expenses supporting the launch of ORKAMBI and research and development cost to support the advancement of our CF medicines. The scale of our R&D organization and SG&A infrastructure is appropriate for our business. We expect modest increases in operating expense in 2016 and these will be driven by the progression of our CF medicines in development and geographic expansion to support the international launch of ORKAMBI, but we are rapidly moving toward steady state. While we expect to invest significantly in R&D we are committed to managing our operating expenses to ensure significant operating margins moving forward.","Our non-GAAP net loss has narrowed to $32 million compared to prior year non-GAAP net loss of $86 million, and this is primarily driven by the significant increase in CF product revenues. From a balance sheet perspective, we've maintained a strong position with approximately $1 billion of cash at the end of the quarter.","Now let's turn to the 2015 financial guidance, specifically KALYDECO revenues and the combined R&D and SG&A expenses. At the time of our second quarter 2015 earnings call in July, we anticipated 2015 KALYDECO net revenues to be between $575 million and $590 million, and we are now increasing KALYDECO net revenue guidance to be between $605 million and $620 million for the full year of 2015. For the non-GAAP operating expenses, we now expect our combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense for the full year to be in the middle of the range we provided in January of this year of $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion.","In summary, we are in a strong financial position today and focused on delivering financial profile that includes sustainable revenue and earnings growth while continuing to invest to create more medicines and support access to those medicines already approved. Now over to David.","David Matthew Altshuler - Executive Vice President, Global Research and Chief Scientific Officer","Thanks, Ian. It's great to be here. Good evening everyone. At Vertex, our strategy is to invest in science to create transformative medicines for serious diseases in specialty markets. This is an enormous challenge because doing anything for the first time involves considerable risk, but it's also a great opportunity, because we live in a time of accelerating breakthroughs in science that can be applied to solve important problems that were previously thought to be intractable. There are three main points I would like to make about Vertex research, and I'll make comments on each of them.","First, CF represents Vertex's most significant success to date and is where we expect our research and early development will continue to have the biggest impact in the near term. Second, cystic fibrosis provides a good template to understand the kind of diseases we expect to pursue in the future. And third, lessons from our work in CF are guiding our early clinical programs in other areas. I'll reference five different candidate medicines in pain and oncology that were discovered by Vertex scientists and that are progressing in early development.","As you know, in CF we're advancing two next generation correctors, VX-152 and VX-440, out of our labs and into first in human studies. In vitro data show that in combination with VX-661 and ivacaftor, these compounds resulted in chloride transport that was approximately three fold greater than the use of lumacaftor\/ivacaftor combination in these cells. These data gives us optimism in that hopefully one day we will be able to address the vast majority of CF patients with a triple combination therapy and also to continue to enhance the benefit for those we are already treating.","Our research strategy with CF is not limited to our internal programs. We are also looking externally to bring in compounds that complement our CFTR modulators. And this is enabled by our CF research expertise. Our CF research platform allows us to robustly characterize the activity of external compounds and their potential to work in combination with our existing regimens. This approach formed the basis for the collaboration we signed with Parion for ENaC inhibitors. And we showed at NACF the ability of Parion's ENaC inhibitor to enhance the effects of ORKAMBI in vitro.","We are looking far into the future of CF treatment to understand what impact new treatment modalities could have. This week, we announced a collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics to use the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing platform to create new medicines. CRISPR-Cas9 is an important scientific and technical breakthrough that holds significant promise for the future discovery of potentially transformative treatments. And this collaboration will evaluate the use of CRISPR-Cas9 across multiple diseases where targets have been validated through human genetics. We are excited to begin our initial gene editing research on discovering treatments to address the mutations and genes known to cause and contribute to CF and sickle cell disease.","Thinking about CF more conceptually, the combination of what we learned through our CF research and the increasing flow of information from human genetics forms a template for our future discovery of precision medicines. First, our CF research program was directed at a target that was validated as an underlying cause based on human genetics. Second, by understanding the natural history of disease and using proprietary in vitro assays, we had a highly focused goal for CFTR modulation. Third, we had early markers of clinical effect that were highly predictive of late stage success. And finally, these features have led to repeated success from the lab to the clinic.","There are many lessons here that we can apply so that we can invest wisely and increase our chances of success in the future. Our investments are being evaluated based on insights from human biology, the therapeutic approach and clinical development path criteria that we learned from our work in CF and can now apply to other diseases.","In the area of pain, we have two compounds in early development, VX-150 and VX-241 target sodium channels with strong rationale for the treatment of pain based on human genetics and well documented roles in pain sensation. Specifically, the basis of our program is a key insight from human biology, the gain or loss of function mutations in key sodium channels can increase or decrease pain sensation.","In cancer we have three compounds in early development, VX-970, VX-803 and VX-984, that target key cellular pathways responsible for DNA repair, a fundamental mechanism underlying the development and growth of cancer. In fact, DNA repair was recognized in 2015 with the Nobel Prize in chemistry citing three academic scientists for their pioneering efforts to map at a molecular level how cells repair damaged DNA. The Nobel Committee specifically cited the implication of this work for the development of new cancer treatments.","In healthy cells, properly functioning DNA repair mechanisms protect against the development of problematic mutations. In cancer however, these systems of DNA repair are known to go awry, allowing cancer cells to both accumulate mutations and increase their ability to survive and proliferate. The new Vertex cancer medicines now in early development target two key nodes in the DNA repair system, kinases known at ATR and DNA-PK. Modulating activity of these two kinases is predicted to be critical to continued cancer cell survival in the face of DNA damage.","In addition, we believe that these new compounds can be targeted to patients based upon a knowledge of the genomic alterations or characteristics in each patient's cancer, allowing a precision medicine approach to help increase benefit by targeting those patients more likely to respond. With the most advanced compound, VX-970, we and a national cancer institute are now conducting a number of early studies in tumor types that are predicted to be responsive to an ATR inhibitor. The first Phase 1 clinical data for VX-970 will be presented at the triple meeting in Boston in November.","In closing, we are pleased with the significant progress we are making in developing additional CF medicines, especially for the tens of thousands of patients living with CF who do not have a medicine that targets the underlying cause of their disease. We look forward to telling you more about our research strategy and our emerging clinical programs as they progress.","And with that, I'll ask the operator to please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Congrats on a great quarter. Two topics I wanted to get some more color on. The first, just on the launch. Can you speak to more specifically how much inventory stock in that was? I think you said one to two weeks, or is that like $15 million to $20 million or so? Maybe help us there. And you said that centers were burdened. I just want to understand that comment a little bit and whether you thought there's any seasonality or things like that as we should be thinking about Q4. So talk a little bit about those things.","And then my second question as a follow-up is on Europe. I know you just got a recommendation for approval, but broadly speaking, should we be thinking about price deltas in US and Europe somewhat similar to what we see for KALYDECO here? How should we think about any deltas there? Thanks.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Okay, Michael, thanks for the questions. On inventory, yes, your assessment is right. It's right in that $15 million to $20 million range, was the initial inventory build for ORKAMBI. The rest is really driven by organic patient demand. In terms of our comments about the burden on CF centers, this is really just reflecting what we heard from centers actually prior to the launch. And we are seeing it play out during the launch. This is just a larger volume of patients than they had to try and get initiated on KALYDECO when we launched it. And so that administrative burden of helping patients through the payer reimbursement process is a very burdensome one for centers. And they certainly are relaying that to us. However, as we said in our prepared remarks, through the end of September, we have seen over 3,000 patients initiating on therapy. So the centers are really working through that process. And I don't think we really are seeing it as a seasonal impact. It really is just a function of working through a new launch with payers. In terms of the EU -","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Would you see seasonality in the fourth quarter? There's a lot of things going on in the fourth quarter. Do you expect any impact there?","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","I don't think so. Not in terms of patient visits and things like that. I wouldn't imagine though what we're going to see is a linear trend in terms of the launch. Launches just don't develop in that way. I think it's going to be a more asymptotic launch curve that you would normally see. But in terms of seasonality, I don't expect that to be much of a factor.","In terms of in Europe, our approach to pricing is going to be very similar to that which it was here, perhaps with once exception. We're certainly going to be taking the same sort of things into account, the seriousness of the disease, the clinical value we've demonstrated through treating the underlying cause of the disease, the investments we've made and continue to want to make in R&D to discover and develop future transformative medicines for CF patients and in other diseases. But we're also going to have to be sensitive to the economic environment in Europe, including the potential budget impact that ORKAMBI could have in what in almost all cases are single payer markets. And so to finish on that and just to reiterate what Ian said in our prepared remarks, we do expect to recognize revenues for ORKAMBI in the EU in 2016, but these revenues are going to be primarily from Germany with minimal if any contribution from other countries.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Afternoon, guys. Congrats on the ORKAMBI launch and thanks for the question. A couple for Stuart and some for David. For Stuart, just on ORKAMBI, wonder if you \u2013 and I know it's early, but can you speak to the wait time to get a script approved? Does it differ among the different payers? And then, again it's early, but when you look at the feedback from the launch in the initial month or two in terms of the profile, is there any differences that you see commercially versus the TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT Phase 3s? And I have some clinical follow-ups.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Sure, Geoff. In terms of wait time, the average time from a prescription being written to a patient actually initiating treatment or getting a pack through specialty pharmacies is about a month right now. Obviously it's very early, and so that number moves around a lot as patients move through the process, but right now it's approximately a month.","In terms of the profile, I guess I'd say the only difference is that obviously TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT had FEV1 criteria, inclusion\/exclusion criteria, so the 40% to 90%. And certainly we're aware that there are patients who've been initiated with FEV1s below 40% and patients who've been initiated with FEV1s above 90% because the vast majority of payers are reimbursing to label and the label doesn't include any FEV1 restrictions. So that's really the major difference that I would suggest between what we're seeing in clinical practice and what we saw in TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then for David on the two next gen correctors, and congrats on getting those, advancing those, do they change the half-life of CFTR, a mature CFTR that's delta F? I know that was a little bit of a hot topic last year at NACF when you look at what VX-809 did to that. And then not on the slide, but I was curious if you had looked directionally, how the second-gen correctors also synergize with ORKAMBI versus the 661\/KALYDECO combination?","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Geoff. This is Jeff Leiden, maybe I'll take those. So in the first question, at least so far we're seeing that when you add all three drugs together, you don't get the effect on correcting CFTR half-life that we've seen with the two drugs, at least with 152 and 440. And your second question was around ORKAMBI. I think we've shown the data with 661, we've shown the data compared to ORKAMBI, and it's really quite similar. We see about that threefold increase.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I got you. Okay. Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Samir Siddhanti - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, this Samir on for Terence. Can you provide any commentary regarding the prescribing turns specifically in October? Thanks very much.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Samir, yeah I mean we're not going to really provide details on a month by month basis. Over the course of the quarter, as we said, we saw just over 3,000 patients initiated. Obviously that's been a fairly steep ramp and I wouldn't anticipate that the launch trajectory is going to be linear. That's just not the way that product launches go.","Samir Siddhanti - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Roden of UBS. Your line is now open.","Matt M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on a great launch. I just want to make sure we're crystal clear on the inventory part. With the levels of inventory that you have, it sounds to me like we should not expect that in the fourth quarter that there's any slack to come out of that system. Just want to verify that that's what you're telling us. And then I guess related on the next quarter's trends, I guess it seems like you're approaching already almost 50% penetration in a partial quarter of sales. Is there any reason that the homozygous F508del population won't be practically fully penetrated by next quarter?","Ian F. Smith - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So, Matt, I'll take the first question on the inventory levels. So I did mention on my prepared remarks that we are at normal inventory levels, which are between one and two weeks. We'd anticipate that being similar at the year end as well. The amount that was actually in the channel relating to one to two weeks at this stage of the launch was approximately $17 million, so that $15 million to $20 million that was mentioned before. I think the key to take away is this is a normal level of inventory as we move quarter to quarter or through the year end.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","And then on the actual number of eligible patients who are on it, it's actually more like 35% rather than the 50%, Matt. 3,000 patients out of the approximately 8,500 eligible patients here in the US. And so as we said, we wouldn't expect it to continue in a linear way. That's just not the way product launches go. There's obviously a lot of initial pent up demand and patients and physicians excited about the launch. We still expect that we are going to get to the vast majority of patients over the course of 2016. But we wouldn't expect the launch trajectory to continue in a linear fashion.","Matt M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. I really appreciate the comments. I guess, Ian, if I could just sneak in a quick capital allocation question. I'm sure you'll be getting a lot of these as your cash flows ramp up. And I don't really mean this from a margin or profitability perspective. I'm just saying that if we do assume some robust margins in the business, can you talk about your priorities for the use of cash? Maybe even rank order in terms of importance, allowing the balances to rise or getting involved in M&A in-licensing or share repurchase activity? Just wanted to get a sense of your broad thinking as you approach the swing to cash flow positivity.","Ian F. Smith - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Thanks for the question, Matt. And just to comment, it's a great question because as we turn profitable, which we do anticipate in the fourth quarter, we're now cash accumulation. And over the years, we've been cash preservation while we reinvest in the business. So we are a different company as we head into the fourth quarter. As we think about the allocation of cash, I start with the receipt of cash is actually the revenue. And just to be basic about this, but the receipt of cash is the revenue.","As we think about reinvestment on allocation of that capital, it does go towards R&D for our business, the internal R&D. But as we develop our business, we also consider the external investment in R&D. And I think you saw that with the example this week of us signing a collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics that we're very excited about. You've also seen it earlier this year where there's been licensing products that complement our approach in CF. So we're already starting to allocate that revenue capital toward internal R&D and also acquire products or expand our scientific footprint. And you should anticipate that to continue.","As far as thinking about other allocation of capital rather than just accumulate on the balance sheet, we do think about our capital structure and the shares outstanding. And we need to continue to think about that going forward, but it becomes a prioritization, and first it is about investment in medicines for the future which provides growth. However, if the capital becomes available that we would consider addressing our capital structure, we'd also make that choice as well.","Matt M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Really helpful. Thanks, Ian.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Brittany R. Terner - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. This is Brittany on for Cory. Thanks for taking the questions. Is there anything you're seeing in the early launch of ORKAMBI in the US that changes your expectations for Europe? And then on the CRISPR collaboration, are there any early signs you're seeing in the applicability of gene therapy to CF? And then also just what advantages did you see with CRISPR versus other gene editing technologies? Thanks.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","In short, Brittany, the answer to your first part of the question is no, not really. I mean we're seeing what we anticipated we'd see with the launch here in the US, which is a lot of enthusiasm from physicians and patients for the first drug that treats the underlying cause of their disease. And I expect there'll be a similar level of enthusiasm from physicians and payers in the EU. So there's really nothing we're seeing here which is changing my view about how I think the launch is going to progress in the EU.","David Matthew Altshuler - Executive Vice President, Global Research and Chief Scientific Officer","And with regard to CRISPR, we believe that CRISPR-Cas9 is a powerful technology that holds really great promise for discovering transformative medicines for genetic diseases including CF. And we're very excited to work with CRISPR Therapeutics as a leader in that field, and it's a good fit for Vertex.","Brittany R. Terner - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ying Huang of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Catherine Y. Hu - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. It's actually Catherine for Ying. A couple questions from us. On the payer mix, of the over 3,000 patients that started in 3Q, what percentage were Medicaid patients? And then can you speak to your expectations for compliance of the ORKAMBI patients versus those on KALYDECO? And then just lastly for the triple combination, just wanted to clarify, are you planning to move both combinations forward, or will you pick one? Thank you.","Ian F. Smith - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So Catherine, a few questions there. Maybe I'll take the first one in terms of the revenue split and Stuart will take the second, and Jeff Chodakewtiz can clean up for us. So first for the split between, let's call it the government channel and the private payer channel, it was about close to 20% in the government channel. That translated to a gross to net adjustment of our gross price of just below 10%. I did make some comments earlier that as this launch proceeds, we do anticipate that the government channel does rise up to somewhere closer to 35%. And when we're at that steady state of 35% government and 65% private, then we would anticipate something in the mid teens as a gross to net adjustment. Stuart.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","And then Catherine in terms of compliance, obviously early days so far in the launch. But in terms of what we would anticipate, overall my anticipation is that our compliance with the therapy will be high, and that's because I think physicians will do a great job explaining to patients, and patients I think on the whole understand that this is a medicine that's treating the underlying cause of their disease. So I think overall the compliance rate is going to be high. I think KALYDECO compliance would be the upper end of my expectations, if I'm perfectly honest. It's the highest compliance rate I've ever seen for any chronic medication. We'll certainly be doing everything we can to appropriately support patients to maintain a high level of compliance with ORKAMBI as well, but I think KALYDECO would be at the upper end of my expectations.","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz - Chief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President","And in terms of next gen, as you know we're going to move both of those molecules into man. We're going to learn about these compounds as they go through the Phase I studies. But assuming the data supports it, we would plan to move both compounds into evaluation in patients.","Catherine Y. Hu - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much and congrats on the quarter.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","David N. Lebowitz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hello. This is David Lebowitz in for Matt. You mentioned earlier in the answer to another question that it was taking about one month to get reimbursement for patients. And I was just curious, going forward as patients start to look to obtain refills, is there any expectation for how payers might address refills? Will there be some point where they want to reevaluate?","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Yes, so it's very common for payers to have reauthorization criteria. It will, they differ from payer to payer, both in terms of the time to when they want to reassess a patient and look to reauthorize. And then also they differ in terms of the criteria. Of the reauthorization criteria that we've seen to date, which is a relatively limited number, but of the ones that we've seen to date, the vast majority have got criteria which are effectively reflective of reimbursing to the label or if the physicians thinks that the patient has seen clinical benefit across a number of different dimensions, reflecting the fact that CF is a complicated, multi system disease.","David N. Lebowitz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, thanks for answering that. And just to jump over to a different topic, there's been some data released recently from competitors on their triple combo and I know you recently at NACS presented some data, some preclinical data on yours and I was just curious if you could juxtapose yours versus theirs and make any overall comments and comparisons?","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","So, David, we'd prefer to keep our comments to our own compounds. So we are very excited about them. We've provided you the HBE data. I would say that we like our position in terms of we already have two marketed medicines. We've got another corrector that is in Phase 3 development that we'd characterize very well given its stage of development. And then with our two next generation correctors coming into the clinic, it provides us the opportunity to move quickly given that we already understand the medicines that we would combine our next gens with.","I'd also point out that we did take our time in choosing the right next generation correctors and the two of them to come into the clinic. And not only were they picked for their performance in preclinical assays with for efficacy and safety but also their pharmaceutical properties. So we believe that we're in a very good position to move those into the clinic very shortly into their healthy studies and then next year to move them into triple combination studies and see some results in patients. So we're looking forward to that.","David N. Lebowitz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you for answering my questions.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Abrahams of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks very much for taking my questions and congrats on the strong ORKAMBI launch. So obviously you have very rapid penetration. It sound like a lot of enthusiasm for ORKAMBI. I was wondering if you could tell us if there's any sort of commonalities amongst patients who are not yet on treatment, if it's mostly administrative or reimbursement timelines or if there's any particular reasons why physicians or patients may not be choosing the drug other than patients just not having gone to their physician's office yet.","And then on VX-970, I'm interested in sort of the opportunity there. If you could tell us a little more about the biomarkers you might use for patient selection going forward, perhaps the proportion of common solid tumors that, of patient with common solid tumors that have complete ATM loss which I think was the characteristic you saw and the complete response that was observed. Thanks.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Yeah. Brian, I'll take the first question on those patients not on treatment. I mean obviously we're delighted that we're off to a promising start with over 3,000 patients initiated, but obviously that means that there's somewhere near 5,000 or so who are not yet initiating. That's just such a large number of patients. It's hard to say there's one reason or two reasons why they haven't started on treatment yet. They really represent all types of eligible patients with the F508del mutation. And I just want to reiterate, we do still anticipate that the vast majority of those patients will eventually be initiated on ORKAMBI over the course of the rest of this year and into 2016. So there's not really one or two things that are holding those patients back from initiating therapy.","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz - Chief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President","And hi, it's Jeff Chok (42:34). Maybe just a couple comments on your 970 question. You focused on ATM, but I would step back just a little bit, because I think in my mind, that ATM deficiency is one of mutations that actually link to disorders of DNA repair in patients who have cancer. And so, ATM is one. Another one that we're using it as we go into our trials is mutations and deficiencies in p53, actually a more common one. And the frequency of that varies widely across tumors, so I can't give you a single number. But it certainly is observed in multiple types of cancer. And we think that does serve as an important foothold in our understanding of the science, to tell us where to go clinically.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Odysseas D. Kostas - Evercore ISI","Hi, this is Odysseas actually sitting in for Mark. A lot of the questions are already asked, so I kind of wanted to take a step back, and ask maybe just more big picture questions. Congratulations on what's a great quarter. But just sort of trying to think about competition, and perhaps specifically Galapagos. And thinking about the development risk, I guess, just trying to think about how Vertex might see that, whether it's each of the drug at issue, or just (44:15) the ability to combine those drugs. Anyway, any thoughts on that?","And then I had a question on, you mentioned reauthorization criteria. And you mentioned clinical criteria, and I guess I just wondered if you could comment on how high you see the bar for those clinical criteria, just because it seems early to be asking those kinds of questions.","And then, just based on the pipeline, and the number of products that are being moved forward, just maybe speaking to margins a little bit. So I know you've made comments before about expenses, but now just seems like a good time to ask again.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah maybe, this is Jeff Leiden, I'll start with the first one and I guess Stuart can take the second and Ian will take the third. With respect to Galapagos, just as Stuart emphasized, Ian said, we really don't comment on any of the competitor compounds or programs. I would just reiterate what Ian said about our program, which is we like our position really for three reasons. Number one, we have two drugs in the combination, 661 and KALYDECO, that are either approved or very well characterized. So when you put a three drug combination together, we feel that's a nice position to be in. Number two, we spent a lot of time optimizing the pharmaceutic properties of both next gen correctors and that's important as you put a three drug combination together. And number three, we showed you the chloride data from the HBE cells with that three drug combination, which we're getting at levels which are at or north of what KALYDECO does in G551D and so far those assays have predicted quite well what we see in the clinic. So we're excited to see the first Phase 2 results. We'll start those studies next year.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","And on re-authorization criteria, just to reiterate what I said. So far we've seen a limited number of plans which have published their reauthorization criteria. So we're really just talking about a small N at this stage. Our knowledge of those will increase obviously as plans publish those criteria or make those criteria known. Of the ones that we've seen so far, they aren't really setting a really very high clinical bar to use your terminology. Most of them are essentially just ensuring that the patients continue to be within our label or show improvement across a number of clinical parameters in the opinion of the treating physician. So, but as I say, that's on a limited basis right now because it is early for plans to be publishing reauthorization criteria.","Ian F. Smith - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And Odysseas, just to round out your questions, I'll just state again we're committed to driving this business forward and having high operating margins. We get to that position by revenue growth and controlling our operating expenses. We have a business and we're in an area where we can do that. And so for us, it's execution on the launch both in the US and then in Europe, continue to reinvest for growth of the future yet still having significant operating margins.","Odysseas D. Kostas - Evercore ISI","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Phil Nadeau of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Phil M. Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good evening. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the progress. First one on European reimbursement. In the prepared remarks you noted that KALYDECO took I think between 9 and 20 months to get country by country reimbursement. I'm curious whether you think that could go faster this time around given that you've gone back to the same payers, in some cases probably several times, with the different KALYDECO label expansions.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Yeah. Phil, thanks for the question. I won't really know until our team over in Europe begins those reimbursement discussions with the relevant authorities, and that's why I said it's really, really difficult to predict. They all have different processes. A number of them, those processes are changing. They're not even the same process that we went through with KALYDECO. So I really can't predict with any sense of confidence or accuracy whether we're going to go faster or slower with ORKAMBI. We won't really know until we begin that process after we receive regulatory approval, which we continue to anticipate will happen later this quarter.","Phil M. Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then second question also on your prepared remarks. You mentioned that the reimbursement assistance team is beginning to shift to impact persistence and contact the patients. Can you talk a little bit more about that? What exactly is involved in impacting persistence and what type of message do you find most effective?","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Yeah, thanks for the question. So obviously they do a number of things. One is to help patients who are initiating on treatment navigate the reimbursement process. And they'll obviously need to continue to do that because whilst there are over 3,000 patients initiated, there's still a lot more patients that physicians are going to want to initiate on ORKAMBI. But for those who are now started on therapy then we have a number of programs. And essentially it's really helping educate patients on the mode of action of ORKAMBI, how it treats the underlying cause of their disease, and providing them to the extent they want to receive educational materials and refill reminders and things of that nature. And so we tailor that to the individual patients as they desire.","Phil M. Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Tony Butler of Guggenheim. Your line is now open.","Charles Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yes. Thanks very much. Stuart, I recognize the commentary around the approval in the EU toward the end of the quarter, but if I make assumptions that as you alluded to earlier Germany's the first country to be purchasing, can you comment on the number of F508del patients in Germany? And then my second question's more scientifically oriented. Beyond the correctors of 440 and 152, I had the impression that you may put additional correctors in, second-gen correctors into the clinic. Is that still true or did I misinterpret that? Thanks very much.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Yeah in Germany, Tony, there's about 2,500 patients who are 12 and over who are homozygous for the F508del mutation. And so assuming that our approval comes through at the end of this quarter, and that that's our labeled indication, that will be the eligible patient population in Germany.","Charles Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And this is Jeff. I'll take the second one which was about the additional correctors, and maybe I'll broaden it out just a little bit if you don't mind. Our goal is to create the best portfolio of medicines for each one of these patient populations, and so certainly a big part of that is going to be next gen correctors. And as I've said several times before, we have multiple, we have discovered multiple next gen correctors. These are the first two, but there are others behind them. And assuming they pan out as they go through lead-up and tox, yes, our intent would be to put additional correctors in, particularly if they have different and interesting properties so that we can study them. But beyond that, I'd also remind you of things like the ENaC inhibitors, like gene editing. We're really looking at a variety of modalities, and so over the next few years, you can expect to see us bring multiple compounds and frankly, multiple modalities into the clinic to try to create the best combinations.","Charles Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Understood. Thank you.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Liisa Bayko of JMP Securities. Your line is now open.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Hi, and congratulations from me, as well. You mentioned that there were a couple of plans that are not yet covering ORKAMBI. Can you maybe give us a sense of what percentage of lives that matter to you that represents?","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Yeah, Liisa. It's a small number of plans. It's in the single digits in terms of the number of lives that they are responsible for. And essentially, they are not reimbursing yet, and we know they're continuing to work through the process of evaluating the product, and we're sure they'll come to a formal conclusion over the next few months. But it's at the minute, it is single digits in terms of the number of lives covered by those plans.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Thanks. That's helpful. And then just on CMS, can you walk us through the timing there and getting coverage for the Medicare\/Medicaid population? Thanks.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Well in terms of payer mix, we already have had patients both in Medicare and Medicaid who have got access and have been reimbursed for ORKAMBI. The vast majority of in fact state Medicaids have already reimbursed patients. And so we already have effectively reimbursement in a number of states and through Medicare as well.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. So there's not really any gating factor there then?","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","I mean, there are some Medicaid plans who are still considering the product and have decided that they are not going to cover ORKAMBI until they've come to a formal decision. So it really is on a state by state basis on Medicaid. There really isn't one answer, one decision; it really happens on a state by state basis.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And then just one question about the oncology portfolio. Can you maybe at all describe some of the data? I see in triple negative breast cancer patients and non-small cell lung you're going to kind of enhance maybe some of those populations and it seems like maybe you have some data there. Could you comment at all on that? And that's my final question, thank you.","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz - Chief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, hi, it's Jeff Chodakewtiz. I think it actually goes back to the question that was asked by someone else earlier about how are we selecting the right subset of patients. And that those factors are present actually in patients with multiple kinds of tumors. What we've done in those two small sets of patients is actually to hone in on patients who we expect or will require to have some of those kinds of mutations that we spoke about, those deficiencies in DNA repair. And then by doing that, we think we are being able to get a very focused, relatively rapid answer to the question about how the drug will work. So that's what that represents that you're seeing in our study descriptions.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Katherine Xu of William Blair. Your line is now open.","Katherine Xu - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Good evening. I just have a few questions on the CRISPR program. How far is it from the clinic? From a scientific perspective, are there difficulties in levels of research between sorting these in pairs versus correcting the base pairs? And also why did you choose CRISPR Therapeutics? There are a few other companies with similar technologies. And if you could comment on the IP side, that would be great as well.","Ian F. Smith - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So Katherine, David will take the first two questions and then I'll answer the third question once David's through it on the process we went through.","David Matthew Altshuler - Executive Vice President, Global Research and Chief Scientific Officer","Yeah. Thanks for the question. I would say that it's still early days in this and so we really can't comment or predict exactly how long it will take. And in terms of things like the different methods of using CRISPR to modify the DNA, again that will all be subject to research we're doing. And look forward to updating you when we have progress to report.","Ian F. Smith - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And to the process, on previous calls we've been asked about our business and corporate development strategy. We've always had three main approaches. One was to complement what we're doing in cystic fibrosis. Two was to be opportunistic in licensing and M&A. And then a third area was always to broaden our scientific platform and that's what we're doing here. We've been very good in small molecules for a long time at Vertex and with David's help on coming on board about a year ago, we were able to consider other technologies and how we may expand our scientific footprint, and this was an area that rose to the top as a priority for us. And so we then went through the process as you usually do as there are a number of companies that have access to this technology. We did our usual diligence process and based on the structure of the arrangement, the collaboration between people and the opportunity of fit with what we want to do at Vertex, our choice was with CRISPR Therapeutics and we're very happy to be a partner of theirs as we move forward.","Michael Partridge - Vice President-Investor Relations","So operator?","Katherine Xu - William Blair & Co. LLC","On the IP part?","Michael Partridge - Vice President-Investor Relations","So operator? Beg pardon.","Ian F. Smith - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, we don't comment on IP, Katherine. Thank you.","Michael Partridge - Vice President-Investor Relations","Well operator, it's now 6 o'clock. We will take two more questions.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Ted Tenthoff of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Ted A. Tenthoff - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. Thank you very much and my congrats on a really nice launch with ORKAMBI. Question, just with respect to differentiation between triple therapy with the second-gen corrector and also the ENaC inhibitor, how ultimately do you see sort of patient selection there? Obviously it's going to be data driven, but is there something where maybe the ENaC inhibitors would be used in different patients? What's your general thinking along those lines?","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks for the question and you're absolutely right. It will obviously in the end be driven by the data which is why we're going to explore these in Phase 2. But if you think about it sort of at a high level strategic, from a high level strategic standpoint, second generation correctors in a triple combination would be expected to address anybody who has a single or double delta 508 allele. so that's about 80% to 90% of all patients. ENaC inhibitors, again theoretically and we're going to have to demonstrate through the clinic, should be useful for anybody with any mutation and the fact as you know, Parion is running an initial Phase 2 trial that's an all-comer trial. We're going to run a Phase 2 trial with ENaC plus ORKAMBI. And based on the data there, we will be able to determine how to sort of craft these regimens for each patient subset. But that would be the theoretical expectations based on what we've seen in HBE cells. But does that make sense?","Ted A. Tenthoff - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Yeah. Absolutely. I appreciate that color.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Brian Skorney of Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is Nina (59:48) in for Brian. Thanks for taking the questions. So I just have a question on the ORKAMBI launch. Do you have a sense of what percentage of treatings have actually started patients on ORKAMBI? And have you seen any hurdles in terms of getting physicians to prescribe the product?","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","I can't tell you exactly how many physicians have actually have a patient on ORKAMBI. What I do know is that just about every CF center in the United States has put a patient on ORKAMBI. So we are really seeing again what we anticipated, which is broad interest in using the medicine, both with physicians and with patients.","Unknown Speaker","Great, and one last question. So I know you said that there has been good feedback from payers in terms of getting ORKAMBI covered. Has there been any sort of push back at all? And if so, could you give us some color around that? And that's all.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Yes. I mean I'd say the end product of our discussions has been good, and that's reflected in the fact that we have good access, the vast majority of which is to label. Obviously there's been a lot of discussion there, but a lot of it as I said been very productive because payers I do think understand how serious a disease this is, and how this is a disease that is \u2013 this is a product which is treating the underlying cause of the disease. And the fact that it's an orphan, if not ultra orphan indication, and so they have relatively few patients in each of their individual plans. So the discussions have been very productive and I think that's reflected in the good and broad access that we have.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thank you.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","You're welcome.","Michael Partridge - Vice President-Investor Relations","So we appreciate everyone joining us for the call tonight.

This call is recorded and a replay will be available later on our website.","Dr. Jeff Leiden, Chairman and CEO, and Ian Smith, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, will provide prepared remarks this evening. Stuart Arbuckle, Chief Commercial Officer, will join us for Q&A.","We will make forward-looking statements on this conference call. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in today's press release, our 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

I would also refer you to slide 3 of tonight's webcast.","I will now turn the call over to Dr. Jeff Leiden.","Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Michael. Good evening (01:26). 2017 is an important year for Vertex and we've made significant progress towards achieving our long-term vision of treating all people with CF. As we enter this year, we were focused on continuing to increase the number of people eligible for and being treated with our approved medicines, as well as generating important data from multiple combination medicines across our CF pipeline. Let me briefly review our recent progress in meeting these objectives.","First, the FDA recently approved KALYDECO for more than 900 people with CF, ages 2 and older who have 1 of 23 residual function mutations. And we continue to work closely with the FDA to obtain approval for more than 600 additional people who have other residual function mutations responsive to KALYDECO. KALYDECO continues to be a transformative medicine and has now labeled to treat approximately 5,000 people with CF globally. Tonight, we are reiterating our KALYDECO revenue guidance.","Second, we've now reached reimbursement agreements in Ireland and Italy for ORKAMBI in people ages 12 and older with two copies of the F508del mutation. We continue to discuss reimbursement with other countries, including France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom and remain committed to expanding the eligibility for and access to ORKAMBI globally. Tonight, we also reiterated our guidance for ORKAMBI.","Third, based on the positive Phase 3 data we announced earlier this year, we recently submitted an NDA to the FDA and an MAA to the European Medicines Agency for the tezacaftor\/ivacaftor combination in people with CF ages 12 and older. We anticipate acceptance of the NDA and the MAA later this year.","Fourth, we recently shared positive Phase 1 and Phase 2 results from three of our triple combination regimens in people with CF who have at least one F508del mutation. These results included the first data to demonstrate the potential to treat the underlying cause of CF and had many patients who have a severe and difficult to treat type of this disease. We also demonstrated that the addition of a next-generation corrector to tezacaftor and ivacaftor significantly increases FEV1 and F508del homozygous patients.","Throughout the rest of this year, we will be evaluating additional data from these and other studies and I look forward to updating you on our plans for pivotal development of our triple combination regimens that may have the potential to treat up to 90% of CF patients. We expect to begin pivotal development in the first half of 2018 for one or two of our four next-generation correctors.","And lastly, earlier this week we added CTP-656 to our pipeline of CF medicines through completing our asset purchase agreement with Concert Pharmaceuticals. CTP-656 has the potential to be used as part of future once-daily combination regimens that treat the underlying cause of CF and we are already working to integrate the potentiator into one of our triple combination regimens.","Based on our significant progress this year, we are well-positioned to achieve our longstanding goal to create medicines that fundamentally alter the progression of CF for all patients, and in doing so, meet our financial goal of delivering sustainable long-term revenue and earnings growth for Vertex.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian to discuss our financials.","Ian F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff, and good evening to everyone. Tonight, I will discuss the key aspects of our second quarter 2017 financials and I will also review our 2017 full-year financial guidance, revenues first. Total CF product revenues of $514 million in the second quarter of 2017 represent a 21% increase compared to the $426 million we recorded in the second quarter of 2016 and a $33 million increase compared to the $481 million we recorded in the first quarter of 2017. We continue to see revenue growth as we treat more patients with our approved medicines.","For ORKAMBI, we reported second quarter 2017 product revenues of approximately $324 million, an increase of $29 million compared to the first quarter of 2017. This increase was driven by continued uptake of the medicine globally as well as the timing of both patients and pharmacy orders of approximately $10 million in advance of the 4th of July holiday. These shipments will likely impact revenues in the third quarter of 2017.","Second quarter KALYDECO sales were $190 million compared to $186 million for the first quarter of 2017. We estimate there was approximately $5 million of inventory stocking at quarter end in advance of July 4 holiday.","Our second quarter 2017 non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were $333 million, compared to $306 million in the second quarter of 2016 and compared to $313 million in the first quarter of 2017. These increases are primarily due to the continued acceleration and broad advancement of our CF medicines in development, and in particular, our portfolio of triple combination regimens.","This revenue expense profile resulted in a non-GAAP net profit for the second quarter of 2017 of $99 million or $0.39 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net profit of $58 million or $0.24 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2016, and compared to a $101 million or $0.41 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2017. The significant growth year-over-year in net profit was largely driven by the strong growth in the total CF product revenues.","During the second quarter of 2017, the company generated significant cash flow and ended the quarter with approximately $1.67 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.","Now, turning to our full-year financial guidance. We continue to expect total CF product revenues of $1.84 billion to $2.07 billion in 2017. For ORKAMBI, we continue to expect $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion in net product revenues. Our actual revenues will be determined by the continued uptake of ORKAMBI in the markets where it's reimbursed, as well as the completion of additional reimbursement agreements throughout Europe. If we are successful in gaining reimbursements in France by the end of 2017, it would be a large contributor to our revenue growth. There continues to be uncertainty after the timing on when these discussions will be completed.","As to KALYDECO, we continue to expect $740 million to $770 million in net product revenues, which includes the recent approval in patients with residual function mutations. We continue to have productive discussions with the FDA to obtain approval for more than 600 people who have other residual function mutations responsive to KALYDECO.","Now, to operating expenses. We have made significant investments and generated compelling data across our CF pipeline this year, and we now expect combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses of $1.33 billion to $1.36 billion for 2017. This updated guidance reflects the progression of our CF portfolio, including the acceleration of Phase 2 studies for VX-659 and VX-445. Preparation for pivotal studies for our portfolio of triple combination regimens and investment to develop CTP-656 as part of future triple combination regimens.","With our continued revenue growth, the management of our operating expenses, we are well on track to deliver a financial profile that includes high operating margins and sustainable earnings growth.","With that, I will open up the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks very much for taking the question. I guess I'd just like to ask about the progression of pricing and reimbursement in Europe. You've obviously made some progress with some countries and yet, some of the large ones, including France, seem to be taking longer. Can you just talk about to the extent you are willing \u2013 what items are still needing to be discussed and I guess what we should think about in terms of that and broadly, I guess the nature of the question here is, you've obviously got ORKAMBI now but there's visibility towards tez\/iva and then triple combos, and does that influence any of the conversation and perhaps, take longer to complete? Thanks.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Matt. It's Stu here. I'll try and address your question. It's got a number of different elements to it. As you said, we have made good progress in the first half of this year reaching pricing and reimbursement agreements in Germany, Ireland, Italy, Austria, Luxemburg and Denmark. And as you said, we're in active negotiations with other countries, including France, the UK and the Netherlands. And where we are in those discussions, I'll refer you back to the comments we've made previously, these discussions tend to have three phases. There's a clinical benefit assessment, the pharmacoeconomic assessment, and then, you're into the pricing discussions, and we're through those first two. There's really no debate in those markets in Europe about the clinical benefits of ORKAMBI. We're really in the pricing and reimbursement discussions. And as Ian mentioned in his prepared remarks, unfortunately, the exact timing of when those are going to conclude is uncertain just because they're not directly within our control.","As to the potential impact of newer agents in development on those discussions, what I'd say to you is that we're very pleased that in Ireland and Italy, where we reached agreements in May after the tez\/iva data was available, those countries still saw fit to do what we think is the right thing, make a transformative medicine like ORKAMBI available to patients as soon as possible because it treats the underlying cause of the disease, and we know, therefore, that it's important for patients to be treated as early as possible. And we're certainly going to be continuing to make that case to the existing authorities who are still not providing access for patients in their countries.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey Meacham, Ph.D. - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. A couple of questions for you. Obviously, with the data thus far in the triple, you can expand the addressable population, but I wanted to ask you about the nonsense mutation and some of the splicing mutations. I know clearly, you guys have the alliance here with CRISPR and to look at some of those, but maybe just talk a little bit about what the strategy is there. Do you have technologies in-house to look at more nonsense mutation patients or is it just going to focus on delta-F single and double. And then, I have a follow-up.","Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Geoff. This is Jeff Leiden. I'll take two parts for your questions. We actually view splice and nonsense quite differently. So as you know, and as Ian said, I think we're in very productive discussions with the FDA around the splice mutations. Most of those produce normal fee of care (13:11) but much lower amounts. And our in vitro data and our clinical data has clearly shown that they respond to KALYDECO, and by the way, also to tez\/iva. And so, the imperative there is to get KALYDECO monotherapy approved for those patients as soon as possible, and then, follow that with tez\/iva and we're confident that we will be able to that. So, that's splice.","Nonsense mutations, as you point out, are quite different. They are obviously not going to respond to CFTR modulators because there is no protein there. And we have several approaches there, the first of which is the ENaC inhibitor. So, one of the reasons we're interested in studying the ENaC inhibitors, that's VX-371, is because they, as you know, function by a different mechanism that doesn't require functional CFTR protein. And so, we'll have a look at the first data, as you know, in the second half of this year but that's sort of mechanism number one, to get at the nonsense mutations.","And as you point out, mechanisms two are genetic approaches, such as CRISPR and Moderna, we're making some nice progress in cell lines. We do have cell assays that allow us to look at those in both HBE cells and other cells, and the key issue there is going to be delivery. I actually think the gene editing and the ability for RNA to make CFTR is a relatively straightforward problem. The tough problem here is delivery and we're working on that in parallel and as we've said, we do think that's going to take a number of years to bring forward into the clinic.","Geoffrey Meacham, Ph.D. - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And a follow-up question more on the commercial side, and I have asked you guys this a couple of times before but I just want to see if there's any update. Clearly, the market is U.S., Western Europe and Australia but I wanted to see, I think at one point, you guys have talked about opening an office down in Latin America or other countries that maybe have a founder effect, where you have populations that are well beyond the 70,000 that everyone puts up as the number. So, is there \u2013 maybe just help us with kind of where you are with that kind of more of the global piece.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, Geoff. You're correct. We have established an office in S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil as a potential sort of regional hub for Latin America, and you're right, there are numbers of patients in there. The level of newborn screening and the maturity of registries there is perhaps, as you might expect, not quite as advanced than it is here in the U.S. and in parts of Western Europe.","And so, the exact numbers of patients, and indeed, their specific genotypes which we would anticipate being different in terms of distribution than it is in the U.S. and Europe, is not as well defined. And so, much of our efforts over the last year or so has been working with the various CF societies and physicians in those markets to try and better understand the size of the potential patient population there and the specific genotypes that they have so that we can work out which of our medicines is best placed to help those patients out. So, that's kind of the phase that we're at there and I would say stay posted. We'll kind of update you as we make more progress from a commercial point of view there.","Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And from a regulatory point of view, Geoff, it is our intention to go ahead and get these products registered there. There's a very formal way to do that and we're well into that process.","Geoffrey Meacham, Ph.D. - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got you. Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Terence Flynn, Ph.D. - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering if you guys could comment on thoughts on uptake of tez\/iva into the F508del homozygous patients with low baseline function. I know that is been an area where there are some concern around use of ORKAMBI. Do you think tez\/iva will be used there or do you think those patients would most likely wait until the triple combo is available? Thanks a lot.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Terence, hi. It's Stu here. Thanks for the question. Let me first talk a little bit more broadly about how we see tez\/iva fitting in. We think tez\/iva, because of the benefit risk profile that it has, really has a great opportunity to allow us and physicians to treat more patients with CF, and that's because we think given the benefit risk profile where we know the efficacy is very good but also the safety and tolerability are also very good, we think it will be applicable to a number of populations. Firstly, those who have discontinued ORKAMBI, many of whom discontinued for adverse events. We think that's a population that physicians and the patients themselves will be very keen to be retreated with a CFTR modulator.","We also know those patients who have never been treated with ORKAMBI, some of whom because the patient and\/or physician were concerned about the benefit risk profile of ORKAMBI. And then, thirdly, outside the U.S., in particular, the residual function population where we don't have KALYDECO monotherapy approved is another population where based on the Phase 3 data that we showed in March with tezacaftor\/ivacaftor, we believe we'll also be able to get additional patients on a CFTR modulator. So overall, for tez\/iva, we see the biggest benefit for patients and physicians, is being able to offer CFTR modulator to more people with the disease.","In terms of exactly how it might be considered for those with low FEV1s, clearly, one of the major concerns physicians and patients have there was the bronchoconstriction side effect that we see from lumacaftor. We've known about that with lumacaftor for a while and the result we've been very diligently and looking at whether tezacaftor has that same property. We know from all of our Phase 2 data, from our Phase 3 data from looking at both adverse events post-dose spirometry, the tez\/iva does not have that same adverse events, and therefore, I think it's going to be a very popular option for patients with a low FEV1.","Terence Flynn, Ph.D. - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey C. Porges, Ph.D. - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much and thanks for the questions. A couple of strategy questions. First, Stuart, could you just talk about what success you're having with the full portfolio contracts and more or less fixed pricing? As you look ahead to now multiple generations potentially five different product offerings over time, is that a model that you think that you can deploy globally or is it just in very selected markets and what sort of reaction are we getting?","And then, secondly, Ian, your balance sheet is shaping up nicely and we expect it to continue to improve, and you are diversifying your portfolio across products. Is there a possibility that you might be able to take on some leverage and sort of free up additional capital from your balance sheet in that way? Thanks.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So Geoff, I'll take your first question. So just for everybody's clarity on the call, the approach that Geoff's referring to is an agreement that we reached earlier this year in Ireland where essentially we have an agreement which is a long-term agreement covers populations of patients, in this case, those who are homozygous for the F508del mutation, all those who are one of the approved KALYDECO mutations and essentially looks at that patient population all the way down to the age zero, and essentially includes in the agreement both the currently approved medicines, KALYDECO and ORKAMBI, will include patients for ORKAMBI when the indications extended the lower age groups but will also include new Vertex medicines in those specific patient population.","I would say to you, Geoff, that since that agreement was put in place, and in particular, since both the tez\/iva data, and now, the next-gen data which makes it very clear to everybody how close we are to being able to develop medicines that treat the underlying cause of disease in 90% of patients, there's been a lot of interest in discussing similar type of patient and\/or portfolio contracts.","So, we're certainly very keen to be flexible, if that's what countries want to do. We're certainly, as we've demonstrated in Ireland, very open to doing that. I personally believe it's a real win, win, win, that arrangement. It's a win for the Irish government. It's a win for Vertex. And most importantly, it's a win for patients in Ireland. And so, we're certainly very open to doing that kind of agreement in any country. We're in, obviously, early stages of discussions with newer countries along those lines and certainly that there's a lot of interest there, whether we'll actually be able to get turn that interest into an agreement, time will tell.","And I think Ian will handle the question on balance sheet.","Geoffrey C. Porges, Ph.D. - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you.","Ian F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. So hi, Geoff. How you doing? So first of all, to the cash, just to give you a couple of points of where we are currently on our financial position. We have cash of close to $1.7 billion and we are cash flow positive each quarter now, and so, that balance continues to increase. I'd also point out that we actually do already have a revolver facility, and so, we have access to up to $800 million. It currently stands at $500 million but we can expand it to $800 million. So, when you have the $800 million debt capacity at the moment on the balance sheet that we have not yet drawn down on, plus the $1.7 billion of cash and a positive cash flow, we're in a very nice position to think about how we allocate that cash and how we apply it.","Obviously, we're already making choices of our revenue stream as it grows to allocate internally and that is going into R&D and it goes beyond to CF these days. It goes into other disease areas, and I'm sure before we finish this call, there will be a number of questions about how are we progressing beyond CF.","And then, as I've said on call previously, that cash can now \u2013 that's on the balance sheet and also the leverage and the increasing leverage and the increasing availability of cash, we can apply outside the company and we have three basic strategies there and we're very active, as shown actually by the announcement yesterday. So, one of those strategies and the priority is still, let's take a look at everything that's complementary in cystic fibrosis to our approach and we actually just closed on the acquisition of CTP-656 yesterday.","Another strategy is for us to look at other scientific footprints or scientific platforms or modalities and how they may allow us to treat diseases in different ways than just through small molecule approaches, and we've done both Moderna and the CRISPR collaboration in the last year or so that have advanced our approaches in those areas.","And then, what is also emerging is how we may just broaden our pipeline beyond CF with earlier stage type deals that relate to asset acquisitions or targets in IP acquisitions and knowledge and assays and small M&A-type ideas that we look at as well. We're very sensitive to looking at the capital structure of the company. We're still progressing and I think our focus is on earlier stage assets of high science in disease areas that are consistent with cystic fibrosis.","Geoffrey C. Porges, Ph.D. - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thanks very much. That's very helpful, Ian.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks for the question. My question was on the Concert molecule which, of course, you just closed on yesterday. What are the next steps? How are you thinking about developing that? Could that be ready for one of the triples to start next year or what are the things you need to do there in discussions with the FDA?","And the other question was in terms of your ongoing triples you have now in Phase 2, how good you feel about the therapeutic window in terms of going up and seeing higher efficacy without the risk of any undue side effects? Thanks.","Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, Michael. It's Jeff. Welcome back by the way.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Thanks.","Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Nice to hear your voice again on the call. So, I'll take both of those questions. So CTP-656, as you'll remember, is deuterated ivacaftor and the rationale there was to potentially get to a once-a-day regimen \u2013 triple regimen because both VX-659 and VX-445 are consistent with once-daily dosing from what we know now about their PK. And of course, tezacaftor is consistent with once-daily dosing. Whereas ivacaftor, KALYDECO, is not. It's a twice-a-day regimen.","And so, we're very pleased to have closed the transaction. We've already been actually working very hard on incorporating this molecule into a triple. It's a little early for me to give you a precise date but if you ask me, could we come up with a triple regimen containing CTP-656 that was once a day and begin a pivotal trial in 2018, I'd say the answer from what I know today is likely yes.","I want to emphasize that we're not going to wait for that certainly. It is our intention to get the best regimen to patients as quickly as possible, and so, the first regimen almost certainly will use ivacaftor, KALYDECO, and be a twice-a-day regimen and we'll follow that likely with a once-a-day regimen, and we also have the opportunity to bridge back later to substitute in the ivacaftor.","All of that as you say requires some discussion with regulators and it also requires a little more data on our part. We're certainly not going to jump into a Phase 3 trial of the ivacaftor until we have enough efficacy, safety, tolerability and PK data to make sure that we know the dose and we know how to put it together with the other agents. But again, we think that's a relatively short journey and that we could have such a regimen in pivotals next year.","And then, your second question...","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","And then, the triple \u2013 yeah.","Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, the triple. And really, your question was about therapeutic window, and as we said last week, one of the things that was the most important for us to see in all four regimens actually was the very favorable safety and tolerability profile, and what that meant to us is that we could begin to expand dosing upwards, and so, we're doing that, as you know, in at least three of the regimens.","So in VX-152, the initial data was at a 100 milligram and 200 milligram dose. We are already expanding that up to 300 milligrams and those patients are being dosed. And so, we'll see whether we can essentially wring more efficacy out of VX-152 with that same safety and tolerability profile. Some suggestion we may be able to because if you look back at that data, there does seem to be a clear dose response in FEV1 between 100 milligrams and 200 milligrams.","With VX-659, you'll remember we're at 120 BID, and so, the Phase 2 trial of VX-659, which is just beginning, will incorporate higher doses up to 400 milligrams a day, and the VX-445 dosing will also go up. So with those three molecules, we are going to try to increase dose looking for maximum benefit with a very favorable safety and tolerability profile. And as we said last week, we hope to have all that data converge towards the end of this year and early next year and that will allow us to pick not only the best regimen or regimens but the best doses.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Thanks.","Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Phil Nadeau, Ph.D. - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. And it's actually kind of a follow-up to the last one that's on data disclosure. I think Concert had guided to you getting a monotherapy data for CTP-656 out by the end of this year. Is that still likely now that's in your hands?","And then, second, Jeff, your answer to the question that you just gave, it sounds like there'll be more disclosures on VX-152, VX-659 and VX-445 either late this year or early next. Is that a correct interpretation? Is that when we'll see the next data or are there interim releases that are possible?","Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Phil. I'll take the first part and Ian, I think, can take the disclosure question. So with respect to CTP-656 for monotherapy, we're actually not planning to develop CTP-656 for monotherapy, given that we believe that 90% of the patients will go on to a triple regimen. So, we're really interested in as part of a once-a-day triple regimen. We will get some interesting, I think, PK data potentially from that study but for us now, it's all about incorporating it into triple therapy and figuring out how to do that, which dose, making sure there's efficacy in the safety tolerability profile. It doesn't require a lot of patients but we will be doing that before we jump into pivotal trials. So, I wouldn't focus on the monotherapy trial because I don't think that's where we're headed.","Ian, may be you talk about the disclosure?","Ian F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And Phil, as we disclosed a couple of weeks ago, we're looking at our next-generation triple combination as a portfolio of medicines and given we are choosing to complete each one of the Phase 2 studies of each molecule, we see our next disclosure is when we've completed that \u2013 all the studies in Phase 2. So when we completed the Phase 2 for VX-440, VX-152, VX-659 and VX-445, we anticipate that being early 2018. We'll be able to not only give you the data, we'll be also \u2013 also be able to tell you how we're thinking about which molecule we're taking into Phase 3 in the first half of 2018. So, we continue to view it as a portfolio so we'd like to keep it to a portfolio disclosure and we anticipate that being early 2018.","Phil Nadeau, Ph.D. - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks. That's very helpful and congratulations again on the progress.","Ian F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Phil.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So Ian, you alluded to more questions on BD and I do, in fact, want to follow-up now the bigger picture question on this front. So recognizing this is all still quite fresh but there's the recent progress in substantial de-risking on the triple front, impact how the company thinks about business development going forward in terms of investing outside of CF. In other words, do you have more confidence or perhaps change the approach to building outside of your core franchise, given what's likely more predictable future \u2013 the future track of CF revenues or these kind of topics that are mutually exclusive? Thanks.","Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Cory, this is Jeff. It's a great question. I'd certainly give you two different types of responses. Let me step back. We've actually been working on what's next after CF, which is one part of your question, for quite hard now for a couple of years and we sort of view it as a two-part approach. First of all, what's beyond CF in terms of trying to find disease areas really is, we've been consistent with what we've learned in CF. That is we're really only interested in transformative medicines and serious diseases that we can sell into the specialty areas with relatively low SG&A, which will then allow us to recycle most of our OpEx back into R&D. That's the model and we're going to stick to that model as we move beyond CF.","And then, we view internal research and BD as essentially complementary, often even looking at the same diseases using some internal programs and some external programs. And so, for instance, we've talked about sickle cell disease as a program that we're interested in because it does fit that profile. We have an internal small molecule program or several of them, actually, in sickle cell disease. We have our collaboration with CRISPR in sickle cell disease and we may even look at additional outside programs. So, this hybrid combination of inside investment and outside investment is the way we're going to go at this for the majority of diseases.","Now, with respect to your question about the strengthening financial position and how does that change our perspective, I think the key word that you said, which is the word we use, is confidence. As this financial position strengthens, we have more confidence not only in our balance sheet today but importantly, in our balance sheet tomorrow, and so, that's going to let us, I do believe, give us a lot more financial firepower, let us do more deals and potentially larger.","As Ian said, we're not in the business of buying revenue in 2019 or 2020. We're not going to go out and buy marketed products but we are very interested in diversifying our earlier stage pipeline with these kinds of transformative medicines and I think you can expect more of that as our confidence is growing significantly.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with UBS. Your line is now open.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and congrats again on all the progress. I guess, the segue to beyond CF \u2013 a question for Jeff or David. ClinicalTrials.gov says the VX-150 Phase 2 study supposed to read out in 4Q. I guess, one, is that the right timeline, and two, how should we be thinking about what you want to see to advance into a Phase 3 in acute pain? Thank you.","Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. So, thanks for asking. Let me again just take a step back for those who aren't familiar with VX-150. This is our NaV 1.8 inhibitor. This a novel mechanism \u2013 pain mechanism, as you know. We recently reported positive Phase 2 data in osteoarthritis which was really the first proof-of-concept for this mechanism, frankly, in pain. And what's important here and what we said before is we don't view pain as one disease mechanistically. We actually view it as several different diseases. So, there is the inflammatory pain that we saw in osteoarthritis, there's acute pain, there's neuropathic pain, in particular. And what we'd like to \u2013 what we are doing at this point, I think, we'd like to do is to explore this molecule in all three of those.","So, we have the positive readout in OA. We're currently involved in an acute pain study which is a bunionectomy study, and we do hope that'll readout later this year, next year. And then, the third study will be a neuropathic pain study, which will start I hope later this year. That takes a little longer so it'll likely be 12 months to 14 months more once it starts before we read that out, again, depending on enrollment. Once we have the profile of molecule, then I think we're in a position to really decide, A, how do we best bring it to patients, which patients, do we need a partner for some of these. Obviously, community acquired pain is not something we're going to do and how to best monetize it as well for Vertex. And so, as we accumulate the profile of the compound, we'll keep you informed with each of these trails and that'll lead to the decision about how to take it forward, which is really your question.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Citi. Your line is now open.","Robyn Karnauskas, Ph.D. - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thank you. So given that you've spend almost a $1 billion on R&D and I know you said a majority of that is CF, can you quantify right now what percentage is non-CF? And if you're thinking about \u2013 you're starting to think about expanding beyond CF, when do you think the CF spend might begin to taper, given that even clinical trials are running are a little smaller than before? So, can you help us understand how you expect the R&D spend to evolve a little bit and could you see an expansion in the non-CF sooner than what we anticipate? Thanks.","Ian F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Robyn. Some of the \u2013 let's say, the number that I'm about to give you might surprise you a little. So first of all, if you take R&D, let's split it up into R and let's split it up into D. So firstly, R, we have three research sites. One of those sites is focused on cystic fibrosis there. It is focused on other targets as well but it is primarily our cystic fibrosis site and they've done excellent work, as you know, out in San Diego.","There are two others sites that are not focused on CF. So already, we're spending well beyond 50% of our research investment beyond CF and on disease areas that, again, we've touched down on this call, that are similar to CF but we have a research strategy that goes beyond CF already and we've been doing that now for a couple of years and we hope to start seeing some productive results in taking molecules into the clinics of diseases that you may be familiar with, and they should start to see that maybe later this year and certainly, into early part of next year coming out of research. So, we're already \u2013 if you wanted me to put a percentage on it because it's fungible but it's probably around 60% that's beyond CF, given how we carve up our research activities.","For development, it is a little bit of a different story. Oh, and by the way on the research, we're committed to maintaining that kind of approach. I don't think that's going to change in the near term, given we continue to invest in CF. And I'd also say in research, we start to supplement it with external relationships such as CRISPR and Moderna and we have an investment there as well.","When we look at development, development is principally an investment in cystic fibrosis right now. As you may imagine, we have a full pipeline ranging from Phase 2s all the way through to Phase 3s. And so, the principal investment in development is actually towards CF and it goes well beyond just clinical trials as well. There is a heavy support in terms of formulation, manufacturing, medical affairs and regulatory.","And so, I would say probably 80% of our development spend is towards cystic fibrosis. And again, I don't see that the investment in cystic fibrosis tailing off significantly for another three, four, maybe five years. You have to understand as we get approval for medicines in 12 and older, we immediately are thinking about how we get approval for medicines in 6 through 11, we're thinking about 2 through 5, we're thinking about how we gather longer term data and build our registry data to support the long-term outcome of our medicines of treating this disease long term.","So, we need to maintain that support for the medicines we're creating to treat CF. I do see the investment starting to increase beyond CF but that would be a function of those creating opportunity. And Jeff just talked you through the pain opportunity. We have to see how that plays out, but you will start to see new ideas coming to the clinic and we'll start investing in those. But it'll be earlier stage so it won't be a significant spend in the next two or three years. It would grow if they progress down the pipeline.","Robyn Karnauskas, Ph.D. - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Michael Partridge - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, we have time for two more questions.","Operator","Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Ying Huang, Ph.D. - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi (40:41). Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a follow-up on the QD KALYDECO you got from Concert. It doesn't sound like it's ready for Phase 3 when you start the triple combo next year, but once that compound is ready, do you think you have to run a head-to-head study versus the BID KALYDECO? You have to show the comparability. And also, do you think FDA would want to see that data or you think it's just completely different separate study just to get that QD of KALYDECO through?","And then, secondly, maybe for Ian, if I add the Q1 ORKAMBI and then Q2 ORKAMBI revenue, just flat line for the rest of the year. We're already at high end of your guidance. Does that mean this is still very conservative for the $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion guidance for ORKAMBI? Thank you.","Jeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Maybe I'll take the first one and Ian will take the second one. Yeah, with respect to CTP-656, I would think about it as two stages. Stage 1 is really more us accumulating sufficient internal data to be confident both about the efficacy, tolerability, safety and dose. That's a small set of studies that supplements what Concert has already provided so that we can feel comfortable before we go into Phase 3 that we know the profile of the drug and we know the appropriate dose as part of a triple. So, we're planning to do those kinds of studies over the next months, as I said, and once we accumulate that data, we'll make a decision about taking that triple with the \u2013 with CTP-656 forward. And as I said, I think it's doable. Well, I'm not promising it because we're just learning about the compound to get that done to be in pivotals next year.","Then, your question about the FDA is a different question. So, I would think about that quite simply as are we going to need a Phase 3 trial there with the iva and is it our intention to do that. If we incorporate it into a new triple, we would then run pivotal trials there to get that approved by the FDA. If we already have a triple approved and later on, we want to substitute it back, that's a different story. That's probably more of a bioequivalent story. But regardless, we're going to need data, both efficacy and some safety tolerability data, dosing data before we dive into Phase 3.","Ian F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And Ying, thanks for the question. So as you saw, we are continuing to reiterate our guidance at $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion for ORKAMBI. But you're correct, if you do the math, we've had a strong first half of the year and if you double up that revenue rate without growth, it does put you in the mid to slightly in the upper part of our range. And so, I can confirm that we do not anticipate being in the low part of our range. But where we fall in the mid up to higher part of the range is a function of a number of things.","I would point out that firstly more acutely in short term, we did note in the prepared remarks that Q2 was benefited by some inventory stocking pre-July for holiday. And on ORKAMBI, in particular, it was $10 million and I know you know how that works but that means you're taking $10 million out of Q3 adding it to Q2, but that does mean a $20 million difference between Q2 and Q3. And so, these things do matter when you're trying to pro rata quarters to try and get a full-year run rate.","And one of the other things that we need to see how it plays out. We did see a little bit of a summer slowdown last year and it was more around compliance of medicines, and there was lower compliance which resulted in less revenues. So, we need to see how that plays out. We have a number of programs in place that we're trying to help patients be more compliant this year and \u2013 but we do need to see how that plays out. And obviously, something that's really important in terms of where we fall in the range is our launches in the new markets of Ireland and Italy, but also whether we gain reimbursement in countries like France. So where we fall in the range, yeah, we don't anticipate being in the low end. Be in the mid end and how we climb up from the mid end is really a function of performance, and that's why we're maintaining our guidance.","Ying Huang, Ph.D. - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Adam Walsh with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Adam Walsh, Ph.D. - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, thanks so much for fitting me in. I got a couple of quick ones. First for Ian, just for our modeling purposes, can you breakout the ORKAMBI U.S. and EU revenues? And then, one quickly for Jeff on slide \u2013 I believe, it's 5, you talked about obtaining worldwide rights to CTP-656, but then you also mentioned other assets related to the treatment of CF.

Earlier this month I met with many of our investors and analysts at the Annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference and talked about the important transition has Vertex has made in the last few years.","As we enter 2016, Vertex is on a path toward sustained earnings and revenue growth, driven by an increasing number of people being treated with our two approved medicines for cystic fibrosis, KALYDECO and ORKAMBI.","We have a broad and deep pipeline of investigational medicines for CF that we believe may allow us to reach our goal of treating all people with CF in the future. Additionally, our pipeline of medicines for other serious diseases, including cancer, pain and other neurologic diseases, continues to progress through early stage clinical development. In short, we're a very different Company than we were just four years ago.","This evening I will briefly review our key priorities for 2016 and provide some insight into upcoming milestones in CF and other parts of our business. Our number one priority has been and continues to be to increase the number of people eligible for and treated with KALYDECO and ORKAMBI and to develop potential new medicines that may provide even greater benefit for all people with CF in the years ahead.","At this time last year, just over 3,000 people were eligible for treatment with KALYDECO. Today approximately 25,000 people are eligible for KALYDECO or ORKAMBI and we expect the vast majority of these people will begin treatment with these medicines to treat the cause of their CF.","We also expect to increase the number of people eligible for these medicines in 2016 through label expansion efforts that could include younger patients or patients with other mutations in the CFTR gene.","Our second key priority for 2016 is to continue building a financial profile of sustained revenues and earnings growth and a strong balance sheet. In 2015, the continued expansion of the KALYDECO label and the approval of ORKAMBI resulted in a significant increase in the number of patients being treated with our medicines which led to a significant increase in revenues.","Our progress in 2015 has positioned us for continued growth and we believe we are on the right path to achieve our goal of building a financial profile consistent with that of other global biotech companies.","And finally, our third key priority is to invest in our business to create future medicines for other serious diseases. Continued investment in our pipeline is essential for creating additional breakthrough medicines for patients. I'll spend just a few minutes reviewing our recent progress and upcoming milestones that reflect these three priorities.","Our first CF medicine, KALYDECO, was approved by that FDA in January 2012 and since then our goal has been to bring this medicine to as many people as possible who may benefit.","KALYDECO addresses the underlying cause of CF and is a significant medical advance for people with certain mutations in the CFTR gene. Today approximately 4,000 people are eligible for treatment with KALYDECO in North America, Europe and Australia.","We're committed to bringing this medicine to even more patients who we believe may benefit in the years ahead. We are awaiting a decision from the U.S. FDA on our application for approval of KALYDECO in people ages two and older with CF who have certain residual function mutations. There are approximately 1,500 people ages two and older in the U.S. we have the residual function mutations represented in the supplemental new drug application for KALYDECO.","While our submission for approval in these mutations is primarily based on preclinical data, and on a Phase 2a clinical study in only 24 patients, we believe that KALYDECO would be beneficial to these patients, given the underlying science behind this precision medicine approach of using genetic markers and predictive assays to identify patients who are likely to benefit. Importantly, we chose to seek this approval knowing that these patients would otherwise have to potentially wait years before potential approval based on Phase 3 data.","With more than four years of safety data, we believe that this path toward potential approval is in the best interest of people with CF. However, we also recognize that the application is based upon limited available clinical data in these rare mutations. The PDUFA date for a decision from the FDA is February 7.","With ORKAMBI, we are working to bring this medicine to more patients who we believe would benefit, specifically children with two copies of the F Delta 508 mutation similar to the approach we took with KALYDECO.","With the approval in the European Union at the end of last year, approximately 20,500 people, ages 12 and older, are now eligible for treatment with ORKAMBI in the U.S. and Europe.","Today we announced that a Phase 3 study of ORKAMBI in children ages six to 11 met its primary safety endpoint and supports our planned submission of a supplemental new drug application in the second quarter of this year in the U.S. If approved, an additional 2,400 people in the U.S. with CF would be eligible for treatment with ORKAMBI.","While this was primarily a safety study, we also saw encouraging improvements in secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints, including a statistically significant change in the exploratory endpoint of lung clearance index or LCI.","Changes in LCI are also the primary endpoint of an ongoing Phase 3 study to support approval of ORKAMBI in this age group in Europe. There are approximately 3,400 children, ages six to 11, who have two copies of the F Delta 508 mutation in the European Union. Additional information on these data was provided in today's press release.","Today KALYDECO and ORKAMBI are approved to treat approximately 25,000 people in North America, Europe, and Australia. We believe that there are many more people who may benefit from these medicines and we have trials ongoing or planned that could expand the number of people eligible for treatment to approximately 44,000 in the years ahead.","Beyond our approved medicines, we have a pipeline of investigational CF medicines from early-stage research programs such as gene editing with CRISPR, to late-stage development programs evaluating combinations of our CFTR modulators. This pipeline represents hope for the CF community and our goal is to one day treat all people with CF.","We have a broad Phase 3 program underway evaluating the corrector VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor. And we are also advancing the development of two next-generation correctors that would be combined with the VX-661and ivacaftor as part of a Phase 2 study of triple combinations planned for later this year.","Both approaches are asking the same fundamental questions. First, can we enhance the benefit for patients already receiving KALYDECO or ORKAMBI? And second, can we provide benefit to new groups of people with CF not currently helped by KALYDECO or ORKAMBI, including a very large group of patients with one F Delta 508 mutation and a second mutation known to result in minimal CFTR function.","The VX- 661 program includes four Phase 3 studies in different groups of people with CF who have at least one copy of the F Delta508 mutation. We will begin to see the first results from the VX-661 program by early 2017 and, importantly, this program is also meant to provide a significant amount of safety data to support evaluation of a next generation corrector with VX-661and ivacaftor as part of an investigational triple combination regimen.","At the end of 2015, we initiated clinical development of two next generation correctors; VX-152 and VX-440. Phase 1 studies of each compound are ongoing in healthy volunteers and are evaluating single and multiple doses of VX-152 and VX-440, as well as triple combination with VX-661 and ivacaftor.","Together with the safety data from the VX-661 program, these studies are designed to support the planned initiation of Phase 2 studies to evaluate triple combination regimens in patients in the second half of 2016.","Our business model is unique. The success we have achieved in CF allows us to reinvest in the discovery and development of new transformative medicines. In parallel with CF, we are advancing a number of additional development programs for cancer, pain, and other serious diseases.","We have significant flexibility in how we may advance these programs, either independently for those diseases we believe are aligned with the focus of our business, specifically specialty diseases where G&A expenses are low, or in collaboration with other companies that we believe would be best suited to rapidly bring these potential medicines to patients.","We believe our pipeline represents both potentially transformative future medicines for patients and significant value for our business. We have begun to provide some additional insight and data for our pipeline programs and I look forward to providing updates on our progress throughout the coming year.","I mentioned at the start of my remarks that Vertex has undergone an important transition in recent years. We are now a global biotech company that has independently brought forward two breakthrough medicines to people with CF worldwide and is on the path to delivering significant earnings and cash flow.","Our financial performance in 2015 and guidance for 2016 are metrics of the kind of company that we want to become, a company that consistently creates transformative new medicines for patients, generates significant value for shareholders, and reinvests in scientific opportunities to create future medicines.","This is our business model and I am pleased by our success to date and with our outlook for the coming years. With that I'll turn the call over to Ian.","Ian Smith","Thanks, Jeff. In my remarks today, I will review our fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results, and discuss our 2016 financial guidance for total KALYDECO net revenues and non-GAAP operating expenses, excluding cost of revenues. I will also discuss our expectation for providing ORKAMBI guidance in 2016.","Financial results first. Our 2015 net CF product revenues were approximately $983 million. This includes KALYDECO net revenues of $632 million and ORKAMBI net revenues of $351 million. Total CF product revenues increased by more than 110% compared to 2014.","In the fourth quarter of 2015, we reported total net CF product revenues of approximately $401 million, including KALYDECO net revenues of $181 million and ORKAMBI net revenues of $220 million.","Fourth quarter KALYDECO sales of $181 million were up 45% versus the fourth quarter of last year and up 9% versus the third quarter of 2015. This included approximately $6 million in inventory stocking that occurred at the end of the fourth quarter.","Growth in KALYDECO was driven by both label expansion efforts which increased the number of eligible patients to approximately 4,000 and by the completion of key reimbursement discussions in Europe. With ORKAMBI, more than 1,500 patients started in the fourth quarter, resulting in sales of $220 million, up 68% versus third quarter of 2015.","As expected, we saw a very rapid uptake for ORKAMBI in the period immediately following the FDA approval with more than 3,000 people starting treatment in the third quarter.","Demand from patients and physicians has been strong. But, as expected, fewer patients started treatment in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, in line with our prior statements regarding expectations for the rate of uptake for ORKAMBI.","We expect this trend to continue through the end of 2016, by which time we expect the vast majority of the 8,500 eligible patients in the U.S. to have initiated treatment with ORKAMBI.","Growth to net adjustments were largely unchanged from the third quarter and were in the high single-digits due primarily to a greater proportion of patients within commercial plans initiating treatment in the first six months following the approval of ORKAMBI as compared to government paid plans.","Each of the 50 state Medicaid programs has now paid a claim for ORKAMBI, thus we expect gross to net adjustments will increase to the mid-teens by the end of 2016 to reflect an increase in patients treated being covered by Medicaid.","As we enter 2016, we are pleased with the launch of ORKAMBI to date, and remain focused on working to ensure those who need the medicine have access to it, educating healthcare providers and supporting adherence to ORKAMBI.","Now to operating expenses. Our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were $282 million, including R&D expenses of $204 million and SG&A expenses of $78 million. The increased R&D expensed in the fourth quarter 2015 compared to 2014 were primarily the result of increased costs related to the pivotal Phase 3 program for VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor.","The increased SG&A expenses were primarily the result of an increased investment in global commercial support for the launch of ORKAMBI. And tonight I am pleased to report that for the fourth quarter 2015 we recorded a non-GAAP net profit of $43 million, or $0.17 per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net loss of $132 million or $0.55 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014.","Our 2015 non-GAAP net loss was $268 million, or $1.11 per share, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $511 million or $2.17 per share for the full year 2014.","From a balance sheet perspective, we started 2016 with a strong cash position of $1.04 billion. Vertex also has $300 million outstanding from a credit agreement that provides for a secured loan of up to $500 million.","Now, let's turn to the 2016 financial guidance, which we first provided on January 10th. We expect 2016 KALYDECO net revenues of $670 million to $690 million. Our guidance for KALYDECO revenues reflects the continued use of KALYDECO as was seen in the fourth quarter of 2015, which resulted in revenues of $181 million, and the expectation for up to approximately 200 patients with a gating mutation to enroll in a Phase 3 clinical study of VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor who would otherwise have received KALYDECO, which will thus reduce 2016 KALYDECO revenues.","There was also an approximately $6 million inventory stocking that occurred at the end of the fourth quarter 2015. That is not expected to recur in future quarters and is thus accounted for in our guidance.","Importantly, our current guidance excludes any potential revenues from the approval of KALYDECO for people with residual function mutations. We will update our KALYDECO guidance should we receive FDA approval for residual function mutations.","With ORKAMBI, more than 4,500 people have begun treatment in the U.S. by the end of 2015. There are four primary pieces of information regarding the launch that will inform our decision regarding ORKAMBI guidance.","First, since all patients who initiated treatment with ORKAMBI in 2015 have been on treatment for approximately six months or less, we are waiting additional information on the compliance rate for patients taking ORKAMBI.","While we continue to expect that the vast majority of eligible patients in the U.S. will begin treatment with ORKAMBI by the end of 2016, we're waiting additional information on the specific rate of uptake and on the specific proportion of the 8,500 eligible patients who begin treatment with ORKAMBI in 2016.","And finally, additional information on the persistence rate, defined as how many patients remain on treatment will also be taken into account.","These four factors, the compliance rate, the rate at which patients begin treatment, the total number of patients who initiate treatment, and the persistence rate, all are important in considering our guidance for ORKAMBI. In 2016, we expect to recognize revenues from sales of ORKAMBI in the U.S. and Germany.","In Germany, there are approximately 2,500 people with CF, ages 12 and older, with two copies of F508del mutation. In Europe, country to country reimbursement discussions are underway. However, we do not anticipate any significant ORKAMBI revenues from countries other than the U.S. and Germany in 2016.","The final component of our financial guidance is non-GAAP operating expenses, which are comprised of R&D and SG&A expenses and exclude cost of revenues. We expect our total 2016 non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.18 billion to $1.23 billion.","As a reminder, our guidance for 2015 operating expenses was for $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion, and we reported 2015 operating expenses at the low end of this range of $1.06 billion, largely as a result of costs related to VX-661 that will now occur in 2016 as opposed to 2015.","The increase in expense expected operating expenses for 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily a result of expanded development efforts related to the pivotal Phase 3 development program for VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor and for multiple Phase 1 and two studies of Vertex's early stage of mid-stage pipeline of potential CF medicines and anticipated SG&A costs to support the launch of ORKAMBI in new global markets.","The components of Vertex's non-GAAP operating expenses include non-GAAP R&D expenses, which we expect to be in the range of $850 million to $880 million, and non-GAAP SG&A expenses, which we expect will be in the range of $330 million to $350 million. Vertex's expected non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses exclude stock-based compensation expense and certain other expenses.","In summary, we are in a strong financial position as we enter 2016. We remain committed to delivering a financial profile that is similar to many of our large cap biotech peers, which includes sustainable revenue and earnings growth, high operating margins, and most importantly, continued investment to create future medicines.","Michael Partridge","Thank you. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is open.","Geoff Meacham","Hey guys. Thanks for the question and congrats on profitability. I got a commercial and clinical question for you I guess I will start with commercial. Wanted to know if you can go into a little bit more detail about persistence rates over time with KALYDECO and whether this should be a real benchmark for ORKAMBI. I'm just curious if you guys have tracked people who have discontinued, but later comeback to therapy.","Jeff Leiden","So, Geoff maybe Stuart will take a question. So, thanks for the comment.","Stuart Arbuckle","Both quarter.","Jeff Leiden","Stuart is going to take the question might also comment on some of the other features that are affecting how we're thinking about the launch as well.","Geoff Meacham","Yes.","Stuart Arbuckle","Yes. Geoff, hi its Stuart here. So, yeah, let me reiterate a couple of things that Ian said about ORKAMBI and the factors we are taking into account when thinking about the launch in the way of tracking very closely.","One is obviously the peak penetration so the number of eligible patients in total that get initiated over therapy over time and we continue to expect the vast majority of 8,500 patients will.","Then there's a rate of uptake, how quickly we get to that peak penetration as you know at the end of December we had about 4,500 patients on therapy about 55% of the total and we expect that we'll get to peak penetration during the course of 2016.","And then as you said one of the other key components is persistence, the number of patients who stay on therapy. And obviously it's pretty early days because whilst we've only been on the market for six months, we really don't have long-term experience with very many patients yet.","In the Phase 3 studies for ORKAMBI, at about 24 weeks in traffic and transport about 5% of patients have discontinued, the 48 weeks in the open label extension with ORKAMBI, we were at 15% of patients had discontinued. So, that's in the ORKAMBI clinical trials and time will tell whether we see a higher number or lower number, but probably a higher number who are discontinuing in the real world.","With KALYDECO, in the studies we looked at, it was about 5% of patients again who had discontinued in the KALYDECO clinical trials. It was actually slightly higher than that in the real world, it got closer to 10%. So, in the real world, over time and largely that was a longer period of time, we did see a slightly higher number -- higher percentage of patients on KALYDECO discontinue versus the clinical trials.","The last thing we're going to be thinking about that is obviously compliance and that's the percentage of patients who actually take the pills that have been prescribed by their physician.","As you know KALYDECO is very, very high at 85%, certainly the highest I've ever seen personally for a chronic medication. Obviously medicines are roundabout the 60% range, I would anticipate ORKAMBI is going to be in that range probably towards the higher part of that range, but somewhere in that range.","The only other question we will have to look at very closely and again we just don't have data on it, we don't have data on it in the clinical program Geoff and we'll have to see how it plays out in the real world is whether physicians and patients choose to reinitiate therapy if they have discontinued for some reason.","And we just have no information from the clinical trials because they just weren't set up to look at that, if a patient discontinued they would then excluded from further therapy. So, we just don't have data on that right now Geoff. Hopefully that gives you some perspective on what we're thinking. ","Geoff Meacham","No, that's helpful. And just real quick on the clinical side, when you look at the 152 and 440 study and healthy, has there been any evidence of drug\/drug interactions with KALYDECO and 661 and I guess I'm trying to figure out whether you guys expect to take multiple doses of those to correctors into CF patients when you look to this back half of the year. Maybe just help us with the design of that 28-day study as you see it at this stage. Thanks.","Jeff Chodakewitz","Hi Jeff, it's Jeff Chodakewitz. So, in terms of the Phase 1 studies for VX-152 and 440, we're really in the midst of those studies and we obviously can't comment on the ongoing trials. Maybe just a comment on [Indiscernible] Phase 2 and we're in early days in terms of those designs, but I do think it's likely that we would look to take multiple doses of the compounds into those Phase 2 studies to learn as much as we can.","Geoff Meacham","Got you. Okay. Thanks a lot guys.","Jeff Leiden","Thanks Geoff.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden of UBS. Your line is now open.","Matt Roden","Great. Thanks very much for taking the question. I also wanted to congratulate you on the milestone of turning back to profitability. So, regarding the pediatric study I understand the primary endpoint is safety and the LCI data look really good, which in the latter point being important for what's going on in Europe.","But just wanted to get your perspective on the sort of 2.5% improvement in FEV. Have you talked to any experts or the FDA about that? I can't imagine that's going to be any kind of issue for you, but just wanted to see if there's anything to add on that side.","And then on the commercial side, wanted to ask, you have left the residual function mutations out of the KALYDECO guidance, but just trying to get a sense for if that were to be approved, how should we think about the onboarding of those patients on to commercial drug?","I'd imagine you have a conversion of those that are on trial to commercial, but apart from that, would you characterize this is a highly motivated subset of patients or because they have a milder phenotype could this be a slower rate of penetration? Thanks very much.","Jeff Chodakewitz","Hi Matt, it's Jeff Chodakewitz, maybe I'll start. So, in terms of the pediatric study, we were pleased with the results of the study, really meaning both endpoints for exposure for PK and then for safety as you said, so that was a nice outcome.","The expectation with the FDA is that once you have established efficacy in the same disease in older children that as you move to younger age groups -- really -- it's really about that exposure and safety consistent with the design of the study.","I will say that I think we were also quite pleased with the evidence of efficacy in the population where it gets harder to actually demonstrate that. And I think actually the FEV1 showing that strong trend was actually quite favorable remembering that these kids started any pretty high FEV1 percentage of baseline and actually you noted the fact that the LCI measure, which is in its earlier days, was nicely positive and that's our primary endpoint in the European study and lastly the BMI kind of measures as well. So, I think overall we were quite satisfied with the results of the trial.","Stuart Arbuckle","Matt, its Stuart here just to comment on the residual function. So, as you said, residual function is not included within the KALYDECO guidance that we have provided. There's about 1,500 patients with the 23 mutations that we've asked for within our filing.","In terms of patients transferring from clinical trials, clearly the article trial on which the application is based or which included in the clinical trial is very small. So, it's not as if the huge bolus of patients to transition from clinical supply to commercial supply.","In terms of rate of uptake, the best analog of think for you there would be R117H which by definition is a residual function mutation. And so both in terms of peak penetration and rate of uptake, I think that's probably the best analog for you to think of in terms of the rate of uptake we might see if we're approved.","And then just to illustrate what Ian said in his prepared remarks, if we're approved in residual function, our anticipation is that we update our KALYDECO guidance to reflect that.","Matt Roden","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Samir Siddhanti","Hi, this Samir on for Terence. Thanks for taking the question. Have all ORKAMBI clinical trial patients in the U.S. transition to commercial drug? And if not, how many are left to transition? Thanks so much.","Jeff Leiden","I'm not going to comment on exactly how many, but the vast majority of the patients who were on clinical trial supply have now transitioned to commercial drug. Just to orient you there was approximately 500 in total of the patients in traffic and transport were in the U.S.","Samir Siddhanti","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your question please.","Matthew Harrison","Great. Thanks for taking the question. So, I just had two quick ones. So, one, just Ian can you go back to the KALYDECO stocking comment that you made and just tell us if you think we should see some of that inventory come out of the channel this year and how that's in your guidance?","And then separately just on the EU pediatric study, how will data from that influence maybe FDA perception of the filing that you guys have? And also how is timing of that related to when you would expect to have a PDUFA date for the label expansion in the U.S.? Thanks.","Ian Smith","Yes, so I'll take the first one and then Jeff Chodakewitz can take the second question. So firstly, the stocking question that you ask is for all people we estimated there was a proximally $6 million of inventory stocking in the fourth quarter for KALYDECO. What we mean by that is the inventory was higher at December 31 compared to September 30 by $6 million. That will then sell out of the channel, so it does impact future sales because it was in inventory.","We have removed that from our guidance, so when we made an estimate for our 2016 KALYDECO guidance, we removed that. In fact I think when we all met in JPMorgan, San Francisco I gave people a simple calculation to think about how we got to our guidance for 2016. I'll refer to the again which is in the fourth quarter of 2015, we did approximately $180 million of KALYDECO revenues, $181 million to be precise, but approximately $180 million.","If you multiply that -- if you take $6 million out of that and you get $174 million worth of fourth quarter run rate revenue and then multiply that by four, you then actually deduct the patients from that annualized number and you get to approximate range of the guidance that we provided which was $670 million to $690 million for KALYDECO. So, we did take account for that stocking.","Jeff Chodakewitz","Great. And this is Jeff, I think in terms of your questions around pediatrics, maybe starting with the U.S., as we said we expect to submit our file in the second quarter of this year, we haven't yet had those discussions with the FDA of course, but we're operating under the assumption of a six-month review time. The European study is still ongoing, it's enrolling and I don't really see there being much interaction in terms of those processes.","Michael Partridge","Operator, we're ready for the next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Michael Yee","Hi thanks, good afternoon. As it relates -- guidance for Ian I know there is no formal guidance for ORKAMBI, but is the key message here when I look at the consensus of 1.6 billion, is the key message to think about the discontinuation is a little bit higher in compliance a little bit lower based on the comments that Stuart made in the U.S.?","And then on OUS, Ian do I need to be clear that Germany is the only country being launched? Are there other things I need to think about when I look at the consensus of 345 million? Maybe they make a common of that and how consensus is modeling just so I'm clear on that.","And then second question is just a quick clinical question, on 152 and 440, in the Phase 1 even though it's healthy, is there anything quite hard or any other biomarkers you're looking at that you will disclose that could give any hints of efficacy? Thanks.","Ian Smith","Thanks for the questions Mike, Jeff Chodakewitz has actually just stepped out while you asked that second question.","Jeff Leiden","Might be able to tell, Jeff has a pretty bad cold.","Ian Smith","I just want to make sure he heard your question. I'll take the first question and so Jeff will take the second question. So, first of all, know we are not trying to say discontinuation is a bigger issue than compliance. I actually appreciate asking the question so we can clarify that. That's not what we are trying to say and it's not actually what we are saying even early on in this launch.","But I appreciate the opportunity to comment on how people are thinking about the ORKAMBI launch and how we're seeing at reflected in sell-side models and specifically 2016, let's say forecasted that are in the sell-side models.","So, obviously, when you look at consensus, there a number of different models that are out there, a number of different numbers and so there's some extreme numbers and then there are some that are more towards the normal.","What I would say, I don't know the assumptions that are being put into other people's models, but I would ask you to listen carefully to Stuart's comments, where we touch on when do we believe we're going to get to peak penetration, the rate of uptake of ORKAMBI and then importantly, the persistence and compliance because specifically compliance if people take six pills out of every 10, it straightforward, you get $6 out of every $10 of your gross price.","And obviously there is a gross to net discount based on whether you've got Medicaid patients versus private payer patients. And so I just -- the opportunity to comment on this call to all people that wanted, I want to make sure that people are giving thorough consideration to all this aspects of the launch and would be happy to talk to you after the call as well.","As far as your question regarding Germany, Germany is the only country that we expect any significant revenues from outside of the U.S. And just to give you the background of Germany, Germany has an estimated 2,500 patients. We believe it could take 12 to 18 months to reach the peak penetration in those patients and we provided people with a price in Germany.","And it is one aspect of the sell-side models that I do struggle with, because when I look at and ex-U.S. consensus of the sell-side model, a number that's close to $300 million; I find it very challenging for us to accrue that much revenue from Germany alone.","And so I do appreciate you calling that out and so I just hope that people are giving consideration to all these features when modeling the ORKAMBI launch. And then --","Michael Yee","Yeah -- 152.","Jeff Leiden","Just very briefly about 152 and 440 I really can't tell into the details of the ongoing studies, but as you know the main focus for Phase 1 study is there's got to be exposure and safety and we learned a lot from those ongoing studies.","Michael Yee","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Ying Huang","Hi, good afternoon, thanks for taking my questions. Maybe first one is for Stuart. So, ORKAMBI you can look at a much larger eligible patient population here. I know you guys have this clinical [Indiscernible] reimbursement agreement with Australian government for KALYDECO. Do you expect government payers to ask for some similar arrangement for ORKAMBI besides Australia?","And then the second one I have on clinical side is maybe for Jeff, talking about the preclinical data you have, what's the metabolism and also secretion route for the two next generation CFTR correctors? Do expect any drug-drug interaction at all based on the way the drugs are metabolized and secreted with ORKAMBI? Thank you.","Stuart Arbuckle","Ying Stuart here, I'll take your first question. Thanks for the question on reimbursement and kind of I have to cut to the chase, I really can't speculate on exactly what our arrangements are going to look like with governments around the world because we really are just at the beginning of that process and just to remind people, in most countries it is really a three-step process.","There will be a clinical assessments of the risks and benefits of the agent, then as a pharmacoeconomic assessment and that really then is the sort of starting point for than the price and contracting negotiations and until we kind of work our way through that process it's really impossible to speculate on exactly what the nature of any relationship that we might come to with the various governments around the world. And for the cynical question, I will hand that over to Jeff.","Jeff Leiden","Sure. Briefly, you are asking about metabolism and so forth and as you know, it's very hard from preclinical data to speculate especially in Chile really understand exposures and so forth. We are going to understand that much better from our Phase I study. I would point back to what we have said all along about our NextGen molecules that we wanted to get molecules that weren\u2019t just look good in Vitro but actually could be medicines and that's the way we've approached it.","Ying Huang","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Cory Kasimov","Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. I wanted to go back to the topic of ORKAMBI outside of U.S. obviously there's a lot of talk about reimbursement and time to rollout in Europe but wanted to go to other regions such as Canada and you just mentioned Australia but following the approval in Canada -- I noticed 1500 patients that meet the label criteria, can you remind us of the market size in Australia as well? And once you do have the reimbursement in place, what would you expect the anticipated pace of uptake and really just the overall relevance of these markets to be from a commercial standpoint. Thanks.","Stuart Arbuckle","Yeah, Cory, Stuart here. As you said, the eligible patient population of F508del home as I get in Canada is about 1500 patients and that\u2019s out of about 4000 total CF patients that we estimate in Canada. Now that we've got the kind of regulatory approval we can now begin to seek public reimbursements for ORKAMBI in Canada and as you know as I\u2019ve just described the process there is again a clinical assessment. There will be a pharmacoeconomic assessment and then there will be a price negotiation, probably through the pan-Canadian pricing alliance process that we went through with KALYDECO.","In terms of rate of uptake, much as we are seeing here in the U.S., I do anticipate that the relative rate of uptake will be slower for ORKAMBI than it was with KALYDECO in Canada and indeed other markets outside of the U.S. for the same reason. It's just the sheer volume of patients as much larger than it is for KALYDECO and it's just more of an administrative burden to initiate patients. So much like we\u2019re seeing here in the U.S. I'd expect the relative rate of uptake for ORKAMBI to be less than it is for -- less rapid than it was for KALYDECO in Canada and are indeed other markets outside of the U.S.","Jeff Leiden","Cory, this is Jeff Leiden. Maybe just to add one comment obviously we\u2019ve heard a lot from Ian and Stuart and some of the questions about the kinetics of the launch and some of the short-term modeling. I do think it's important to stand back as well and remember what the total opportunity is which I think is where your question is going.","So if you think about where we are today versus where we were even six months ago, right? Today, we have approval for 8500 patients in the U.S. and we have a launch that we are really pleased with more than 4500 or 55% of the patients already on drugs in the U.S. which I think is remarkable.","We have reimbursements in the U.S. that\u2019s gone actually better than we have been expected meaning every state Medicaid is now reimbursing the drug and the majority of the private insurers are.","We have approval in Europe and are starting a launch in Germany as you heard in the press release and ATU in France. Now we have approval in Canada which gives us access to 1500 private patients and the ability to negotiate reimbursement as Stuart said to an additional like 2500 patients or so.","And so when you look at the total opportunity, it's actually every bit of what we thought before we have made significant progress and nothing of that has changed. It's impossible to predict the exact kinetics what's going to happen in the first quarter versus the second quarter but at least the way we look at it is we look out over the next couple of years we see that opportunity intact and progressing really nicely and I think it's important to sort of see that in the big picture as well as the short term model. So I hope that helps.","Cory Kasimov","Yeah, helpful perspective. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brian Abrahams","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Two questions, first, on the clinical side on the 6 to 11 year-old population. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the natural history of untreated patients on the lung clearance index and points. Where does it typically go over a six months period in children of this age? I guess balancing disease progression versus normal growth. Does it typically worsen our stay flat? And then on the clinical\/commercial side, can you give us anymore granularity on the ongoing Phase III B study in low FEV1 patients the doses timeline and potential impact that data might have to help these patients manage through the initial side effects and stay on therapy?","Jeff Chodakewitz","Hi, Brian. It's Jeff Chodakewitz. So let\u2019s -- maybe start with the LCI and as we talk about little bit it is an early measure. So the information I could give you is somewhat imperfect just so you know and the advantage we think is being able in children who have relatively normal FEV1 that as you know they have significant underlying disease. Their pulmonary function really is far from normal. It allows you to measure that.","And over reasonably short periods of time sort of like a six-month period as we go in our clinical studies, there could be small decreases but we think overall that should be relatively stable. There may be modest shift over time but we think we would be able to have a reasonable baseline for assessing it.","So actually that\u2019s part of why the data that we had coming out of our pediatric study even without the control arm was encouraging to us. Maybe I will take a comment on the study in patients whose FEV1 are less than 40.","We are still -- actually in the process of collecting all that data. We are still in rolling but we think that there is some useful information there just in terms of the experience that we have accrued.","We did to your specific question did give hard way through give investigators the opportunity to start with a lower dose and then step up to full dose. That would be -- it's not a perfect evaluation of that but we were really trying to do what you said which is to help explore what could help patients get through those early weeks of dosing. We're going to summarize all that data and present it and use it from an education perspective as well.","Brian Abrahams","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alicia Young of Credit Suisse. Your question please.","Alicia Young","Thanks guys for take my questions and squeezing me in and congrats on the non-graph in the Green. Maybe just a couple. One if something happens with the residual where the FDA may request information do you guys have a strategy on how you might pursue that population going forward?","And then also with the potential kind of chest tightness that sometimes happens, our text kind of suggest if that happens earlier rather than later like in the first couple of weeks but is there a dynamic where it could happen later and did you see similarities and differences though you probably titrated in the safety in the younger populations?","Jeff Leiden","Yeah, hi, Alicia. It\u2019s Jeff Leiden. Maybe I'll take the first one since it's a bit of a science and a policy question, strategy question I think then Jeff see if you can take the second question on the chest tightness. So maybe just to give you a little background, I know you are aware of this but the RF application is a little bit unusual compared to the other applications. That Vertex has submitted on KALYDECO and ORKAMBI which are always based on large Phase III studies.","This one is different. It\u2019s basically aimed at about 1500 patients with 23 different mutations resulting in residual function. And it\u2019s based predominantly on preclinical data. That is cell-based data from cells that have been engineered to have those 23 different mutations supported by a very small Phase 2a study of about 24 patients that comprised eight or nine of those 23 mutations.","And so what we are really asking the FDA to look at is both the science and the medicine. That we are submitting but also there is a policy question here which is how do extend the label of a drug like KALYDECO to very rare populations of mutations?","Some of these mutations only have four patients in the last or ten patients in the U.S. and that's a very important policy question in precision medicine that as you know the FDA is considering much more broadly even just in CF. And so part of the reason why it\u2019s little difficult to handicap this one is because of this combination of clinical and policy sort of things.","We feel very strongly it is the right thing to do for patients that's why we did it. There are 1,500 patients in the U.S. but today don't have any CFTR correction therapy of any sort. And it would be years before they could get them based on large Phase 3 trials.","For us this is definitely the right thing to do for patients and we believe in the science strongly and in the clinical support that we have but handicapping with the FDA is going to do obviously is a bit more difficult we will know by February 7 and then based upon what we do we have obviously come up with a strategy but again our goal is to try to get this medicine that has four years of safety data to these patients as soon as possible.","Jeff Chodakewitz","Great. And it\u2019s Jeff Chodakewitz. Just to comment on your question about the chest tightness. Maybe first step back to our Phase 3 results which I think are the most definitive information. And as you noted those adverse events did occur very early. They were manageable in the vast majority of people and they did decrease overtime.","Usually the average duration was approximately two weeks. So I think all of that really comes out of our Phase 3 data and suggested is an early event and the experience in our pediatric study was actually completely consistent with that. It was a small number, it happened early and in fact nobody discontinued because of that.","Alicia Young","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And next question comes from the line of Liisa Bayko of JMP Securities. Your line is open.","Liisa Bayko","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to better understand what you are describing with Canada in terms of the private payers. I know there are 1,500 patients that are -- would be eligible for ORKAMBI. Can you break that down into how many of those would be private?","Stuart Arbuckle","Yes. Lisa, it\u2019s Stuart. There is 1500 patients in total who are 12 and over who are homozygous for the F508del mutation. And we estimate there is about 30% of those would be covered by some form of private insurance.","Private insurance may take some time to kicking in Canada; it is not necessarily quite as rapid for them to come to a decision certainly that was our experience with KALYDECO. But approximately 30% of the 1500 patients we estimate will have some form of private insurance.","Liisa Bayko","Okay, thanks, that\u2019s helpful. And then the data on the kids look really impressive with the LCI. Can you maybe comment on the clinical meaningfulness of that number? Obviously, we are not as used to seeing that number as we are with FEV. So I would be curious if you could put some context on that. Thanks.","Jeff Chodakewitz","Sure. It\u2019s Jeff Chodakewitz. And I will say that in terms of that kind of validation of saying what the minimally clinically important differences it doesn't exist for that tool. I will say based on our discussions with people who are experts in the methodology, we were -- we kind of targeted a 0.7 decrease.","Remember in this measure, actually a negative number is an improvement because of the way the test is done. So, I can't give you an exact number, but hopefully that gives you some context in why we were pleased with the results. ","Jeff Leiden","And Liisa, this is Jeff. Maybe to reiterate one thing that Jeff C. said before because I think it's important. And I remember you and I talking about this at one point, that we are very interested in some of these alternative endpoints for a couple of reasons.","One, as Jeff said, these may be much more applicable to populations in which it is difficult to measure FEV1, like the kids, particularly as they get younger. But also because, as you know, FEV1, which is a measure of midsize airway resistance, is quite a bit downstream or upstream, if you will, from the problem in CF, which is really a distal airway gas exchange problem.","And actually LCI is probably a much more sensitive measure closer to the actual physiology of what is going on in CF. And so we have been very eager to start to see results from these kinds of studies to tell whether LCI could actually turn out to be as good or better an endpoint than FEV1. And obviously we need to provide agencies with clinical data to support that and this is the first step in that process.","Liisa Bayko","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau of Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Phil Nadeau","Jeff and Ian thanks for taking my questions. Just to -- as we begin to model the younger kids -- the penetration of ORKAMBI to the kids age six to 11, are there any issues with compliance persistence or uptake in that population that you want to point out or do you expect similar rates of those elements in the younger kids as in the older?","And then second, on the pipeline, I think we are expecting the ENaC monotherapy data midyear. Can you give us some idea of where you are looking for in that data set and what would be proof of concept? Thank you.","Ian Smith","In terms of modeling the kids, were we lucky enough to get an approval this year, I'd certainly recommend that people take into account the same considerations that's the peak penetration, time to peak, persistence rate and compliance, and model those each individually.","In terms of what we have seen with KALYDECO, we have seen that the worst compliance we see tends to be in that teenage to young adultsville. And so because kids -- our assumption because kids are very closely monitored by their parents, particularly in that six to 11 year age group, perhaps not surprisingly, we see high levels of compliance with that particular patient group.","We tend to see a bit of a dip, perhaps unsurprisingly, in the teenage to young adults group. So, we might anticipate in the six to 11 group that that would be our best complying patient population and that is certainly what we have seen with KALYDECO.","Jeff Chodakewitz","And it's Jeff Chodakewitz. Just maybe a couple of comments on the ENaC program. First of all, there is an ongoing Phase 2 study that Parion has the lead on. That study is across all different types of genotypes in terms of the patient population and so we're going to be really looking for early evidence of activity in that study. And not just looking overall, but we're going to be trying to learn looking among the different subpopulations and we still expect the results of that to come out around midyear.","At the same time, we're going to be starting our study, which is very complementary to the study that's ongoing this quarter and that study is going to be in 508 homozygous patients who already are going to be receiving ORKAMBI.","And then looking to see whether the ENaC inhibitor can add to the efficacy for that population. And actually the preclinical data in our hands actually suggests that that may be the best way to get activity and benefit for patients from that mechanism. And so ultimately it's going to be learning from both of those trials as we better understand what the potential for that mechanism may be.","Phil Nadeau","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Walsh of Stifel. Your line is open.","Michael Partridge","Adam, are you there?","Adam Walsh","Yes, I'm here. Hi. Thanks a lot for taking my question. I really appreciate it. I guess I have two questions. The first one is for Jeff Leiden. We have been out talking to docs and, according to them; your GPS reimbursement support program is really terrific. I'll start with that, but some of these docs also note that the total out-of-pocket cost burden for a lot of CF patients is really quite high, even before they try to get on ORKAMBI or KALYDECO.","And I'm just curious in terms of -- with that in mind, how do you think about how far you can go to support patients, given the fact that if a co-pay is, say, 20%, and that adds quite a bit of out-of-pocket expense, where is -- how far can you go in supporting the patients there both with your own medicines and thinking about this in the context of the portfolio medicines they may already be on?","That's one. And then I have a question for Jeff Chodakewitz as well. It mentioned in the press release that two patients discontinued treatment in the ORKAMBI six-to-1 study because of adverse events. If you could comment briefly on those two patients, that would be great. Thank you.","Jeff Leiden","Thanks for the questions. This is Jeff Leiden. I'm actually going to turn that one over to Stuart, because he is really responsible for the GPS program and he will also be able to describe the patient assistance program that has allowed us to help patients who do have high co-pays. ","Stuart Arbuckle","Yes, Adam, thanks for the question and thanks for the positive feedback. The GPS program, just so everybody is aware of it, is a service which is there to help patients and help them navigate the reimbursement process and there to provide them with ongoing education if they choose to opt in. It is great to get the feedback on that.","Now dealing with the question you raised about out-of-pocket costs. For both KALYDECO and ORKAMBI, we have comprehensive patient assistance programs in terms of co-pay assistance for eligible patients.","The program is such that no patient who has a co-pay who is eligible for the program would have a monthly co-pay for either KALYDECO or ORKAMBI about $15 per month.","And then for those patients who have coinsurance, we will cover coinsurance up to 30% of the price of the medicines. And the program is to keep things simple for people, identical for both KALYDECO and ORKAMBI.","Jeff Chodakewitz","And it's Jeff Chodakewitz. In terms of the pediatric study, as we pointed out, the overall profile was actually quite favorable. If there were two patients who discontinued, one of them was because of abnormal liver function tests and one of them was because of a rash.","Adam Walsh","Great. Thanks a lot.","Michael Partridge","Operator, we have time for two more questions.","Operator","Yes, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Your question please.","Mark Schoenebaum","Hey, guys, first question is on guidance. Should we assume your financial guidance is more or less conservative than Partridge's statement that this call would end by 5:45? Because you missed that pretty badly, so I'm a little concerned here.","Anyway, just really quick ones. I know it's getting late. Number one, can you just tell us when to expect data from the Phase 2 triple combo that you are going to start this year? I assume that is a mid-2017 event? Let me know if I'm wrong on that.","And then, number two, I apologize if you addressed this. If you did I missed it. But can you confirm the timing and your disclosure intentions around the -- what I believe is the futility analysis in the HETMIN trial?","Ian Smith","So, Mark its Ian. I'll take both of those questions.","Mark Schoenebaum","I want an answer to the Partridge question, please.","Ian Smith","In his prepared remarks he said the call would be brief as well. So, he was wrong there as well.","Mark Schoenebaum","Pretty embarrassing.","Jeff Leiden","Luckily he doesn't give financial guidance for us.","Ian Smith","So, your first question was regarding the triple. And so -- first of all, the timing of getting data from the triple or disclosing the data from the triple is really subject to how fast we move through the Phase 1. And we've mentioned this before, the longer our Phase 1 takes, actually the better it is because it means we're escalating the dose and we're getting greater exposure of the drug into the healthy volunteers.","And based on where we expect this to go, we anticipate in the second half of the year we will be in the proof-of-concept triple studies, which will probably push us into early 2017 to get that data. So, that's how we are trying to set a timing expectation.","And then your second question was on the disclosure regarding which -- futility. The HETMIN futility. So, the HETMIN in terms of recruitment to that trial is actually going very nicely, as you might anticipate, given that these patients have no other alternative medicine.","And so we anticipate that we will be completed enrollment around the middle of the year. And, therefore, we do expect the futility study to be done in the second half of the year. Obviously, we won't be disclosing that unless we have to curtail the study. So, no news would be good news on that assessment.","Mark Schoenebaum","Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot. And congrats on the Pat's loss.","Jeff Leiden","Now you're hurting us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tony Butler of Guggenheim Securities. Your question please.","Tony Butler","Yes, thanks very much for allowing me to squeeze one in. There are number of respiratory articles that actually support the use of LCI as an endpoint because it does demonstrate greater sensitivity. I guess the question is really what is the correlation between LCI and FEV, given that LCI apparently becomes abnormal earlier than spirometry and yet, in the later stage disease, it seems to correlate. And then, therefore, can you only use LCI in children?","My last question -- I guess that's for Jeff C. And my last question really for Jeff L. Are you going to publish the kinetics and functionality of 152 and 440 soon? Or I guess ever, in a peer reviewed journal? Thank you.","Jeff Leiden","Jeff -- I'll take the first question. And then -- I'll quickly say we will make the appropriate steps in terms of where we publish data regarding our molecules as we move forward. Obviously you've seen a lot of publications at NACF, which is in the fall and then overseas the ECFS conference, so you'll probably expect to see more data at those conferences. And then to your other question, Jeff.","Jeff Chodakewitz","Maybe a couple more comments on LCI. And as you point out, they do have overlapping but somewhat different sweet spots, if you will, in terms of the best way to use them. And I do think, as a field, this links back to Jeff Leiden's comments that we're continuing to learn the best way to use each of them.","Obviously LCI has that potential sensitivity advantages in children. But right now there are only some centers that actually have the expertise to do that well. And, of course, a great tool used poorly doesn't really help anybody. So, I think there are still -- there is still a lot of work to be done.","And then there is the other part of your question about regulatory recognition. And I can't speak for the regulators, but I think it was encouraging that in Europe, LCI was accepted as our primary endpoint in our study. So, I think there is, in general an openness to continue to advance the field and hopefully we can contribute to that.","Tony Butler","Thank you both.","Jeff Leiden","Great. Well, thank you again for joining us tonight. Apologies for running over; it was all Michael's fault. At the risk of running for one or two more minutes, I did want to make a couple of concluding remarks.","And, again, I always like to do this sort of in retrospect and say where are we today as a company as compared to where we were six or 12 months ago. And I must say, from a personal standpoint and from the standpoint of CF patients, I'm very, very encouraged with the progress that we've made.","I think we -- it's now clear that KALYDECO and ORKAMBI together are approved for about 25,000 patients or almost a third of all patients -- CF patients in the world. As we discussed at JPMorgan, there's a fairly straightforward strategy through label expansion in the younger populations and others to take that number from 25,000 to 44,000 patients in the next couple of years.","And then we have a clear strategy with multiple prongs, actually, to get to the vast of majority patients. And they include the ENaC inhibitors which are in Phase 2, so they can move very rapidly if we see positive results there in combination with ORKAMBI.","They include the NextGen correctors, which are moving along in Phase 1 and which we hope to have in patients in the second half of this year. And we think those have the potential to both increase the efficacy for the patients we're treating today, but also to let us get to that large subset of HETMIN patients that don't have anything today.","And then finally the progress we have made with some of our deals, particularly the CRISPR deal here. And although that's the Holy Grail, 10 or 15 years down the road, we do have a vision of potentially correcting the underlying mutation and curing patients with CF.","And so as I look at the world from our perspective, obviously, I'm tremendously encouraged about the future opportunity and particularly the future opportunity for patients. And I'm pleased with the progress we're making and we'll look forward to updating you over the next year as we continue that.","Michael Partridge","Thanks very much, everybody. That concludes tonight's call. The IR team will be available in our offices for additional questions if you have them. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, you may disconnect your lines\u2026"],"22116":["Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call July 31, 2019  4:30 PM ET","Company Participants","Michael Partridge - SVP, IR","Charles Wagner - EVP and CFO","Jeff Leiden - Chairman, CEO, and President","Reshma Kewalramani - EVP, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs and CMO","Stuart Arbuckle - EVP and CCO","Conference Call Participants","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Company","Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs","Michael Yee - Jefferies","Alethia Young - Cantor Fitzgerald","Cory Kasimov - JPMorgan","Matthew Harrison - Morgan Stanley","Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets","Paul Matteis - Stifel","Geoffrey Porges - SVB Leerink","Mohit Bansal - Citi","Brian Skorney - Baird","Whitney Ijem - Guggenheim","Evan Seigerman - Credit Suisse","Michael Partridge","Welcome.

Tonight, we will review with you Vertex's Business Progress and provide our Second Quarter Financial Results.","Making prepared remarks on the call tonight, we have Dr. Jeff Leiden, Chairman and CEO; Dr. Reshma Kewalramani, Chief Medical Officer; and Charlie Wagner, Vertex's Chief Financial Officer. Stuart Arbuckle, Chief Commercial Officer, will join us for Q&A.","We recommend that you access the webcast slides on our website as you listen to this call. This conference call is being recorded and a replay will be on our website. We will make forward-looking statements on this call that are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in today's press release and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","These statements, including, without limitation, those regarding Vertex's marketed CF medicines, the ongoing development and potential commercialization of our triple combination regimens for cystic fibrosis, Vertex's other programs, and Vertex's future financial performance are based on management's current assumptions. Actual outcomes and events could differ materially.","I will now turn the call over to Dr. Jeff Leiden.","Jeff Leiden","Thanks Michael. Good evening everyone. It's with great pride and appreciation for all that our employees and leadership team are achieving, so I'd like to take a few minutes to talk about our progress and to affirm our strategy going forward.","I'm pleased to say that our business is outperforming on multiple fronts. As we enter the second of year area, we are on track to achieve or exceed our 2019 goals, and we're well-positioned for continued innovation and growth in the future.","We're treating more people with CF than ever before with our approved medicines, which continues to drive significant revenue growth to support investment and to creating future medicines. We have rapidly growing our pipeline beyond CF, and we now have ongoing development programs evaluating seven different potentially transformative medicines spanning five specialty diseases.","We have also established multiple new collaborations and acquisitions over the past year aim at complementing our productive internal research engine. First is CF. Our progress in CF has been extraordinary. In 2019 alone, we have received nine new regulatory approvals or label expansions for our CF medicines globally.","We reached new reimbursement agreements in 10 countries outside the U.S. and completed the Phase III program for our triple combination regimens involving nearly 1,000 patients. And just last week, we announced the submission of the New Drug Application for the triple combination of VX-445 tezacaftor and ivacaftor to the U.S. FDA, marking the most significant milestones to-date in our efforts to create new CF medicines over the past two decades.","The Phase III data we announced in May for the VX-445 triple combination regimen were unprecedented, showing improvements in lung function and other measures of the disease that were among the highest magnitude ever seen in any of our CF studies.","CF is a progressive and debilitating disease. We share the urgency of patients who are waiting for a new medicine to treat the underlying cause of their CF and we therefore moved quickly to complete our NDA to the VX-445 triple combination within just weeks of receiving the final data.","Outside the U.S., we are focused on reaching new reimbursement agreements for our current CF medicines. And wherever possible, we are seeking portfolio agreements that will also provide patients with access to future CF innovations from Vertex. Beyond CF, our pipeline is expanding and advancing rapidly. We have seven potential transformative new medicines and clinical development across five serious specialty disease areas, including alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, pain, APOL1-mediated kidney diseases, pain, sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia.","We are also increasing our external investment to build the toolkit to develop future breakthrough medicines and specific diseases we're interested in. Most recent example of these efforts are the recently completed acquisition of Exonics Therapeutics and our expanded collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics and the development of new genetic therapies for DMD and DM1.","These agreements provide us with development candidates that have shown promising preclinical results and also enable us to integrate cutting-edge scientific technology and expertise in diseases that are highly aligned with our business strategy. We plan to execute more of these types of fields as we further expand our pipeline of transformative medicines over the coming months and years.","Our strategy to create medicines by investing in serial scientific innovation is working as demonstrated by our continued strong performance in the first half of 2019. Importantly, our commercial success allows us to invest both internally in our own pipeline and externally through new collaborations to fuel our future growth. The results of our substantial and highly directed investments in R&D are evident in the significant progression of our pipeline, and we have the potential to achieve a risk-lowering clinical data in several programs in 2020.","Before I end my prepared remarks, I'd like to say a few words about the leadership transition that will happen eight months from now, where I will become Executive Chairman and Reshma will become Vertex's new President and CEO.","First, let me say that it's been a tremendous pleasure and honor to lead this company since 2012. I'm very proud of what the team has accomplished during that time. Vertex has never been stronger. Our business is growing rapidly and we'll continue to grow for the next decade as we bring elexacaftor to the vast majority of CF patients worldwide and then deliver on our clinical stage pipeline and multiple other serious diseases.","Based upon our success in CF, we now have the financial strength to invest in both internal and external innovation to deliver even more transformative medicines to more patients with serious diseases.","Finally, we have an outstanding senior leadership team with a proven track record of executing against our strategy. Together, these factors differentiate us and position us for long-term success. Having worked closely with Reshma for the last several years, I know that she is the perfect choice us to succeed me as CEO and fully prepared to lead Vertex into the future. As a position scientist, she has a deep commitment our strategy of serial innovation as well as our inclusive culture of outstanding science.","She is an excellent communicator and a strong collaborative leader with a proven ability to execute against our strategy and deliver results. Importantly, she has a track record of putting patients first in driving innovation to have a transformative impact on patients' lives.","Of course you all aren't getting rid of quite yet, as you probably know, smooth and undisrupted succession is historically been one of the biggest challenges for biotech companies. Recognizing this, the Board and I worked for several years on the succession plan that would ensure both strategic and operational continuity. As part of this plan, I'm looking forward to playing a continued active role in the company as Executive Chairman, supporting Reshma and our team to a smooth transition through Q1 2023.","Specifically, Reshma and I have agreed that I will maintain an active role in four areas of the company; business development, helping to get deals done and secure our access to external innovation in products; building our new Boston research site dedicated to genetic therapies; Investor Relations and public affairs and government relations where I have established important relationships with state, federal and international levels over the last seven years. I look forward to continuing to engage with you as the company progresses.","I'll now turn the call over to Reshma.","Reshma Kewalramani","Thank you, Jeff. I'm honored to become Vertex's next CEO. Over the last eight years, your strategic vision and relentless dedication to science and serial innovation has transformed the company, revolutionized the treatment of CF, and produced a pipeline of breakthrough medicines for other serious diseases. The success of our serial innovation strategy has also resulted in unprecedented financial strength.","I believe strongly in our differentiated strategy and I have no plans to change it. Our commitment to finish the journey in CF and to create multiple transformative medicines for other serious diseases has never been stronger. I look forward to continuing to work alongside Jeff and our outstanding senior leadership team at a time of such great opportunity for the company. And to deliver on our promises to bring more transformative medicines to patients with serious diseases who are waiting for them.","Now, turning to key updates on our medicines and clinical development. 2019 has been a year of important clinical and regulatory milestones for our CF medicines and our pipeline beyond CF. In CF, we recently submitted our NDA for the VX-445 triple combination regimen and remain on track to complete our application in Europe in the fourth quarter of this year.","Our NDA included a request for priority review which are granted with provided PDUFA date sometime late in the first quarter of next year. If approved, this regimen would not only be the first medicine to treat the cause of CF for the SMF population, the largest remaining group of people with CF without the medicine for the underlying cause of their disease, but it would also be a significant enhancement for the SF population.","The VX-445 triple combination regimen represents a significant advance over currently available medicines and may be able to treat up to 90% of people with CF in the future. We want to bring this medicine to as many patients as quickly as possible, and we've already begun our efforts towards gaining approval for this regimen in younger patients to an ongoing Phase III study in children ages six to 11.","Outside of CF, we have clinical development efforts ongoing across five different diseases and expect important clinical data readouts from multiple programs in 2020. In our AAT program, we have completed evaluation of single and multiple ascending doses of our first small molecule corrector, VX-814 in healthy volunteers.","Based on the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic data from the study, we have decided to advance VX-814 into a Phase II dose-ranging study in AAT patients who have 2 Z mutations. We expect to obtain clinical data from our AAT program in people with two Z mutations in 2020.","And consistent with our approach of developing a portfolio of multiple potential medicines in each of our programs, we have also recently advanced a second AAT corrector, VX-864 into Phase I development; both VX-814 and VX-864 have received Fast-Track Designation from the FDA.","In pain, we have established proof-of-concept for NaV1.8 inhibition in multiple Phase II studies in acute, neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain conditions. We have identified a number of selective NaV1.8 inhibitors and our plan is to obtain clinical data from multiple compounds in order to choose the best molecule or molecules to advance into late-stage developments. We announced today that we are initiating a Phase I study of a novel NaV1.8 inhibitor, VX-961.","In sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia, we've now dose two patients in our hemoglobinopathies program with our partner, CRISPR Therapeutics, using the novel gene-editing therapy, CTX001. The first sickle cell patient was dosed in the middle of this year which follows the first patient with beta-thalassemia who was dosed in the first quarter of the year.","Before I turn the call over to Charlie, I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about a new area for Vertex, APOL1-mediated kidney diseases, which includes FSGS or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. There have been few to no medicines developed and approved specifically to address the underlying cause of kidney diseases. So, the nephrologist who has treated his patients, I find this program exciting both scientifically and personally.","Our approach to the treatment of APOL1-mediated kidney diseases will initially focus on the inhibition of APOL1 functions in patients with FSGS. We estimate that there are approximately 10,000 people with FSGS in the U.S. who are homozygous for APOL1 mutations. These patients high level of protein known as proteinuria and typically progress to reduce kidney function and\/or kidney failure.","We have developed proprietary self and animal models to evaluate our compounds in FSGS and based on our preclinical data, we believe that inhibiting APOL1 protein function will reduce proteinuria and also the course of this progressive disease.","I'm pleased to report that we recently began dosing healthy volunteers in a Phase I study of our first oral small molecule inhibitor of APOL1 function. This molecule known as VX-147 is the first of multiple potential medicines for APOL1-mediated kidney diseases that we are advancing in late-stage research.","If we are successful in Phase I, our plan is to initiate a Phase II proof-of-concept study in 2020 where we would evaluate the ability of VX-147 to reduce protein levels in the urine. A demonstrated reduction in proteinuria in FSGS would represent an important biological proof-of-concept for this program.","In summary, we've made outstanding progress in CF and in multiple other disease areas in 2019 and are positioned to obtaining important clinical data from multiple diseases in our pipeline in 2020.","I'll now turn the call over to Charlie.","Charles Wagner","Thanks Reshma. I'm pleased to review with you our second quarter financial results, which showed both strong commercial performance as a result of treating more CF patients globally and disciplined investment focused on internal and external innovation to create future medicines. All of the results and guidance I will discuss tonight are non-GAAP.","Our second quarter total product revenues were $940 million, a 25% increase compared to the second quarter of 2018. This increase was driven primarily by the uptake of SYMDEKO in the U.S. and the recent launch of SYMKEVI in Germany.","SYMDEKO and SYMKEVI revenues for the second quarter were $362 million; the strong SYMKEVI launch in Germany represented the majority of $46 million in SYMDEKO and SYMKEVI revenues from outside the U.S. As a result of the reimbursement agreements and new regulatory approvals for young children, we also continue to see new patients initiating treatment with KALYDECO and ORKAMBI.","Our second quarter 2019 combined R&D and SG&A expenses were $394 million, similar to the $388 million seen in the second quarter of 2018. The significant growth in revenues and disciplined spending in the second quarter resulted in operating income of $413 million, a 59% increase compared to the second quarter of 2018.","Net income for the second quarter of 2019 was $327 million compared to $244 million in the second quarter of 2018. We also continue to strengthen our balance sheet and in the second quarter with approximately $4 billion in cash and marketable securities compared to $3.2 billion at the end of 2018.","We expect to continue to generate significant cash flow throughout 2019 and beyond as more patients are treated with our medicines, and we have a clear strategy of reinvesting in both internal R&D and external innovation to support our long-term growth.","The results of our commitment to reinvest in R&D are clear, as evidenced by the progression of our internal pipeline into multiple new diseases and also by our increased use of capital to establish new collaborations and acquisitions aimed at the creation of future medicines.","Over the past 12 months, we have invested more than $600 million in cash to establish multiple new collaborations and acquisitions that provide us with access to new external scientific technologies, programs and expertise in multiple diseases to complement our internal research engine.","These activities and the significant expansion of our internal team dedicated to finding and securing new scientific opportunities underscore our commitment to investing in external innovation to support our future growth. Importantly, with our growing free cash flow, we have even more flexibility to enter into additional deals.","Now on to guidance. As a result of our strong commercial performance seen in the first half of 2019, we are increasing our total CF product revenue guidance to $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion from the prior range of $3.45 billion to $3.55 billion.","Our revenue guidance reflects anticipated revenues from countries where our medicines are currently reimbursed. Our financial guidance for both combined R&D and SG&A expenses and our anticipated effective tax rate is unchanged.","We remain on the trajectory of significant revenue growth, which is driving expansion of operating margin and increases in net income. Importantly, our increasing revenues are allowing for significant reinvestment in internal and external programs to fuel our future growth with new medicines.","Echoing Jeff's comments from the start of the call, Vertex has never been stronger and is well-positioned to continue executing on its strategy to drive value and growth through investment in serial innovation.","With that, I'll open the line to questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from the line of Phil Nadeau from Cowen & Company.","Phil Nadeau","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on the progress. Two for me. First on the financials for the quarter. There was a big step up Q-on-Q the revenue ORKAMBI soon SYMKEVI revenue still not clear to me what exactly drove that uptick in Q2 versus Q1. Would you be willing to delineate what factors drove that uptick? And then second on VX-814. Curious if you'd be willing to say anything more about the Phase I profile you saw or the Phase II trial you're about to start. Thanks.","Stuart Arbuckle","As I'll take the first question, Phil, on the step-up in revenues. It's actually this was driven by a number of things. It was the ongoing launches of SYMDEKO here in the U.S. and SYMKEVI outside the U.S., most notably in Germany, where those were driven fantastic performance. So that's led to the growth of SYMDEKO SYMKEVI. And while cannibalized some of our ORKAMBI revenues, we've actually received a number of new approvals for lower range ranges for ORKAMBI and KALYDECO over the last few quarters.","And as those launches are being executed, that's adding new patients in both KALYDECO and ORKAMBI as well. So, it really is a combination of expanded labeled indications for our all the ORKAMBI and KALYDECO and then the successful launch of SYMDEKO around the world. ","Reshma Kewalramani","So, this is Reshma. With regard to your question about VX-814, that's the first small molecule corrector we've taken into AAT. We have completed the Phase I study, which is the status single-ascending dose and multiple ascending dose and what we saw there was a profile that looked really good from a safety and tolerability point of view. That was of course the primary endpoint but also importantly, around the PK.","With regard to what we're going to do in Phase II, obviously we need to have our discussions with the regulators, but what I can tell you is that I expect the study to be of a very reasonable size and of a very reasonable duration, not dissimilar to what you've seen us do with CF. And I say that because what we're going to be measuring is AAT levels and activity.","Phil Nadeau","That's very helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Salveen Richter","Thanks for taking my question. So, regarding the AAT program, you talked about looking at the endpoint of AAT levels, do you think that liver histology would be required? And then how do you see the asset sitting into the treatment paradigm in light of different approaches that are in development? And I have a follow-up.","Reshma Kewalramani","So, Salveen, you know that the data point that's available to us right now, it pertains to the infusion therapies and what they used in their Phase III programs and what their approvals were based on even the AAT levels. And that's a data point, and that's what's available to us. What I foresee here in terms of our AAT program are a few points I just want to make sure I highlight. One, this is a small molecule oral corrector, so that's important, this is oral.","The second is that certainly for the long liver move -- sorry, for the lung AAT levels activity will be important. And for the liver, I do expect that we're going to evaluate liver biopsies in Phase II and that we will need to have discussions with regulators regard to how that fits into the label and what that program looks like. Let me ask Jeff to make a comment as well.","Jeff Leiden","Yes, I think the second part of your question, Salveen, which is related to first is how does this compare to other approaches. Maybe just to remind you that AAT escalation says is both a lung disease and a liver disease. The mutant protein is that accumulate to the liver and therefore causes significant liver disease and up to 30% of patients. And obviously, it doesn't get into the serum in an active form and so it doesn't protect the lung against out of digestion by protease. There's two different that are involved in really successful treatment of the disease will require treatment of both liver and lung.","This approach, as Reshma side, is a small molecule which has distinct and sort of differentiated advantage of treating both by refolding the protein in the liver and clearing the liver. Now, we believe it will have a positive effect on the liver disease and of course by refolding the protein to an active form of the serum, we expected to have a positive effect in the lung.","And I think you can see why we're enthusiastic about that. If you look at our slides, this time, we've shown the 814 in the past, this time we showed you 864, which is the next molecule for a longer period of time for 12 weeks now. What you see in that slide, in the mouse model, is actually expressing the human mutant protein is two important things. One, we're able to drive functional levels of AAT in the serum well into the carrier range quickly and that affected sustained over 12 weeks at that if anything had increased as we go through the 12 weeks.","And two, with 12 weeks of therapy, we're really able to see remarkable clearing of the liver, both the non-aggregated forms of the -- and aggregated forms, which are the forms. And so those are exactly the things -- recently excited, exactly the things that we want to look for in the human.","Most of the other approaches out there as you know either treat the lung so, for instance, the replacement therapy or they treat the liver, for instance, the antisense or knockdown therapies that are out there.","But they don't treat both and so the reason we're so excited about is it's a small molecule approach that treats both at least in their mouse model, and that's what we'll be looking for as Reshma described in the Phase III studies which can be a fairly small number patient for a fairly short period of time. ","Salveen Richter","Great. Thank you. And then on the call, you did discuss a couple of times today using capital for external opportunities. And are you thinking about smaller transactions like the one you just did with Exonics? And in the context of that, when you think of building the genetic center, do you see yourself of sticking just to gene-editing or would you expand it to other modalities? And then further, would it be these smaller transactions or could there be a larger transaction in your future? ","Jeff Leiden","Sure. First of all, I don't want to call Exonics a smaller transaction. They might be insulted by that. We sought to be an important significant transaction, but I know of course what you mean. As we said before, first of all, we are accumulating significant financial firepower capital in our balance sheet, and so you should expect to see us do more deals and potentially larger deals. But the strategy will remain the same as it's been for the last four years. And as you know, we focus on three areas. Anything in CF that could be complementary or were additive to what we're doing now is triple. Obviously, we're not seeing any of those because the triple has set such a high bar, but we continue to look at everything out there.","The second one is technologies -- our technology platforms that would allow us to better treat the kinds of diseases which you've heard about today either alone or potentially in combination with small molecules. And you've seen us do the CRISPR deal, the Moderna deal, the Armor deal, the X-Chem deal, all of those fall into that category.","And then the third area is looking for assets mostly preclinical and early clinical assets that will complement our pipeline in the diseases we're interested in. In a way, Exonics was a part of that because DMD and DM1 are two diseases we're interested in and we continue to look for those assets.","So, I think you can expect to see more of that. With respect to the size of the transactions, we do have more firepower, and so you could potentially see larger deals. But what I think you will not see is us doing large deals to buy on-market products or late-stage products to grow revenue and by revenue growth. We don't really need that given the revenue growth we're projecting out well into the 2020 from both the CF franchise and then the pipeline. Does that give you better sense of what we're looking for?","Salveen Richter","Yes, that's helpful. Thank you.","Jeff Leiden","Okay. Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question a comment comes from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Michael Yee","Thanks for the questions. On AAT, I just wanted to know back to back, ask Reshma, we don't have a lot of confidence in the assays that you guys have to use and translating both CF as it relates to what level that you could get in the human? And then how long that will take that to show up and what specifically is indication?","Reshma Kewalramani","Thanks for that. So, maybe let me talk about AAT and our level of confidence with regard to the assay and our approach. So, with regards to the assay, that was pretty simple. The assays for levels is--","Jeff Leiden","Hey Mike we may be getting a background noise. May be you can go on mute.","Reshma Kewalramani","I'll try and speak over the noise. The assay with regard to AAT levels, that was pretty simple. That's a commercially available, readily accessible assay 4 levels. With regard to activity, that one is also well worked through. It's analyzer and that is not something that we think is going to be particularly complicated.","With regard to confidence, obviously, unlike CF, which has already gone through our preclinical assays and through the clinic, so we can look back and make those correlations, with AAT, we have yet to go into patients.","That being said, the reason we have confidence and the reason I'm very excited about taking this forward to Phase II is the animal models we have remember has the human gene inserted into it. And whether we look at levels or activity in the mouse or we look at the liver and particularly, as we look at the liver over time, it just continues to impress us and raise our levels of confidence.","Jeff Leiden","And then, Mike, the other thing as you know, is that we know from sort of experiments of nature that carriers, meaning the parents of these patients, are asymptomatic, and they have reduced levels anywhere from sort of 11 to 17 micromolar. Certainly by the time we get to 17 micromolar, there's a lot of evidence that's highly protected. So, we know the level that we're looking for in advance.","And as Reshma said, simply by measuring levels of active AAT in these Phase II patients, we had a pretty good idea of where we are with respect to treatment efficacy and carrier levels.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Alethia Young from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Alethia Young","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a very good quarter and progress from the pipeline. I just wanted to kind of maybe take a step back and ask a question around the pain program. I noticed it's under differentiating molecules. So, can you just spend some time, maybe, discussing how you think pain and the certain indications associated with it might fit with for your business? And are you planning on partnering some of them? Or keeping some to yourself? That would be very appreciated. Thanks.","Reshma Kewalramani","Alethia, let me start, this is Reshma, and let me just bring everyone up to speed on where we are, and then I'll turn it over to Jeff to make some comments about strategically where it fits into the business, partnering and all of that.","So, with regard to the pain program, you know that we have advanced VX-150 through Phase IIb dose ranging, and we've had positive results in neuropathic pain, osteoarthritis, as well as acute pain. The safety profile look good. The tolerability look good. And that's one-half of the equation.","The other half of the equation goes back to our approach to CF as well as the AAT, and that has to do with bringing forward a portfolio of molecules. And that part as it pertains to the new news for today, we're advancing VX-961, our next NaV1.8 inhibitor into the clinic. So, we're going to wait for the results from that one, and then pick the best molecule or molecules to advance into late-stage development.","If I try to maybe simplify it and raise the altitudes, we always talk about cracking the biology and then pouring out the chemistry. In the pain program, the part of it that we're at is pouring on the chemistry. And what we're doing now is bringing our molecules forward, and we're going to pick the very best one or ones to take to late-stage development. Jeff?","Jeff Leiden","So, Alethia, with respect to how we think about pain sort of strategically and commercially, which I think is your question. We said in the past, we really view it as multiple indications, even, potentially, multiple causes. But we feel there's acute pain, which is the kind of pain that you have when you have a surgery or a tooth extraction or an injury. That pain is treated mostly -- not entirely, but mostly, in hospitals, pain centers, Dental offices, et cetera, and you can reach most of those patients with a specially sales question.","So, we view acute pain, which is the multibillion dollar opportunity, as something that's certainly consistent with our Vertex strategy of making transformative drug in the specialty area. And obviously, the other driver in acute pain is that we're sitting in the middle of a horrible opioid crisis, and the majority of the pain treatments for acute pain are opioids.","So, we think having a molecule, like 150 or 961, that would have opioid-like efficacy without any of the indicative potential or side effects would be very powerful transformative advance in the treatment of acute pain. That one we really developed and commercialized ourselves.","If you move on to neuropathic pain, which is the second type of pain, very, very different. There's a diabetic and nondiabetic component there. It's also a specialty market; it requires slightly more -- slightly larger sales force, but certainly one we could muster. And the key there is going to be to demonstrate that one of our molecules is superior for the molecules out there, like [Indiscernible] et cetera, which as you know, are going generic. And so we're doing those studies as part of our Phase II program. And then we'll be able to decide what the commercial strategy is there.","And then the third area is what we call musculoskeletal pain. It's what you would think of as low back pain, sciatica. It's a huge market, as you know, a multibillion market. That's a community market, for the most part, and that's a market that we would not enter ourselves. We are looking -- we have positive results in that market, but that's one where we would look to partner with a company that had a community sales force that we would not intend to build.","We still think we can monetize this with them, but we wouldn't -- we certainly wouldn't do it ourselves. So, maybe that gives you a little clarity about how you think about these three different components of the market.","Alethia Young","Yes, very helpful. Thanks for teasing that out.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Cory Kasimov","Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats to both Jeff and Reshma on the news. So two for you. First on AAT, I know this is standard strategy for Vertex, but can you describe the key differences between the two AAT molecules you have? Now is there anything that really stands out there?","And then, secondly, I just wanted to ask about the triple and the potential of a future once-daily. Did the selection of 445 over 659, did that -- was the decision made to any extent based off of like early work in combination with your other next-gen correctors that you're working on? Or with VX-651 for use in that once-daily combination? How important do you think a once-daily option is at this point? ","Reshma Kewalramani","Okay. Hi Cory. Two very different questions. Maybe let me tackle the CF one first, and I'll go backwards and do AAT. With regard to triple combination, let me take the first half of that, and I'm going to ask Stuart to comment on the importance of once-daily.","So, no, the decision to select 445 versus 659 really had nothing to do with our ability to combine it with some of our other molecules. I think you're thinking about VX-561, our deuterated ivacaftor compound that it is, itself, in Phase II.","The VX-561 corrector could be combined with VX-121, which is what it is combined with currently, and it is in Phase II, but we could have easily paired it with 445 or 659. Stuart, do you want to talk through once-daily?","Stuart Arbuckle","Yes. Cory, once-daily is an advance for sure, and we certainly want to try and make things as easy as possible for patients to take on medicines, but much more important is the efficacy and safety of the triple-combination regimen.","So, it's definitely an advantage. It's something we want to do to try and make things as easy as possible for our patients. But going from twice-a-day to once-a-day is nowhere near as important as the levels of efficacy that we are delivering with the triple-combination regimens. And then, AAT, I'll hand it back to Reshma.","Reshma Kewalramani","Okay. So, with regard to AAT, VX-814 and VX-864, pre-clinically, they both look very good, and obviously, we look at parameters pertaining to efficacy as well as safety, but there are also additional parameters that we pay careful attention to pre-clinically. Those include things like formulation, DDI, PK, and both VX-814 and VX-864 look really very good.","The reason we're taking multiple molecules into the clinic is what we've learned, honestly, from CF. And what we've learned is once you crack the biology, it really is about pouring on the chemistry. And it serves as risk mitigation as we progress forward. So, both 864 and 814 look very good, and we're going to be moving those as quickly as possible.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Matthew Harrison","Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Two for me. One, Jeff or Reshma, could you just give us an update on the current status of your negotiations with various EU countries about reimbursement for your CF medicine?","And then, second, on FSGS, can you just talk broadly, is proteinuria a potential regulatory endpoint in that disease? Or how should we think about that as a biomarker that could be used from a regulatory standpoint? Thanks.","Stuart Arbuckle","So, Matt, it's Stuart here. I'll take the question on reimbursement, and then Reshma will take the question on FSGS and proteinuria. So, as Jeff said in our prepared remarks, we have made some important progress in the first half of this year in securing new pricing and reimbursement agreements in various countries around the world, either for SYMDEKO, SYMKEVI or for our expanded indications for ORKAMBI and KALYDECO. There's a number of countries where we are yet to establish access, and that is a very, very high priority for us as a company.","We're in active discussions with all of the governments where we don't currently have access and our commitment to securing access for our current and in the future medicines is as strong as it's ever been. Unfortunately, it's impossible to comment on exactly when we'll be able to bring those discussions to a successful conclusion, but it absolutely remains a top priority for us, and we remain committed to getting access as soon as we possibly can. Reshma, FSGS?","Reshma Kewalramani","All right. FSGS. So, with regard to what could the regulatory endpoint be, and could it be proteinuria? I guess there are a few important points to raise. The first is that, not all proteinuria is created equal. And what I mean by that is regulators around the globe have actually thought about this issue and have handled workshops, and this is something that is often discussed in the renal community.","And really, where we are is that there are certain homogeneous real diseases that lead to heavy proteinuria. And in those sorts of conditions, proteinuria may well be an endpoint that is the one that is important in the long run.","Now, there are many other diseases that are far more heterogeneous with levels of proteinuria that are smaller, and that's a different kettle of fish. We have to go through our regulatory interactions. We have to have these discussions, and we're not there yet. But what I will say is that not all proteinuria is created equal.","And in my mind, when you're looking at a homogeneous disease, a disease like APOL1-mediated FSGS, which is a genetically-defined condition, it is a very described patient population, and the proteinuria that we're talking about is heavy with the consequence invariably being progression of the kidney dysfunction or progression to end-stage renal disease, which really means dialysis or transplantation, that there's a lot of conversation to be had around proteinuria being the endpoint. I hope that helps.","Matthew Harrison","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line up Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Brian Abrahams","Hi guys. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking my questions and my congrats to Jeff and Reshma as well. A question on AAT, and then a question on the kidney program. On AAT, any reason why 864 was tested for longer periods in the assays that you presented versus 814?","And then on the kidney program, some recent data suggested that APOL1 RNA variance might have a more direct impact on podocyte damage that leads to proteinuria. So, I'm just curious what drives your confidence that targeting the protein will reverse the path of physiology? Thanks.","Jeff Leiden","Yes. Maybe I'll take those both. First of all, with respect to 864 and 814, no, there was no real reason that we had different time frames. In fact, we've looked at shorter time frames for 864 and longer time frames for 814.","I think what you should take away from that is, we've seen very, very consistent results for both of these molecules, which is one of the reasons why we're so encouraged and excited about taking them into the clinic. So, I think that's pretty simple.","Second question was about -- the RNA merits, yes, on APOL1. So, yes, let's touch on this real quickly. Actually, Reshma maybe talk about APOL1 and what we know about the mechanism, and why we're excited about what we've got there.","Reshma Kewalramani","Yes. Sure. Sure. So, let me try to break down APOL1-mediated kidney disease. It's a genetic disease. It follows an autosomal recessive pattern, so you need homozygosity to get the disease. And maybe this thing that is the most important to note is, amongst African-Americans who have FSGS; 70-plus percent of these patients have APOL1-mediated disease. So, that's why this is so important. And in the U.S., there's about 10,000 people who have this.","What we -- we understand the mechanism of APOL1-mediated disease very well, and we also understand the mechanism of our molecule, VX-147 very well. We have developed a host of in vitro cell-based assays, and we also have a mouse model with the human gene that we've inserted.","And we really have a very, very good understanding of what happens with the protein, the next steps, how we are interdicting on this resulting in decreased proteinuria. And the 75% that you see is a very big number.","And the bottom-line of all of this is the way you end the progression of kidney disease, the way you stop this is you need to do two things. One, you need to target the underlying biology; and two; you actually need to decrease proteinuria because proteinuria itself further damages the kidney. And so that's sort of where we are, and that's why we feel very good about our program. Jeff, I don't know if you have any other comments you want to make?","Jeff Leiden","I think, if I heard you correctly, Brian, you were asking, specifically, do we believe this is an RNA variance issue? And the answer that is no. We believe it has very strong evidence, both pharmacologically, and genetically, and biochemically that this is a protein defect within the APOL1 protein.","Brian Abrahams","That's really helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Paul Matteis from Stifel. Your line is open.","Paul Matteis","Thanks very much for taking the questions. To continue the trend, I'm going to ask Q1 AAT. One, on the mouse data. Can you talk about how early you're treating in the lifespan of mice, where you're seeing this level of clearance in the liver? How much protein accumulation has already occurred?","And second, we had found a posting on the A-1AT Foundation for a study for VX-814 going on at the Covance research unit in Dallas looking at ZZ mutant patients that was -- it looked like it was recruiting. Can you clarify, is that study ongoing? And is that something that could produce some data, potentially, on the sooner side? Thanks.","Jeff Leiden","And maybe I'll take the first one, and Reshma will take the second part of that. This is Jeff. So, we decided to treat these mice at about one month of age. We treated them, and this particular experiment showed you they'd explode for 12 weeks. And in answering your question, there's already protein accumulation, very significantly, yes. You can see that, actually, in the slide there, and you see that protein accumulation occurring early and getting worse and worse over time in the control animals, and essentially clearing or mostly clearing in the treated animals.","Reshma Kewalramani","I think your second question was around VX-814 and some clinical trial postings and such. What you can expect to see from us is the same level of urgency that we worked on CF with AAT. And so you're right, we are starting to really mobilize our clinical trial efforts. And you may well see some postings for patient recruitment. I would anticipate that the data event with regard to when can we see some data from people with ZZ -- the ZZ mutation, I would say that that's likely to be a 2020 event.","Paul Matteis","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Porges","Thank you very much and appreciate taking the question. Stuart, just a couple on the core business. Could you just give us an update on where you are with the success of SYMDEKO in the penetration of the adult population carrying F508del allele? Just help us with benchmarking.","And then, related to that, would you anticipate the vast majority of those patients switching pretty quickly through the triple? And should we anticipate that there is incremental patient volume available to the triple, or is it primarily going to be the cannibalization of existing volume? And that's in the adult market in the U.S., obviously, the individual geographies around the world will play out over time.","Stuart Arbuckle","Yes, Jeff. So, SYMDEKO here in the U.S., in the 12-plus population, we are about 18 months into that launch now. That launch has gone spectacularly well. The vast, vast majority of F508del homozygous patients are now being treated with either SYMDEKO or ORKAMBI because there are a large number of patients who have chosen to remain on ORKAMBI.","So, that launch is going to vary kind of long in its life cycle, and as you know the life cycle of our launches in CF is pretty short. The uptake tends to be fairly vertical. And obviously we're earlier in the launch in ex-U.S. markets.","But as Charlie said in his prepared remarks, the launch, for instance, in Germany is going tremendously well. And there, we are now over 80% of F508 homozygous patients are being treated with a CFTR modulator, either ORKAMBI or increasingly, SYMKEVI.","So, the launch is in the 12-plus population, going very well, and that's largely what's driven the strong revenue growth this quarter. In terms of the number of patients who might transition, hard to predict until we get out there in the real world, but certainly, given the strength of the clinical data that we have in terms of the additional clinical benefit patients see from adding in a third product, our second corrected to SYMDEKO, I think the demand is likely to be really, really strong.","Those levels of efficacy are truly, truly incredible. And certainly, the feedback we've had from the position of patient community, both directly and also through research, would suggest that we're going to see very high levels of uptake.","In fact if anything, it's likely going to be most constrained by the actual capacity of the CF centers to be able to make that transition, rather than position in the patient interest in getting on to the triple.","Geoffrey Porges","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Mohit Bansal from Citi. Your line is open.","Mohit Bansal","Thanks for taking my question and congrats to both Jeff and Reshma. Maybe -- I would love to get your thought on the recent mRNA data we have seen retranslate. Do you think the delivery -- what do you think of the delivery here? And what is the challenging part of delivering a micro RNA -- mRNA therapy, in lung? And I would love to get your comments on your own efforts to modernize that. thank you.","Jeff Leiden","Sure. Thanks for the question, Mohit. This is Jeff. Obviously, it's a little too early, I think, to really make much of any comments about the data we saw today. Very early data, one part of the trial, single doses in very small numbers of patients. I honestly can't really give you much of a comment, and we usually don't comment on competitors anyway.","I certainly can comment on what we think about nucleic assay therapy or mRNA therapies, which as you know, we're working on as well. We do believe that, ultimately, they may play a role in the treatment of CF, but we also believe it's a very long journey.","And the reason for that, as you just pointed out is the delivery issue. It is very difficult to deliver to the entire lung, to the rights cells, which we'll come back to in a minute. And in the case of mRNA, to do that repetitively which will certainly be needed. And while we're working out and many others are as well, it's a difficult problem.","And the problem isn't expressing CFTR. That is a relatively easy problem. The problem is how do you deliver to a football field of surface area and a lung that's inflamed full of nucleates and other immune cells, get it into the right cells, and then do it over and over again in the case of RNA. That's a really tough problem, and we said we think that's 10 or 15 years away before we crack that problem -- or others crack that problem.","Now, the other issue that's worth keeping in mind is CF is not a lung disease. CF is a systemic disease that affects many different organs, including the pancreas, the liver, the GI tract, et cetera. While the obvious advantage of the small molecule CFTR correctors like a triple approach is they treat all the organs, which is very important and very beneficial for these patients.","Even when we work out the inhalation therapy -- or someone works out the inhalation therapy for the lung, if it's possible that will only, obviously, treat the lung. And so I think as a standalone therapy, these will be quite challenging.","And then, the final thing I would say is, there are 2 different fundamental approaches here. One is some sort of gene therapy or gene-editing approach, where you get into a stem cell, which can repopulate the airway continuously, and the other one is you deliver it to the bronchial epithelial cells, but unfortunately, as you know, those turn over every few weeks. And so if you're going to deliver mRNA to the bronchial epithelial cells, that will require continuous retreatment, which it has all sorts of immune and other inflammatory challenges itself.","So, we're very interested in this. We think it's a very hard problem. We and others are working on it. I think it is a 10 or 15-year journey, and unfortunately, these inhalation therapy probably won't treat the entire disease, but just treat the lung.","Mohit Bansal","Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Brian Skorney from Baird. Your line is open.","Brian Skorney","Hey guys. Thanks for putting me in here. Just maybe if I can ask a question on the APOL1 program. Is there still activity for this molecule for the different variance? And would you expect this to be equally effective for G1 or G2? And that the ultimate goal here for compete knockdown of APOL1? And are there any infectious risks that we should be thinking about for full inhibition of APOL1? And would you expect to see reductions of wild-type APOL1 in the healthy volunteer study?","Reshma Kewalramani","Yes. This is Reshma. I think you're asking a few different questions about what do we understand about APOL1 in our models? And what do we understand about how VX-147 works? And so in general, we feel quite good, and we have data in our models with both G1 and G2. So, I do expect that when we go to the clinic and treat patients with APOL1-mediated FSGS that it would be all comers of APOL1-mediated disease.","With regard to what do we expect to see in -- with our inhibition? We haven't taken this to humans yet so it's difficult to say. But what I can tell you is that in our animal models, we have seen good preclinical safety, good PK, and the data we've shown you on this slide, very good reductions in protein levels.","Brian Skorney","And would we -- just in the healthy volunteers, would we be looking at a biomarker in terms of wild-type of APOL1?","Reshma Kewalramani","As you know, the Phase I SAD\/MAD study, the primary endpoint for that is going to be safety and tolerability. The key secondary endpoint is going to be PK. And when we get to our dose-ranging study is when we're really going to start to see the impact on proteinuria.","Brian Skorney","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Whitney Ijem from Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Whitney Ijem","Hey guys, thanks for taking the question and Reshma my congrats as well. I wanted to follow-up on an earlier question around gene-editing versus gene therapy and some of the investments you guys are making, specifically with the research center and bringing John Gray on to the team.","So, as we think about Vertex investing in viral vector capability, specifically, is that more around delivery in gene editing or even RNA as we think about that? Or does that signal an interest in broader gene therapy applications going forward?","Jeff Leiden","Yes, this is Jeff. So, maybe just to remind those who aren't familiar as you are with what we have announced. So, we are very interested in both gene editing and gene therapy. Not as pure therapeutic modalities. We're not going to become a gene editing company. But because the diseases that we're interested in, many of them, are very amenable to gene editing or gene therapy approaches or combinations of gene editing, gene therapy with small molecules.","And so we're really building a toolbox, a broad toolbox, of mRNA, gene editing, of potentially gene therapy approaches that we can use to address those diseases. We're actually also very interested in learning how we can combine those with small molecule approaches.","As part of that effort, we recently announced, simultaneously, three things. One was the expansion of the collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics into DMD and DM1. Simultaneously, the acquisition of Exonics, which gives us great scientific expertise with Eric Olson, very important guy at IP, very impressive preclinical data in the dog model, and really accelerates our DMD and DM1 programs.","And the third was, you mentioned, was hiring John Gray, who's really one of the world's experts in making and manufacturing AV vectors because AV vectors are obviously going to be very important in both gene editing and gene therapy approaches.","We plan to combine all of those into a new research site here in Boston, which we call Vertex Genetic Therapies. It'll have 150 to 200 scientists or so, and it will have both the project teams around these diseases like DMD and DM1, but also a preclinical and clinical manufacturing facility that will allow John to do vector work, vector formulation, bio-analytics and preclinical and clinical vector manufacturing.","Michael Partridge","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Okay. Our final question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Evan Seigerman","Hi all. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the strong quarter, and my congrats as well to Reshma on your upcoming promotion. So, one on the drug pricing front. Do you see any risk to Vertex's U.S. businesses with the recent proposal by the administration to allow for importation of drugs from Canada?","And while Vertex has not been a focus of recent discussion on drug pricing, how are you managing the potential risk of increased drug pricing pressures in the U.S., as this discussion is unlikely to go away anytime soon? ","Jeff Leiden","Yes. Thank you for the question. It's really a two-part question. First, with respect to drug importation and I would also include them, by the way, price importation because those are really both the same things.","We believe very strongly in policies that do two things: policies that encourage innovation to make more breakthrough transformative drugs; and policies that then make sure that all eligible patients can have access to those breakthrough drugs, which is equally important for us.","When we look at the drug importation or price importation proposals that have been made, they don't meet either of those objectives. And in fact, we would argue that they're counter to both of them. From an access standpoint, imported drugs from Canada doesn't solve the problem because there's not nearly enough supply -- the supply access to the patients who need them in the U.S.","Second, we feel that the potential very significant safety issue of allowing drugs to flow across the border in an unregulated fashion. And third, we're very certain that these kinds of policies will stifle the innovation that's led the industry here in the U.S. to be the leading innovator to make new breakthrough drugs. And so we feel that, that type of legislation is completely inconsistent with our principles.","With respect to what are we doing for the future? I think the biggest thing we're doing for the future is to make sure that we're making transformational drugs because at the end of the day, these are the kind of drugs that patients and payers want to pay for and they want us to invest them and the best evidence of that is our CF programs here in the U.S. where we've seen very rapid reimbursement from all forms of payer, including government payers, Medicaid, Medicare, as well as the promotional players. And the reason for that is simple, they understand the value of those medicines to patients, and these are the kind of medicines that they actually want to pay for.","I think when you look at our pipeline, as Reshma described it, what you see is exactly the same kinds of medicines for serious diseases like sickle cell disease, pain, AAT, APOL1. That's the most important thing.","Obviously, we talk with politicians and lawmakers to explain the value of innovation, and we have active programs to do that. But the most important thing we do is to actually do innovation and invest in it because I think that's how we protect the value for patients and shareholders.","Evan Seigerman","Great. Thank you.","Operator","That concludes the Q&A period for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Partridge for any closing remarks.","Michael Partridge","Thank you, operator.

I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Michael Partridge. Sir, you may begin.","Michael Partridge - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you operator and good evening everyone. Joining me on the call tonight are Dr. Jeff Leiden, Chairman and CEO; Stuart Arbuckle, Chief Commercial Officer; and Ian Smith, Chief Financial Officer.","Our agenda tonight is as follows. Jeff will begin by discussing key priorities for our business and reviewing the progress with our cystic fibrosis medicines. Stuart will review the first quarter performance of KALYDECO and will also discuss preparations for the anticipated launch of ORKAMBI, which we announced today as the proposed trade name of the lumacaftor-ivacaftor combination. To close, Ian will review the first quarter 2015 financial results and reiterate our 2015 guidance. We will then open the call for your questions. Dr. Jeff Chodakewitz, Chief Medical Officer, will not be on the call today as he is attending a scheduled meeting with the FDA. We expect today's call to run for approximately 45 minutes.","You can access the webcast slides by going to the Events section of the Investor Relations page on our website. I will remind you that we will make forward-looking statements on this conference call. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in today's press release and our 10-K, which have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These statements, including without limitation those regarding the ongoing development and potential commercialization of ORKAMBI, those about Vertex's other cystic fibrosis programs, and Vertex's future financial performance, are based on management's current assumptions. Actual outcomes and events could differ materially.","Information about our use of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is available in our first quarter 2015 financial results press release, and I would also refer you to slide four of tonight's webcast.","I will now turn the call over to Jeff Leiden.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks Michael, and good evening everyone. 2015 is a very important year for Vertex. Vertex is the leader in the development of cystic fibrosis medicines that address the underlying cause of the disease. Our goal in CF is to treat as many people as possible, and to enhance the benefits for those we treat. I want to start by acknowledging all the CF patients and families who continue to reach out to us. We and they are eagerly awaiting the availability of ORKAMBI. I want to thank them for their support and encouragement as we seek to improve the lives of more people with CF.","There are three strategic priorities that we believe will allow Vertex to continue delivering on our vision to make new transformative medicines available to patients globally. We're focused on delivering on those priorities.","First, we're focused on gaining approval and successfully launching ORKAMBI while continuing to grow KALYDECO, enabling us to treat even more people with CF. KALYDECO continues to treat more patients through both geographic and label expansion, and we anticipate approximately 3,900 patients to be eligible for KALYDECO by the end of this year. In addition, we are ready to bring ORKAMBI to the approximately 8,500 patients ages 12 and older in the US who have two copies of the F508del mutation. We look forward to our meeting with the FDA advisory committee on May 12 to discuss ORKAMBI for the F508del homozygous population who currently don't have any treatment options that target the underlying cause of their disease.","Also we have just completed enrollment in the Phase 3 safety study evaluating this combination medicine in children ages six through 11 who have two copies of F508del mutation, which if successful, positions us to provide ORKAMBI to these younger patients in the US.","Our second priority, we're advancing our CF development pipeline with novel medicines with the potential to create regimens that may increase the benefit for CF patients. We believe that VX-661 could play an important role in the treating of CF as a key component of a two or three drug combination. We're now enrolling two of the four studies included in the broad VX-661 with ivacaftor pivotal Phase 3 development program. And the third study will start in early May.","And our third priority is expanding and diversifying our early stage pipeline. We continue to expect a next generation CFTR corrector as well as multiple programs outside of CF to enter the clinic by the end of 2015.","In summary, we continue to make significant progress in realizing our long-term vision to treat more people with cystic fibrosis and to enhance with benefit for those we treat. The continued execution on our strategy gives us the confidence that we will achieve sustainable growth in revenues, earnings and cash flows and create new medicines that treat other serious diseases beyond CF.","With that, I'll hand it over to Stuart.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Thanks Jeff, and hello everyone. I'll begin by reviewing KALYDECO performance in the first quarter, which reflects strong underlying demand as well as the impact of label and geographic expansion. I will also discuss our progress in preparing for the anticipated approval and launch of ORKAMBI in the middle of this year in the United States.","KALYDECO revenues increased 31% over the same quarter last year. Global sales this quarter were $130 million, comprised of US sales of approximately $72 million and ex-US sales of approximately $58 million. There has been rapid uptake of KALYDECO by eligible patients in Australia following the completion of reimbursement discussion in late 2014. There are more than 200 adults and children with CF in Australia who are eligible for treatment, and the vast majority of those have already started to take KALYDECO.","Late last year, KALYDECO was approved in the US for use in children and adults ages six and older with the R117H mutation. More than 150 of these patients have already initiated treatment. And in March, the KALYDECO label was expanded in the US to include children with CF ages two to five with one of 10 different CF mutations. The first children under the age of five have already begun treatment.","We are delighted that so many new children and adults with CF now have access to KALYDECO, and later in 2015, we expect to make further progress as we achieve reimbursement approval for gating mutations in the major European countries where these mutations are prevalent. In summary, multiple growth drivers are in place for KALYDECO this year, as we continue to deliver on our geographic and label expansion plans.","Now turning to ORKAMBI. Our PDUFA date in the US is July 5, and our team is ready to bring this medicine to the many patients who are eagerly awaiting its approval. Our patient services team, who help patients navigate the reimbursement process and also help with patient education and compliance is fully staffed and trained. We are having ongoing and productive discussions with payers.","One of the main areas of focus is disease education, to help payers understand cystic fibrosis as a disease, its impact on patients and caregivers, and also to estimate the number of eligible patients they may have in their plans. And from a supply chain perspective, our launch supply is ready to be shipped shortly after approval, and we have sufficient supply to meet what we anticipate to be strong demand.","In summary, geographic and label expansion continue to drive significant growth in the number of patients we treat with KALYDECO and we are well positioned for additional long-term revenue growth with the launch of ORKAMBI for F508del homozygous patients.","I'll now hand the call over to Ian.","Ian F. Smith - Executive Vice Presidnet and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Stuart, and good evening to everyone. Tonight, I'd like to discuss our first quarter 2015 financial results, and then our 2015 financial guidance. Firstly, to the financials.","KALYDECO revenues were $130 million this quarter and are up 31% versus the first quarter of 2014 as we continue to expand the number of patients we treat. Our first quarter non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses were $246 million, an increase of $13 million compared to last year, this increase mainly being attributable to an increase in SG&A expenses as we prepare for the potential launch of ORKAMBI.","And our non-GAAP net loss was $148 million similar to prior year non-GAAP net loss of $151 million. From a balance sheet perspective, we've maintained a strong position with approximately $1.2 billion of cash and equivalents at the end of the quarter.","Let's turn to our 2015 financial guidance, specifically the reiteration of KALYDECO revenues and combined R&D and SG&A expenses. KALYDECO revenues are on track and we continue to expect 2015 revenues to be between $560 million to $580 million and we also continue to expect the combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to be between $1.05 billion and $1.1 billion for the full year.","I would just note before closing that we expect our operating expenses will be higher in the second half of this year compared to the first half, mainly as a result of anticipated progress with the VX-661 pivotal program and the investment to support the potential launch of ORKAMBI.","I will close by stating that we are in a strong financial position today and focused on delivering a future financial profile consistent with our large cap biotech peers, and we look forward to updating you on the continued execution of our strategy throughout this year.","With that, I'll ask the operator to please open the line for questions.","Operator","Thank you.","Michael Partridge - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, this is Michael Partridge. We've received several messages that the webcast for some participants was cutting in and out and what we'd like to do for those webcast participants is offer them just a few minutes opportunity to dial into the phone which we understand did not cut out.

That's 866-501-1537 for the US; 720-545-0001. And we'll pause for just a minute to allow people to dial in.","Operator","Thank you, sir. And please let me know when you're ready to take questions.","Michael Partridge - Vice President-Investor Relations","So operator, this is Michael Partridge again. We understand there are still a few people dialing in. We'll wait for them to dial in and we'll be right back.","Operator","Certainly.","Michael Partridge - Vice President-Investor Relations","All right, operator, we're back. We're ready to start the Q&A. And one thing I'll say also is that we will post the transcript of tonight's call on our website when it becomes available for anybody who missed our prepared remarks earlier.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question for this evening comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just have a couple here. I know Jeff isn't around for clinical questions, but just curious what you guys would be thinking in terms of the pace that you can go from initial data on the second corrector to a proof of concept with that corrector plus 661 KALYDECO. And I have a commercial question for Stuart.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, this is Jeff Leiden. Thanks for the question, Geoff. It's a little difficult to give you a precise number, so maybe instead I'll just sort of outline how we're thinking about these second gen correctors. As you'll remember, we have several of these molecules which are in late stage preclinical development. Our goal is to get the first of those into the clinic this year and then follow with several others rapidly after that. And these will likely go through the typical development process, which means a typical Phase 1, a single ascending \u2013 a single dose and then multiple ascending dose, looking predominantly of course at safety. And once we have that data, we'll be able to go on to patients. And I think the question you're asking is, can we go into patients just with singles or with combinations and that's something we'll obviously have to discuss with the regulators.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That makes sense. And then just for Stuart, when you think about the reimbursement for ORKAMBI across Europe, what are some of the factors that affect the speed of reimbursement? Do you think \u2013 certainly, it's not a patient education question, but it obviously has a lot to do with the size of the market and the number of patients. And do you also think that budgets will play a role just given the greater number of patients for delta-F? Thanks.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Yes, thanks for the question, Geoff. In Europe, I think there are really two different buckets of things which are going to affect the pace of reimbursement. The first one is kind of systemic if you like. It's the process that each country has, and some have a very formalized process with very well laid out and rigid timeliness, and others are much more fluid. So I think there is always that, which affects not just us. It affects every product which is trying to secure reimbursement.","And then specifically as it relates to us, it really is going to be discussions around the severity of the disease, level of unmet need, the nature of the product and then the patient population. And as you say, one of the big considerations in Europe you alluded to is the budget impact and that's where discussions around the patient population and making sure that payers understand the size of the patient population, that this is an orphan disease and that the initial indication hopefully for ORKAMBI will be for a subset of the F508 homozygous population. So they really have a good sense of the size of the patient population and how relatively small it is, is obviously a really important consideration for them as they are thinking through the budget impact. So, those I think are the two types of considerations. One systemic around the process, and then the others which are very specific to us and ORKAMBI.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got you. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, thanks. On the second corrector, which you made some comments about, maybe you could talk about within those different compounds that you've been working on, what is the gating factor to getting an IND underway? And have you ever actually shown monotherapies where chloride, or I guess just a chloride transport assay date on those? Are those actually quite active as a single?","And then the second question, I guess for Ian. You did mention that you are thinking about profitability and cash flows like large cap peers, so maybe you could expand a bit on that. And over the next few years, what is the philosophy of Vertex on how profitable you guys think you can be? How important is it? I know there has been some discussion and maybe some nervousness about what you can do versus what's been in the past. Thanks.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Michael, this is Jeff Leiden. Let me take the first question, then I'll turn it over to Ian for the second. In terms of the second gen correctors, again let me just sort of remind you not from my view, but for some who may not be as familiar. The idea here is that we have shown data that by adding a second generation corrector a first gen corrector like 809 or 661 plus KALYDECO, we can get very significant enhancement of chloride transport, both in delta-508 homozygous cells and then delta-508 het min cells, which is obviously important. And so this is really a sort of two-edged approach. One is to, we think it has a high likelihood of allowing us to treat the het min patients, which we know are so difficult with a two drug combination. And the other one is it enhances the benefit of the homozygous patients and frankly anybody who has a delta-F508, a single delta-F508 allele. So that's the idea.","And when we started the project, there were really two challenges. One was really a biologic challenge, that is was that hypothesis correct. Could you actually identify molecules that would synergize with first generation correctors and increase chloride transport, and we've now definitively answered that question. We have multiple molecules that do that and provide very significant synergy. To me that was actually the more challenging or worrisome question.","The second part of course is once you have such molecules turning them into drugs and that's really a matter of lead optimization around parameters of PK and drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics. And that's the stage we're in now with multiple of these molecules. We're on track for what our goal was this year, which is to get the first of those molecules in the clinic this year with multiple other molecules following thereafter.","And we have shown, your second part of the question was have we shown data to demonstrate that synergy and we have shown that data. I'd refer you back to NACF even a year and a half ago or so I believe, where we showed several pieces of data on the synergy that we can produce with those second gen correctors.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes, but even as mono? Are they even active as mono? I don't know if they actually have a difference in that.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, we haven't shown data as monotherapy, but we're looking at all the different combinations to produce the best, the most optimal regimen we can produce.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great.","Ian F. Smith - Executive Vice Presidnet and Chief Financial Officer","Mike, thanks for the questions, especially thanks that I get chance to reiterate the comments of what we target financially for the company a few years from now. And it is to be a company similar to our larger cap peers and that's one of high operating margins. I think we have the opportunity to do that as a business given the disease areas that we're in, specifically with the KALYDECO revenue growth that we're starting to see, and we anticipate it should increase with the label expansion and the geographic expansion.","And then later this year, following the potential approval of ORKAMBI, we should see an acceleration of that revenue growth and that should accumulate to a significant revenue line. And if we continue to control our operating expenses, what that means is that growing revenue line cascades over an operating base that allows us to achieve high operating margins as a business. I would also point out that in that financial profile, because of the scale of the revenue growth, we're still able to reinvest in R&D, which is a core principle of the company, still able to reinvest in R&D while maintaining those high operating margins. So, as we look out to three, four years from now, we do see that we're in a very strong position financially.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Bernstein.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you very much for taking the question. A couple just on upcoming events. First on the AdCom, you must be in the final stretches of preparation and I know Jeff's not there, but perhaps Jeff Leiden could comment on, what are the issues and what additional analyses or areas of focus we should anticipate at that AdCom? And then, one for sure on the same kind of thing, you must be engaged in discussions with payers both in the US and outside the US now. And how are they coming back to you in terms of their perceptions of the value of ORKAMBI compared to KALYDECO and how they're going to work with you to manage that? Because obviously it's a significant step up in their patient volume and revenue exposure in this category. Thanks.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, Geoff. This is Jeff Leiden. Thanks for the questions. I'll answer the AdCom question then turn it over to Stuart. Just to put it in context, I think as you are aware these AdComs are fairly routine with new chemical entities and this is certainly a new chemical entity. And they typically focus on two questions, what is the strength of the efficacy data versus the unmet need and what's the safety profile. And at the end of the day, is there a favorable benefit risk profile and those are the questions that we expect to be discussed at the AdCom.","Based on the data that you've already seen, we're very confident and in answers to all of those questions because we feel that there is very significant clinical benefit. The drug was well tolerated from a safety perspective and when you put those together you get a favorable benefit risk in patients who today don't have any underlying therapy that treats the underlying cause of the disease. And that's consistent with what we're also hearing as feedback from KOLs and from the community. So we're looking forward to the discussion. We think it will be pretty much the typical AdCom discussion around those issues.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Yes, Geoff, on our discussions with payers, you're absolutely right. We have had and are continuing to have ongoing and very productive discussions with payers. One of the main areas of focus for us is obviously educating them on the disease and the seriousness of the disease, CF being an orphan disease is not necessarily something that they've spent a lot of time focusing on. So talking about the disease, the impact it has on patients and caregivers, making sure they really understand the disease and the level of unmet need has clearly been a very important part of our early discussions with them.","The other critical point of the discussion has really been around helping them understand the patient population. And as you know, one of the things that payers are very keen on understanding is having a high level of certainty and that's certainly one of the things that we can offer them in cystic fibrosis. This is an incredibly well-defined orphan population. So helping them understand the size of the population in total and specifically the size of the eligible patient population likely to be in their plans or in their geographies has been really important.","And then when we've been talking about the science behind the product that treats the underlying cause of the disease, where there really isn't anything that does that in the market today. When you put all those factors together. I think the general impression we've been getting is that this is the sort of innovation that they like to see and that they want to reimburse.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI.","Odysseas D. Kostas - Evercore ISI","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. This is actually Odysseas sitting in for Mark. The question I had has to do with sort of I'm thinking about the triple combination and optimizing each of the parts. I guess I just wanted to, as much as CF development has progressed over the last five or 10 years, sort of getting an understanding as to your confidence that were this first generation, second generation corrector target, the site, the sort of confidence in that synergy over perhaps a combination of correctors that target different sites on the CFTR?","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. This is Jeff Leiden. Maybe just to clarify, we do believe that the first generation and second generation corrector target different sites, different parts of the folding mechanism or folding pathway, and we have direct evidence that shows that. And so the idea here is that the delta-508 mutant CFTR actually has multiple defects at different points in the folding pathway that the first generation correctors like 809 or 661 target one of those, which is actually relatively early on in the folding pathway. But then we then search for second generation correctors that could target a second one that's further downstream in the pathway, the theory or the idea being that those two should be added if they're synergistic.","And as I said before, we've been able to show that I think very definitively we can identify multiple molecules like that. They do add or synergize with the first generation correctors and our confidence in those is really based upon the totality of all the HBE cell data that we have, which in each case has translated into the clinic. And so we've shown you data that of first generation corrector, second generation corrector, KALYDECO can produce significantly more chloride transport in those cells than just a first gen corrector and KALYDECO, and that's why we're so confident that will translate into more benefit in the clinic in anyone who basically has one or more delta-F508 alleles. Does that answer your question?","Odysseas D. Kostas - Evercore ISI","So my question more just had to do with whether for instance if there are multiple defects or multiple sites, let's say A through E, and we know that the first generation corrector targets A, with a combination of A plus, but any of the others is perhaps is necessarily better than let's say C and another site? I guess that's all. I mean just sort of the multiplicity of the...?","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. I understand. You're sort of asking what's the best combination?","Odysseas D. Kostas - Evercore ISI","Right.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's a good question, and we are trying to produce exactly that, the best combination. But another way of thinking about it might be how much chloride transport relative to normal can you produce with two different correctors plus KALYDECO. And we've shown some of that data before. We can produce quite a bit more at least equivalent to what we see with KALYDECO on a 551D cell. And so the goal is to optimize those with HPEs, because we're very confident that that translates into the clinic. And so we do have multiple correctors against multiple target sites just as you say and the goal is to produce the best combination and put it in the clinic.","Odysseas D. Kostas - Evercore ISI","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe first just one for Stuart. I know you guys were gathering data on the cost of hospitalization due to exacerbations. Can you maybe give us an update on where that data stands, how important has that been or will that be in your discussions with payers both in the US and ex-US?","And then just with respect to uptake of KALYDECO in the R117H patients, I think I heard you correctly about 150 patients currently on drug. I think you guys have said about 500 in the US before. Maybe anything you're seeing in terms of uptake across a certain age or is there anything specific about those, that first group of patients that's come on the drug? Thanks.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Yes, Terence, let me take those in reverse order. So the R117H launch is going well. You're right, we do have at least 150, more than 150 patients we know have initiated therapy. And without breaking them down into all sorts of different age groups, we are seeing use across the range of ages from as you know our approved indication is for patients six and older and we are seeing patients from the younger age groups into the older age groups as well. So it's distributed across the age groups.","In terms of the exacerbation data, yes, you're absolutely right. We have been gathering data on a number of different elements on exacerbations, things like the number and frequency of them, the severity of them, the impact it has on patients and caregivers and also the cost to the overall healthcare system. And that data is all going to be very important as we're putting together the dossiers that we will need to submit for reimbursement. And so, making sure that we have a really very up-to-date set of information on those exacerbation rate by the major countries has been an important part of the work that our health economics team has been doing in preparation for the launch.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Can you share any findings from that in terms of the cost to the system?","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Well, it can be expensive. I mean it depends on the type of exacerbation and the severity and does it lead to hospitalizations and we know that hospitalizations can be up to two weeks at a time and things like that. So there's a range of costs if you like and it varies by country and things like that. And we will be getting around to publishing that data and when that data is publicly available, that's when you'll be able to see the kind of costs that we think these events have for the healthcare system.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden from UBS.","Matthew M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much for taking the question. I wondered if we could go back to the VX-661 Phase 2b data. I thought maybe you could add a little bit of perspective on that, because I have gotten a lot of questions on it. So, the FEV1 at four weeks was 4% and 4.4% higher than baseline. But the final through 12-week result on a repeated measures basis was 3%. And because that statistical method is a little bit different than what you're \u2013 it's kind of apples and oranges between the four and 12-week. I wondered if you could talk about why you use the repeated measures method for the 12-week endpoint? And then maybe if you could give us a better sense of the progression of FEV1 throughout the 12-week trial, and at what time point did you have the high watermark in the FEV1? Thanks.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, Matt, this is Jeff. Thanks for asking, giving us a chance to sort of clarify this because I know both have had some questions about it. I think it's perhaps more straightforward than people imagine. First, let me just remind you about this trial. The idea here was we needed more safety data than we had had to move into Phase 3. And so this trial was really designed predominantly as a safety trial to get us 12 weeks of safety data that would cover us, so we could accelerate into Phase 3. And the first finding that I would emphasize that we were particularly pleased with was the fact that we didn't see any new safety concerns and that allowed us to accelerate the pivotal program as you know, which is enrolling now.","The other, though they were efficacy endpoints as you said, predominantly FEV1, and what you're really asking is what was the sort of pattern that we saw. I would characterize it this way. First of all, the changes in FEV1 that we saw were consistent with what we've seen before in that 4% range in multiple studies. The pattern was very similar to what we've seen before with all CFTR correctors, which means that the changes were rapid. You saw them within two weeks and they were sustained through the 12 weeks of the study.","It was a small study, so there was some bouncing around of those, but none of those were statistically significant. This thing went up by two weeks, went out to 12 weeks and it was consistent through the 12 weeks of the trial. And that's consistent with the biology. We know that when you get underlying CFTR correction, that has been something that we've seen that's stable and is sustained.","In terms of making a point estimate about what the effect is, we're certainly not going be able to do that from these small Phase 2 trials. That's really going wait for the Phase 3 trial, which is going to be much larger obviously and allow us to directly make the accurate point estimate. But there was nothing here in terms of FEV1 that was in any way inconsistent with what we've seen with 661, or frankly, with the other CFTR correctors in terms of the pattern. Does that answer your question generally?","Matthew M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","It does, but just to clarify, you're not describing a downward trend on the FEV1 benefit from baseline from four weeks to 12 weeks, is that correct?","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's correct. There was some bouncing around at different time points, but the at 12-week time point looked a lot like the at 4-week time point. And so, while there was some bouncing around, there was no statistical or consistent downward trend, if that's what you're asking.","Matthew M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then if I could just sneak in a quick commercial question. Wanted to check in on the expanded access program. Is this happening? If yes, in what geographies and how many patients on program? Thanks.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, this is Jeff. I'll take that one quickly. So, we do have an expanded access program in the US. It has sort of two parts. There's an initial enrollment of about 50 patients who have FEV1s of less than 40. So that's something that actually falls outside the official boundaries of the Phase 3 trial. We'd like to see more data on that population. We'll collect an initial set of patients and then analyze that and based on that, we'll expand the access program as we go.","Matthew M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Congrats on the progress.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That trial is enrolling as we speak.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Liisa Bayko from JMP Securities.","Masha Chapman - JMP Securities LLC","Hi. This is Masha for Liisa. Thank you for letting us ask question. I have three, one is commercial. How do you think about the adoption curve for ORKAMBI in the US and maybe more specifically, like what are the factors that you envision will be at play that are different from the KALYDECO launch, just aside from just the volume of patients.","And in Europe as a follow-up question, it took some time in that geography to negotiate price and the reimbursement for KALYDECO. Now given your presence there, do you think the process will be faster? One quick housekeeping question is what was the FX impact this quarter on top line. Thank you.","Michael Partridge - Vice President-Investor Relations","Masha, this is Michael. Just in consideration of other analysts who will be asking questions, could we ask you to just focus on one question and then we are happy to address other questions you have after the call during follow up.","Masha Chapman - JMP Securities LLC","Sure. Thank you. First question is fine.","Michael Partridge - Vice President-Investor Relations","So which question would you like us to answer?","Masha Chapman - JMP Securities LLC","Yes. First question is fine, on the adoption in the US and various factors that will be different from KALYDECO launch. Thank you.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Yes, great. Masha, it's Stuart here. So thanks for the question. I mean broadly speaking, we're anticipating the demand from patients and physicians to be very high for ORKAMBI given the seriousness of the disease, the level of unmet need given that there is no currently available treatments that address the underlying cause of the disease and the community's positive reaction to the clinical profile. So generally speaking, we are expecting there to be significant demand and quick uptake.","Specifically to address your question about what might be different around the uptake, the biggest difference I think is going to be around the patient volume. And if you think about it, there's about 275 CF centers in the US. So for KALYDECO in G551D, they were seeing about three to four patients. For the F508del homozygous population 12 and over, we've got about 8,500 patients. So they're going to be seeing 30 plus patients in the average CF center if there is such a thing.","And whilst the initial decision to initiate therapy may be made very quickly by the physician in consultation with the patient, just that sheer volume of patients and the level of administrative burden that goes along with initiating a patient going through the reimbursement process, prior authorizations and that sort of thing, I think is likely to lead to a slower relative rate of uptake relative to KALYDECO.","The one last thing I do want to say though, relative to KALYDECO is the important phrase there. I mean the KALYDECO uptake was virtually vertical. I mean, we were at 90% of peak penetration in six months, the fastest launch personally I've ever been involved in. And so whilst we're saying the relative rate of uptake with ORKAMBI maybe slightly slower as a result of some of these increased patient volume factors, as I say, we're still expecting the demand to be very significant from both patients and physicians.","Michael Partridge - Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber from Citi. Your line is open, sir.","Yaron B. Werber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks for taking my question. Ian, it's a question for you. I think it's a follow-up to some of your earlier comment, just talking about profitability and expenses obviously ramping up a little bit second half. Can you give us a sense where are you sort of on your commercial preparation now? How much more do you need to prepare since the sales force is already in place? And just maybe a little bit understanding, just maybe just not in the script, not in concrete terms, but just broadly is R&D broadly going to go up in line with revenues over time or less than revenues? I'm just trying to get a sense what profitability could be, because that's the key question I'm getting all the time. Thank you.","Ian F. Smith - Executive Vice Presidnet and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Yaron. I'll actually \u2013 Stuart can follow my answer, but Stuart can, because I heard of two questions there. Stuart can also help you understand where we are in commercial preparation as well for the launch of ORKAMBI. The way we look at this is profitability should come with the launch of ORKAMBI and we continue to drive the revenue line with KALYDECO with geographic and label expansion as we stated earlier on this call. Clearly, the revenue growth is accelerated by the potential approval of ORKAMBI. Therefore as we look towards the end of this year and maybe beginning of next year, we start to see the company turn cash flow positive and profitable.","As far as the operating expense is concerned and the future operating expense is concerned, as you're asking, in the short-term we've committed to financial guidance of $1 billion, $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion and we've reiterated that on the call tonight. So it helps you understand how we think about this year. And then as we think about the out years, I made some comments earlier that we continue to control that operating expense, but with the revenue growth that we have, we see the opportunity to make significant operating margins.","To use what you just said in the question, we do not see the company taking a proportion of its revenues and allocating those to R&D. The R&D investment in the company is based on our commitment to a research function that has been highly productive over the years. We like where we are with that. And then the development spend and development investment is a function of the opportunity of the products that we may create. And so we don't look at it as a financial metric to spend away the revenue line. It is more a function of controlling and having efficient R&D, having a control and efficient operating expense, but controlling that to allow the revenues to generate significant operating margins. And Stuart, do you want to comment on ORKAMBI's?","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Sure. Yes, in terms of the launch preparations, in the US, we're launch ready. The additional commercial infrastructure that we need here in the US, which was largely in our patient services team, this is the team that supports patients through the reimbursement process and helps with education and compliance. That team has been scaled up to reflect the larger patient population we hope to serve when ORKAMBI is approved later this year.","So in the US, we're fully scaled up and launch ready. And ex-US, essentially we'll be using largely the same infrastructure that we've used for KALYDECO in those markets where we commercialized KALYDECO. The real growth in our ex-US markets is driven by us needing to build infrastructure in markets where we don't currently have a presence, because there isn't really a large bolus of KALYDECO-eligible patients in those markets. And so that expansion is really happening in the second half of the year as we get ready for the approval and then subsequent reimbursement submissions in Europe towards the back end of this year.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to stay on this topic of profitability and cash flow for a second. But from a BD standpoint, I'm wondering if you anticipate that you'll have the capacity to drive the bottom line while simultaneously being opportunistic with acquisitions, whether inside or outside of CF. And then I guess as it specifically relates to CF, what's your view on the most value-add timing of a potential deal? In other words, how much proof of concept do you need to see before trying to go after an asset? Thanks.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Cory, thanks for the question. I think I've mentioned this on a number of earlier calls. So we have a very firm and committed corporate and business development strategy. And I'll just go over that once again and then comment on your last part of the question, which is timing. The priority within business and corporate development for us today is cystic fibrosis. And so we continue to evaluate opportunities of other technologies or medicines that may enhance our approach to creating the best combination medicines for our patients as well as thinking about other modalities of how we may treat patients many years away from now. We're committed to the space. And so we continue to evaluate different technology and different medicines that are at various different points of research and development to give them consideration of whether they would be better in combination with our base therapy.","Second priority for us in the area is scientific footprint. Vertex has been highly successful in small molecule drug development and looking at molecular targets. It's time for us to continue and consider other things. And so we're looking at other modalities of science and there is a lot of very exciting stuff out there and we're working very hard on evaluating those as well.","And then third, there is this consideration of being more opportunistic with in-licensing. I would say it's smaller scale. I don't want you to take away from this call that Vertex is trying to buy revenue. We have a lot of internal growth with our own compounds. We've got a lot to execute on in the CF space alone. So we don't need at this point to go out and take on risk of M&A to buy revenue, but we would consider balancing our pipeline opportunistically.","And then to your point of a question of how do we think about the timing, the ideal timing for bringing in potential CF assets. We look at it by looking at our HBE assays to be honest. If we have an opportunity to study an external asset with our own assets and evaluate the combination therapies or even that the standalone therapy through our HBE cells, we take a lot of confidence from that. And if we can at least do those kind of lab experiments, it gives us confidence there to move forward where then potentially the risk in the clinic is one mainly focused on safety. So for us, the ideal time is around this pre-clinical or translational time of medicines to look to do the combinations.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Deutsche Bank.","Mohit Bansal - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks. This is Mohit Bansal for Robyn. Thanks for taking our question. So maybe like diverting a little bit from cystic fibrosis, and can you please talk a little bit about your BioAxone collaboration which you did in October last year, and the asset in particular VX-210 for spinal cord injury? And then should it be taken as an indication for the types of deal you are looking for outside the CF space? Thank you.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, this is Jeff Leiden. Thanks for the question, and I'll tell you a little about the deal and then answer the second part of it. So just as a reminder, this was a licensing deal for a Phase 2b-ready row inhibitor for a spinal cord injury. Strategically obviously it's the kind of disease we're interested in. That means a serious disease with very large unmet medical need where even small improvements in neurologic function make huge improvements for patients. It's a market that's of the right size, which is clearly a specialty market, very consistent in size with markets like CF and other specialty markets, so not requiring large commercial infrastructure.","And there was preclinical and early clinical data that was suggestive of an effect and it was I think economically also a very good deal for Vertex in terms of acquiring an option for what could be a very valuable asset to patients and us. The plan with that program as we've said is to begin the Phase 2b study later this year, and it's a study that's we were designing to be large enough to really give us a clear answer on the effects of this particular molecule.","Your second question, is this the kind of deal that we would do, there is no one answer to that. But because of all the things I just told you, yes, it fits strategically. It's the right size. It's the right stage. It's the right kind of asset and it's potentially transformational for patients.","Mohit Bansal - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tony Butler from Guggenheim Partners.","Tony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Jeff, I'm respectful of your comments around chloride transport in HBE cells for the triple combination or the addition of the second corrector. But the question is, as it begins to fold, why don't you get steric hindrance, because you've got three molecules there? And more importantly, how do you actually know from the in-vitro assays that you \u2013 let's just say will not or may not generate exhaustion when you move that in-vivo? Or can you know that? Thanks very much.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, two great questions actually, and we're thinking a lot about them. The first one's really interesting because it points to what I think is a fundamental property of these correctors in particular, but also the potentiators, which is that they don't stay bound to the target. In fact that's important, that they help with the folding and they likely come off the target, at least everything that we've seen says that that happens, which also gives you some interesting insights into the kinds of potency that you might really want to look at. I think that's one of the reasons we don't get steric hindrance, and another reason of course is the size of these small molecules compared to the size of these proteins is quite small. But I actually think it's the first reason more than anything else. These are binders which tend to come off I think during the folding process.","And your second question is about exhaustion. In a way, that would be a nice problem to have in terms of driving chloride transfer, driving CFTR trafficking and chloride transport up so high that you get exhaustion. But in fact what we're seeing so far anyway is that you can drive this up very significantly with these three drug combinations and that the CFTR that's on the cell surface is functional. That's of course the most important thing and we're not seeing what you might worry about, which is increased recycling of the CFTR or abnormal function of the CFTR when it's folded by these three molecules. That's really not what we're seeing.","Tony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks very much.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Katherine Xu from William Blair.","Katherine Xu - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, good afternoon. Just a very quick question on the strategy for ORKAMBI in children ages six to 11. Do you have a safety study plan, any, what other studies you're going to do for the eventual approval?","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, so it's a little bit \u2013 thanks for the question. It's a little bit different in the US than Europe and so it's important I think that we clarify that. In the US, the safety PK study, which is fully enrolled now, we believe and we know is the only study that we're going to need, assuming of course it's successful, to apply for approval in the US.","In Europe, it's a little bit less certain, and in fact our assumption is typically in Europe that one would need both an efficacy endpoint and a safety endpoint. And so at the current time, although we're still discussing it with European regulators, we're planning a second study in Europe that would have both the efficacy and safety endpoints, about the same size, to apply for approval in Europe in this patient population. And we would assume that that would likely start sort of mid-year.","Michael Partridge - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, we have time for two more questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, thanks for taking my questions. First of all, the results you just released last month from the 12 weeks Phase 2b for VX-661 in homozygous patients, based on that 2% absolute change between placebo and drug, does that change your view of the likelihood of success for this combo in heterozygous, or you called the het min patients?","And then secondly, philosophically, how high do you think the barrier to entry for your competition is? It seems that everyone else is also developing drugs using your HP assay. So, I was wondering what your view is for the competition that's coming on the way? Thanks.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, let me answer the second one first. Of course there is now increasing competition. That typically is what happens when you show the kinds of success that we've shown. I think the strategy that we're taking is to as quickly as possible find the maximal regimens and get the most patients we can on them. We do think we have a pretty considerable head start. Most of these other assets are preclinical or just entering the clinic. And so as I told you, for the reasons I've told you, we're confident that for instance a three drug regimen will allow us to address 80% to 90% of the patients and get essentially maximal effects.","And that does of course provide a barrier to entry, both in terms of even enrolling clinical trials and certainly in terms of commercially once you're already there. So that's really the competitive strategy. And it's supplemented by our business development strategy as Ian said. So if some of those assets come from externally and we can put them together into even better combinations, all the better for patients and of course for us.","On the first question is really, what's our confidence around 661. And as I said, the FEV1 response that we saw in that study and in the delta-F508 homozygous patients was pretty comparable to what we've seen in the other Phase 2 studies. So if anything, that increased our confidence in the effects we're seeing since it went through 12 weeks. I'd also remind you that there is a lot of other Phase 2 data out there. For example, adding 661 to patients who are on KALYDECO who have a gating mutation, in which in a Phase 2 study we showed I think about a 4.6% further increase in their FEV1, and of course that's become a part of our Phase 3 program.","I think one of the key questions that we have and that others have is, what is the likelihood of success with the two drug combination, 661 plus KALYDECO in the heterozygous min population, the really most difficult population to treat. And as we've said before, we think that has a lower probability. We haven't actually tested the drug yet there. But on the other hand, those patients have nothing today. So the way we're managing that in the Phase 3 program is there is a separate study in that population, but it looks quite different. And we're going to enroll a reasonably small number of patients, about 120, and then we're going to do a futility analysis based on those 120 to decide whether to continue and enroll another 150, which would give us the full pivotal trial. So it allows us to manage the risk there, if you will, while we're also bringing forward of course the next generation correctors that we think have a higher likelihood of success in that population.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much for the color.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for fitting me in. So if I could just ask again on the next generation corrector, I think earlier you suggested that it's \u2013 you obviously know the targets and you know the sites you want to target. It sounded like you were still doing some work to get the molecule ready. I was wondering if you could maybe be more specific. Is this formulation work that's still necessary, tox work? Is it that you have a few compounds and you're trying to pick which one you actually want to move forward and put in the clinic? So maybe if you could just be a little bit more specific there. And then separately, Ian, could you just talk about FX for 2015? Thanks.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. This is Jeff again. I'll answer the first part and then I'll let Ian answer on the FX. So what we've said here is, and where we are here is, that we have multiple second generation correctors, which do add to KALYDECO plus a first gen corrector like 661 and we are basically at the stage of lead optimization. And as you know, what that involves is optimizing around several parameters, PK, drug-drug interaction and toxicity. And so these molecules are at various stages there of optimizing PK, tox and drug-drug interaction. And when we get the first one, which we expect to do this year, optimize for those. We'll take that into the clinic, but our plan is not to just pick one and take it into the clinic. Our plan is actually to pick multiple versions here. They have different flavors. They bind to different sites, we believe. And so we will test multiple versions in multiple combinations in the clinic, and as I said starting this year and then certainly going into next year. Does that answer your question about the second gens?","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That does. Thank you.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Ian F. Smith - Executive Vice Presidnet and Chief Financial Officer","And to the FX question, I know it's been a popular discussion through Q1 results. We also have ex-U.S. revenues. In fact in the first quarter, approximately 45% of the KALYDECO revenues do come from ex-US, and so we suffered the same headwinds as the other companies have suffered. However as you can see, we've recorded $130 million worth of revenues in the first quarter. The launch is going very well.","To the broader story of the full year, we anticipate that FX does have an impact on our revenue line. However, we've taken appropriate measures in terms of hedging against those revenues. And then when you look at the bottom line for the company, we have a natural hedge because we have overseas operations where we're benefiting from a reduction in expense, because we're getting favorable benefit there on the expense line. So we've managed the FX and for the rest of the year, we believe we're in good shape. We continue to be committed to our revenue guidance of $560 million to $580 million for KALYDECO and we're happy with our position.","Michael Partridge - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Michael Partridge, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Michael Partridge","Thank you, operator, and good evening, everyone. Joining me on the call tonight are Dr. Jeff Leiden, Chairman and CEO; Stuart Arbuckle, Chief Commercial Officer; and Ian Smith, Chief Financial Officer. Dr. Jeff Chodakewitz, Chief Medical Officer, will join us for Q&A.","Our agenda tonight is as follows. Jeff will review the progress with our cystic fibrosis medicines in the context of our broader corporate vision. Stuart will review the third quarter performance of KALYDECO and will also discuss preparations for the launch of the lumacaftor\/ivacaftor combination. And to close, Ian will review the third quarter financial results and provide commentary on our expected financial profile moving forward. We will then open the call for your questions. We expect the call to run for no more than 45 minutes.","You can access the webcast slides by going to the Events section of the Investor Relations page on our website, vrtx.com.","I will remind you that we will make forward-looking statements on this conference call. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in today's press release and our 10-K and 10-Q, which have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These statements, including, without limitation, those regarding the ongoing development and potential commercialization of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor and those about Vertex's other cystic fibrosis programs are based on management's current assumptions. Actual outcomes and events could differ materially.","Information regarding our use of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is available in our third quarter 2014 financial results press release. I would also refer you to Slide 4 of tonight's webcast.","I will now turn the call over to Jeff Leiden.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Thanks, Michael, and good evening, everyone. Our vision is to be a leader in discovering and developing therapies for cystic fibrosis and other serious diseases. We outlined the clear strategy over 2 years ago designed to establish a foundation for sustainable growth. And I'm happy to say, we are well along that path.","Specifically, and more recently, clinical data presented at the North American CF Conference earlier this month showed just how far Vertex has come and supports our confidence in delivering more medicines to more CF patients.","Our goal in CF is to reach the vast majority of people with CF and to continue to enhance the benefit for the patients that we treat.","Let me summarize our recent progress. First, data presented at NACF in early October from the roll over study of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor showed sustained clinical benefits through 48 weeks of treatment and no new safety concerns, supporting the longer-term treatment for CF patients. We are on track to submit the NDA and MAA in the fourth quarter of this year for patients 12 and older with 2 copies of the Delta 508 mutation.","Second, and also in early October, we provided an update to our VX-661 development plans. We now expect to initiate a pivotal Phase III program for VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor in the first half of 2015, pending regulatory discussions and data from the ongoing 12-week study in people with 2 copies of the Delta F508 mutation. We believe that VX-661 ivacaftor combination has the potential to benefit multiple patient populations and achieve a broad label.","Third, last week, the FDA's Pulmonary Advisory Committee voted 13 to 2 to recommend approval of KALYDECO in people ages 6 and older who have the R117H mutation. This is an important step toward making ivacaftor available to the approximately 500 people in the U.S. ages 6 and older who have this mutation.","And lastly, during the third quarter, we've strengthened our financial position by adding $300 million to our balance sheet through a new credit agreement. With approximately $1.5 billion in cash and the successful progression of our CF medicines, we are well-positioned for future growth.","Our financial strength gives us the flexibility as we work to further enhance the treatment of cystic fibrosis and develop innovative new medicines to treat other serious diseases.","In summary, we are transforming the treatment of cystic fibrosis with medicines that address the underlying cause of the disease. We are advancing our earlier stage science and pipeline, and we are positioning the company for sustainable revenue and earnings growth.","I'll now hand the call over to Stuart.","Stuart A. Arbuckle","Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Tonight, I'll review the third quarter sales of KALYDECO that continued to reflect strong underlying demand driven by label and geographic expansion. I will also discuss how the commercial organization is preparing for the approval and launch of the lumacaftor\/ivacaftor combination.","KALYDECO generated $127 million in product sales, including U.S. sales of approximately $74 million and x U.S. sales of approximately $53 million. Underlying demand and adherence in G551D patients continue to be strong, both in the U.S. and internationally.","U.S. sales reflect continued uptake in the 8 additional mutations approved earlier this year, and $7 million of buying accelerated into the third quarter from the fourth quarter due to a change in our distribution model, which went into effect on October 1. This change provides scalability in anticipation of the larger F508del patient population. Due to this stocking in the third quarter, reported sales for the fourth quarter will be impacted. We expect to end this year with approximately 2,600 patients eligible for KALYDECO and momentum with multiple growth drivers going forward based on further geographic and label expansions.","In Europe, we are working closely with national authorities to achieve reimbursement to make KALYDECO available to the approximately 200 people ages 6 and older who have 1 of 8 non-G551D gating mutations.","In Canada, 6 provinces and territories have added KALYDECO to their public drug programs, and patients are beginning to initiate therapy. These provinces and territories account for approximately 80% of the 60 G551D patients who have public insurance in Canada.","In Australia, the government recently announced that KALYDECO is expected to be listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme as of December 1. There are approximately 250 people with CF aged 6 years and older who are expected to be eligible for treatment with KALYDECO in Australia.","In the U.S., the FDA Advisory Committee voted 13 to 2 in favor approval for KALYDECO in people with the R117H mutation ages 6 and older.","The FDA is expected to make a decision on our application by December 30, 2014. We have also filed an MAA in the EU during the quarter. There are approximately 1,100 patients ages 6 and older with the R117H mutation around the world.","And lastly, we submitted an NDA in the U.S. and an MAA in the EU for the approval of ivacaftor in children with CF ages 2 to 5 who have gating mutations. There are approximately 300 of these children with CF around the world.","As we move through 2015, we expect that the number of patients eligible for KALYDECO will increase from 2,600 to nearly 4,000 by the end of 2015. Although, all eligible patients will not be on treatment next year, we expect significant growth in 2015.","Now to the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor. We are on track to submit the NDA and MAA in the fourth quarter, and we will be requesting priority review in the U.S. If granted priority review by the FDA, the submission would qualify for an 8-month review and a potential mid-2015 launch in the U.S.","There are approximately 22,000 people ages 12 and older who have 2 copies of the F508del mutation in North America, Europe and Australia, including approximately 8,500 in the United States and approximately 12,000 in Europe. We are expanding our infrastructure in anticipation of the launch and working to understand how CF centers plan to manage the increased volume of patients eligible for a CF modulator.","In the U.S. we are in the process of hiring additional case managers who help providers and patients navigate the reimbursement process and help with patient education and compliance.","Internationally, we have a plan in place to build out the required infrastructure in new markets to support the lumacaftor\/ivacaftor combination launch.","In summary, we're pleased with the progress we are making with KALYDECO as it continues to be made available to more patients globally. Also, our launch preparations for the lumacaftor\/ivacaftor combination are well underway, and we look forward to bringing this transformational medicine to CF patients once approved.","I'll now hand the call over to Ian.","Ian F. Smith","Thanks, Stuart, and good evening everyone. In my remarks tonight, I will review our financial results, update our guidance for the rest of the year and give some thoughts about our financial profile as we move into 2015.","First to the financials. This quarter, we generated $165 million in total GAAP revenues that include KALYDECO revenues of $127 million. The KALYDECO revenues increased compared to third quarter 2013 as we continued to expand the number of patients we treat.","Also, this quarter, we recognized $30 million in revenue from our recent out licensing of VX-787, our novel flu medicine, to Janssen.","Our third quarter non-GAAP total operating expenses were $212 million, a decrease of $62 million compared to the third quarter of last year. This reflects our prioritization towards CF medicines and cost reductions relating to prior investments in HCV and other areas.","More specifically, our non-GAAP R&D expenses were $157 million for the third quarter of 2014, a reduction of $43 million compared to the third quarter of 2013.","Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $55 million for the third quarter of 2014 compared to $74 million in the same quarter of last year. We will continue to focus on cost control and prioritization of our investments, consistent with the growth and value drivers of our business.","The non-GAAP loss was $86 million or $0.37 per share compared to the prior year loss of $74 million. This increased loss was the result of significantly reduced and now excluded HCV revenues in 2014.","Now to update our 2014 financial guidance. Earlier this year, we provided guidance that non-GAAP total revenues were forecast at $520 million to $550 million for the full year. We are now narrowing that range to $525 million to $535 million. We also provided KALYDECO revenue guidance of $470 million to $500 million based on expected timing of approvals for label expansion and reimbursement in certain countries.","We now expect KALYDECO revenues to be approximately $460 million for the full year, which translates to a fourth quarter revenue of approximately $120 million. This reduction in the KALYDECO revenue range is principally due to the delayed access to patients in Australia, which has now been resolved.","With recent regulatory submissions and approvals for reimbursement, we are in a strong position to see continued growth in KALYDECO revenues in 2015.","Specifically, we could see eligible patients increase from 2,600 today to nearly 4,000 by the end of 2015, although we don't expect all eligible patients to be on treatment by the end of next year.","Now to the operating expenses. We're also narrowing our non-GAAP operating expenses to $910 million to $920 million from the previously guided $890 million to $930 million. This narrowed guidance includes accelerated investments as we prepare for VX-661 pivotal program to begin in the first half of 2015.","Now to our outlook for 2015. In CF, we expect to treat significantly more patients in 2015, which will require investment in supporting the ivacaftor\/lumacaftor combination launch, building inventory and establishing a larger international presence. We therefore anticipate an increased SG&A investment compared to 2014. And from an R&D expense perspective, we will increase the investment as we begin pivotal development of VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor while still maintaining investment in lumacaftor\/ivacaftor combination for patients who remain on long-term extension study through 2015.","Overall, we expect the total operating expenses will be higher in 2015 compared to 2014. However, we will continue to control our operating expenses in future years as we make progress towards being a steady-state fully resourced company.","I'll close by stating we are focused on delivering a financial profile consistent with our large-cap biotech peers that includes significant revenue and earnings growth and high operating margins. With that, I'll ask the operator to please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First, just on -- sorry, I jumped on a little bit late, but KALYDECO for R117H in Europe, can you just tell us what age range you filed for approval there for that indication? And then another question, the same question was with respect to the 661 in KALYDECO Phase III trial. Have you guys selected a dose there for 661 yet? And if not, what's going to drive that decision?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","It's Jeff Chodakewitz. So on your questions, for R117H, we did file for greater than 18. As you may know, the -- there are differences in how regulatory agencies in the EU and the U.S. think about data for pediatrics. We now have been gone through the AC and we can engage in a little bit in that conversation with them, but that was the filing. In terms of the 661 ivacaftor program, we do choose a dose and the dose is 100 milligrams of 661 and the standard 150 twice daily for ivacaftor.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just to follow up on Europe. Does that mean you guys might have the opportunity to go back to them and ask them for a lower age range on R117H?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","No, I think that the expectation is that it's going to focus on greater than 18. But, of course, we're going to have the discussion because of the need for patients as we spoke about with the U.S. Advisory Committee. I really can't predict more than that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets.","John Chung - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This is John on behalf of Michael Yee. As we look forward to the 12-week Phase IIb data for VX-661 combo we expect in early 2015, is there a minimum threshold you're looking for in terms of efficacy, such as FEV1 or sweat chloride that would give you confidence that in fact 661 is leading to better efficacy and thus reasonable to invest and go ahead with the extensive Phase III trial as planned for the combo?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","It's Jeff Chodakewitz again. So I think really what we're looking forward to there is 2 things. One is to get confirmation in what we've been seeing already in 4-week data, and the other, of course, is that this is the longest period of time that we'll have studied the combination. So we'll also be confirming that the favorable safety profile continues. I don't think there's any one number.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Roden from UBS.","Andrew R. Peters - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","This is Andrew Peters in for Matt. I was just curious, as you prepare for the approval or potential approval on launch of the combination next year, I'm curious as to what you've learned with -- from KALYDECO in terms of reimbursement and pricing x U.S. that you can apply hopefully to kind of speed up the reimbursement process. Just thinking of delays that you saw with the NI -- with -- in the U.K. as well as places like Australia.","Stuart A. Arbuckle","Yes, thanks for the question. Yes, the first thing I would say is, actually, we were able to secure reimbursement for KALYDECO in Europe, I think really very quickly indeed. The U.K., although it's 5 separate countries, England we managed to secure reimbursement in about 7 months, which I would say is remarkably fast for an ultra-orphan product like KALYDECO, which I think is a testament to a couple of things, which I think do form the foundation of our learnings as we think about the lumacaftor\/ivacaftor combination. And the first one is this is a really serious illness with few treatment options. The second thing is that these are breakthrough medicines that treat the underlying cause of the disease and really work incredibly well in children and adults with CF. And so the combination of those 2 things, I think, is what has led us to be able to have very productive, challenging at times, but productive and ultimately successful reimbursement discussions.","Operator","And our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges from Bernstein.","Wen Shi","This is Wen Shi here for Geoff. Some questions about the 661 Phase III study. [indiscernible] so what are some of the gating factors for the start of these studies or is -- are you waiting for the 12-week data in-hand before you kind of sort of finalize the Phase III plan? Are you looking for FDA meetings and those kind of things? And also a related one, right, so for the gating mutation patients, are you looking to conduct head-to-head studies versus KALYDECO with the combination in the potential to replace KALYDECO in those patient population?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","It's Jeff Chodakewitz. I think maybe a couple of comments. I think, in terms of factors or -- that we're looking for information from, I think you hit on the 2 main ones. Of course, we're going to -- as we were just talking about, get the data from our 12-week study. And then importantly, we need to speak about our plans with regulatory agencies. So I think that, that's really -- those are going to be the big drivers, and we think that, that will be consistent with our first half start, as Jeff Leiden has said. I think in terms of the patients who have already KALYDECO use indicated for them, I think what we're really doing is building off the observation that we had in our Phase II study. And you may remember that where we had patients who had a G551D mutation on 1 allele, and we're already taking KALYDECO, but also had a F508del mutation on the other allele. And in that study, we're able to show by randomizing patients to 661 or placebo that those patients got incremental benefit, which we think was an important observation. I think the details of the study really still, of course, needs to be worked through, as I said, with regulatory agencies.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group.","Unknown Analyst","This is Mr. Robyn Karnauskas [ph] sitting in for Mark. The question I had -- I have has to do with the third-generation -- or I guess, the next-generation corrector that potentially form the triplet [ph] therapy. I'm just curious, I know that when it comes to the clinic next year, sort of trying to predict a time frame is very difficult, to be given the number of drugs in the mix. I was wondering if you -- maybe there's a way to appreciate. So -- maybe how quickly -- so maybe not how long it would take but maybe how quickly theoretically it actually could come to the market? So maybe frame the other end of that.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","I think what we've said before -- this is Jeff Leiden, sorry, what we said before is we plan to have at least one and hopefully, more than one of those next generation, third-generation correctors in the clinic next year and, obviously, the development path for those will be Phase I study single-dose and multi ascending dose first to ensure safety then followed by combination studies. And so I think, you can sort of do the math, as well as we can in terms of how long these studies take, they'll look a lot like our initial studies of KALYDECO and 809. And obviously, our goal is to get to the combination trials in Phase II where we've been able to demonstrate efficacy with our other drugs as quickly as possible.","Operator","And our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Deutsche Bank.","Robyn S. Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just coming off of NACF, I was just curious, I guess we also had heard some of the centers were just very busy with patients. Just sort of concerns around the flow of patients into the NACF or into the cystic fibrosis centers. I was just wondering about that flow. You were talking about concerns around launching into a bigger CF population. And given it seem like there was flow problems already, what are you doing now to sort of prep for the number of patients that are going to have to be treated with the new regimen?","Stuart A. Arbuckle","It's Stuart. Yes, it's a great question, and it is a topic that we've been discussing with CF centers recently, both here in the U.S. and internationally because it is a concern for them. And the reason why it's a concern for them is not because they're going to be seeing more patients than they currently are looking after. It's more to do with the fact that when you're initiating a new therapy, obviously there's a number of steps that you need to go through to initiate that new therapy. There'll be things you need to do in terms of working up the patient. There is -- probably one of their primary concerns is the administration associated with securing reimbursement and access and going through the approval process with whatever plan or reimbursement or authority might be covering that patient's prescription. So that's why one of the things that we're doing in terms of expanding our footprint is expanding, in the U.S. for instance, in our case management team. That case management team's primary role in life is helping providers and patients navigate the reimbursement and access kind of maze and also providing education and compliance support. And so that's one of the things that we're doing, and obviously we're going to be trying to do other things to really try and help smooth that administrative burden for the CF centers so that they can triage their patients onto a therapy as quickly as they want to.","Operator","And our next question comes from Liisa Bayko from JPM Securities (sic) [JMP Securities].","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","First of all, can you just tell us if you're expecting an Ad Com for the upcoming combination for the homozygous patients?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","It's Jeff. I think, we really just don't know yet. That's a determination that the FDA will make during the review process.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just, again, coming off of the NACFC conference, there was quite a bit of discussion about reimbursement. How are you thinking about pricing from the combination relative to ivacaftor, both domestically and other territories? If you can just provide us a framework.","Stuart A. Arbuckle","Yes, Liisa, obviously, it's premature to make any very specific comments about pricing the combination. I can tell you the sorts of factors that we're taking into account. The first one is how well the medicine works for children and adults with CF. As you know, it's a breakthrough medicine, which treats the underlying cause of the disease and as a result has kind of multiple benefits across a range of different dimensions, obviously, things like FEV1. But important aspects like exacerbations, hospitalizations, time in hospital, things that we know are of great concern and high value to patients, payers and to patients. So the first determiner really is how well the medicine works. The second one is the size of the population that we're hoping to benefit. The third area is really reflecting the time and expense that have taken us to develop the combination. And then lastly, is our ability to continue on our mission, which is to continue to bring transformative medicines to patients who need them in cystic fibrosis and also in other conditions where they are equally serious where there's very few treatment options. So really, those are the 3 or 4 things that we'll be taking into account as we think about the price of the lumacaftor\/ivacaftor combination.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, just a final question about your guidance. It looks like when we take out some of the one-time kind of events, it's flat...","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","We lost her. And our next question comes from Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Catherine Hu - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is actually Catherine for Ying. Just a couple. What are your reasoning behind skipping a Phase II trial for VX-661 in the heterozygous patient population and kind of heading straight into the Phase III? And then secondly, are there any restrictions on the reimbursement in Australia? And is payment contingent on achieving outcomes, such as FEV1 improvement?","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","It's Jeff. I'll take the first part and then turn it over to Stuart. I think that the reasons for going directly as we've talked about to the [indiscernible] population are a couple. One is that the -- there are some characteristics about 661 that are somewhat different than 809, which we think could convey a benefit. Secondly, that in some of the clinical studies that we perform to date in Phase II, there are some signals that there's some potential advantages for 661. And then the third part is really the medical need for those patients. So it really is we've recognized a higher risk group of patients, but it's a group of patients that don't have access right now to a therapy that's directed at the underlying cause of the disease. And so we think it's valuable to find out whether 661 with ivacaftor can offer a benefit. The last thing I would just note is that the way we're restructuring the program is that there really are 4 different studies. And so even if we're hoping that, that study will work for patients, but if it doesn't, there's still then multiple pivotal trials to support filing and approval.","Stuart A. Arbuckle","And on the reimbursement in Australia. The specific terms of our agreement in Australia are obviously confidential. What I can tell you is that we've reached an agreement where all eligible patients will have access to KALYDECO and that no patient types are going to be excluded from reimbursement and also no patients are going to have their access for therapy interrupted as a result of stopping rules. And that's really consistent with our belief that patients should only be discontinuing treatment if they and their physician think that's the best clinical decision for them.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Abrahams from Wells Fargo.","Shin Kang - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","This is Shin calling in for Brian. Related to the FDA panels, favorable vote on 117H for broader population of patients. It was quite apparent that if the questions were posed to the panel, if they were segmented by age, perhaps the votes might have reflected some reservations among the panel members. I was curious to hear your thoughts on the way the questions were constructed and what that might suggest about FDA's thinking in terms of approving the drug in children, given the study didn't meet the endpoint in that population.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","This is Jeff Leiden. Thanks for the question. Obviously, we were quite pleased with the vote, and we think it reflects 2 things: one, the results of the trial, which we thought were quite clear; and two, I think a real understanding among the panel members that there -- our populations of patients at all ages, in other words all ages greater than 6, who are sick with CF and who can benefit from the drug. And we think that discussion was a very good and lively one and that the conclusion of the vote represented really those 2 factors.","Operator","And our next question comes from Liisa Bayko from JMP Securities.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to understand the guidance. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, it looks a little flattish when we take out some of the one-time events. And so I'm wondering if we could -- if you could just comment on that. And then maybe in the context of that, are you seeing any sort of discontinuations? I heard anecdotally that patients feel so good that sometimes they don't need to take their medications. I just wanted to ask if you've kind of -- if there is some sort of discontinuation rate or lack of compliance.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Liisa, thanks for the question. I'll take the first one and Stuart may take -- I think what you're referring to, rather than discontinuation, is more likely adherence and compliance and Stuart can take that. When you talk about the guidance, I assume you're referring to the KALYDECO revenues, which yes, you are correct. When they -- there is an anomaly in the third quarter number we reported, which we reported $127 million. Within that $127 million, there is $7 million of let's call it accelerated stocking. We changed that distribution channel as of September 30, and there were some buy in by the distributors prior to 1st of October. What that did is it brought $7 million of medicines, let's say, into the third quarter. Without that, we would've reported $120 million and would expect the fourth quarter to be $127 million. So that's the only item. So as you can see, the natural demand for KALYDECO and the usage by patients continues to grow quarter-on-quarter if you see it this year, which is what we expect. Then the other comment I made earlier was as we look into 2015, we're currently eligible for around 2,600 patients. But with the approvals and the approvals for reimbursement that we've got recently, we can see by the end of 2015, that we should be eligible to treat approximately 4,000 patients. So there's a nice growth curve there for KALYDECO through this year and then on to next year. And Stuart?","Stuart A. Arbuckle","Yes. In terms of persistence and compliance with KALYDECO, Liisa, not entirely sure what you've heard anecdotally. But if I look at it kind of holistically, across all of the markets where we've introduced KALYDECO, there is a very, very low level of discontinuation. Certainly, discontinuations for efficacy being too good and also, we see very, very high compliance rates up in the 80%, which for a chronic medication is as high as I've ever seen personally. So whilst you might have heard some of these things anecdotally, I think big picture, when you look at it on a population basis, persistence and compliance are both very, very high with KALYDECO.","Operator","And our next question comes from Yaron Werber from Citigroup.","Kumaraguru Raja","This is Kumara in for Yaron. There were lot of data presented at NACFC on the long-term benefits of KALYDECO. Are you able to discuss with [indiscernible] and probably get like reimbursed in a better manner? Or what are you guys doing about that?","Stuart A. Arbuckle","There was some data presented at NACFC, and we are able to talk with some of that -- about some of that data to insurers and reimbursement authorities and have been talking with them about the data that we have on KALYDECO and its long-term benefits for some time. So yes, we have, and I think that data is always appreciated by them as, obviously, this is a chronic medication for a chronic condition. So that information is certainly of some value to them as they can see the consistency and durability of responses that we see and also the ability that KALYDECO has demonstrated to be able to change the natural course of the disease.","Kumaraguru Raja","And any update on licensing VX-509 out?","Stuart A. Arbuckle","No, there's no update at this point.","Operator","And our next question comes from Katherine Xu from William Blair.","Yu Xu - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I'm just wondering, Stuart, can you just quantify a little bit the increase of SG&A next year as you launch the double combo? And also another question, probably for Jeff, from a theoretical perspective, I'm sure you're conducting a lot of experiments with other compounds as well. Is the combination of the 1 potentiator plus 2 corrector potentially versus 1 corrector and 1 potentiator plus another one with some kind of other means of action, do you see, so far, any differences? And do you think that your methodology would come out a strong one next year?","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Katherine, I'll take both of those questions, thanks. So as I mentioned earlier on the call, we're not really in a position to quantify the incremental investment in SG&A for 2015. Although I have to make comments as in -- and it's difficult without giving a number to say whether it's significant or insignificant as you may view it. But the way we look at this is that we're launching a very important medicine in the U.S. in the middle of next year, we hope. And therefore, we want to support that through awareness and also getting fast access to the drug. That's principally where the investment is. As you know, given the already high awareness for this combination medicine and the -- both from patients and physicians, the challenge for us in reaching patients as fast as possible is actually helping them with access. That's where the principal investment will be. This is not a typical drug launch where you've got consumer brand advertising. It's more about helping access to patients. And so we look at it as a spot launch. And as I said on earlier, we also look, as we go forward in future years, that we want to hold operating costs, those our R&D and SG&A expenses, to really get leverage off of growing revenue line, which creates the growing earnings and cash flow. And then the second question regarding, let's say, more of a broader business development strategy and how we think about combination medicines of those next generations that we have within Vertex. We are looking at the full field. It's the #1 priority in our business development efforts at this point in time. We do see opportunity, both internal, and we have multiple next-generation compounds that act in different ways that we may be able to combine with lumacaftor and ivacaftor or with 661. And so we have great opportunity there within Vertex. When we go outside the walls of Vertex, we also see opportunities and whether it's directly on target of how we think about CFTR modulation or whether it's with other complementary mechanisms, we see a couple of opportunities there as well. They tend to be earlier stage, but we do see opportunities, and I think hopefully, the other side of this is the other companies see opportunities of working with us given our advanced nature of our medicines to date.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Kelsey Harrison - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just want to ask a question about pricing and reimbursement. When you think about Europe, as you try to expand the label with some additional gating mutations, would that require you to go back and renegotiate pricing? Or only when you have a substantial change like the combo?","Stuart A. Arbuckle","Yes, thanks. I think it's important when thinking about gating to put a few things into context. So the first one is that the additional gating mutations account for somewhere around 400 patients worldwide, about 250 of which are in the EU. So it's a relatively small number of patients. The other thing to know about the patients with additional gating mutations is that some of them are in markets where KALYDECO has already been reviewed by their health technology assessment agencies like, for instance, England. But many of those patients are in new markets where KALYDECO really hasn't gone through a full reimbursement assessment. That's because they have such a small number of G551D patients. A good example there would be Italy. So it really is going to be negotiated on a country-by-country basis. The last thing I would say is that we do know that KALYDECO in these additional gating mutations performs pretty much identically to how it performs in G551D patients. And so the value proposition, if you want to describe it that way, is really the same in gating patients as it is in the G551D population.","Operator","Our last question comes from Yigal Nochomovitz from Oppenheimer.","Yigal D. Nochomovitz - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I just want on the cash balance and your strategic strategy going forward, with some of the next-generation correctors. You suggested at the NACFC event that you could see some deals and collaborations with some of the smaller next-generation corrector players in the coming months. So I just wondered if you could elaborate a bit on your strategy there and whether you'd be open to a strategy where you could test internally developed correctors and the externally sourced correctors in a parallel fashion.","Stuart A. Arbuckle","So yes. So that was actually the answer I gave on the prior question, which is, yes, we -- I start, first of all, inside Vertex, which is we have multiple next-generation correctors. And as you know, we have a great belief in our HBE assays. And so we're doing all the usual work there. They've tended to translate right into clinical results. And then as we go outside of Vertex, there are a number of companies that have, a couple of companies have a similar approach to ourselves and those could be interesting. And we need to compare those opportunities with what we have internally in terms of adding next-generation type molecules to the portfolio. And then I would say there are other mechanisms that would be complementary to our approach that may provide additive benefit. And so we give consideration to those as well. I appreciate you pointing out the strong balance sheet. That gives us our opportunity to participate in these opportunities. And we hope to bring more information to you in the future on this.","Yigal D. Nochomovitz - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Great. And just one quick question on the guidance. If you net out the KALYDECO guidance revision, it seems that you're raising the non-KALYDECO guidance from $50 million to $65 million to $75 million. Could you just clarify exactly what's going on there? What's driving that?","Stuart A. Arbuckle","So I haven't specifically done that math. But if there is something that's driving the non-KALYDECO, the only thing I would start with the only non-KALYDECO revenue items are collaborative revenues and royalties. And the significant transaction this year that's contributing to that line is the outlicensing of VX-787, the flu molecule, to J&J.","Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz","We appreciate you dialing in tonight. If there are additional questions, the Investors Relations team is in the office and can take your call. Thanks, and have a good night.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Michael Partridge. Sir, you may begin.","Michael Partridge","Thank you. This call was originally scheduled for Monday night and postponed due to the storm. We know there are many listeners who have been directly affected by the storm, and our thoughts are with them as they try to get things back to normal. So thank you to everyone for joining us tonight.","Vertex continued to make progress towards building a global business in the third quarter of 2012. With KALYDECO, our approved medicine for people with cystic fibrosis with the G551D mutation, we achieved sales of $49 million in the quarter. We are now treating the majority of eligible G551D patients in the U.S. We believe that the near-term inflection point for KALYDECO growth is achieving reimbursement across the major European markets.","In cystic fibrosis, our goal is to improve the lives of all patients with CF, and we're making progress toward this goal. We refer to KALYDECO as ivacaftor when discussing investigational uses, and ivacaftor monotherapy has the opportunity to address more patients through ongoing label expansion studies. In particular, we have initiated 3 additional Phase III trials of ivacaftor and together with other ongoing and planned studies could expand the treatable population to approximately 15% of CF patients.","Additionally, on the basis of our recent Phase II VX-809 plus ivacaftor data, we are on track to begin pivotal development of this combination in F508del homozygous patients in early 2013. We believe the success with our ivacaftor label expansion studies and success with the VX-809 plus ivacaftor combination would enable us to address the majority of the 70,000 CF patients in the U.S. and Europe.","With INCIVEK for the treatment of hepatitis C, we reported sales of $254 million in the third quarter. INCIVEK is the leading DAA in the hepatitis C market and continues to be an important medicine for hepatitis C patients. We reiterated our full year net revenue guidance for INCIVEK today.","In hepatitis C, we are advancing our uridine nucleotide analog VX-135, previously referred to as ALS-2200, which we are developing in collaboration with Alios. We are executing on a strategy of developing VX-135 with other promising DAAs in multiple all-oral combinations. We announced agreements this morning with GSK and Janssen to enable us to evaluate VX-135 in multiple 12-week, all-oral combination regimens. Our goal is to complete multiple Phase II short duration, all-oral studies within 2013 and be poised to move quickly to pivotal development in 2014.","Joining me on the call tonight to discuss Vertex's strategic and financial outlook and recent progress in our R&D pipeline are Dr. Jeff Leiden, Chairman and CEO; Ian Smith, CFO; and Dr. Peter Mueller, Head of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer. After the prepared remarks, Stuart Arbuckle, Vertex's recently appointed Chief Commercial Officer; and Dr. Bob Kauffman, Vertex's Chief Medical Officer, will join us for Q&A.","We will conclude tonight's call at 6:00 p.m. To help us do that, we would ask that you please limit your question to one with a related follow-up. I will note that information discussed on this conference call includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in our reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q reports, which have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","These statements, including, without limitation, those regarding the market launch of INCIVEK and KALYDECO, our development plans and expectations, and our guidance are based on management's current assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and events to differ materially.","GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this call. Information regarding our use of these measures and reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP is available in our third quarter 2012 financial press release, which is on our website.","I would also refer you to the information on Slide 5 of tonight's webcast. Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Thanks, Michael. Good evening, everyone. To reiterate what Michael said, our thoughts are with those affected by Hurricane Sandy, including some of you on the phone.","I'd like to acknowledge the many Vertex employees who worked through the storm and who are continuing to work hard, with the goal of making sure the patients who need our medicines can continue to get them.","Tonight, I'd like to frame my remarks around Vertex's strategy and our priorities for today, tomorrow and the future. First, I'll provide a perspective on how we are positioned today in key diseases, and also how we are preparing to further improve treatment of these diseases tomorrow and in the future. I'll put these strategies in the context of our overall financial strategy and operating philosophy and describe how we're managing our business as we move forward into 2013. After that, Ian will review the details of our third quarter financial performance and discuss the activities we are undertaking to ensure that we are prioritizing our investment in the business. Then, Peter will provide you with some specific updates on recent progress in our pipeline and plans for tomorrow and the future and the serious diseases for which we are creating medicines.","I'd like to begin tonight by formally welcoming Stuart Arbuckle, our new Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. Stuart joined us in early September and has hit the ground running, adding valuable insights and strategic direction from his 25 years experience leading global sales and marketing efforts at biopharmaceutical companies. As Michael said, he will join for the Q&A portion of the call.","Let me begin with our approved medicines. We're proud to have 2 best-in-class therapies on the market: KALYDECO for cystic fibrosis and INCIVEK for hepatitis C.","Beginning with CF, KALYDECO for CF patients with the G551D mutation age 6 and older is a transformative medicine that addresses the underlying cause of the disease in these patients. Today, only 9 months after launch, we are treating the majority of the eligible G551D patients within the U.S. and we have just initiated our launch in the EU. Over the next year, we expect significant revenue growth from KALYDECO monotherapy as we launch the product in Europe, Canada and Australia.","But this is just the beginning of our efforts in CF. We've talked several times this year about our strategy in CF and how it is to fundamentally change the outlook for as many people with this disease as possible. First, by expanding the ivacaftor monotherapy label to address more patients who can benefit from this medicine alone. Second, by combining ivacaftor with the corrector compound to address the most common type of CF, which is the Delta F508 homozygous population that makes up about half of those with CF. And third, by further enhancing efficacy of our existing treatment regimens and potentially addressing those people with only 1 copy of the Delta 508 mutation, the heterozygotes, using second-generation correctors and dual corrector regimens. We believe that collectively these efforts could enable us to address up to an estimated 90% of all people with CF.","In the third quarter, we've made significant progress on executing this strategy. We've now initiated 4 studies, 3 of which are pivotal Phase III studies, with ivacaftor monotherapy to significantly expand the CF population that we believe we can address with this medicine alone. If our KALYDECO monotherapy strategy is successful, we could increase the addressable population from the current 4% to perhaps up to approximately 15% of the total CF population. That would bring tomorrow's total population of CF patients in the U.S. and Europe who could benefit from KALYDECO monotherapy to about 10,000.","We are also on track to initiate pivotal development of the corrector compound VX-809 and ivacaftor in Delta 508 homozygous patients in early 2013. We're preparing to meet with the FDA this quarter. Peter will go into more detail on our current pivotal trial plans.","We are also advancing our VX-661, another corrector compound, in a proof-of-concept clinical study with ivacaftor in CF patients who are homozygous for Delta 508. We expect to have results from this study in the first half of 2013. If in addition to being successful with our monotherapy efforts we are successful with our combination development efforts targeting Delta 508 homozygotes, we could potentially increase the number of CF patients we could address up to 60% or more of the CF population. That's an estimated 40,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe.","During the last several months, we've also made progress in identifying second-generation corrector compounds. We have identified second-generation correctors that show significant additive or synergistic activity in vitro when combined with VX-809 plus ivacaftor. We showed some of these results in Orlando a few weeks ago, and we look forward to providing you with more information on these compounds in 2013.","Turning now to hepatitis C. Today, we are leaders with INCIVEK combination therapy. In the 17 months since launch, more than 50,000 people have been treated with an INCIVEK-based regimen in the U.S. and many have been cured or on their way to a cure. Our market position in hepatitis C is strong. INCIVEK has been and remains the leading direct acting antiviral or DAA. Approximately 3\/4 of genotype 1 hepatitis C patients, who initiate therapy with a DAA, receive INCIVEK. Today, there are fewer hepatitis C patients starting treatment as compared to a year ago. Some patients are deferring therapy in anticipation of future treatment regimens. However, there are still many patients that want to be treated or who need to be treated today. For example, during the third quarter, we estimate that approximately 7,000 patients in the U.S. initiated treatment with INCIVEK. Our long-term strategy in hepatitis C is to maintain a significant presence as the treatment of this disease evolves, and we believe we are well positioned to do this with all-oral regimens built around our nucleotide analog VX-135. Our recently reported 7-day viral kinetic data suggests that VX-135 is highly potent and well tolerated. And we're executing on the strategy of evaluating multiple regimens to combine VX-135 with other promising late-stage DAAs. VX-135 has attracted a lot of interest from other companies in the hepatitis C field. I'm pleased that we are able to share with you some of our progress on this front today. Specifically, as Michael mentioned, we have established agreements to conduct all-oral, 12-week combination studies of our once-daily nucleotide with GSK's once-daily NS5A inhibitor, GSK 2336805, also known as GSK 805. In a separate agreement and study, combining VX-135 with the once-daily protease inhibitor, TMC435, being developed by Janssen and Medivir. We expect to initiate these combination studies beginning in early 2013 and to have Phase II data in hand from multiple combinations by the end of 2013. Based on these data, we will plan to pick the best regimens to advance in the pivotal development in 2014.","In addition to cystic fibrosis and HCV, an important part of our R&D strategy has been to continue to bring innovative, potentially transformative drugs forward in other important disease areas. During the third quarter, in addition to CF and HCV, we continued to advance VX-509, VX-787 and several other exciting early-stage programs.","In closing, some remarks on our operating philosophy and how we're managing our business today and in the future. Today, we have significant annual revenues from multiple sources that allow for the reinvestment into a diverse portfolio of discovery and development programs and commercial initiatives, while also creating positive cash flow and earnings. This has enabled us to complete the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion of cash and equivalents, while advancing our pipeline in CF, HCV and autoimmune diseases. We are excited about the product development opportunities we have. But at the same time, we are being disciplined in our investment in the business. As we enter 2013, we have and we will continue to prioritize our R&D projects, investing in those areas that we believe will create long-term value for patients and for Vertex while exercising strict financial discipline on SG&A spending. We remain mindful of our revenues and cash flows and how to most prudently invest these revenues to grow our business.","In summary, we continued to execute on our strategy. Our business is strong with substantial revenues from 2 market medicines, a broad and deep pipeline that has further advanced during the first 3 quarters of 2012, and we have significant cash on our balance sheet. We are well positioned for growth over the long term. I look forward to updating you as we go. With that, let me turn it over to Ian.","Ian F. Smith","Thank you, Jeff, and good evening to everyone.","Financially, Vertex has a diverse revenue base and multiple sources. Our revenue is significant and enables us to fund reinvestment to our pipeline for growth. As we enter 2013, we're committed to maintaining financial discipline. We're mindful of these revenues and cash flows, and we'll prioritize, as Jeff says, our investments as we seek to grow the future opportunities in cystic fibrosis, hepatitis C and other priority pipeline areas.","Now to our third quarter financial results. Total revenues were $336 million compared to $659 million in the same quarter of last year. Last year's revenues included $200 million in onetime milestone revenues due to the approval and launch of INCIVO in Europe. Without this milestone, our revenues were $454 million last year compared to $336 million this year for this quarter. The key components to the third quarter revenues are as follows: the first, we reported $254 million of INCIVEK product revenues. As Jeff noted, INCIVEK remains a market-leading DAA with approximately 7,000 patients initiating treatment with INCIVEK during the third quarter. We continue to see demand for INCIVEK-based therapy and we are reiterating our INCIVEK net revenue guidance of $1.1 billion to $1.25 billion for 2012.","Second, we recorded $49 million of net product revenues for KALYDECO in the third quarter. This reflects the majority of eligible patients in the U.S. starting treatment with KALYDECO, with only a small number of patients initiating therapy in Europe prior to KALYDECO receiving -- achieving reimbursement in that region.","The number of patients in the U.S. has a potential to increase incrementally in the near term as new patients initiate therapy and as the final patients roll off the cyst study and onto commercial drug. We anticipate that in the near term, the most important growth driver for KALYDECO revenue will be in reimbursement acceptance in Europe. We received European approval for KALYDECO in G551D patients in July, and we are making progress negotiating reimbursement country by country. We anticipate that in 2013, each of the 4 major European countries, which account for 80% of the G551D patients in Europe, will provide reimbursement for KALYDECO.","Third, we recorded $26 million of royalty revenues including $20 million of INCIVO royalty revenues  from J&J. We expect our INCIVO royalties will continue to be important to our financial results during 2012 and 2013 and in the future.","The GAAP net loss attributable to Vertex was $58 million in the third quarter of 2012 or approximately $0.27 per share. The non-GAAP net income was $27 million or $0.13 per diluted share. The non-GAAP income principally excludes 2 charges: $27 million in stock compensation and $58 million related to the increase in fair value of expected future payments under our Alios collaboration.","Now to our operating expenses. Beginning in the second quarter, we increased and accelerated our R&D investment on the base of clinical data into our high-priority programs in these areas of cystic fibrosis and hepatitis C. Despite the increased investment in these programs, we are reiterating our non-GAAP operating expense guidance for 2012 of $1.03 billion to $1.13 billion that we originally provided on our February 2 call earlier this year. We accomplished this by prioritizing and reducing expenses, specifically in the areas of reductions in G&A spend, aligning our commercial spend to follow future demand in markets in which we operate and reprioritizing investment in R&D towards key programs. This expense reduction and investment allocation is visible in our third quarter results. Our R&D spent is essentially flat compared to the second quarter despite the progress of our clinical pipeline. And our SG&A spend in the third quarter is significantly reduced compared to the second quarter. As we move into 2013, we plan to continue these initiatives.","In summary, we continue to derive significant revenue and cash flow from INCIVEK sales and INCIVO royalties. KALYDECO is positioned to provide growth in the near term. And with the execution of our hepatitis C and CF strategies, we anticipate expanding our presence on the number of people we can treat over the long term. We are balancing this with our financial position and prioritizing our investments.","I'll now turn it over to Peter.","Peter R. Mueller","Thank you, Ian, and good evening, everybody.","Tonight, my remarks will focus on the progression of our pipeline, mainly in the areas of CF and hepatitis C.","Two weeks ago, we reviewed our R&D strategy in cystic fibrosis at the North American CF Conference in Orlando and I want to briefly summarize and reiterate that strategy. We have demonstrated our commitment to discover new treatments for cystic fibrosis by working closely with the medical community and the CF Foundation for about 14 years now. Through our work, we have developed a proprietary research platform that enables us to uniquely target the underlying cause of that disease, the defective CFTR proteins. From this platform, we developed KALYDECO, an important breakthrough that is available today for G551D patients ages 6 and older.","If you look to how we can further advance therapy in the near future, we have 3 studies underway to expand the label for ivacaftor monotherapy. These studies are: a 6-month Phase III study in patients with the R117H mutation, representing an additional 3% of the population; a crossover Phase III study in patients with non-G551D gating mutations, representing an additional 1% of the population; and a pediatric Phase III study in patients, aged 2 to 5 years, with gating mutations, where we expect to begin enrollment by the end of the year.","We have also initiated a proof-of-concept study in patients with residual CFTR functions. We anticipate receiving the first data from these studies next year. If we are successful with these and other planned studies, we could treat many more patients with ivacaftor alone than we do today, up to approximately 15% of the CF population.","Also, in the relatively near term, we have the potential to expand therapy to the largest group of CF patients, those homozygous for the Delta 508 mutation that make up an additional approximately 50% of the CF population. We presented Phase II results at the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference a few weeks ago.","And on the basis of these positive data, we are planning to initiate a pivotal program of VX-809 plus ivacaftor in the early part of 2013. While details of the pivotal program design will depend on the outcomes of regulatory discussions, we can provide some of what we think the important aspects of the pivotal program will be. Firstly, we will seek to confirm the safety and activity of 600-milligram VX-809 qd in combination with 250 milligram of ivacaftor twice a day in patients homozygous for Delta 508, 12 years of age and older. This was the regimen that demonstrated the greatest improvement in FEV1 compared to the patients' baseline and also to placebo in the Phase II study. Based on our experience with KALYDECO, we anticipate the pivotal study to be anything between 6 and 12 months' duration pending our discussions with the regulatory authorities. We expect that the primary endpoint will be change in FEV1. In fact, we will evaluate a number of other endpoints as well, including weight gain, reduction in pulmonary exacerbations and CFQ-R.","Finally, we may include a higher dose of VX-809 where we've added the 400 milligram BID of VX-809 in an additional cohort of patients called Cohort 3. Safety and PK data from Cohort 3 will inform the potential inclusion of a 400-milligram BID VX-809 dose as part of the pivotal program. Cohort 3 is fully enrolled and we expect to have the data in time for the start of the pivotal program.","The VX-809 and ivacaftor combination represents our first opportunity to create a significant treatment benefit for the most common group of CF patients, the 508 Delta homozygous group. But it is not the only program we have to address this population. We are working on strategies to further optimize therapy for these and additional patients, including Delta 508 heterozygotes.","In this context, we are developing an additional novel corrector compound, VX-661, in combination with ivacaftor in a Phase II study. This study is designed as a dose escalation placebo-controlled study. The design is very different than the Phase II VX-809 study and it is our first trial of VX-661 in patients. Part A of the study which we initiated earlier this year is evaluating different doses of VX-661 alone for 28 days in approximately 50 patients and in combination with ivacaftor for 28 days in an additional 50 patients. The monotherapy doses escalate ahead of the combination doses. All arms are 28 days and each new dose enrolls a completely new set of patients. We will be evaluating safety and efficacy of these ascending doses, and this will inform our next steps with this combination therapy. We expect the results from this study will be available in the first half of 2013.","Beyond VX-809 and VX-661, we are very exciting -- we have very exciting efforts underway to further expand and optimize therapy in CF. We have now identified novel correctors that in vitro have additive or synergistic activity with VX-809 and ivacaftor. This work is based on recent advancements in the understanding of the folding pathway of the CFTR protein. We look forward to updating you on our progress, the second-generation correctors and further combination approaches as we move ahead in 2013.","In summary, in CF, we believe we are well positioned to bring innovation and clinical advancement to this area today, tomorrow and in the future.","Now turning to hepatitis C. We have a range of development activities underway, but I would like to focus my comments on our nucleotide, VX-135. Based on our 7-day viral kinetic study, VX-135 appears to be a highly potent nuke with an excellent early clinical profile. We are excited to present some preclinical and viral kinetic data for this compound at the upcoming AASLD a week from now.","Since receiving the viral kinetic results in July, we have articulated our strategy for how we think we can position VX-135 as an important backbone in future short-duration, all-oral regimens for hepatitis C. Today, we shared our significant progress with that strategy with the announcement of 2 agreements for Phase II combination studies. These collaborations will enable us to evaluate VX-135 in combination with 2 highly promising compounds, each of them representing complementary direct antiviral mechanisms. We intend to move as rapidly as possible. Specifically, we will begin a series of Phase II 12-week studies with VX-135 in combination with these oral DAAs with and without ribavirin. The goal of these studies will be to evaluate safety, decay in SVR in genotype 1 noncirrhotic naive patients. We are planning additional Phase II proof-of-concept studies with VX-135, including a study of VX-135 in combination with ribavirin by the end of 2012 and a study of VX-135 in combination with INCIVEK planned for 2013. We are aiming to identify the best regimens to treat hepatitis C patients, and our goal is to complete Phase II evaluation of multiple regimens in 2013, so that we can choose regimens for pivotal development in 2014.","I will just quickly now -- during the third quarter, we also advanced Phase II development of VX-509 for inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and VX-787 for influenza.","In summary, our efforts in cystic fibrosis reflect a commitment to leverage our R&D expertise, scientific knowledge and capabilities to make a big difference in the lives of thousands of CF patients, and our ongoing efforts in hepatitis C demonstrate our commitment to continued innovation in this area. I look forward to reporting on our progress in these and other areas in upcoming quarters.","I will now turn it back over to Michael.","Michael Partridge","Thank you, Peter. That concludes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with Bernstein Research.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Peter, I just want to follow up on some of the comments about 135 since it seems to be a focus inside and outside of the company. First, it's sort of an obvious question, which is this is a rapidly changing landscape, but can you tell us what sort of differences there are between this molecule and the other nukes that have failed recently and over time? And why should investors ascribe it in real value to this -- at this stage? What gives you the conviction? Secondly, related to 135, conspicuously, you're not mentioning VX-222. Is there any drug-drug interaction thing that you're concerned about there? Why wouldn't you want to combine this with 222 rather than combining it with ribavirin? And then lastly, could you tell us when we'll see the 787 influenza data?","Robert Kauffman","So Geoff, this is Bob Kauffman. I'll take the first question. And yes, we recognize the rapidly changing landscape. We certainly recognize the issues that have occurred with a couple of other nukes in the space in the past few months. All I can say is that VX-135 has a very strong preclinical profile and in our early clinical study really was extremely well tolerated and produced very impressive antiviral activity and therefore, we have very great confidence going in. As we've noted, is a uridine analog, unlike some of the other compounds that have not done so well lately and it just gives us more confidence that we'll have a very good outcome in the next set of studies. Obviously, we recognize the limitations of the data we have. We have only 7-day safety data. Clearly, 12-week data will give us even more confidence, and that's why we're moving as rapidly as we can to obtain those data.","Peter R. Mueller","So Geoff, it's Peter speaking. I think good questions. So I want to just confirm on the one hand and what Bob said about 135, and I think the good thing for 135 is that it has a metabolic profile that allows us to basically combine it with many different molecules. And that leads me to your second question about what is about 222 and other molecules that we have in our portfolio. So obviously, we are currently looking deeply into what the best regimens are and we will have in mind different concepts where 222 is part of it. And we will come later when we prioritize whatever we can do. So 222 is a viable asset, a highly viable asset in our regimen and I think should not be forgotten. So and the last question was, when do we hear something about 661 and I turned it over to you that's a disclosure question -- the flu, the 787, yes.","Robert Kauffman","Yes, topical in flu season. Thanks, Geoff. So as we have communicated earlier in the year, we anticipate giving you top line results from that study before the end of this year and we're still on track for that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn with Bank of America.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two totally separate questions. One, just -- congratulations on the collaboration for 135, but I'm just wondering why you would bother running the INCIVEK combination study. Is that really just for safety, or is there really a point since you have this partnership now with a low-dose once-a-day protease inhibitor with a very well-established safety profile? And then secondly, Ian, I think you've talked a number of times of not wanting to be cash flow negative in 2013 or 2014. But at the same time, you're talking about putting more money into R&D from SG&A. So I'm just wondering how you can manage that? Can we be sure that R&D overall will be down annually in 2013 versus 2012?","Robert Kauffman","Rachel, given there's a number of questions given the collaboration comment, we appreciate your thanks on the collaboration. Jeff is going to take the first piece, and then I'll take the financial question.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Hi, Rachel, it's Jeff. The first question really had to do with how we're thinking about prioritizing these different regimens. And I know you're familiar with this, but let me just take a step back and briefly rearticulate the strategy that we talked about in July, which was, we do feel that VX-135 has a profile as a nuc that makes it potentially a very valuable piece of multiple combination regimens. We also feel that it may be the case that there will be several regimens. One, optimal regimen, for example, for easy-to-treat patients and a separate one or separate duration for longer-to-treat patients. So our strategy was to combine 135, both with different combinations of our own medicines, 222, INCIVEK, et cetera, but also to be open to collaborations with others. And obviously, you've heard today about how we're executing on that strategy. If you look at where we are today, we feel really good about what have in hand, right, because we have now a very potent and tolerable members of each of the major classes that we think are going to be important; nucs, non-nucs, PIs and 58s. And so we're in a very nice position to begin to combine them in different combinations and learn pretty quickly in 12-week studies what the best or winning combinations are going to be. We're obviously in the process right now of prioritizing those studies. So we've told you that we're going to do VX-135 plus ribavirin. We certainly are going to do VX-135 plus 435, as well as the GSK 5A. And then we're trying to understand where INCIVEK and 222 are really going to fit into that, and we'll be able to give you a lot more details as we move forward. But the strategy remains the same. We're going to test multiple combinations, find the best ones for patients in 2013 so that we're in a position to pick those and move into pivotal studies in 2014. And I'm just really pleased now that we have all the pieces in hand to do that.","Robert Kauffman","And, Rachel, to answer your question about financial profile in '13. I'm hoping that you did hear the comments that Jeff made in his prepared remarks and then also echoed by my own. You can see with just the results we've disclosed in the third quarter that we're working very hard towards prioritizing our R&D investment. As you can see that the R&D investment remains consistent with how we guided in the beginning of the year, and then also from Q2 to Q3, despite the increased investments in CF and HCV. So you can see that we're reprioritizing throughout our portfolio there, and we'll continue that effort into 2013 for the high-value programs. On the SG&A side, again, we can continue probably more dramatically if you see the reduction in SG&A spend between Q2 and Q3. Again, that's active management of SG&A. We're following where the demand is in the markets. We're looking at programs, looking at our infrastructure and we've made decisions there as well. So we're working very hard. These efforts will continue into 2013 and I'll just close by -- we are in our planning process. We're taking a look at what we believe our revenues may be for '13, 2013. Both the growth on KALYDECO side and what the potential is there, and specifically look into how we think we may go into Europe and penetrate that patient population for KALYDECO. And then on INCIVEK, acknowledging that INCIVEK, it is a challenge. We acknowledge that. And so we're taking those revenues and being mindful of our cash flows for reinvestment, and we'll give you more of an update specifically as we go into 2013 with our call early on in that year. But we're in the middle of that process. But I hope you can hear the themes that are coming through strongly on this call.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But you still agree cash flow neutral or positive next year?","Robert Kauffman","As I said, we're going through our planning process because we need to understand what our revenues will be at this point in time and as we go to '13, we'll provide more specific direction for our business at that time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gloria Woo with Citi.","Gloria Woo","I have a question on CF and then one on your HCV. I want to know how quickly you anticipate countries in the EU picking up KALYDECO and whether you actually need formal NICE for that group, reimbursement for the U.K. and how many patients you think that in the U.K. and Scotland? And then moving on to HCV, could you just give us an idea of GSK's NS5A inhibitor and the potency? You mentioned it's going to be once-a-day pill, but can you give us a little bit more information out of the resistance profile, and how much data there is on that drug already? Just based on [indiscernible].","Robert Kauffman","I'm sorry, Gloria, but with your questions, I'm not sure whether you're in the office or maybe you're out, given weather conditions this week, but your question really didn't come through very clearly. I'm not sure whether you can pick up the phone or whether there's something else, but it really didn't come through very clearly. If you could try repeating it and we'll try our best answer it.","Gloria Woo","Sure, I'll try again. Sorry, we're out of the office right now. Just first on KALYDECO, just as you would need a formal NICE reimbursement in the U.K. before you can have [indiscernible] use in Scotland and the U.K. and how many patients you think are in the U.K. and Scotland? And for HCV, can you give us some information on GSK's NS5A inhibitor? The potency, the resistance profile and any safety data that maybe in animals and humans? Did that come through?","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Yes, it did. Maybe we'll just start with the HCV question, with the GSK's NS5A inhibitor and maybe Bob can give you a quick profile of that compound. I would also offer that following the call, Michael Partridge can send you a package on that. And so therefore, you will have specific details of what's been disclosed on that compound at previous medical conferences. But maybe Bob can give you a top line at this moment.","Robert Kauffman","So this is a very -- we believe it's a very promising NS5A inhibitor. It's been evaluated in short-term viral kinetic studies, single-dose studies, and shows approximately a 3 log drop at the dose that's been chosen for further development, which is 60 milligrams. That 3 log drop is really comparable to the other NS5A inhibitors that are in development now, including one from BMS and one from Gilead. It is a once-a-day medication, a once-a-day pill. And in terms of its other profile, it has a very good preclinical profile and its resistance profile has not been fully discussed there in the midst of a 12-week study with -- in combination with peg and riba at the present time. It looks as though it has a resistance profile which is similar to the other NS5A inhibitors that are in development, but really, it has very good properties and we're really looking forward to the combination studies that we're about to start.","Robert Kauffman","Then to the question on KALYDECO. Welcoming Stuart Arbuckle, our newly-appointed Chief Commercial Officer.","Stuart A. Arbuckle","This is Stuart Arbuckle. So just addressing your questions on KALYDECO reimbursement in the U.K. As an open drug, it doesn't actually currently go through NICE but it is going through an official reimbursement process in England, Scotland and the other countries in the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland. We are in the middle of that process. It's going well, it's difficult to predict, though, exactly when that process will conclude. And in terms of patient numbers across Europe, we think there's about the same number of G551D patients in Europe as there are in the United States, but approximately half of them are in the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I've got a couple on the CF combo. You guys mentioned you're meeting with FDA this quarter. I guess I appreciate the urgency on starting the Phase III. But first question is, should we read into this that you guys ultimately expect 661 to look less robust? In other words, why wouldn't you at least wait for that data? And the second question is, is the 800-milligram, 809 does look stronger than 400 or 600, do you think you go right into Phase III or do you think another FDA meeting to tweak your protocol would be required? And I have one follow-up.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Thanks, Geoff. Peter will take that question.","Peter R. Mueller","Geoff, it's Peter speaking. I think I'll start with the second question first about that is the BID 400-milligram question. Do we need to do another study to go in Phase III or go directly into Phase III. So the answer is, we have enough data in our Phase I and II packages gathered to basically do molecular modeling that gives you an insight about how you might conduct a Phase III study in different dose regimens. One is upwards like the 600-milligram that we have to confirm that is sort of standard approach, you know you have to confirm the data and what you have to have in Phase II. And the other one is go with a higher dose. And I think the twice 400 is, from a modeling point, what it is. That's the reason why we also do Cohort 3 to confirm that we have a chance to go with a higher dose in that study. We do not need -- at this given point in time, it is our strong belief, another study to add a higher dose of VX-809 into our Phase III regimen. Now the question will be, with the agency, what the right dose is and what the higher dose is. It might not necessarily be twice 400, it could be something else, but that is the reason why we did the study. So I think the answer is, no, we go directly into pivotal trials with 600-milligram as the confirmatory arm of it, and then there's another higher dose and that might be twice 400 or might be something else. So that's the first question. So the second question is, why do we not wait for 661 data in all these type of things? I think we have basically concluded a Phase II study, and we go as fast as we can with the regimen for the patient population that responded well over the finish line. And so, if you would wait with 661, you would delay basically substantially the entire development and the outcome. And we have a commitment to basically reach out to those patients as fast as we can. This is our commitment as a company, and I think the 809-770 combination is a very viable regimen that really will have big impact in a big population, and I think we want to not slow down by 2 years, waiting for 661.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then a follow-up, just a quick one on the dual corrector strategy. Is the assumption that you guys would include 809 and KALYDECO as part of the combo? I guess I want to get a better sense for why do you think 2 new agents that are correctors may be needed or if it is sort of an add-on to 809 KALYDECO? And what have you seen thus far in some of your preclinical work?","Peter R. Mueller","So there's 2 questions. What we have seen so far is basically addition of a second-generation corrector to our existing correctors and KALYDECO. And so, there's an 809 ivacaftor or KALYDECO-type of regimen as a base, and you add in new correctors, and when you add in one of these, you basically get nice synergistic efforts. There is also what we have seen, the combination of 2 new ones that will bring you to very high levels of CFTR expression, which is I think a good one. And at the end of the day, it will probably be a mix-and-match out of different type of things. That you have in one case, maybe 770 and 809 and 1 of those correctors, in other cases, maybe the 2 correctors. And that is driven by the patient population that segregate in the CF world. Because you have heterozygotes, homozygotes, you have pancreatic insufficient ones and that might respond differently to different regimens. So it is basically not a one-size-fits-all solution, it is a patient tale of personalized medicine approach to treat those populations the best we can.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","This is Omar filling in for Mark. I had a couple of questions, both on CF. Number one, on disclosure plans, so should we expect a press release with FEV1 data after Part A of 661 trial finishing? And also, when the third cohort in the 809 combination trial for the 400-milligram BID dose finishes, should we expect FEV1 data in a press release for that? And secondly, are there any plans for an extension phase of the 400-mg BID arm, beyond the 2 months?","Robert Kauffman","Thanks, Omar. I'll take the disclosure questions and then maybe Peter can take whether there's a plan for any extension. I'm first going to go to the 400 BID, and I appreciate you asking the question, there's been a number of questions regarding disclosure of this data. I refer you back to Peter's commentary just a moment ago, which is the purpose of that study, which effectively is to support the data we'd already gathered from Phase I and Phase II with our combination therapy and into PK\/PD modeling exercise and that data in Cohort 3 will supplement the data we've already collected. I think the key for us is that the Phase III study design, which we'll be shortly discussing with the regulatory authorities, and when we have a better understanding of what that protocol and design is and all the various ARMs and the duration of that study, we'll provide you a disclosure around the design for the Phase III. And at that point in time, in disclosing the Phase III data, we'll give you a basis for that protocol design. So that's the answer for the Cohort 3. And I'd just point out that it is only 15 patients and it is not powered to measure FEV. As far as VX-661 is concerned, that's in a combination study at this point. Bob described -- sorry, Peter described that study in his prepared remarks. It is a dose escalating study. Monotherapy, which goes to combination therapy, and then escalating doses. We are in the process of running that study and it will run into 2013. And at the point that we have completed the whole study, so it will be final data. We'll provide you with top line press release and that would include FEV, but it's effectively a safety and efficacy top line press release, and that will be in the first half of 2013. And as to your third question, I'm going to turn it back to Peter. That was regarding the extension.","Peter R. Mueller","Yes. And with respect to the extension for the twice 400-mg BID, we have no intention to basically have an extension for that particular small population at this given point in time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","On your plan to start combination studies with 135, with the new GSK and the J&J compounds, what data do you actually need to have or present to FDA or anything to actually start dosing patients? What actually goes on in that discussion? And related to that, I noticed that you said you actually need to have a drug-drug interaction with the J&J drug, but that wasn't really matching with the GSK drug. So I'm just trying to understand what logistically do you need to do to actually start dosing patients and what are the steps?","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Maybe Bob will take the first question. Peter can talk about the J&J compound.","Robert Kauffman","So in terms of going forward, we have an open IND in the U.S. and so it is a matter of submitting a protocol to the FDA for the review, and oftentimes, comments may come either in writing or on a brief telecon. But we have already had some discussions with them regarding our ribavirin study and the telaprevir study, and we certainly understand what's required in order to move forward, and we're planning on doing that with the ribavirin study, which will be starting imminently. The process is really very much the same with the other 2 compounds. Both are under review with the FDA. Their IND is obviously for both other compounds, and so it's a rather straightforward pattern to just get the FDA to cross-reference the INDs, review the data and then have a discussion about the protocol. Nothing complicated.","Peter R. Mueller","So what is going on? Maybe I'd just say, I think there is absolutely fair discussion going on in the FDA, and it is a compound-by-compound discussion and it's not a one-size-fits-all type of approach. I think you have to provide data and then basically you get, treated dependent on your data, and not necessarily dependent on other people's data. So I want to just say that. And then, that goes with the DDI study. So I think every compound has a different metabolism and dependent on what the metabolism is and what the potential interaction could be in combination of 2 compounds, you might consider or not to do a DDI study. And there is a difference between PIs and NS5As in general about how they get metabolized, and so there's not the same size and the same type of approach for each and every compound. And that's the reason why we basically opted for the Janssen compound, the TMC435, to do a DDI study up front to get the better doses.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Liisa Bayko with JMP Securities.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","I wanted to change topics to your influenza program. And I'm just looking at ClinicalTrials.gov and it says that you're going to inoculate healthy adult volunteers. First question is, who actually would enroll in the study? And number two, actually, the more important question is, what data are you looking for to really get excited about the program? And what's the hurdle for going -- to taking this program forward?","Robert Kauffman","This is Bob. People volunteer for studies, is all I can say. Obviously, there's some remuneration that goes on for these volunteers. But it's just the way things work.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","That was kind of a joke question. You don't really have to answer it. I just can't believe it. But I really was more interested in sort of like the -- when we think about the endpoints of what you're looking at and what is really going to be compelling to take the program forward?","Robert Kauffman","So what we look for is obviously, we're looking for evidence of antiviral activity and that's really measured by viral shedding and nasal secretions, and that can be measured either by looking for a live virus or by various PCR technologies. So we're looking, first of all, for antiviral activity, we're obviously looking for the safety of the compound and we're also looking for a change in reduction of symptomatology. This is an attenuated strain of influenza, the subjects don't get that sick. But we do -- we are able to measure shortening of the clinical illness. And so it's really a combination of antiviral and clinical symptomatology measures that are the way one describes efficacy in these kinds of studies and that's really what we're looking for.","Peter R. Mueller","Liisa, I just want to add one thing to the enrollment because it might have sort of questions whether people want to get sort of infected. There is a flu camp in the U.K. that's called Flu Camp, and we are basically having the study completely enrolled at those, okay? So I think that would be a basically sort of currently in the data collecting phase. And that's reason why we basically hope by end of year be happy enough that we can sort of analyze and then tell you said sort of really next year what it is.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","And can you get a little bit more specific? Like, quantitatively, what kind of threshold antiviral effect? Like how it will be measured and what levels you are going to be looking for? What range would be sufficient to move forward? And the same thing, I don't know if there's a way to talk about symptomatology or shedding, nasal shedding, et cetera?","Robert Kauffman","I mean, the purpose of this study, really, first of all, is to look at the safety of the compound. It's our first real longer duration trial, and so we're looking for safety. We're also looking for dose response, because one of the goals of this trial is to help narrow down the dose range when we would ultimately conduct a study in natural influenza. And I would say that given that it's attenuated, given the characteristics of the way these studies are run, that's really kind of what we're looking for is a dose response. We're looking for as complete and antiviral response as we can get, and then we go on and do further trials.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.","Alethia Young - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Alethia in for Robin. Just a quick question on your guidance for INCIVEK seems to imply kind of a wide range of outcomes in Q4. I was just wondering if you could give us some color in what you're seeing around trends in Q4 in the hep C market in a little bit more detail?","Robert Kauffman","I'll just, first of all, reiterate our guidance and why we're reiterating guidance, which is at this point through the year we've recorded net revenues for INCIVEK of around $940 million, and our guidance that we're updating tonight are -- reiterating tonight is $1.1 billion to $1.25 billion. And so when we see the current demand of our products, we are also heading into November now, but we're very comfortable in reiterating that guidance and we'll be providing more information on trends as we go in 2013. Obviously, we're watching it closely because it impacts how we think about our business for 2013.","Alethia Young - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And also on the TMC435 trial, is that a U.S. trial or a global trial?","Robert Kauffman","It's likely that sites in the U.S., a substantial number of sites in the U.S. will be involved in that trial. The planning is still ongoing with Janssen who are going to be running that study.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo Securities.","Brian Corey Abrahams - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","With respect to the ongoing 661 study, I'm just wondering, what are you looking for to conclude dose escalation? Is that going to be driven more by safety or by efficacy? And should we take the official narrowing of guidance results to come in the first half next year to mean that you're at or near doses that you're expecting will have activity or at least exposure similar to 600 mgs of VX-809?","Jeffrey M. Leiden","I'll take the first part of that in terms of guidance and disclosure, Brian. Frankly, I don't know whether there's a narrowing of guidance, we  anticipate the data coming in the first half of 661 as I commented earlier. It is a dose escalation study. Maybe I'll turn it over to Bob in terms of what we're looking at as we go up in each of the doses. So, Bob, can you?","Robert Kauffman","Yes. I mean, normally, we're looking for a dose response for the endpoints that we're looking at, which includes sweat chloride and other measures. And the hope is that we can define the large part of the dose response curve so that we can pick doses for the next set of studies. And that's really -- that's what we do.","Peter R. Mueller","I think the interesting piece here is that 661 has a different biodistribution, and so you cannot basically collect data from 809 and basically sort of refer to it. So you have to do your own study. Chances are here that you can come with substantially lower doses, and that's basically what we are trying to do to have basically a low [indiscernible] burden, a low dose burden and that allows us to do better combination studies in the future, with many different second-generation correctors or KALYDECO or anything in the mix.","Brian Corey Abrahams - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just of quick follow-up. Following the Phase II  studies for the VX-135 combo, just wondering, forwardly speaking, what types of options you might envision would your preference be to pursue further studies with those compounds? Perhaps bring in other assets within the same classes? Where do you sort of foresee the next steps fast forwarding beyond next year?","Jeffrey M. Leiden","This is Jeff. Let me answer it at a high level, and then Peter and Bob can add additional color. So as I've said before, we're really pleased with where we are today because we now have high potency and competitive assets in each of the major classes. So obviously our nuc, which you've seen the data on TMC, which you've also seen a lot of data on in the protease inhibitor class, we feel is an excellent next-generation protease inhibitor. 222, our non-nuc, which also is highly potent, you've seen some already [indiscernible]. And then the GSK NS5A, which as you know, look like they're going to be important components of regimens and it's a once-a-day highly potent NS5A that's already been in humans and shown very nice viral log drops. And so, I think we have the pieces in hand. But the question now is which regimens for which patients? We're going to try some 2 drug regimens, particularly for easy-to-treat patients. We may try some 3 drug regimens. But our strategy is to collect that data next year and based on the data, pick regimens to go forward with the pivotal trials in 2014. Now each of the collaborations we sign today are nonexclusive, and so we do have the opportunity as we go forward, if we see a compounds that would add benefits to patients to do additional collaborations. But we're pretty pleased with where we are today in terms of having all the pieces in hand to begin with these studies.","Operator","Our next question comes Matt Roden with UBS.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I wanted to get into the KALYDECO commercial trends a little bit. The experts tell us that KALYDECO is well penetrated with big academic centers. But just trying to get a sense of where we are on a broader basis, so we can understand what the -- where we are with the eligible segments that is not yet penetrated. What it will take and over what time frame do you expect a cashable station [ph]? I heard you mention at the top of the call that majority of those eligible in the U.S. are being treated, but can you actually give us more specific in terms of where we are in penetration into that market? How do you expect to convert those patients?","Stuart A. Arbuckle","This is Stuart. I'll take that. So yes, you heard correctly, the vast majority of patients in the U.S. who are eligible are already taking the product. And so, in the U.S., while we're expecting a handful more of products to be added into the mix, we really are at the vast majority of patients right now and we're very pleased with that. As Jeff said, the uptick of KALYDECO has been astonishingly quick. In my experience, it's been an incredibly impressive launch and really reflects what a great breakthrough medicine KALYDECO is. And again, as Jeff said, in the future, we're expecting the major infection for KALYDECO in 2013 to come from uptick in the EU.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you comment on the gross to net? Was there any change this quarter? Just trying to get a sense of whether or not -- I mean, is $50 million really the -- can you formulate what the current level you have right now in the U.S?","Jeffrey M. Leiden","I'll take that question. The gross to net -- or the discount has slightly increased through the year. As we launched it with -- it tended to be around 8% to 9%. And right now as we enter the fourth quarter, it's around 9% to 10%. That's really just a reflection of the patients that we're treating, and we'd anticipate that the continue into the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was just wondering if you can tell us on the KALYDECO 661 Phase II trial, if there is an interim analysis? I understand you guys are going to release final data to us, but is there an interim analysis built into that trial? And then the second question is, thinking about the disconnect between, I guess, FEV and sweat chloride. Seeing the KALYDECO 809 trial, is there a rationale to think that you'd see a similar disconnect in the KALYDECO 661 trial?","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Terence, I'll take the disclosure question. We'd like to complete the study. VX-661 in combination with KALYDECO, that means going through the monotherapy and then the combination period with each of the escalating doses. We'd like to complete all of those ascending doses, and at that point, with final and complete data, we'll provide a top line press release. And that's why we're guiding to the first half of 2013 in terms of a top line release.","Peter R. Mueller","So the second question that you had, this is Peter speaking, is about, do we anticipate a similar disconnect between sweat chloride and FEV? The answer is I don't know. Because that's why we are doing the study. And we will see at the end of the day what the relationship is, because they have very different molecules here that penetrate differently into the body and into the tissues. So I can't really answer that at this given point in time, that's one of the reasons why we're doing the study.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","Operator, we're now 5 minutes past 6. We have time for 2 more questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Barclays.","Ying Huang - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So can you elaborate a little more on the decision to collaborate on VX-135 with GSK's NS5A inhibitor? We know that there's a scarcity of other nucs in development, that's why VX-135 is very precious. But there's no shortage of NS5A in development right now. So what attracts you guys in terms of the GSK's NS5A program compares to, let's say, a more advanced drug like Bristol's daclatasvir? And then second question is, do you guys think between your internal studies, for example, combination with INCIVEK and ribavirin, and then the TMC435 and then the GSK studies, you will have sufficient database in terms of safety to move on to a pivotal study in 2014?","Robert Kauffman","So the first is about our excitement about the Glaxo 5A inhibitor. I must say, what I have seen from a preclinical package, it's really impressive. What I have seen in the clinic, it's really impressive. And the log drop is basically in the range that all the other 5As have. Interesting piece though is the metabolic profile that allows it to really be easily combined with our own molecules, which is a key criteria when you basically do combination regimens. And so, I'm really excited about that molecule. And I think it is far enough advanced and it is a once-a-day. That is the other piece. It offers the opportunity at the end of the day to come out with a once-a-day regimen. And given the 60-milligram dose that you basically have seen in the regimen, what it also allows this and that's why I'm really excited about it. To do coformulation studies and have maybe a once-a-day pill with whatever regimen that we have at the end of the day in mind. This is really fantastic. And so this is the excitement about this. And the other question was about, do we have enough data by doing all those Phase II studies to enter into Phase III in 2014? And the answer is absolutely yes because we will have a pooling concept from a safety point of view with everybody that has received 135, and then for the regimen that we pick, we have enough data to move forward in 2014 from an efficacy point of view.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","And our last question, please.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of David Friedman of Morgan Stanley.","David Friedman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just 2 quick questions. The first is, in the ivacaftor, the minimal moderate CFTR residual function, how are you defining residual exocrine pancreatic function? And then just the second quickly is, do you have a sense as to how well efficacy in an experimental flu model correlates with the efficacy in a real sort of real life flu situation?","Jeffrey M. Leiden","So for the second question, yes, it's an artificial system, and the goal is really to get some preliminary read on antiviral activity and more importantly, to narrow the dose range. One can get a sense of the dose range to be studied in subsequent natural influenza, and that really is the goal of the study.","Robert Kauffman","I can add maybe one thing to that. That is maybe a different for 787 compared to Tamiflu. We have also a possibility to study viral clearance because that's a mechanism that actually, I think, that Tamiflu doesn't provide. And so we will also look into that. Bu that is basically the time factor to it. We do know with the challenge study what day you have infected and you can basically go backwards and say, what is the clearance after 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, which is really important thing to basically add value to the molecule. So that's the other piece that we have sort of look into.","Jeffrey M. Leiden","In terms of the ivacaftor question, it's really primarily based on functional results. Those people who are dependent on pancreatic enzyme replacement are considered to be pancreatic insufficient, and those who can manage without them are generally pancreatic sufficient. And that's how we define it.","Okay. Thanks, everybody, for joining us tonight. We are in our offices. If you didn't get ask a question or if you have a further follow-up, and I would add that we look forward to seeing many of you at the EASL League Conference, which starts in Boston at the end of next week. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect.

This is Michael Partridge, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for Vertex. Tonight, we will review our financial results, our continued progress to develop new medicines for all people with cystic fibrosis and recent advances in our research and development pipeline.","Dr. Jeff Leiden, Chairman and CEO; and Ian Smith, Chief Operating Officer, will provide prepared remarks this evening. Stuart Arbuckle, Chief Commercial Officer; and Dr. Reshma Kewalramani, Chief Medical Officer, will join us for Q&A. We recommend that you access the webcast slides on our website as you listen to this call. This conference call is being recorded. A replay will be available on our website.","We will make forward-looking statements on this call that are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in today's press release and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These statements including, without limitation, those regarding Vertex's marketed CF medicines, the ongoing development and potential commercialization of our triple-combination regimen for cystic fibrosis, Vertex's other programs and Vertex's future financial performance are based on management's current assumptions. Actual outcomes and events could differ materially.","I will now turn the call over to Dr. Jeff Leiden.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Michael. Good evening everyone. I'm pleased to say that, we have made tremendous progress across our business in 2018 and are well on track to achieve the key goals that we outlined to start this year.","In CF, approximately half of all patients are now eligible for a Vertex CF medicine and we're progressing rapidly toward the development of a single medicine to treat any CF patient with one or more F508del mutations, approximately 90% of all people with the disease.","In our development pipeline, we have initiated the first clinical study of CTX001 in beta thalassemia with our partner CRISPR Therapeutics and are progressing VX-150 for the treatment of pain. And in research, we're preparing to advance the first of our potential medicines for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency into clinical development by year-end and to move other molecules into development in 2019.","First, to our recent progress in cystic fibrosis. CF is a progressive multi organ disease with its presence from birth and a key part of our strategy is to treat patients as early as possible to slow or prevent the progression of disease. To that end, we gained important approvals throughout 2018 that now allow us to treat eligible children as young as one year of age with KALYDECO and as young as two years of age with ORKAMBI.","With SYMDEKO demand continues to be strong following the U.S. approval in February. The launch of this medicine in the U.S. has been a significant driver of revenue growth in 2018 as new patients initiate treatment and we also plan to submit a supplemental new drug application to the FDA later this year to gain approval in eligible patients as young as six years of age. In Europe, we anticipate approval of this medicine before the end of this year, which will further increase the number of patients eligible to be treated with the medicine for the underlying cause of their disease.","We've also reached multiple important reimbursement agreements across the world, to provide access to ORKAMBI, enabling patients in many countries to treat the underlying cause of the disease for the first time. Many of these agreements, including those recently signed in Denmark and Australia, also provide a pathway to access and rapid reimbursement for certain future CF medicines. Importantly, these portfolio agreements provide certainty to patients that they will have immediate access to future innovations in CF from Vertex. We remain in discussions regarding this type of agreement in other countries, but have yet to reimburse ORKAMBI.","We're also rapidly progressing our two Phase 3 programs, evaluating two different triple combination regimens that include a next-generation corrector either VX-659 or VX-445. In September, we completed enrollment of the two Phase 3 studies for the VX-659 triple combination regimen and expect data from these studies in late 2018. We expect to complete enrollment for the VX-445 Phase 3 studies this quarter and to report data from these studies in the first quarter of 2019.","We will evaluate data from both programs with the goal of choosing the best regimen to submit for regulatory approval. We remain on track to submit a new drug application for a triple combination regimen no later than mid-2019. In parallel, we've also recently initiated studies of both of our triple combination regimens in patients ages 6 to 11 years of age with the goal of gaining approval for this group of children as quickly as possible.","We also continue to innovate in CF to develop even better regimens for the future, including potential once-daily triple combination regimens with our potentiator VX-561 and regimens to contain other next-generation correctors that may have enhanced profiles. We expect to advance one or more of these novel next-generation correctors into early clinical development in the coming months.","Beyond CF, our research strategy is well-defined and focused on the development of transformational medicines for serious specialty diseases with large unmet medical need. And we're advancing a portfolio of such potential new medicines into the clinic. The diseases we are targeting all have well understood biology where we can use or create early clinical markers that support the potential for transformative benefit and rapid development timelines.","We are establishing proprietary scientific insights into a number of these diseases just as we did in CF and CFTR and we are bringing significant resources to bear to both advance our development stage assets and also to bring other potential new medicines from research into early clinical studies.","With our partner CRISPR Therapeutics, we're advancing CTX001 as the first gene-editing treatment for both sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia using the CRISPR\/Cas9 technology. This is a cutting-edge transformational technology that holds great promise in the treatment of many diseases and we're pleased with the rapid progress we are making together with CRISPR toward dosing the first patient with the CRISPR\/Cas9 gene-editing therapy.","Our pain program is another example of Vertex's innovative science translating to the clinic where Phase 2 data generated to date for VX-150 provided the first clinical validation for the sodium channel 1.8 mechanism in the treatment of acute and chronic pain.","We expect that Phase 2 results for VX-150 in the third type of pain, neuropathic pain, in early 2019. We now also plan to initiate a Phase 2b dose-ranging study of VX-150 in acute pain following bunionectomy surgery that has the potential to support future pivotal development of this medicine in acute pain.","Acute pain represents a multibillion-dollar opportunity where many of the conditions that lead to acute pain are treated by physicians that can be reached with a specialty sales force. Given the significant need for highly efficacious pain medicines that do not have the addiction, tolerability, and abuse issues associated with opioids, acute pain is an opportunity that is well-suited to inhibitors of the NaV1.8 sodium channel and we're also continuing to invest in the discovery of other potential pain molecules including additional NaV1.8 inhibitors as well as medicines targeting other new mechanisms.","We're also advancing a portfolio of small molecule correctors for the treatment of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency or AAT and I'm pleased to report that we expect to move the first of these compounds into clinical development later this year. There are many similarities between AAT and CF both in the biology of the disease and how we may target its cause and in the potential to establish early clinical proof-of-concept and rapid development pathways for new AAT medicines.","Like CF, AAT is a protein folding disorder caused by mutations in a single gene where more than 90% of patients have one common mutation that results in life shortening systemic complications primarily in the lung and also in the liver. We believe our scientific expertise in CFTR protein folding coupled with our development experience position us well to rapidly advance our novel small molecule approach to the treatment of AAT.","I look forward to updating you on this program as we enter development later this year and to providing additional insight into our research programs, including those in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and others as they progress in 2019.","As we move our internal R&D pipeline forward, we're also continuously evaluating external opportunities, where our research and business development strategies are fully aligned. With our strong financial profile, we have increased ability to in-license or acquire assets or establish scientific collaborations that provide access to unique product opportunities and technology platforms.","We've completed a number of such transactions in recent years and we have expanded our internal team devoted to finding and evaluating potential opportunities for scientific innovation with the goal of further broadening our pipeline and scientific expertise in the future. We believe that it is the combination of our R&D strategy with our business model that truly differentiates Vertex as a biotechnology company with the potential for highly profitable long-term growth based on a portfolio of transformative medicines for multiple serious diseases.","This year has been marked by significant progress across research and development and in our efforts to bring our CF medicines to more patients globally, which has led to significant growth in our revenues and earnings, which Ian will now discuss in more detail.","Ian F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff, and good evening to everyone. I'm pleased to review with you our third quarter 2018 financial results and to discuss our outlook for future financial growth as we approach 2019.","Revenues first. Total CF product revenues of $783 million in the third quarter of 2018 represent a 42% increase compared to the $550 million we recorded in the third quarter 2017. We continue to see significant revenue growth as we increase the number of patients treated with our medicines globally.","The third quarter included $255 million in revenues from the launch of SYMDEKO in the U.S., which is the primary driver of the rapid growth in our total CF revenues. Demand for SYMDEKO remains strong and we continue to receive positive feedback from patients and physicians and strong coverage for SYMDEKO across both public and private payers.","Similar to prior quarters, demand for SYMDEKO has come from all groups of eligible patients, F508del homozygous patients initiating treatment for the first time, patients who discontinued ORKAMBI coming back to initiate therapy with SYMDEKO, and also patients switching from ORKAMBI to SYMDEKO.","Our third quarter 2018 non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were $379 million compared to $334 million in the third quarter of 2017. This increase was primarily due to the advancement of our portfolio of triple combination regimens for CF and the investment to support the treatment of patients with our medicines globally.","Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2018 was $282 million, with an earnings per share of $1.09, compared to non-GAAP net income of $136 million, with an earnings per share of $0.53 for the third quarter of 2017. Our non-GAAP net income and EPS has more than doubled compared to last year, largely driven by strong growth in the total CF product revenues.","We ended the quarter with approximately $3.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities compared to $2.1 billion at the beginning of this year.","Today, we also reiterated our guidance for total CF product revenues of $2.9 billion to $3 billion and for combined non-GAAP, R&D, and SG&A expenses of $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion.","I will close with a few comments on our expectations for future financial growth and how we anticipate providing revenue guidance next year as well as how we may start to record non-cash tax charges. We have already created a strong financial profile for our business, and we anticipate that our revenues will continue to grow next year.","In 2019, revenue growth will be based largely on the impact of SYMDEKO and SYMKEVI launches, the impact of labor expenses across our CF portfolio, and the recent completion of multiple reimbursement agreements. The timing of further revenue growth from countries where we do not currently have reimbursement for ORKAMBI is unpredictable. Therefore, when we provide 2019 guidance for total CF revenues early next year, it will be based only on the geographies where we have established reimbursement agreements at that date. If we gain additional reimbursement agreements in 2019, we will update you on our guidance as appropriate. This is consistent with how we provided guidance at the beginning of 2018.","Beyond 2019, continued revenue growth will be driven largely by the potential approval and launch of a triple combination medicine for the large group of patients with one minimal function mutation and one F508del mutation who are not eligible for our currently approved medicines.","Now to taxes, I'll note that in 2019 we may begin recording a non-cash tax provision at an effective tax rate in the low to mid-20s as a result of the improving profitability of our business and our future strong financial outlook. The vast majority of our tax provision would be a non-cash expense until we fully utilize our net operating losses. This will be further discussed in our 10-Q filing.","The financial profile of our business is strong, and the coming year will be an important period to define our future growth as we obtain Phase 3 data from our triple combination regimens for CF, provide access to each of our CF medicines to more patients globally, progress multiple new medicines in development, and also to advance new approaches for the treatment of serious diseases from research into development. I look forward to updating you on our progress.","With that, I will open the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question is from Phil Nadeau from Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the progress. Just two questions for me, one on completion and one on the financial guidance or financial comments that you just made. Ian, in your comments, you talked about 2019 sources of revenue growth. Can you specifically talk about the revenue growth outside the U.S., which I know you said was unpredictable, but which countries could be drivers of growth where you recently got expansions? Which ones are possible for next year and which ones are total wild cards?","Ian F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Phil, and thanks for the comment on the good quarter. I do want to replay some of the comments I just made, which is that when we think about 2019, first of all, we see 2019 as being a continued growth year for our revenues. When we look over the previous years and we look over future years, I think what we're seeing here is we're treating more patients or treating more patients globally, and therefore, that's driving our revenue line year on year and into the future, and so it's a really nice profile.","As we think about more proximately in time and we think about going from 2018 into 2019, we should continue to see growth even without reimbursement outside the U.S., and that growth would be driven by the continued launch of SYMDEKO in the U.S. and getting a full year's contribution for patients that are on drug. But then also outside of the U.S., SYMDEKO, which is known as SYMKEVI outside the U.S., is also launching into certain markets where it is already reimbursed. So we see baseline growth from already approved geographies.","More specifically to your question, as in where the geographies that we could anticipate or possibly attain reimbursement approval, to have an impact in terms of growth on our revenues, it would have to be those larger markets. And principally, those would be either the UK, France, or Canada.","I do want to replay, though, that this is unpredictable in terms of timing, and in particular, in the UK, which is probably the \u2013 it is the second largest CF market. If we are to obtain reimbursements over there, then we are launching the drug from anew, so we're in a launch curve in the UK. It's not that we're just switching on a large pause of revenue. We have to launch the drugs in the UK. We continue to make good progress with discussions with all three of those countries. However, resolution, whether it is in 2019 or whether it's in 2020, we'll update you as we progress.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","That's really helpful. And then second on competition, after the close today, Galapagos NV had a couple announcements, some new data as well as a change to the collaboration, and Proteostasis recently announced some data for their programs. I'm curious to get the team's updated thoughts on competition from those two parties. How real was it? What do you see as the strengths and weaknesses?","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So this is Jeff. Thanks for the question. As you know, we don't typically comment individual competitors or data. I think actually the data sort of speaks for itself. But what I would like to comment on is sort of how we view our competitive position and our data and sort of where we are in the process.","And I think we've learned a lot over the last year. In fact, I think our competitive position has improved over the last year significantly. One of the things we've learned is that it's going to be a world of triples, and it's going to be a world of triples pretty quickly. And the reason for that is that in order to really get to all patients, particularly to have men patients who are so difficult to treat and to maximize benefit for the homozygous patients, it's pretty clear now that you need a triple, any company needs a triple.","And that doesn't only mean you have three components. It means you have three medicines that can be combined, co-formulated, that have the right PK that can provide really superior efficacy, and I think the bar in efficacy has gone up very significantly and we'll talk about that in a minute. And also important is that they're tolerable and safe. These are medicines that kids are going to take for the rest of their lives.","And we learned a lot about our regimens in that regard in the last year. We know that we have two different triple regimens that are now have been in hundreds of patients. They are co-formulatable, they do have the right PK, they raised the bar in efficacy very significantly into the double digits for -- to have men patients and into the mid double digits for the homozygous patients, that's going to be the bar, I think, for the future.","And most importantly to us, we're well into our Phase 3 trials, which are enrolling ahead of schedule to the point where we're very confident we'll be able to file one of those regimens no later than mid next year, which would allow us to launch those drugs and get patients on them pretty quickly in the coming years. And so I think from our perspective, we like where we are, we have multiple options and most importantly, we have clinical data both on efficacy and on safety with these drugs, which is a high bar, frankly.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","That's helpful, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good afternoon. Thanks for the question, guys. I just have a couple. The first one is on the triple selection process, just for the NDA, when you guys think about it, you likely won't have much in the way of mature data on exacerbation benefit on BMI when you pick the regimen so \u2013 and that may matter, actually, over the long-term. So, is it just about safety, tolerability in FEV1 or are there other parts of the profile that you think will be impactful that you're looking for?","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Geoff, this is Jeff Leiden. You're right. I think that at the point we can pick these triples, the primary data that we'll base that on is FEV1 data and safety and tolerability data as well as the whole profile of these drugs. Remember, we have a lot of preclinical and early clinical data as well.","I think the good thing is, is there hasn't been enormous disparity between many of those long-term outcomes and short-term outcomes, and what I mean by that is that, at least, in our experience so far, drugs that have a very positive acute effect on FEV1 and a lowering sweat chloride is significant, acutely have also turned out to have these very profound, long-term effects.","And, in fact, as you know, one of the interesting things is that KALYDECO and, say, ORKAMBI, which have a bit different acute profiles, ORKAMBI being less potent acutely, actually have very similar long-term profiles, which suggest that if you can really hit CFTR effectively in these patients, you will get the long-term benefit.","So, I think the risk of a disconnect between an acute effect and a long-term effect is rather small. Now, obviously, we will have the long-term effects of both of these drugs within a relatively short period of time, but you're right. Probably not by the time we decide which one to file.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And just a follow-up for Ian and I know you haven't given a 2019 outlook, but when you plan for OpEx spend, you'll have the triple launch pending the data obviously and then a bunch of new programs and R&D. So, how are you guys thinking about that in the context of also showing some operating leverage?","Ian F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Hey, Geoff. Thanks for the question. I really appreciate you pointing out that we've got this continued investment and commitment to CF. I just want to cover that because we do sometimes get asked the question whether when we deliver on these Phase 3 trials, are we declining our investment in CF? And I actually we want to maintain the position that we're not. We continue to invest in CF.","In fact, those patients that were in our Phase 3 studies roll over to open-label studies. Those open-label studies we have found to be incredibly important because we gather longitudinal data to show the benefit of these medicines longer term.","We're also doing studies in the younger patients and so we're able to treat these children at much younger ages of their lives. And so our commitment and investment to CF into these medicines that we believe will be hugely beneficial to them is maintained.","So, if you could think about that as a steady state part of our R&D investment and then as we think about advancing our pipeline in other disease areas beyond cystic fibrosis, we are happy to be letting you -- we'll bring you more up-to-date with how we're advancing new medicines into the clinic in these new disease areas that Jeff just referred to earlier.","The investment in these disease areas is smaller in magnitude, it's earlier stage, but it is additional investments and therefore, when you compare a 2018 operating expense profile to a 2019 operating expense profile, you should see a relatively small increase compared to the increase we anticipate on the revenue line. So yeah, we do like to anticipate operating to increase.","And then one last thing I would say is that you got to remember, we're also launching medicines globally, not just where it's been in the U.S. and therefore, there are launch costs that are being incurred outside of the U.S., not significant because of the nature of the disease and how we can reach these patients with our medicines, but there is investments there as well. So, you should expect to see operating expense margin increase in 2019 compared to 2018, but the key will be the revenue growth which will allow us to continue to generate more cash flow.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Yee from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for the question. Congrats on a great quarter as well. On the once-daily, you made a comment that you've had some positive feedback and are moving that forward. Can you just, I guess, clarify the process going forward and why you're choosing gaining mutations as sort of the first move forward and not maybe a broader population? How should we think about that?","And then second question was more of a modeling finance question which is that obviously, the triples are advancing forward like you said, but ORKAMBI and SYMDEKO are pretty big franchises. Over some period of time, is that expected conceptually to have those doublet drugs go away and the triple is basically the single line item? How do you think about that? Were there patients that actually would stay on doubles? Thanks.","Reshma Kewalramani - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","This is Reshma. Let me start by taking the first part of the question with regard to VX-561. As you know and we've talked about this on previous calls, the FDA had asked us to do additional dose-ranging before proceeding to Phase 3 and part of that request was to study VX-561 across these dose ranges in gaining patients and we've had productive discussions with the agency and we're now at the point where we've designed our study, we've selected our doses, and I expect that this study will get started next year, probably in the first half or so. Stuart?","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, Mike, and on the question of what do we think the triple combinations might do to the doublets, certainly, if we see the sort of results in Phase 3 that we saw in Phase 2 in the homozygous population where, as you know, we saw the triple combinations deliver very, very substantial increases in clinical benefit over and above a baseline of tezacaftor and ivacaftor. If those results hold true, then our expectation would be that the vast majority of patients would be transferred to a triple combination rather than staying on a doublet just given the significant benefit risk improvement that we saw in those Phase 2 studies.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And just to clarify on VX-561, you have to test it in gaining patients first, but the full plan certainly is to move it into a broader population after that? Is that fair?","Reshma Kewalramani - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","You got that right.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Robyn Karnauskas from Citi. Your line is now open.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, thanks for taking my question and also congratulations. So I guess let me ask about VX-150. So you mentioned that you're doing a dose-ranging study. Things are already done \u2013 some trials and execute. I was curious if this is to get a drug that may be superior to Vicodin since the other doses were just trying to be equivalent.\\","And another question on that is like you talked about the acute market, some checks we've done suggest that reimbursement might be challenging there because doctors may just give a cheap generic drug. What has your market told you what has to happen for a more expensive, non-addictive drug to have uptake in that setting?","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks for the questions, both good questions. Let me start with maybe your second one and I'll come back to the dose-ranging study, which is pretty straightforward. With respect to reimbursement, you're correct. A large part of the acute market has been genericized and as you know, a large part of that market is actually opioids for acute post-surgical pain, post-dental pain, et cetera.","Obviously, we're sitting in the middle of an opioid epidemic and the number one objective that I think patients, physicians, and the government has is to find medicines that have essentially equivalent efficacy with opioids without the abuse potential and the side effects of opioids.","We believe that VX-150, based on the data we have so far, has potential to hit that profile. You saw that in the comparative trial that we did. If that's true, we feel that VX-150 is a very, very competitive drug to a generic opioid and with just reasonable pricing, that market is a multibillion-dollar opportunity even if you only capture a portion of it.","You may know in the U.S. last year, there were over 200 million opioid prescriptions written, which is a truly astounding number. Obviously, not all of them for acute pain, but a lot of them. So does that answer the question in terms of reimbursement?","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes, that's very helpful.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Okay. Then in terms of VX-150 -- I'm sorry, go ahead. Did you have another question on it?","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","No, go ahead. I was just asking about the dose-ranging...","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","If your does range is higher to maybe sell a superior profile in the acute setting, which may make reimbursement even easier.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, yeah. So you may remember, the study that we did in acute bunionectomy, it's actually I would call it a proof-of-mechanism study because it was the first time anybody had shown that a NaV1.8 inhibitor could work in acute pain. And so we actually used a fairly high dose there just to make sure that we were getting up to a reasonable exposure.","You also know that before you can move into Phase 3, regulators will require you to do a dose-ranging study really to understand two things: one, what is the PK\/PD profile of the drug; and frankly, two, what is the lowest effective dose because you always want to give the lowest fully effective dose. And so think of this as just a standard part of the Phase 2 regulatory process where we need to identify the PK\/PD profile of the lowest effective dose, and that would then enable us to go to the agency with a plan for a pivotal trial, again, assuming that it's successful.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Right. And second question on alpha or antitrypsin. You mentioned (30:24) efficacy but I do have flashbacks for ORKAMBI I think not correlating with FEV. In this indication, is it more straightforward that if you see a reduction, you're going to see an improvement in efficacy? Help us understand a little bit the disease.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sure. Sure. Yeah, let me maybe give you a little context on the disease, if you don't mind. It might take me a minute. One of the remarkable things about AAT is how similar \u2013 it smells and looks a lot like CF in many, many different ways. It's a genetic disease. It affects somewhere between 60,000 and 100,000 people in the U.S. and probably about another 50,000 to 60,000 outside the U.S. It's caused by one major mutation in more than 90% of people, and it's a protein folding disorder as it turns out, just like CF is, which is a remarkable similarity. In this case, the normal protein, AAT, is made in the liver and is normally secreted into the blood, where it travels to the lung and it protects the lung against autodigestion essentially by endogenous enzymes.","So in the disease, the mutant protein has two problems. One, it doesn't fold correctly and accumulates in the liver, and so it causes significant liver disease actually in up to 30% of all the patients. And two, obviously it's not secreted into the blood, so it's unable to go to the lungs and protect the lung. And so if the lung gets autodigested, that means patients suffer from early-onset emphysema. So, that's the disease.","The challenge is, for us, was could we make a corrector, a small molecule corrector of AAT just as we had for CFTR that would essentially refill the protein in the liver so it would be secreted from the liver and therefore presumably help treat the liver disease, and more importantly, that would secrete functionally into the blood where it would go to the lung and protect the lung. That was the challenge.","It's a very hard problem, I could tell you, biological problem. I think we've cracked that problem now. We've made a series of small molecule correctors that clearly do both of those things. They refold the protein so it's secreted, and it's secreted in a functional form so that it could protect the lung.","One of the really nice things in this disease is that there is both a cell or several cell models. And there's also, in this case, an animal model which we didn't have in CF of which the human mutation has been engineered into the animal. And so we've been able to test these molecules both in the cells and in the animals, and they do what we thought they would do. They refold the protein. It's secreted from the cells. In the animals, they produce secreted AAT at levels that would be sufficient to essentially be preventative or curative in the disease.","And then the other thing that's very similar to CF is this is a nice biomarker, which is simply the circulating levels of AAT in the serum. You can treat the patients for several weeks and just measure both levels and function of the AAT in the serum. And we know from human experiments of nature essentially that if you have a certain level of AAT in the serum, you don't get the disease. And so we know exactly what we're shooting for here and we can measure it very easily.","And so the plan is take this into normal healthies by the end of this year, the first of these molecules, and we have a whole series of them just like we did the CFTR correctors. And that if they are safe and more tolerable, (33:43) once we understand the PK, take them into patients. And again, with relatively small numbers of patients treated for relatively short periods of time, you simply measure AAT in the serum and you know exactly where you are.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right, thanks a lot. That's helpful.","Ian F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Robyn.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Geoffrey Porges from Leerink. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you very much. I appreciate taking the questions. First, Jeff, you mentioned a mid-teens FEV1 improvement now being the hurdle for triples for competition. Could you give us your sense of what the bar is, the sweat chloride relative and absolute for homozygous and het\/mins, so we know how to appraise all these competitors coming along?","And then just wondering, Stuart, if you could give us a sense of where you are in the eligible F508del penetration in the U.S. between SYMDEKO and ORKAMBI. You've mentioned that you had quite a few discontinuations in patients who never started on ORKAMBI. And have you caught all those patients up yet, or are you still substantially below the penetration you've achieved with KALYDECO in the eligible population sector?","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Geoff, thanks. I'll answer the first part, and Stuart then, of course, will answer the second part. On the first part, I do want to just correct what may have been a misimpression of what I said or maybe I said the wrong thing, but I want to be very clear. I don't think mid-teens is the bar, for instance, for het\/min patients. I think the bar that we've set, as you know from the data, is somewhere between 9.8% and 13.8% in our Phase 2 data for het\/mins.","And for homozygous patients who already have an effect from doubles that we believe (35:33) was around 4%, we showed an additional 9.6% or 10% improvement, which is how I get to that mid-teens. So I just want to be clear that I'm not suggesting 15% is the bar that you need for het\/mins to get to be successful.","With respect to sweat chloride, I think these are approximate numbers. But I think when you reach sweat chloride that approaches carrier levels, which is our goal, let's say 40 to 50, that's probably the goal that you know you're there with a triple. And so I think those are the two numbers we look at. In most cases but not in all cases, they correlate pretty well. And at the end of the day, as you know, the regulatory endpoint is going to be the FEV1.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Great, thanks.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Geoff, it's Stuart here. Just commenting on the SYMDEKO launch in the U.S., so as you suggested, one of the most important things for us, for SYMDEKO is the ability to get patients who were not being treated by ORKAMBI onto a CFTR modulator, and that was really two populations. One was those who were completely na\u00efve, had never been exposed to ORKAMBI, and we've seen good uptake in that population.","And the second population was those who had discontinued ORKAMBI, often because of the respiratory adverse events, and we've also seen good uptake in that patient population as well. We've also seen a number of patients switch from ORKAMBI to SYMDEKO. So we've seen strong uptake in all those patient populations. We're certainly not done with the launch whilst we've seen good uptake, Geoff. We're certainly not done. We haven't flattened out on SYMDEKO uptake in the U.S. yet so we still have some ways to go, but we're certainly pleased with how the launch has gone so far.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, thanks very much.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And, Geoff, maybe just to add one thing that I know you are aware of is we talked about the efficacy side of these triples, but clearly, tolerability and safety is the other side of the equation and long-term tolerability and safety, not one week or two weeks and so I think that's going to be an important thing that we'll all look at as well as these trials progress.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Congrats on all the progress. Was just wondering, first, you might not comment on this yet at this point, but just with respect to the triple combo, can you maybe just give us an update on the different inputs you're thinking about with respect to pricing?","And then just love your way of thoughts on capital allocation here. I know, Jeff, you made some comments in your opening remarks but could you have $3 billion on the balance sheet? That might be the most you guys have ever had so just curious how you're thinking about that as that continues to grow here into next year. Thank you.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Terence, Stuart here. On pricing for the triples, obviously, much too early to make any specific comments, but we'll be taking into account the same factors that we always do and that will be the magnitude of the clinical benefit that we're able to deliver for patients. It will be the label that we get approved for and that obviously leads into what's the eligible patient population. So those are really going to be the inputs that we take into consideration and obviously, we'll get more information on those in the coming months.","Ian F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And as far as capital allocation is concerned, it's really interesting. I can tell you that being in the company has invested mainly and it's been about capital preservation for a long period of time in the last three years. We're now a cash accumulator and creator and it's about capital allocation. It is an interesting philosophical change for the company.","But I'd like to start by saying that revenue line is the main source of cash and because after that, we then allocate inside the company on our internal programs. That's often not thought about until the capital allocation, but the main source of capital is our revenue line and then we allocate that internally. And as you can hear, in terms of the questions we were asked on operating expense earlier, we still allocate significant amount of capital towards cystic fibrosis medicines, but also now, we're starting to allocate capital to diseases that are beyond cystic fibrosis and we're really happy about that.","Some of those opportunities that are beyond cystic fibrosis are our next order of priority, which is we're allocating capital outside the company towards collaborations and towards medicines that we can accelerate into developments and some of the opportunities we have with beta thalassemia and also sickle cell have been a product of a very successful, a nice collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics and we're really excited to be going into the clinic very shortly with these medicines, both sickle cell and beta thalassemia. And we anticipate that there will be others to follow. The medicines for FSGS, for example, was something that we in-licensed from a very early stage a couple years ago and -- but what it allowed us to do is to really reignite a research effort in that area is now providing the opportunity to go into the clinic in a very short period of time, a very important medicine.","So that -- it's a high order priority for us to allocate capital outside the company to do collaborations to give us opportunity with more modalities and more medicines for diseases that we would be interested in. But I would say there is also a consideration for how we may also limit the increase of our share count. Our share count \u2013 outstanding shares, does increase year by year based on the issuance and exercise of options and restricted stock.","And so we like to think of ways that we may limit that creep in outstanding shares and we've been doing that throughout this year. We did announce earlier this year that we entered in a $500 million share buyback program and we have been buying shares back throughout this year and that's been very successful for us as well and therefore has limited the creep in the outstanding shares, which obviously helps us with a small amount on the dilution. And so that's how we think about capital allocation. It's very important, very close to us, and we're happy that we have the opportunity to prioritize it in this way.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Alethia Young from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","Eliana Merle - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hey, guys. This is Ellie on for Alethia. Thanks for taking the question. Just on the earlier status income on the R&D side, you've recently did a deal with Genomics. So could you talk a little bit more about this and sort of how having this particular discovery engine will sort of enhance your R&D efforts?","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the question. We were actually quite excited about that collaboration. As you know, one of the principles of our research effort is to really, I mean, work on what we call highly validated targets. There's really two major ways you validate targets. One is pharmacologically with medicines. That's actually the minority, by the way, and the second is human genetics where mutations either gain a function or loss of function will tell you a lot about the role-specific targets. A beautiful example of that is NaV1.7 and NaV1.8, which were validated by human genetics, obviously, CFTR, et cetera.","The collaboration of Genomics, who we believe is the leading small company in the world working on this kind of high throughput human genetics, will allow us to screen for new targets on the one hand through large scale data analysis of human genetic databases. But also, it will allow us to ask questions, for instance, about the potential side effects of hitting a specific target because we can screen the human population for mutation from that the target, which is a loss of function, for example, and ask are those people normal or not until they suffer from any mechanism-based side effects. That's a far a very important thing to know as we begin to pick targets and develop small molecules. So think about it as a way of tapping into the human genetic data resource that both help pick targets and help screen for safety and that collaboration is off to a very nice start in a number of different diseases.","Eliana Merle - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Got you, thanks. And then just another one in terms of early phase development. Can you just talk a little bit more about the preclinical models for AAT? I mean, obviously, with CF, you guys are very successful on optimizing these preclinical models. But could you tell us a little bit sort of about your thoughts on what you think the best preclinical model for AAT and also part of your thoughts on how predictive these models might be? Thanks","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks for the question. There's two kinds of models that are generally used. These are not by the way necessarily proprietary to us. One is the set of cell-based models in which either derived from patients or derived from engineered cells with the human gene mutation in them which is the major AAT mutation. And in those cells, the mutant protein is made, it's misfolded, it's not secreted and so one can test molecules on those cells as to do they help refold protein secreted as a function, et cetera.","The other one is there is a transgenic model which is actually expresses the human mutant protein. Again that protein is not secreted well. It accumulates in the liver of those mice and one can dose those mice with medicine and then ask if the protein's secreted as a function or what levels do you reach, et cetera. So two very nice models which we feel actually will be highly predictive because they do to actually study the human mutation not some mouse mutation.","Eliana Merle - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Got you. Thanks very much. That's helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First one maybe on, again, competition, we have seen some data from Proteostasis. I was wondering, if you guys have done any work in the lab about the role of amplifier? Do you have any view on that or not? And then second maybe for Stu. Can you tell us by when you might see SYMDEKO pretty much reaching a full penetration in the U.S. market given where you're seeing the market today?","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","This is Jeff. I'll take the first one in terms of the amplifier. Again, we really don't comment on other people's specific molecules. One of the things that we like about our triple and our correctors are we know that they're quite specific for the CFTR protein which is I think one of the reasons \u2013 they're quite selective, if you will, they don't hit other proteins, one of the reasons why they've been so tolerated and so I think as we look at \u2013 as you look at other molecules, that issue of specificity and potency is a very important thing to look at.","Stuart A. Arbuckle - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And then in terms of the SYMDEKO uptaking, obviously, we're very pleased with how it's gone to date. Predicting exactly where it's going to reach full penetration is hard to do, but you can rest assured that when we get the point of giving 2019 guidance, we'll be including our expectations in that how SYMDEKO is going to perform in the U.S. and then also hopefully by then we'll have the approval of SYMKEVI in Europe as well and we'll incorporate all that in our 2019 guidance.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, there. Thanks very much for taking my questions. And congrats on all the progress. In NACF data we saw more specifics on the rate of cough for the triple combo. I know these weren't classified as bronchoconstrictions. I was wondering if you can give us any more details on the quality, severity, and duration, and remind us, should we think about this as related to the initial mucus clearance and how it might compare to ORKAMBI?","And then just a follow-up on the pain program, obviously, some really interesting Phase 2 data. Wondering if there are ways you might be able to further improve upon the bioavailability and potency of VX-150? And should we assume VX-128 is no longer being pursued? Thanks.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Maybe I'll take both of those real quickly. I think the question you're trying to get at with the triple, but correct me if I'm wrong is are we seeing bronchoconstriction as we saw with ORKAMBI, the answer is no. We actually measured that specifically not only in terms of cough or anything else.","So we do not see bronchoconstriction with the triple and we did not see it with tez\/iva, as you remember. But I think the more important point, Brian, is just looking at the total tolerability and safety profile of these drugs now in a couple hundred patients. What we're seeing is they're quite clean. They look a lot like the earlier drugs. ORKAMBI excepted, they don't have the bronchoconstriction and they've been very well-tolerated and very safe so far. Does that answer your question? I just want to make sure that was the question you're asking.","Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's very helpful. I just wanted to contextualize that, yeah.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yes. And then the other question was about VX-150 and VX-128?","Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So maybe just again, let me take a step back and remind you that the approach that we're taking in pain, actually not unlike the approach we've taken in CF and the approach we're taking in AAT is to create a portfolio of molecules, not one, not single rifle shots, but multiple molecules that have different properties, both with respect to things like potency but also with respect to things like PK biodistribution, drug-drug interactions, et cetera, and then take those molecules forward into early-stage clinical development to understand their profiles more fully.","Obviously, VX-150 we have the most data on. We know that it's well-tolerated. We know that it has efficacy, at least at these higher doses, in acute pain and in osteoarthritis, and we'll get a readout on the third kind of pain, neuropathic pain, early next year.","VX-128 was a follow-on molecule, if you will, with some different properties than VX-150. We discontinued development of VX-128 in Phase 1 healthy volunteers because it didn't have the PK profile and tolerability improvement that we were hoping to see over VX-150.","We have multiple additional 1.8 inhibitors coming behind that, and so you should expect to see us bring other inhibitors into early clinical development, the same way trying to optimize these molecules. Remember, in acute pain, you're going to need molecules that are highly efficacious and also highly safe and highly tolerable. We don't want to create molecules that have liabilities like opioids.","Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's really helpful. Thanks so much, Jeff.","Michael Partridge - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, we have time for two more questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Matteis from Stifel. Your line is now open.","Benjamin Burnett - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, thank you so much. This is Ben Burnett on for Paul. I wanted to ask another question about VX-150. I wonder if you could provide a little bit more color on the Phase 2b study in acute pain. I guess specifically what are you looking for and what is the efficacy hurdle that you need to advance this pivotal program?","And then the second question just more at a high level, I guess across these different pain indications, the acute, I know neuropathy is ongoing as well as osteoarthritis-related pain, you have some data there. What is the ultimate vision for this program? And I guess under what scenarios would you want to commercialize this yourself? And is there a scenario where a partner might be involved in that aspect of it? Thank you.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Ben, thank you. I'll take the second part actually first, I'm sorry, because it's a little more strategic. Maybe we'll give you some context and then Reshma will take the first part, which is about the VX-150 Phase 2b trial.","I said this before but maybe just to give you some context. We think about pain both from a commercial standpoint and from a scientific standpoint not as one disease but as actually multiple diseases. So an easy way to divide it, for instance, is acute pain. That's the kind of postsurgical pain or dental pain when you have an acute injury. That's one segment. The second segment is chronic inflammatory pain, things like osteoarthritis, lower back pain. A third segment is neuropathic pain. That's pain like diabetic neuropathy.","They have different commercial channels obviously, but they also potentially have different pain mechanisms. And so it's important to study them separately because some drugs will work in one and some drugs will work in two, and frankly, some drugs might work in all three. So that's the approach that we've taken with our portfolio.","We've done separate trials in acute pain using bunionectomy as the model. We've done separate trials in chronic inflammatory pain using OA as the model, osteoarthritis, and we're doing a third set of trials in neuropathic pain using small fiber neuropathy as the model. And as you know, what we've seen so far, just to remind you, is a high level of efficacy in acute pain, a high level of efficacy in osteoarthritis chronic pain, and we're still waiting to see the data from the neuropathic trial, which is due early next year. So that's where things sort of stand from a scientific standpoint.","Now again, if I take a step back, remember that there is a very large need for a new class of pain medicines. There really hasn't been a new class for over 50 years. And the reason is that we have opioids on the one hand, which have high efficacy but are burdened with all of the addictive and other side effects, and then we have drugs like Aspirin, Tylenol, and NSAIDs, which have lower efficacy and also, by the way, have some of their own side effects which are not trivial.","And so the target for us is really can we find a new mechanism of pain that approaches opioid-like efficacy without the liabilities, addictive and other liabilities of opioids. And so far, based on Phase 2 data, what we're seeing is yes, NaV1.8 looks like such a target. VX-150 is the first medicine that does look like it hits in both of those two pain indications, and the third one we're waiting to see.","And the final part of your question is what about commercializing that. It turns out acute pain, as I said, is a multibillion-dollar opportunity. And at least many, not all necessarily, but many of the channels in the acute pain market can be addressed by a specialty sales force. That's something that we would develop and commercialize ourselves. Contrast that with, say, OA pain or lower back pain, that's clearly not a specialty disease. That's like a community disease that requires a primary care sales force. And while we may take the science in Phase 2 trials forward, we would certainly not develop our own primary care sales force and commercialize that. That would be done with a partner. Nevertheless, we think if we have such a molecule, it's a very valuable asset for us to partner.","And then neuropathic pain lies somewhere in between. It can be covered by a rather large specialty sales force, meaning 100 to 150 reps probably in this country, so it is seen mostly by a specialist. And it really depends on the quality of data that we're going to see then in the first part of the year in terms of deciding what we would do with respect to further development and commercialization. Does that give you the lay of the land of how we're thinking about it?","Benjamin Burnett - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Absolutely makes sense. I appreciate it.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Okay, Reshma?","Reshma Kewalramani - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","This is Reshma. With regards to VX-150 Phase 2 study that we are going to be initiating shortly, it's a fairly standard Phase 2 dose-ranging study. This is going to be in the bunionectomy acute pain model. And in essence, it's going to be several doses that we study to get a full dose exposure range. You'll remember that the bunionectomy study that had the positive results from early in the year was a high-dose study because we were really testing proof-of-mechanism in that one.","The endpoint is going to be SPID24, SPID48. This is a pretty standard endpoint for the bunionectomy model. And with regard to the treatment effect, we were very pleased with the treatment effect we saw in the bunionectomy study. And now we need to explore the full dose range and exposure to see what the lowest effective dose is going to be and that's really what we're studying here.","Benjamin Burnett - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Two for me as well. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned you'll have some enhanced next-gen correctors moving into the clinic in the coming months. I'm wondering if there's any additional information you could provide about these in terms of how they might be further differentiated from what you already have.","And then my second question is with regard to the clinical hold for CTX001 in sickle cell not being listed in initial trials slated to begin. How much data do you ideally want to accumulate before you're potentially comfortable providing an update? And will this be something that's your responsibility or your partners?","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Cory, this is Jeff. Maybe I'll take part one and Ian will talk about disclosure in part two of the question. With respect to the enhanced next-gen correctors, I would say what we're looking for here is two things. One, I think we've showed you the chart before that as we've gone through the last four years, it's really remarkable to see how we've been able to improve the potency and efficacy of these next-gen correctors.","With the current molecules VX-59 and VX-445, we're close to getting all patients to carrier levels, but not quite there. And so the goal would be to find a next-gen corrector that could get all patients, meaning het\/mins in particular, as well as homozygous patients, the carrier levels of chloride transport because we believe if you can get there, particularly, in young patients, you'll either prevent or greatly, greatly lessen the severity of the disease.","The other goal of that program is to continue to diversify the chemotypes. We always like to have multiple chemotypes of any medicine that we're making. And so we've been able to explore alternative chemotypes and we're working on those as well. So, those are the two kinds of molecules that you can expect to see entry to clinic. We already have examples of both. And so the first ones of those, I do expect going into the clinic early next year and you can probably see some more as the year goes along as well. Does that answer your question about the enhanced next-gen correctors?","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, perfect.","Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Okay.","Ian F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And, Cory, to your disclosure question, well, we've just started recruiting patients of these studies and I think the next disclosure we'll provide you would be kind of an update of where we are on the recruitment. We'd anticipate dosing first patient probably around towards the end of this year, early next year. And then once we have a number of patients in the study, we'd anticipate a disclosure of data from the study later on next year. But that would probably be timed with multiple patients in both studies and \u2013 so being on therapy or, let's say, have had the procedure for a certain duration of time.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you.","Michael Partridge - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Well, that will conclude the call. The Investor Relations team is in the office tonight to answer any further follow-up questions. Thank you very much for joining the call and have a good evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect."]}}
