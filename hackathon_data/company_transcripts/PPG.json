My name is Tawanda and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Vince Morales, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Vince Morales","Thank you, Tawanda, and good afternoon, everyone. Once again, this is Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations for PPG Industries. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our first quarter 2015 financial results overview.","Joining me on the call today from PPG is Chuck Bunch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael McGarry, President and Chief Operating Officer and Frank Sklarsky, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information we released today, Thursday, April 16, 2015.","I will also remind everyone that we posted detailed commentary in the accompanying presentation slides on our investor center at ppg.com. These slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the opening comments Chuck will make momentarily. Following Chuck's perspective on the company financial results for the quarter, we will move to the Q&A session.","Both the prepared commentary, the presentation slides and discussion during the call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements.","The presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures the company has provided in the appendix materials which are available again on our website reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC.","And now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch.","Chuck Bunch","Thank you, Vince and good afternoon everyone. I want to thank you for your interest in PPG. Today, we reported record first quarter 2015 financial results from continuing operations. We achieved record first quarter net sales of 3.7 billion and record first quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $2.37.","Overall, we continue to deliver strong financial results and I'm pleased with our sales and earnings per share growth in the quarter. Our adjusted earnings per share were up 20% versus the first quarter record established last year with each of our reporting segments growing earnings by at least 10% in local currencies.","As I will discuss in a few minutes, our strong performance was despite the fact that we faced some difficult prior year sales comparisons. As a global company, we were also impacted by unfavorable currency translation and continue to see variation in economic conditions among the major global regions.","Contributing to our record first quarter results were the benefits from our recent strategic actions and cash deployment. This included both acquisition related earnings and a reduction in our share count stemming from cash deployed on share repurchases.","We have also continued to work diligently on other company specific actions. This included a debt refinancing we recently completely which reduced our net interest expense in the quarter by nearly 50% versus the prior year.","In addition, we have continued our strong legacy of cost and productivity improvements which you have come to expect from PPG. Finally, several of our businesses have continued to deliver strong and above industry growth rates as we benefited from our leading technologies and excellent customer service.","Again, we achieved excellent quarterly results that were aided by specific actions we have taken strategically, operationally and financially.","Now I will discuss some specific business trends for the first quarter. Our net sales and local currencies grew by 8%, while sales reported in U.S. dollars were up 1%. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted sales by 7% offsetting acquisition related sales growth of about 7% in the quarter.","Our sales volume growth was modest increasing about 1% year-over-year and reflects overall subdued global economic activity and a difficult comparison with strong prior year growth rates in certain regions.","Regionally, our highest coatings growth rate was in emerging regions which in aggregate grew at about 6%. This is up versus recent quarters as each of our businesses delivered emerging region volumes growth year-over-year. This improvement was driven by a performance in Asia and specifically China. In Latin America, demand was mixed by country and also by end-use market.","Volumes at our U.S. and Canadian coatings businesses declined slightly, decreasing 1%. Sales volumes this quarter were compared against sales in last year's first quarter that included 7% volume growth, which is a difficult comparison. Last year's volumes were favorable across many of our businesses, reflecting strengthening regional economic conditions, coupled with pipeline fills of new products at several of our major architectural coatings customers.","Despite the modest volume decline in the first quarter this year, overall demand conditions in the region were generally favorable. Most of our businesses continued to experience modest but consistent growth.","From a seasonal perspective in the region, overall retail activity was weak in February, but did recover, and ended the month of March strongly. We expect increased economic growth and higher PPG growth rates in this region in the coming quarters.","In Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, or EMEA, our volumes grew by 1%. This was also in comparison to strong coatings volume growth in the previous year's first quarter of 4%, which was very high relative to the economic conditions in that region. The previous year sales benefited from very favorable weather conditions that allowed for an early start to the architectural paint season. The region experienced a more normal weather pattern this year.","Strong performance from our automotive OEM business offset the lower year-over-year architectural coatings results. We remain optimistic regarding the European auto market, given the pace of regional auto sales during the first quarter.","As with previous quarters, overall demand throughout the region varied considerably by country. Most businesses delivered growth in the region with particular support from the U.K., Ireland, and certain Central and Eastern European countries. Conditions remained weak in other countries such as France, and also in our business in Africa.","Overall for the EMEA region, we remain constructive on economic growth in the coming quarters. We expect consumer spending in the region will benefit from the lower cost of oil. Weaker European currencies are anticipated to stimulate higher exports, and this is being coupled with overall Central Bank stimulus actions.","From a PPG perspective, we significantly lowered our cost structure in the region, and, as we experienced over the past several quarters, we expect excellent earnings leverage on any future volume growth.","With respect to currencies, as I mentioned earlier, unfavorable currency translation impacted our overall PPG sales by about 7%, which equated to about $260 million in the first quarter. This is primarily attributed to a weaker euro, but included impacts from other currencies as well.","Based on current exchange rates, we anticipate a full-year unfavorable currency impact on our net sales of about $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion and about a $110 million to $120 million unfavorable impact to earnings. This is an increase from the figures we provided in early January when we reviewed our 2014 full year results and reflects further weakening of many major international currencies against the U.S. dollar throughout the first quarter.","We expect the largest unfavorable currency translation impact for the year to occur in the second quarter given the seasonality of our businesses. As a reminder, our second quarter is traditionally our highest seasonal quarter of the year. Based on current exchange rates, we expect the quarterly currency translation to reduce sales in the second quarter by $350 million to $375 million.","From a segment perspective, our performance coatings segment contains roughly two-thirds of our EMEA sales exposure, as it includes our large architectural coatings EMEA business.","A last but important point with respect to year-over-year sales comparisons, our 2014 acquisitions added about 7% to our first quarter sales. This was primarily from our Comex acquisition which we completed in November, but included other, smaller acquisitions as well.","We remain very excited about our Comex acquisition. The performance of the acquired business over the first five months has been excellent. The business grew by more than 10% this quarter versus the prior-year pre-acquisition quarter, and we remain on track for a high single-digit volume growth for the full year.","We expect to achieve the previously communicated acquisition related cost synergies, with action plans well underway. In addition, we are now looking to fully utilize their very well established concessionaire distribution network from the sale of other legacy PPG products in several areas, including light industrial coatings and protective coatings within Mexico. We plan to provide updates throughout the year on the acquisition and our progress on these potential sales synergies.","Moving to our first quarter earnings performance, our 20% adjusted earnings per share growth continues a strong multiyear trend for PPG. Over the preceding three full years beginning in 2012, we have grown adjusted earnings per share by 20%, 31%, and 27%, respectively. This is a reflection of our transformed business portfolio and strong operational execution.","For the quarter by segment, performance coatings sales grew 2% and segment income was up 6%. Contributing to the results were the benefits from the Comex acquisition, partly offset by unfavorable currency translation.","Sales for the industrial coatings segment were down 2%, as strong volume growth of 5% was offset by a 7% unfavorable currency impact. Segment income was up 6% on the volume improvements and improved manufacturing costs.","Glass segment sales were flat, with higher selling prices in both businesses along with positive flat glass product mix, offset by unfavorable currency translation. Glass segment income rose to $30 million versus $4 million in the prior year quarter. Results were aided by the improved product mix and lower manufacturing costs, including the benefits from our 2014 sale of a flat glass manufacturing facility. Additional segment details are available in the presentation material.","Overall, our businesses performed well. However, we remain focused on our costs and are initiating restructuring actions focused on productivity measures in certain businesses or regions, along with securing the synergies we committed to with our recent acquisitions.","We have approved and will record a restructuring charge of $135 million to $140 million in the second quarter. We anticipate the restructuring actions will be completed by the end of 2016, and expect full year pretax savings of $100 million to $105 million in 2017. Partial year savings in 2015 will be approximately $15 million to $20 million, pretax. While these are difficult actions, we need to continue to aggressively manage our costs.","Lastly, we continue to work on balance sheet optimization and earnings accretive cash deployment. As I have previously mentioned, we refinanced some of our higher cost debt in the fourth quarter of 2014. Additionally this quarter, we issued about $1.3 billion in long-term euro-denominated debt at an average interest rate of 1.1%. We ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash and short-term investments, maintaining strong financial flexibility.","Also, we remain active with respect to acquisitions. We completed the previously announced acquisition of REVOCOAT, an automotive specialty materials manufacturer. We also announced during the quarter that we submitted an offer to acquire the majority interest in an aerospace and automotive sealants business and are currently working through the customary works council and regulatory review processes.","We have an active M&A pipeline and while we remain disciplined, this remains a priority for cash deployment. With respect to our shareholders, we repurchased $200 million of stock in the first quarter.","Also today our Board approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.72 per share, we have raised our annual dividend for more than four decades and are proud of our track record.","The Board also approved a two for one stock split that will be effective in June of this year. So as you can see, we have remained active on all fronts. ","Now I will quickly summarize in the phase of somewhat subdued economic activity in the quarter, we delivered record first quarter financial performance supported by continued and aggressive operational execution.","We had excellent contributions from our recent cash deployment including the Comex acquisition. We have continued to optimize our balance sheet and have kept focus on rewarding our shareholders. ","This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again we appreciate your interest in PPG and now operator would you please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","John McNulty","A quick question on Comex. I guess you had indicated that you saw volume growth, it was about 10% year-over-year organically. And I guess I'm wondering what's driving that, because it certainly seems a stronger than the general end markets down there would imply.","Michael McGarry","John, this is Michael. The Comex business has been performing on all levels, they have \u2013 the GDP down there is around little bit around 3% and we have been growing. We expect it, we told you in the last call we grow probably 1.5 to 2 times that, we have outperformed that, that's been both government sales as well as the cohesion with our other PPG products.","So all in all, I would tell you they\u2019re doing a very good job and they had a early Easter promotion as well at segment augmented sales.","John McNulty","Great, thanks. And then maybe a question with regard to the restructuring plan and where the $100 million to $105 million of savings are coming from, can you give us a little bit of clarity as to where you do see the biggest buckets in terms of opportunities there?","Frank Sklarsky","John this is Frank. So a little more than half of the actions are focused on some of the markets that have seen some subdued economic conditions so that will focus on Europe and some other areas of challenging economics.","So some of that savings will be in area of administrative backoffice, increased shared services, parts of the supply chain in terms of manufacturing productivity, warehousing efficiencies things like that.","But if you look across the spectrum of the 100 to 105 savings, it really does run across all regions, all businesses, and all functions.","The other thing that we are focusing too as we stated in that release is that part of the restructuring is focused on the acquisition, synergies, achievement and that was we always plan to do that. So that's also part of it.","John McNulty","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche bank. Please proceed.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Chuck, on raw materials, did you see any material benefit in Q1? And what's your expectation in terms of Q2 for gross margin expansion, given lower raws?","Chuck Bunch","We saw very modest improvement in raw material pricing David, in fact if you look across all the corporation in both our fixed and variable cost, we had inflation that was just slightly negative less than 1% and so we still have not seen the full benefits of the raw material price reductions that we anticipate later this year.","We think the second half of the year, we will be able to pull through some of these raw material price reductions in a more meaningful way.","I think we\u2019ve talked about first quarter working through higher cost, inventory levels as an example and getting those savings pull through from our suppliers, we don\u2019t have index prices as a rule with either our suppliers or customers.","So we focused on that and we think as we go through the year but certainly in the second half, we are going to see more raw material benefits from our raw materials.","David Begleiter","Very good. And just in Asia and China, you noted some acceleration in China. That's perhaps against what we're seeing in terms of growth slowing. So what are you doing well in China and Asia overall?","Chuck Bunch","I think for PPG we\u2019ve been well positioned with several of the more consumer oriented markets not as focused on exports or construction, we have exposure to those businesses.","And I think our strongest of markets in China were automotive OEM which is a domestic market in China, those sales have continued to grow above - slightly above the what their overall GDP growth has been stated as so high single digits for automotive growth.","And we\u2019ve been well positioned there with some of our new technologies, compact processes, we have done well in that sector, packaging coating would be another example of a consumer oriented end used market that has grown faster than some of the export oriented or construction related business.","David Begleiter","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.","Ghansham Panjabi","First off, Chuck, are you sensing a new level of optimism from your customers in Europe correctly? Or are your comments on lower energy costs and the pickup in exports from the region more your expectation on a go-forward basis? And also, any early cycle businesses in the region that are starting to improve that you are particularly excited about?","Chuck Bunch","Yes Ghansham it\u2019s good to hear from you, I would say in Europe we have been probably waiting for recovery for several years and we remain cautious on how the markets are trending.","But I have been encouraged and this is not just a personal view, it is our team and they have been pessimistic or as cautious as I\u2019ve been but especially on the automotive side of the business, you had seen sales growth accelerate here in the first quarter especially in Southern Europe.","So we\u2019re talking now about kind of high single digit sales growth that we haven\u2019t yet seen translated into production, production increases or production growth which is where we have our sales and earnings.","And our team feels that if these sales levels continue that we\u2019re going to see higher growth rates in automotive as we go through the year. ","If you look at consumer confidence indicators they have also turned up in Europe and I think they\u2019re combination of yes we\u2019re facing some weaker currencies there but the combination of some of the central bank actions with some of the earlier cycle markets like automotive is starting to move I am a little more optimistic in the recovery here after the 2008, 2009 recession automotive was one of the early movers after it really went down quite drastically.","And then it was the construction markets here in North America that took a little longer to recover and I would say that seems to be the case a little bit with us at least in France and Southern Europe we\u2019re not seeing the construction markets bounce back yet.","But automotive we\u2019re all more optimistic and that I think bodes well not only for that end used market but for a number of other industrial production end used markets. ","So I\u2019m a little more optimistic even with the weaker currencies and in fact that is probably going to be one of the contributing factors as we go through this recovery in the overall economies there.","Ghansham Panjabi","And then just as a follow-on on North American architectural, is it your view that pricing is sort of stable in the market? Just curious on what you are seeing from a competitive standpoint, just given all the promotional activity in the channel.","Chuck Bunch","The pricing is flat in the marketplace.","Ghansham Panjabi","Is that your expectation that it stays flat for the year?","Chuck Bunch","Take the expectation is that it will remain flat.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay, thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Kevin McCarthy","Yes, good afternoon. Chuck, it looks like we have some nascent momentum in vehicle miles driven. Are you seeing any benefit in your refinish business yet, related to that? Or would you expect any as the year progresses?","Chuck Bunch","Hi, Kevin. I would expect, it\u2019s a little early, if you looked some of the winter activity last year we ended up having a pretty good year even though of the automotive refinish market started off quite slowly last year as well.","And so, I think you were going to see some improvement in automotive refinish as we go through the year but the first quarter is a little too soon to get the benefit from what was pretty sharply cold winter here in the early months.","We saw obviously some improvement in the second half of March when things finally got a little better but we won\u2019t see that yet in refinish it\u2019s probably as we go through the second quarter and into the second half of the year.","Kevin McCarthy","Okay, great. And then the second question, if I may, on the glass business -- or a two-part question. Can you comment on how much of the cost relief there was fixed versus variable? Just trying to get a sense of how durable it could be through the year. And then second piece, does the improved profitability influence your thinking on potential monetization of that business","Chuck Bunch","Well, I would say that there has been improvement in our flat glass business in a number of let\u2019s call it P&L areas, so fixed cost obviously we got helped by the lack of a big cold repair that we had last year in our Wichita Falls, Texas plant. ","We also completed the sale of Mount Zion facility in Illinois in the third quarter, so the absence of those two elements helped, so those were fixed cost improvements.","We also saw pricing and demand improvement too. So I would say that, the numbers that you\u2019re looking at are sustainable of these are not one-offs and I think we have changed the direction of the business, we\u2019re at little bit of an inflection point, as you know this is a commercial construction business and that market has improved.","Glass supply and demand is much more imbalanced, we\u2019ve gotten some pricing, we\u2019ve done well in the marketplace, natural gas cost and others have been under control.","So I think we have some elements here for a sustained performance at this level and I think for us as always with this business, we are \u2013 we will listen if there are opportunities to create value for the shareholders in any transactions and at this point I think we\u2019re \u2013 we are just continuing to execute on opportunities in front of us in the marketplace for the business and we\u2019re optimistic that this can continue.","Kevin McCarthy","Fair enough. Thank you, Chuck.","Chuck Bunch","Okay, Kevin.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Frank Mitsch","Congrats on a nice start to the year. I wanted to come back on the raw material question. I know that one of your competitors was talking about seeing a roughly mid-single-digit type of improvement here in the middle of the year, and actually accelerating towards year-end. Are those the sort of figures that folks should think about with PPG, as well?","Chuck Bunch","I\u2019m not sure, I haven\u2019t listened or seen any of the reports on any other industry or competitive activity.","I would say as I indicated we do expect more help as we go through the year and in the second half, I would say my comments would be that sounds a little on the aggressive side.","We\u2019ve seen the oil prices move back up a little bit here and I would say that we expect some help but it not to the magnitude that you mentioned.","Frank Mitsch","All right. That's helpful. And I noticed that packaging was a nice mid-single-digit type of improvement there. What portion of that would you ascribe to BPA-NI? And what's your sense of the competitive balance there? And how should we think about that part of your portfolio?","Chuck Bunch","I think for us, it is certainly a good sign and some of those volume gains were in BPA non-intent or BPA-free coating. So I think it should give you some confidence as an investor that, we\u2019re performing and delivering on the technology challenges for the BPA-free material, we feel pretty confident that we\u2019re well positioned and I think you\u2019re going to continue to see conversions in the food and beverage industry overall on the this technology.","So I think it bodes well for us although I would say, we see other competitors active in this basis, well but I think we feel positive with volume growth that you\u2019ve seen and I think it\u2019s an indication that our technology is going to be, is going to deliver growth in the market.","Frank Mitsch","Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Bob Koort","I was wondering if you could talk on the North American architectural about -- do you have the confidence that there was no underlying issues around the big box distribution channel? And have you seen any changes in DIY versus contractors? That's my first.","And then second, can you talk a little bit about how your PPG-owned stores and Akzo -- or Glidden stores, with the rebranding -- if there's any changes in what you've seen in dynamics there. Thanks.","Michael McGarry","Bob, this is Michael starting with the company owned stores, we merge that the network together so you can\u2019t really pull out legacy Akzo versus the old PPG and as we said in our opening remarks, they were up mid single digits.","So we were happy with that and when we look at the big boxes, we had some pipeline fill last year especially with the stain side we have nice stain position and that\u2019s an early win there, we did not have that pipeline fill in this year.","Overall we think, when we look at the sell out from the big boxes it is progressing at a normal rate obviously the slow start to the paint season given the weather but we saw acceleration starting in mid March.","Chuck Bunch","More your second question Bob that we covered.","Michael McGarry","Yeah, that was the\u2026","Bob Koort","It was just around whether or not you've seen any variation in DIY versus contractor trends. And then in your own big box business, whether there's any regional -- or of any underlying trends, or it was really just an inventory management and tough comp issue.","Michael McGarry","No, I think it was all \u2013 I think the inventory is a one-time and we\u2019re seeing no material differences and how it goes out in the marketplace.","So we\u2019re happy with what we\u2019re seeing and the dealers and the contractors all performing what I would say as a reasonable marketplace.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Laurence Alexander","Can you give a little bit more detail on how much of a lift you should have next year from not having the pipeline adjustments in the North American architectural?","Vince Morales","Hi Laurence, this is Vince. Pipeline adjustments for last year, so it is just not recur so we actually have pipeline fills or higher levels of activity in the first quarter of 2014 and that\u2019s what created the difficult comp.","Laurence Alexander","And then the price mix, can you give a little bit of regional flavor, how that was doing in Europe and Asia?","Vince Morales","Prices generally for the company in all regions were basically flat, the only favorable mix I\u2019d say we had from an overall perspective was in our flat glass business where we moved up, as commercial construction glass is more a value added product versus residential glass.","So, we are moving up the spectrum as we saw more commercial construction into the market based on demand.","Laurence Alexander","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Please proceed.","Jeff Zekauskas","Can you talk about the progress of your titanium dioxide chloride technology in China -- whether it's being well commercialized or well developed, or whether it isn't?","Michael McGarry","Hey Jeff, this is Michael. The plant is in the startup mode. We expect to get commercial quality product in the second half of the second quarter and we will be looking at that. ","So far what we have seen, we have been pleased with everything and we\u2019re happy so far.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. And as my follow-up question, when you think about the changes in suppliers at Lowe's, where they've gone from two paint suppliers to three, do you think that that's a one-off event at Lowe's? Or do you think it's part of -- or it could be part of a larger industry trend as the coatings industry consolidates?","Michael McGarry","Jeff, I don\u2019t know that we want to get into specific customers on this. Certainly Lowe\u2019s made decision and we would expect the other folks to try their own business. So, we will wait and see how that works out.","Chuck Bunch","And just as a reminder, as we said on the first in January, you know, with respect to our own center customers for calendar year 2015, we picked up a little bit more product.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Vincent Andrews","Just a question on Comex. Just looking at your comments on exceeding your net sales range from January, I guess that's in the face of probably some challenging FX there. Could you just talk about what the dynamics are that allowed you to exceed the range?","Michael McGarry","Hi, Michael again. I think we have a strong market share down there. We have increased the number of concessionaires and when we bought the business from 3740, we are up at 3,900. We are adding a concessionaire every other day and that gives us additional penetration to the marketplace.","We also have the strongest brand in Mexico and the government there some election spending or actually some elections later in the year and the local governments are spending some money to help beautify their local areas.","So, that\u2019s also positive. I think there are number of factors that are driving this.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. Thanks very much. I\u2019ll leave it there.","Chuck Bunch","Let me just add to what Michael said. So we \u2013 our anticipation in Comex as we are going to have a total opening of concessionaires this year somewhere between 116 to 119 new locations. Again as Michael said, one every other day.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna financials. Please proceed.","Don Carson","Thank you. Chuck, a question on the trade-off between FX and raws. You outlined that FX will be almost twice what you thought it would be on the January call. You are a little more optimistic on the raw material outlook, perhaps not as much as one of your competitors. But do those two largely balance each other off? That is, more raw material cost reductions offsetting that increased FX headwind?","Chuck Bunch","Well, if you look we were down 7% in currency at least at the top line and we were down much less than that on raw material side. Although not all the currency impacts our bottom line.","So, certainly I think they are offsetting to a certain extent and we think that unfortunately currency is going to be more of a headwind here in the second quarter if these currency trends continue and in the second half it\u2019s a little early to say what we\u2019re going to see on currency but we think we will get little more help on raw materials.","So, we\u2019ve got some, let\u2019s call them countervailing trends here. They didn\u2019t offset indirectly the same ways in the first quarter and it\u2019s going to be how we see this thing play out both on currencies and very unpredictable. We think there is a broader trend in raw materials, but not in a relatively moderate way.","Frank Sklarsky","And Don, just one. This is Frank. Keep in mind that on the cost savings side, I think we do get in our cost structure \u2013 including those savings we anticipate to get now through 2017 due to restructuring program that\u2019s real economic benefit and structural benefit to our structure whereas on the currency side only about 10% of that goes to the bottom line, because of the natural hedge we have by making our product generally where we sell it.","And that\u2019s a not really an economic exposure as much as it\u2019s just a translation exposure from the foreign currency into U.S. dollars. ","The transaction exposure, which would be the real economic impact is very limited and we do hedge a portion of that transaction exposure where we buy in one currency and sell in another currency. But that\u2019s very, very limited. So we just want to clarify that.","Don Carson","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed.","P.J. Juvekar","Yes, hi good afternoon. I have a question on automotive refinish. Can you talk about the dynamics there, as one of your new competitors seems to be gaining some share? So just talk about what the dynamics there, and what kind of organic growth are you seeing in refinish?","Chuck Bunch","P. J. automotive refinish in the developed markets is a relatively mature market. And we have I would say a very incomplete industry growth data in terms of the actual refinish market.","But I would say that for us in terms of the market trends this has always been a competitive market there are few large global players we feel that as PPG, we\u2019re holding our own in the developed market regions and we\u2019re continuing to grow in the developing markets like China and India where these are the fastest growing car parks and automotive refinish markets.","So yes it\u2019s a competitive market, we got a few large global players, we don\u2019t see that competitive intensity decreasing, but we feel as PPG we\u2019re well positioned and certainly maintaining our leadership in the industry.","Frank Sklarsky","If I can add just Chuck\u2019s comments if you look at the technology in the marketplace everything is moving toward a water based technology. I think from our observations we\u2019re the leader in that technology both in the U.S. and in Europe. So I think we\u2019re well positioned from a technology perspective as well.","P.J. Juvekar","Thank you. And then I want to go back to Lowe's and just Lowe\u2019s introduced this new HGTV brand. And I know Olympic is at a lower price point. But what is the risk that a person who walks into a Lowe store to buy Olympic paint could trade up to buy HGTV. I mean do you see any possible impact there?","Chuck Bunch","P. J. I think it\u2019s too early to speculate and I think Lowe\u2019s would like to be the one comment on that.","P.J. Juvekar","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed.","James Sheehan","Thank you. On your architectural coatings sales in the US, if you exclude the impact of the pipeline fills, what would sales have done in percentage terms in the first quarter?","Vince Morales","James this is Vince. So if you look we had good volume growth as Michael mentioned in the company owned stores and comparable growth in the independent distribution market and that was just offset with the \u2013 I will call it the negative year-over-year comps with respect to the pipeline fill.","The store \u2013 the sales in DIY were positive and at the door and we feel good about that going forward. The other thing that was impactful for that business from a sales perspective was currency in Canada was negative, we have a big Canadian business.","Volumes in Canada were positive, but currency was negative. So again we\u2019re pleased with our performance to-date early in the seasons as Michael mentioned and we did our kind of a different weather pattern, weaker in February, stronger in March.","James Sheehan","Okay. And on your commercial construction comments on the glass business, you have often talked about that flowing through into the coatings business over time. Are you starting to see that pick up in coatings on the commercial construction side?","Michael McGarry","Yes Jim, this is Michael. We\u2019re starting to see that it's a little early, because as you know glass goes in the building it\u2019s generally can be anywhere from 12 to 18 months before the paint goes in and upon the size of the building. So it's a little early, but we certainly expect that to flow through as well.","Jim Sheehan","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed.","John Roberts","Good afternoon. Frank, does free cash flow get as impacted by foreign exchange as earnings? Or are there things you can do with working capital and capital spending, some of the offsets in the free cash flow, to sort of dampen out the foreign exchange on free cash?","Frank Sklarsky","Yes, we were irrespective of FX, we're always looking at ways to improve working capital obviously Q1 is usually the weakest from a cash flow perspective as you build a little bit of working capital, perhaps some of the payables from fourth quarter and build up over the working capital and where receivable as things pull up for second quarter.","But we do have initiatives underway and we've made a lot of progress in terms of reducing pass to receivables, we have aggressive targets and try to streamline our inventory levels as well as complexity in each of our businesses during the year we\u2019ll see progress more progress in the latter half of the year.","And then payables are in pretty good shape. Yes, you do see some impact on the translation, but actually I think we're going to have adequate initiatives to offset and make some progress on the working capital and move through the year.","John Roberts","Okay. And then just secondly, is your strength in automotive OEM new wins as strong as the strength that you're currently seeing in the existing business?","Chuck Bunch","It's balanced between what you have in some markets where we did well such as Europe these are - I think - we\u2019re seeing a ramp up of some of the customers that have been maybe most affected by this kind of long recession in Europe so that we\u2019re customer based in Europe you don\u2019t have as many new plants there.","So these are your traditional customers that are now starting to do a little better as we see this pick up in sales, especially in some markets like Southern Europe where Fiat is starting to grow faster.","And in Asia and in China and India for example that's a combination of new wins, but primarily these are new plants that are going in with global and domestic competitors both there and in India. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s more of a combination of new plants and existing market growth.","John Roberts","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Arun Viswanathan","I guess I just wanted to clarify, first, if you can give us some guidance on what interest expense would look like for the rest of the year with the euro refinancing.","Chuck Bunch","Sure. The interest expense was down and of course the numbers we gave was on a net basis went from $35 million to about $18 million in the first quarter as we look out through the rest of the year interest expense will be down between the $20 million to $25 million per quarter.","Our weighted average interest rate in our portfolio right now, we've got debt about $4.6 million weighted average interest rate about 2.5%.","Frank Sklarsky","And Arun, so we did refinance as we said on our press release and Chuck's comments in the fourth quarter we also did put in a $1.3 billion of debt in March. So we had no interest cost for that in January, February so there will be a step up in Q2 of $4 million to $5 million verse Q1 partially rated to that. So mid-20s \u2013 mid to low 20s would be a good number on a go forward basis.","Chuck Bunch","And that\u2019s a net interest expense offset against interest income and the cash balances.","Arun Viswanathan","Okay. Great, thanks. And then just taking that a step further, you guys obviously have quite a bit of balance sheet flexibility here. Can you give us a little update on the M&A pipeline? I know you completed two in the first quarter. Anything else look interesting, maybe in industrial coatings in Europe, right now?","Chuck Bunch","We have an active M&A pipeline, we don\u2019t have any mega deals out there those don\u2019t come along very often, but we have some good discussions going on. We announced the agreement although we have not closed yet on the French aerospace acquisition Le Joint Fran\u00e7ais or LJF from Total so that\u2019s one that we are continuing to work and we hope to be able to close that in the second half of the year. And we have some other deals that we\u2019re currently discussing and we hope that we\u2019ll be able to announce some things as we go through the year, but it\u2019s an active pipeline still we think good opportunities.","Arun Viswanathan","Great, thanks. And if I may, just one more on the Comex opportunity. Is there any way you could quantify the revenue opportunity, now selling some of those legacy PPG products? Thanks.","Vince Morales","Arun, Vince, again. We\u2019re suddenly working closely with the concessionaires on what products they like, what products we\u2019re actually selling in the market. We really need to go through a paint season to fully understand the acceptance of the products and its different obviously by geographic region in Mexico so we do want to give some sidelines for you guys. At some point it\u2019s just too premature right now to do that.","Arun Viswanathan","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please proceed.","Nils Wallin","Yes. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Industrial coatings revenues were down, but profitability was up year-over-year. Would you help us understand what happened there? Did you take some low-margin business out, or did you take some costs out? Just curious as to how you achieved such a solid result.","Chuck Bunch","This was productivity and we continued to perform well in the businesses that are in industrial coating so lot of cost down restructuring benefits from prior years and good growth of profitable business in our automotive OEM industrial coating segments.","Vince Morales","And then Nils, the 2% decline I think in sales revenue really was 7% negative currency, 5% positive OEMs for the segment so that 5% volume dragging along nice incremental margin as we\u2019ve talked about in the past for the reason Chuck just mentioned. So I think that really hastened our improvement.","Nils Wallin","Yes, understood. Understood. I guess last year, Europe saw something like a 20% earnings growth on volumes that were starting to improve. Now it sounds like, in general, you are becoming incrementally positive on the region, some recovery. Should we expect that type of -- or better type of earnings growth in Europe on a constant currency basis for 2015?","Chuck Bunch","Well, I would say that remember we should still see earnings growth improvement in Europe primarily related to our industrial coating segment. So we have not yet seen strong improvement on the construction side of or the performance coating side of the business. But we think there will be some modest growth there and we\u2019re obviously working on these restructuring actions that should help us late in the year.","Vince Morales","And keep in mind too that any incremental volume should accretive to at a pretty nice margin closer to the PC margin than the EBIT margin because the fact that we\u2019re still 15 to 20 percentage points below peak volumes so we don\u2019t have to add much of anything in terms of fixed supply chain cost to get that volume and in fact we continue to find streamlining opportunities on the administrative side. So any volume we do get \u2013 when we get in the commercial spaces on should accrue good margin.","Nils Wallin","Understood. And just one more, if I may. I noticed in the commentary the $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion of potential cash deployment over the next 12 to 18 months was removed. Was that deliberate? Although you had obviously highlighted continued cash deployment issues or goals -- so was that deliberate? Have you changed your view about how much cash will be deployed?","Vince Morales","The cash flow is still working as it did when we made that disclosure and that disclosure and guidance still does apply.","Nils Wallin","Great. Thanks so much.","Chuck Bunch","Thanks Nils.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we do have time for one final question. Your final question comes from the line of Kevin Hocevar with Northcoast Research. Please proceed.","Kevin Hocevar","Hey, good afternoon, everybody. On the auto OEM side of things, you continue to really significantly outperform the industry, which seems to be the norm at this point. So I'm wondering if you could comment on what's driving that. I know technology has something to do with it. Is the gap not closing between the competitors? Do you continue to innovate, and they are not keeping up? Are you are aligned with the right customers? Wondered if you could just comment on that.","Chuck Bunch","I think we\u2019ve been \u2013 it\u2019s a combination of both of those. I think technology and service our performance with existing customers has gone extremely well with the new technologies. We are the largest automotive OEM competitor in the space. We have a broad geographic or global footprint.","So we\u2019re able to I think deliver a value around the world whether you\u2019re talking about North America or Europe or Asia or China any of those markets. So I think we\u2019ve been very well positioned both from a technology service and we have a very broad based customer \u2013 customer array.","And in China as an example we\u2019ve seen both the global OEMs as well as the Chinese domestic players growing and we\u2019ve been positioned on both sides of that so I think it\u2019s a combination.","Kevin Hocevar","Okay. And then just quickly on the US architectural paint business. I noticed the independent dealer channel was up to mid-single-digits, which is kind of strong for that channel. So just wondering if you had any new business wins, or it just happened to have a good quarter.","Vince Morales","No, we had no significant new business wins, but I do think we got a fast start to the year.","Kevin Hocevar","Okay. Thank you very much.","Chuck Bunch","Thank you, Kevin.","Operator","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Morales for closing remarks.","Vince Morales","Thank you.

At this time, all participants are now in a listen-only mode. Later, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed sir.","Vince Morales","Thank you, Philip and good afternoon, everybody. Again, this is Vince Morales, I am the Vice President of Investor Relations for PPG. Welcome to PPG\u2019s first quarter 2014 financial teleconference.","Joining me from PPG today on the call is Chuck Bunch PPG\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Frank Sklarsky, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our comments relate to the financial information we released today, April 17, 2014. I will remind everybody that we posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on our Investor Center at our website www.ppg.com. These slides are available on the webcast site as well and provide additional support to the opening comments Chuck will make in a few moments.

We appreciate your continued interest in PPG Industries.","Today, we reported record first quarter 2014 financial results from continuing operations including records in sales and adjusted earnings per diluted share. This strong performance occurred despite continued mixed global economic conditions and inclement weather that postponed demand in some of our U.S. businesses and emerging region currency headwinds.","Even with these challenges, we delivered record first quarter sales of $3.6 billion, eclipsing last year\u2019s figure by 17%. Our global volumes grew 5%, representing our largest gain in three years. Each region also posted solid volume growth led by the U.S. and Canada as our coatings volumes here improved by 7%. Volume improvements were achieved in most businesses as overall economic conditions in this region remain solid.","Year-over-year European volumes advanced 5%. This represents our first volume increase in that region in 10 quarters, reflecting the early stages of an economic recovery there. Emerging region volume performance also improved year-over-year and sequentially versus the fourth quarter, although results remained mixed by country and industry.","Each of our major regions benefited from improved demand in automotive OEM, aerospace and automotive refinish as we continue to outpace the industry growth rates in these end use markets due to our leading technologies and focus on customer service. Also our architectural coatings EMEA business delivered mid-single digit volume growth, including some benefits from favorable weather.","Supplementing our organic growth were acquisition related sales gains of about $360 million which represents over 11% sales growth. From an earnings perspective, each region delivered higher pretax earnings led by Europe, where our earnings growth was nearly 40%.","We realized excellent earnings leverage on the improved demand as a result of the actions we have taken in the past several years to significantly lower our cost structure.","In addition, our ongoing cash deployment contributed to the earnings growth. This includes higher earnings from additional acquisition related cost synergy achievement and continued implementation of our restructuring program announced last year. We also repurchased $200 million or 1.1 million shares of PPG stock in the quarter.","As a result of all these actions, our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.98, up more than 40% versus last year\u2019s comparable figure and a record for the company. And we more than fully replaced these earnings from the businesses divested in the quarter. As we previously communicated, we finalized the sale of our interest in the Transitions Optical joint venture in our sun lens business at the end of March. Results for the divested businesses are now reported in discontinued operations and prior year results have been recast accordingly. We also introduced a new reportable business segment structure.","Lastly, we received gross proceeds of more than $1.7 billion from the divestitures, which added to our already strong cash position. We ended the quarter with $3 billion of cash and short-term investments including strong first quarter cash from operations aided by the higher earnings and continued improvements in working capital.","Looking ahead, we anticipate solid global growth to continue, but it will not be uniformed across geographies or industries. We remain well positioned with the balance coatings portfolio both regionally and by end used market providing broad growth opportunities, while minimizing the impact of any individual fluctuations.","We anticipate further earnings accretion from our internal actions including additional synergy capture from the ongoing integration of our acquisitions and further implementation of our restructuring program.","Finally, we intend to deploy our cash balance in a timely yet disciplined manner with a continued emphasis on earnings accretive cash uses including additional acquisitions and share repurchases. We are still targeting earnings accretive cash deployment of $3 billion to $4 billion through the end of next year.","Also, we remain focused on returning cash to shareholders. Today, our Board of Directors approved a $2 million of share repurchase program and they also approved a 10% per share dividend increase.","In summary, I am pleased we were able to begin 2014 by delivering record first quarter financial results. We remain focused on aggressively managing our business to deliver continued top and bottom-line growth this year and on creating additional value for our shareholders.","Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And this concludes our prepared remarks. Now operator would you please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Of course. (Operator Instructions). And your first question comes from line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Neal Sangani - Goldman Sachs","Good morning. This is actually Neal Sangani on for Bob. A question on the industrial business in addition to the Akzo acquisition it looks like you\u2019re annualizing point last year where you really started to outpace the industry growth rates. Does that suggest maybe a deceleration in the last three quarters of the year or are you going to see something similar going forward?","Chuck Bunch","Neal, could you repeat the question please?","Neal Sangani - Goldman Sachs","Looking at the industrial business it looks like you\u2019re lapping some of that outperformance over the, specifically in auto OEM over last year when you started outperforming the industry rates. Does that suggest a deceleration going forward or are you going to see a similar pace of outperformance going forward?","Chuck Bunch","I would say that yes, we continue to feel optimistic about the automotive OEM business both the underlying market, where we are seeing good growth rates, as well as our positions in the various geographies and with our customers. So, we can\u2019t be sure we\u2019ll continue to have growth in excess of let\u2019s call it these global averages. But we think we\u2019re doing quite well and have good momentum in the business. And so we would say we remain optimistic overall in the industrial segments and in auto OEM, in the auto OEM business in particular.","Neal Sangani - Goldman Sachs","","And you also didn\u2019t specifically call out raw materials much in the prepared remarks, is that something you are seeing or is it some type of lag that we should see in next coming quarters?","Chuck Bunch","I would say raw materials for us have been relatively benign. We have had a few commodities, actually slightly below our last year\u2019s average, a few slightly above. We are projecting for the year low single-digit inflation in raw materials and we have some other inflationary costs, labor, transportation, natural gas. But right now overall I would say raw materials it\u2019s a relatively benign story for us early in the year.","Neal Sangani - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thank you.","Vince Morales","Thanks Neal.","Operator","All right, your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird","Hey guys, good afternoon. First off just on the macro outlook for Europe, Chuck, how much of the improvement do you think is purely from just easier comparisons over the last couple of years versus any sort of structural improvement. And of the various end markets that you are exposed to in the region, which particular one are you most optimistic for specific to this year?","Chuck Bunch","Well, I would say the end of 2012 and almost all of 2013 Europe was very weak. So we do have let's call that easier comparables compared to last year. But we saw what we thought was some pretty solid volume growth, some improvement in economic industries. So we're more optimistic that this is the early days or early stages of a modest improvement.","We talked about some of the sectors more broadly; automotive has been a nice bright spot in terms of improving volumes for the European region. Aerospace, although smaller in Europe, is still a solid business for us. We finished the first signs of volume improvement and the construction markets, they have been a little slower to recover, but we saw some of that recovery in that. We have signaled the last quarter especially in the Northern; let's say the Northern geographies, the UK, Benelux were areas where the construction markets were also showing some early signs of improvement. So, those are all I think encouraging for us.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird","Okay. And then a commentary on packaging being a little bit weaker in Europe, which particular end market did you see the weakness in, because one of your, presumably one of your bigger customers reported this morning the beverage can side and Europe was actually up for them, so just curious why the difference there?","Chuck Bunch","Well, we have a big exposure in Europe on both the food and the beverage side; there is also a lot of activity in terms of BPA, non-intent or BPA free coatings so a lot of trialing going on there. There is heightened, also heightened competitive activity in the European packaging coatings right now. So there are a few moving pieces on the European side, although the business for us grew nicely in the Asia Pacific region, but there was more competitive activity in Europe during this quarter.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird","Okay. Thanks so much.","Vince Morales","Thanks Ghansham.","Operator","","Alright your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","","Thank you. Chuck just on Comex I know you can\u2019t say too much, but obviously bid the first time. Is there still interest from institutional standpoint towards that asset and beyond Comex can you discuss the M&A pipeline globally for coatings?","Chuck Bunch","","Well, we continue to be interested in making acquisitions both in the coatings space and in the near adjacencies of specialty chemicals. We look at almost all potential acquisitions both small and large; we made just a couple of what I would call smaller this year in the first quarter. So we continue to be interested and look at all of the acquisitions.","I would say the pipeline I find somewhat encouraging at this point. These are not all big deals as we announced with high (inaudible) supply, but I think there is a good level of dialog, I\u2019m little more optimistic today than I was six months ago as we proceed with some of these conversations. So I would say I am encouraged.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","","And so just on auto OEM you have done a fantastic job and this business is growing well above the market. How long can it continue? Can you grow 8%, 9% for the full year or will grow slow back half of the year in auto OEM?","Chuck Bunch","I think auto OEM in terms of the general market if you look at the [overly], we\u2019re seeing here in the North American market we\u2019re still seeing good growth, we\u2019ll be at little or maybe slightly lower than where we were last year, but we\u2019re just looking 4%, 5% growth. We saw the sales come back here in North America in March. So we feel pretty good about market conditions here in Europe as we discussed it is finally showing some volume improvement and some strength and China has continued as our largest market in Asia, it\u2019s continued fairly soft.","So we have again a good mix of technological innovations all layers in the automotive coatings profile. And so we think that we have a good opportunity with the technologies and we do business with almost all of the major automotive OEMs both the global ones and it looks very strong national domestic players around the world. So we think that we\u2019re well positioned, we\u2019ll continue the slower momentum and the overall market on a global basis, we think is pretty good.","Frank Sklarsky","And David, this is Frank. Recall that we continued to do well when the Japanese and European makers locate new manufacturing facilities outside their home markets because of our product consistency service level or whatever. So the transplant facilities, we\u2019re getting plants, we\u2019re getting layer. So to the extent we\u2019re able to continue to do that when we may not have the incremental several digits percentage above the market growth rates as we have in the past we think we have ways to continue to enhance our share position.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","","Thank you very much.","Chuck Bunch","Thanks Dave.","Operator","","All right. And our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse.","John McNulty - Credit Suisse","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So now that you have gotten a lot of the transactions done, transitions done, access being integrated in, when we start thinking about your SG&A line and its ratio to sales, how should we be thinking about that going forward. Where can you get that overtime like order where you\u2019ve been in the kind of low 20s in the past. Is that an area that we can think about going forward should it be lower than that like how should we think about that?","Vince Morales","John, this is Vince. I think the first quarter would be approximately the first quarter doesn\u2019t include any of the divested businesses all of the results [both] last year with commodity chemicals and this year with Transitions has been moved to discontinued operations. So the first quarter would give you a proxy for that particular quarter\u2019s return on sales.","We did restate the entire 2013 year that\u2019s available via in 8-K filing. And you could see again in those numbers for 2013 by quarter what our sales, what our SG&A as a percent of sales was last year. And that would include some seasonality to it; you really have to look at it on a quarterly basis, buts that\u2019s what I would point to you o John.","John McNulty - Credit Suisse","Okay. I mean maybe taking it from a slightly different angle, when we think about some of your businesses are really just starting to recover now, you also have Akzo really kind of early in this integration stages. So I guess as we think about how the SG&A launch progressed over the next few years versus your sales, how should we be thinking about the leverage that you should be getting off of the SG&A line going forward?","Frank Sklarsky","Yes. And we don\u2019t want to necessarily pull whether it\u2019s going to be 50 basis points or 100 basis points. There will definitely be operating leverage. So when we characterize the incremental profitability of 30% to 40% plus going to the bottom line from incremental revenue dollar, some of that comes from the fixed base in the cogs line and some of that comes from the operating leverage from the SG&A line, because the only part of SG&A where we have to add traditional revenue dollars is sales resources. The back office as we continue to move toward shared services environments in the regions, will definitely give us leverage and SG&A.","So, that\u2019s got a specific percentage, but there will clearly be the opportunity to gradually reduce that as a percent of revenue as the markets recover. Particularly in Europe, where we have an infrastructure there, we\u2019re accelerating, moving things into shared services center in Czech Republic and so we don\u2019t have to add incremental resources on that pure G&A line as the revenue line creates.","John McNulty - Credit Suisse","Great. Thanks very much.","Vince Morales","Thanks John.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America. Please proceed. ","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America","Yes, good afternoon. If I look at your volume growth at the company level of nearly 5%. It\u2019s double or more than double that of your principal global competitor that reported this morning. And I guess, I\u2019m tempted to ask you about market share trends in that context. Obviously there is a mix differential and I saw your plus 10 on auto OEMs volume. But if I put auto OEM on the side, are there other categories where you feel you\u2019re gaining significant market share versus your competitors these days?","Chuck Bunch","Well, I would say first of all Kevin that we -- today is a busy day for us. We had our Board Meeting, our Annual Shareholders Meeting. So we haven\u2019t had an opportunity to look at our competitor\u2019s, either their earnings reports or their slides or Q&A. But I would say that we don\u2019t have the same, even if you look at the global business profile, we don\u2019t have quite the same mix of businesses. And I think you indicated we did well in automotive OEM as that market continues to recover. They don\u2019t have as much exposure with the acquisition that we made of their business here in North America. So some of our strongest volume growth as you know was here in North America as the economy despite the weather continues to improve, they don\u2019t have as much exposure here.","So those would be some things that I would point to but it\u2019s really too early and it\u2019s only one quarter to comment that there would be any change in share, it may be do as much to just regional mix for the company.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America","And then I guess second quarter on returning capital to shareholders, is the timeline are likely pace of execution on your $2 billion share repurchase program meant to be coincident with the end of 2015 bracket on your 3 billion to 4 billion goal or is that not necessarily the case, perhaps you can just comment on what your strategy will be there?","Frank Sklarsky","","Yes. So, this Frank. We have left no timeframe specifically on a $2 billion. What we have said is we are going to deploy the $3 billion to $4 billion over the next 12 to 18 months as shareholder friendly manner. What we would say about the share purchase is we are committed to returning that cash to shareholders but the pace and the timing will be dependent upon market and economic conditions but it will also be dependent upon the magnitude and the timing of acquisition activity. And we\u2019ve said consistently that acquisitions, accretive acquisitions would take priority. But the message here is that we will deliver that value to shareholders by acquisitions when available and then also making sure that we maintain that commitment to return that cash to shareholders or deploy that cash I would say in accretive manner to the extent that we don\u2019t execute all of that $3 billion to $4 billion acquisition activity over the next 12 to 18 months. We will continue to have share repurchases be an integral part of the capital allocation philosophy.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America","Okay. And then last question if I may. Can you speak to your U.S. architectural coating sales by channel please?","Chuck Bunch","Well, I would say that we had some mix effects and I would say different strength by channel, Kevin. Overall, I would say that we had good strength in U.S. stores channel. We\u2019re saying mid single-digit improvement there, again we have some moving parts because of some of the store closures after as part of the integration. We saw also volume increases in our home center channel, although weakest of the few channels. And we think it\u2019s more related to weather here with kind of the geographic mix. But the dealer channel was weaker from a volume standpoint in the first quarter here in North America.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America","Thank you very much.","Chuck Bunch","Thanks Kevin.","Operator","All right. Next question comes from line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","Chuck, a question on your outlook, does this stronger start to the year and perhaps better than expected operating leverage make you more optimistic on your earnings growth potential for calendar 2014?","Chuck Bunch","","Yes, I do feel a little better, Don. And Europe was encouraging. Here I think, we did well despite what I think was some poor weather conditions that affected some of the end use markets as well as just sort of supply chain transportation. In China, there has been a lot of discussion around China, the automotive related businesses in China continue to do well. This is automotive OEM, automotive parts, automotive refinish, some of the mixed and some of the other end use markets in Asia, like consumer electronics. But as I mentioned packaging, coatings, some of the construction related markets in China held up. So I would say here in April, as we look back on the quarter, I would say I\u2019m more encouraged for 2014. We have some geopolitical events, we\u2019re monitoring currencies in emerging regions, there are few watch-outs I guess as you say, but in general especially based on the first quarter, we\u2019re encouraged.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","","And I want to go back to issue of how you are outgrowing the industry on autos and not just the mix of say transplants; is it a technology issue or your better technology for example in e-coat and things like that and are there other opportunities to grow through technology transfer amongst your various businesses?","Chuck Bunch","","I would say yes, we were introducing and I think we sort of talked about this last year, the introduction of the new generation side of e-coat. And I think that has continued to build momentum for us. We\u2019ve taken that product global with our global customer base. And so, I'd say from an echo perspective, we feel technology, innovation and development backed up by our service and globalization in all regions of the world. So, I would say that's an example.","And then we are also working with new contact processes that would be in the top coat layer. This is primers to base and clear coats and some compression of these layers; we've had good waterborne technology introductions. And I think the advantages of some of our new technologies are most evident when you have this new Greenfield plants sort of starting around the world especially in the emerging regions, but also here in places like Mexico or the Southern part of the U.S. So I would say we are very pleased with the technology that we've been developing and the receptivity on the part of our customers. And I would say this is probably the biggest story around the growth that we\u2019ve had in auto OEM.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","Thank you.","Vince Morales","Thanks Don.","Operator","All right, our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.","Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities","Good afternoon gentlemen.","Chuck Bunch","Hi Frank.","Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities","Obviously you had some positive volumes overall in Southern Europe and you were able to translate that into fantastic earnings improvement. What role is our cost reduction is playing? And what [inning] are we in some of the cost reduction efforts Frank had outlined in the past?","Frank Sklarsky","Yes, that\u2019s right. This is Frank. So we had announced of course that 2013 our restructuring program in the third quarter, which had a lot to do with completing of synergies for the North American Akzo business that we acquired, but also where we had identified some rationalization opportunities in other markets which were perhaps weak up to that point. And so that is playing a role and once we take that cost out obviously that the teams have been dedicate to making sure that as revenue grows we do not add that cost back and so that leverage is taking place.","And as we go through 2014, we are expecting somewhere between $75 million and $90 million of incremental savings from these restructuring and synergy programs. So that will continue to benefit the bottom-line and the leverage that you spoke about.","Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities","All right, terrific. And you mentioned I guess mid single-digit margins on the Akzo North American business and I guess with all (inaudible) headed to the mid-teens what sort of timing are you thinking up there?","Vince Morales","","Frank, it\u2019s Vince. One thing we did in the first quarter, which I\u2019ll remind due to seasonally slower quarter for everybody in the architectural business in this country, our projections will be in the above 10% by the end of this year on a run rate basis and that our targeted level by the middle to end of \u201815 which is 12.5%, 13%.","Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities","Terrific. And then lastly, you referenced some of the positive benefits from weather in Europe, is there a case that there might have been some pull forward from Q2 to Q1 or not necessarily?","Chuck Bunch","","I think it\u2019s always a good indicator when you get better weather in the first quarter and it tends to lengthen the season. Did we pull some things forward? I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that, it depends on how the weather shapes up. But I would say we are encouraged because even in market that\u2019s been weaker in Europe Frank, Eastern Europe now they did have better weather, but we saw them finally bounce back and we have some nice shares in markets like Poland where we had struggled a little bit during the latter half of 2012 and 2013.","So I think the weather is helping, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to produce here in the second quarter some snap back in terms of the volume momentum. I think we feel pretty good that we have some strength here that the weather just will make the season longer and then hopefully better if it holds out for the year.","Frank Sklarsky","Yes. And then if you look at the global insights projections as Chuck said in his remarks, the recovery still hasn\u2019t been totally even by countries. There are still some countries in Western Europe that haven\u2019t recovered as fast as others so that still represents upside for us in particularly in some of the architectural markets.","Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities","Terrific. Thank you so much.","Vince Morales","Thanks Frank.","Operator","All right, our next question comes from line of John Roberts from UBS. Please proceed.","John Roberts - UBS","Good afternoon. Chuck when you talk about adjacencies in terms of your acquisition strategies is it anything in surface chemistry related or how broad would you define adjacency areas?","Chuck Bunch","Well, when we talk about adjacencies we are talking about businesses that we are already in the end used markets that we were already in. So if you look at some of the best examples adhesives, ceilings, pretreatment these are three examples of adjacent chemistries that build on our strength we\u2019re already in these businesses in automotive, in aerospace in industrial and this would be what I would call near adjacencies with good synergies and similar end used markets surface chemistries would be obviously one of those.","John Roberts - UBS","","And could you talk about anything in the silicas area?","Chuck Bunch","We have now reconstituted the business of specially coatings and materials that includes our precipitated silicas business along with OLED, dyes, Teslin and some of our research capabilities in optical in to the monomer business. So we had not excluded silicas as a possible area of growth. You saw the comments that we made around that business unit for the first quarter, they have a very good growth across the spectrum of the end use markets and products there in specialty coatings in materials. So we would not exclude growth in the silicas business and margins and growth performance quite good, not only in the first quarter that we just finished but over the last year and half to two years, we see good growth in that business. And we\u2019re looking forward to a very solid year for the businesses.","John Roberts - UBS","","Okay. Thank you.","Vince Morales","","Thanks John.","Operator","All right. Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Sure, thanks very much. Just looking at your 5% volume growth and some of the markets for your outperforming the balance of the industry. Could you talk a little bit about how you\u2019re thinking about price here, are you happy with your price level particularly in Europe, is that something that you think there could be, maybe the high level, just some focus on going forward and are you premium priced as it relates to your business in autos or what\u2019s the outlook here?","Chuck Bunch","Are you talking now about the automotive business or more broadly for PPG\u2019s coatings business?","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Well, I was talking more broadly about the European business, which is about the pickup, I was just wondering if you\u2019re happy where the price points sold out? And then sort of separately to autos, broadly where you are from the pricing perspective just given your market share performance relative to the peers?","Chuck Bunch","As we talked about, we see a relatively benign raw material inflation environment at least here early in the year. That\u2019s always been one of the drivers of the inflationary environment for our pricing strategies. We typically don\u2019t price off a narrow, a more narrowly focused spot pricing opportunistic. We tend to be longer term in our approach.","So, at this point, I would say that even though there maybe some tactical opportunities in products or specific markets, I would say the pricing environment today in Europe is relatively flat. And that\u2019s consistent with the major inflationary factors, although we are watching. So that there has been some discussion that even though there has been a lot of inflation in Europe over the last few quarters, that could pick up later this year if we see continued volume growth. So we\u2019re watching carefully, but right at this point, I would say there are no major initiatives.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Okay, thanks very much. That\u2019s very helpful. I\u2019ll pass along.","Chuck Bunch","Thanks Vince.","Operator","Alright. Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Please proceed.","Dan Jester - Citi","Good afternoon, it\u2019s Dan Jester on for P.J. Circling back to the architectural business in North America. One of your competitors is rolling out a premium branded product through the one of the bigger independent dealer channels. And I was just wondering if you are seeing any changes in that competitive landscape or maybe promotions ahead of the spring painting season?","Chuck Bunch","","I think I know what you are referring to and at this point I would say, it is very, it\u2019s early in the season to see what if any impact, any rollout would have in the independent dealer or hardware store channel. I think we have all been encouraged by what we are seeing in terms of a market potential. I think you are going to see a lot of new product line extensions, we\u2019ve seen new campaigns supporting some of these rollouts and introductions. So I think it\u2019s going to be a competitive space here in 2014. But I think the opportunities will be there for all of the suppliers if the current momentum around the construction markets is maintained.","Dan Jester - Citi","Okay. And then secondly and I apologize if I missed this from earlier. Have you completed all of the Akzo related store closings and can you sort of update us on what your expectation is for sort of the net change in your company own stores will be in 2014 versus 2013?","Vince Morales","","Yes. This is Vince. We have completed the store closures that we earmarked for the acquisition on a net basis, it was just around 100 stores and we move to a growth mode from a store perspective. On a short to mid to long-term basis, we are going to add 25 to 40 stores a year, and a lot of these differ each year so that\u2019s we\u2019re starting with that growth expectation beginning this year.","Dan Jester - Citi","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","All right. Our next question comes from line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies","Good afternoon. Two quick questions on incremental margins, first for Europe. How far do you think you can expand volumes before incremental margins start to deteriorate? When do you see there is a 10% or 15% kind of leeway before you see a step down? And secondly on the emerging markets, do you think that you need to see a [sergeant] level of volume growth, underlying volume growth to start to see higher incremental margins there?","Chuck Bunch","We\u2019ll take the European one first. We still think there is a good amount of headroom. You mentioned 10% to 15% that\u2019s only a possibility because when you look at capacity utilization levels as where they are and with volumes still as of the end of the year about 20% below peak there is ample headroom to continue to accrete the bottom-line at that 30% to 40% for a while.","When you talk about emerging markets, it depends on the emerging market; Latin America where our profitability is a little linear than it is in some of the markets like China for instance, we have a lot of opportunity in Latin America for instance by changing the mix of our inputs so as we\u2019re putting capital into -- putting resin capacity in Brazil for instance that will give us some kind of a step function improvement in raw material costs which will go right to the bottom-line avoiding duties on incoming raw materials.","For China for instance in some cases we will be building new capacity so while you might not get the same leverage to the bottom line on the incremental revenue we will clearly be accreting margin to the bottom line in a way that still creates shareholder value because we\u2019re getting good IRRs on our new capacity investments. And so we make those decisions on a case by case basis. We have plans over the next couple of years to enhance our capacity of shipping the automotive industrial space and that tends to be very accretive from a value creation standpoint. But also -- and while it may not substantially enhance margin percentage it will substantially enhance margin dollars per unit, per dollar invested.","Vince Morales","And Laurence this is Vince. One other comment I will make on Q1 in particular with respect to emerging regions is, we did see higher earnings in emerging regions in Q1. Those earnings were on higher volumes, but those earnings were tempered a bit by foreign currency, negative foreign currency translation. And so on a non-U.S. denominator local currency perspective our margins were higher than they were and we brought them back to the U.S.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies","","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And just [going to tease out] one nuance on the emerging market side. Are there any regions where a small acquisition could have a material change in market structure and therefore help margins that way?","Chuck Bunch","I would -- I\u2019m trying to think of but I would say that, it\u2019s somewhat theoretical as a question, in some cases that can happen but at this point I wouldn\u2019t say that that\u2019s a significant factor or something that we see as likely.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies","","Thank you.","Vince Morales","Thanks Laurence.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Nils Wallin from CLSA. Please proceed.","Nils Wallin - CLSA","Thanks and good afternoon gentlemen. On marine, I know that it stabilized over the last couple of quarters, but it\u2019s still trending down. When do you guys think that you will see at least a flat comp or a positive comp in that business?","Chuck Bunch","I would say in the, we should see stability through the course of 2014. And we're looking for growth returning on a volume basis in marine OEM in 2015.","Nils Wallin - CLSA","Okay. The independent channel in North American architectural is, it's consistently been called out as weak. Is there any reason that this needs to be a channel that PPG needs to be in or even if you don't need to be in it, there is a significant loss of synergy, if you try to exit that channel?","Chuck Bunch","Well, we have a long-term commitment to the inter channel, it's been one of PPG's strength. So over the years in the North American market, we intend to continue to support our independent dealer base, the channel has not grown as much over the last decade or more, largely due to the growth of some of the national home centers and the company owned stores.","But it\u2019s still an important channel for the industry and an important channel for PPG. And we continue to support it and we work to ensure that it can be as successful as possible and it should be well positioned with the improvements that we see in the underlying markets over the next couple years wasn\u2019t as evident in the first quarter and the dealers do tend to watch their inventories a little more closely, our dealer profile is skewed more to the, let\u2019s call it colder weather regions. So we think they were impacted a little more than the other channels, but we think there will be growth there as well during the course of this year.","Nils Wallin - CLSA","Understood, thanks. And just finally in the last two years obviously there has been a dramatic change in the portfolio. Is there any reason to expect that there are going to be dramatic changes going forward or have you strategically looked now more towards just intensifying your coatings division?","Chuck Bunch","","We think that we have largely completed the transformation. There are continued consolidation and growth opportunities in the coating space and some of the new adjacencies that we talked about on this call. So I think you have seen largely complete now the PPG transformation. Although there are couple of business units that aren\u2019t in the coatings or adjacent space but these are very small now for PPG\u2019s total portfolio.","Nils Wallin - CLSA","Thanks for your help.","Vince Morales","","Thanks, Nils.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn from Longbow Research. Please proceed.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","","Good afternoon guys and congratulations on a good start to the year.","Vince Morales","","Thanks Dmitry.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","","Question on we touched on the weather impact in architectural and it didn\u2019t sound like it was all that material for you although you did called it out in the press release, but was there a weather related factor in your collision repair business on the automotive aftermarket side or may be not in this quarter but do you expect maybe a little bit of a pickup in that business in the second quarter as people get around to repairing their things and reruns?","Chuck Bunch","We think so. The weather, the inclement weather actually helps the automotive refinish business, Dmitry as you know. So, we had more than our share of it here in the northern part of the U.S. although in many cases, one it was either -- we saw a lot of accidents, so a lot of let\u2019s call it, built up demand that didn\u2019t get completed in the first quarter and we also had some supply chain issues. We\u2019re shipping a lot of order base automotive refinish coatings now. So those supply lines were disrupted at several times during the quarter. So we think that the next few quarters for our North American business are going to be good, because there will be a back -- and there is a backlog of work now in the collision shops. And so we think that the next couple of quarters here in North America should be good ones.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","Switching gears a little bit, if you talk about your Asian paint business and how that\u2019s doing if I would recall for much of 2013, it was under pressure and delivered some lower volumes from time to time. Are you seeing that business turnaround or at least stabilize and sort of what\u2019s your expectations for that in 2014?","Chuck Bunch","This is Asia Pacific in general for the region or Asian Paints, our joint venture in India Dmitry, what -- we were cutting out there as you were asking the question?","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","Okay. I am talking about the general Asian paint business as architectural coatings that you report in the performance materials. Well, now that you are reporting all your coatings, but -- all your paint, but when you used to report paint being basically North America and Asia, talking about the Asian piece of that?","Chuck Bunch","","Okay. Well, we have, in this case, if we look at architectural coatings businesses in Asia for us, those are two principal markets Australia, New Zealand and China. Australia, New Zealand, the market is positive. We saw some growth here in as we -- in the second half of 2013 and the first quarter, so our position in Australia continues to improve. We have seen volume growth and improved profitability.","China, likewise, so it\u2019s a smaller business, so we have a smaller regional business in China focused in the East Coast major cities. And we saw an improvement there as well, again smaller volume growth for our business than what you have seen in some of the other western Tier II and Tier III cities. But we saw a nice improvement for the business despite let\u2019s call it the smaller size of our business in China that did grow there in terms of volume and profit.","Vince Morales","","Yes. The only thing I would add to that is the fact that we did have good volume growth in those architectural markets in Asia, fortunately in the first quarter versus the prior year we were subject to currency changes on the translation side, principally in Australia and a significant change ever since Q1 \u201813.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","And then finally, I\u2019d just like to follow-up on a question asked earlier around your strategy in the U.S. or North American independent dealer channel. You\u2019ve increased your exposure there obviously, with the Akzo acquisition and then recently you have announced a closer tie with the group of stores in the Northeast.","There has been some disruptions in the business and one of the largest suppliers into that market and they are under 3rd or 4th CEO and losing track already. Is that an opportunity for you even though this is a market that maybe trailing sort of the growth rate that you would expect from company on stores or from big box DIY? Is it still a market that given maybe a little bit easier competitive environment, where you can gain some share and actually become a more meaningful supplier into that channel?","Chuck Bunch","Well, we feel that we have been -- we\u2019ve had a commitment to the independent dealer channel here for many years. And we\u2019ve reaffirmed that Dmitry, even with the acquisition that we made last year where we did pick up additional exposure to the independent dealer channel here in Canada but also got additional stores and home center sales as well.","So, we think it\u2019s been a -- it\u2019s an opportunity for us to bring more value to the independent dealers, so many of them are committed to staying in the market and growing despite the competitive environment. So, we think it\u2019s a good opportunity for us. Yes, it\u2019s not as fast growing as the other channels, but we think there is a good role for us. We can support these dealers and we\u2019re going to continue to do that.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","Thanks very much.","Vince Morales","Thanks Dmitry.","Operator","All right. And our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Please proceed.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays","","Hey guys.","Vince Morales","","Hey Duffy.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays","","Just quick question or maybe not quick. Talk about the puts and takes and the difference for your business and architectural in the recovery that\u2019s left in Europe versus the recovery that\u2019s left in the U.S. kind of where do you see the most upside in those two architectural markets say over the next three to four years?","Chuck Bunch","","Well, let me think about that for a moment. I think we are in the early innings of the recovery in Europe. This has been -- and we have seen negative volumes for the last three or four years in the market. We saw the biggest drops in the Southern Mediterranean regions in Europe. So, I would say that as we look at the markets now of UK and Benelux starting to come out and we are encouraged there. Our biggest market in Europe is France. We didn\u2019t see as much an improvement overall in the construction indices in France. So, I would say that\u2019s our biggest opportunity. We don\u2019t have much exposure in Southern Europe. There is soft recovery there, we have a smaller exposure. So I don\u2019t think we have as much to benefit in Spain or in Italy at this point. And Eastern Europe has also been bettered. And the first quarter you saw that for the first time we saw some nice improvement in markets I told.","So I would say that biggest opportunity -- I think we are still in the early innings of the regions or countries that the growth has restarted. And I think for our biggest engine in Europe which is France, if we can get them moving; and you have seen recent elections and more of a commitment around returning to growth in the French markets and as that works its way through to the construction markets, I would say that\u2019s our greatest opportunity. So still early days in Europe on the construction side, I think automotive is actually probably a little bit ahead of construction because they have a large export base in Europe.","Here I would say that we\u2019re couple of years into the recovery. And although it has been slower in coming than we thought, so I do think that we\u2019re going to see several more years Duffy of growth in architectural coatings here in this market. We haven\u2019t seen the commercial construction or non-residential side come back as strong, most of the improvement we\u2019ve seen in residential. And that\u2019s coming and helping us. DIY was probably a little more affected here in the first quarter with weather, but I think we have more to go on residential. And non-residential which we were getting more optimistic about in back half of last year, things slowed down a little bit we think more due to weather. So I think that\u2019s going to provide the impetus for the next couple of years, completing this kind of residential recovery and with non-residential stuff coming through on an extended basis.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays","Great. Thanks guys.","Vince Morales","Thanks Duffy.","Operator","All right. Next question comes from the line of Ivan Marcuse from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Ivan Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Thanks. A couple of quick questions, on top, the European question that was just asked. What would your volumes be, how much are they pre-downturn levels, so if you compare them where they are today versus I guess 2011 when they started to tail off?","Vince Morales","We typically go back Ivan to 2008, that\u2019s kind of a point in time we started to see volumes fall in Europe. The volumes today versus 2008 levels are still down, high teens percentages even with the early recovery we saw in first quarter.","Ivan Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets","","Got you. And then where are we and how much in synergies were -- it helped I guess performance chemicals, or maybe performance coatings on -- from Akzo and how much more is there to go, how much should you see going to the year?","Vince Morales","","We expect out of the 200 synergies that we said will be our ultimate goal by early 2015, our run rate by the end of this year should be around 170 or so out of that 200, with about 30 left to go remainder of the year. We closed 2013 at a run rate of 100, so about 70 incremental kind of ramped up through 2014 from that 100 run rate to 170 run rate this year.","Ivan Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets","","Great, thanks for taking my questions.","Vince Morales","","Sure. Thanks Ivan.","Operator","All right. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Reitzes from BroadArch Capital.","Robert Reitzes - BroadArch Capital","Hi. Most of questions I had have been answered. The one I would ask is that when you look at all the damage that was done by the storms in the first part of the year, have you guys seen a pick up or do you anticipate pick up in the sale of paint et cetera during the second and third quarters as repair and modeling?","Chuck Bunch","Yes, we do. [Weather] like we have takes its toll. We saw pick up last year after hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast. I think we\u2019ll -- we should be in a position in the second and third quarter for this year to, I think capture more opportunities both from the [storms] and from the people that weren't able to get out and shop for some of their painting needs during January and February. And I think we talked about the automotive refinish business, lot of accidents here in the first quarter that lot of those didn't get repaired. So those are two examples both on the architectural side and the automotive refinish side where we think over the next couple of quarters it should get some help here from some of this demand.","Robert Reitzes - BroadArch Capital","Thanks.","Vince Morales","Thanks Bob.","Operator","Alright, our next question comes from the line of Kevin Hocevar from Northcoast Research.","Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research","Hey, good afternoon everybody. I was wondering if you could give us an update on the level of success you had and the price increases you had at the Paint Stores in the U.S. and if you expect that to spill over in any other channels?","Chuck Bunch","We were able to capture a low single-digit increase, price increase in the Paint Stores during the first quarter.","Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research","Okay.","Chuck Bunch","Have those and carry through for the remainder of 2014.","Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research","Okay. And then just another quick one when you parsed out the pieces in the performance of this coating segment, could you give us an idea of how much the architectural EMEA business margins improved in the quarter?","Vince Morales","Hey Kevin, this is Vince. That was the business as Frank mentioned earlier that had the most leverage potential. Volumes were up 5% and the business sales last year were separate segments. So you can easily do the math, 5% volume increase and again I would tell that as we said coming into this year we expected incrementals somewhere between 30% to 50% and again that was the one business we certainly year marked is having highest potential given the largest drop in volume over the last couple of years.","Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Vince Morales","","Thanks Kevin.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JP Morgan. Please proceed.","Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan","Thanks. What was cash flow from operations in the quarter?","Frank Sklarsky","","Cash flow from ops in the quarter I think Jeff, give me one second I will find it. You could ask if you\u2019ve another question Jeff.","Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan","Sure. On a pro forma basis the Akzo, both the acquired Akzo sales in the United States grow versus what they were when they were run by Akzo in the first quarter of last year?","Chuck Bunch","","Jeff they were very comparable with last year, slightly ahead, but very comparable. We shuttered about 100 stores as part of the synergy capture.","Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan","And into the cost reduction that you are doing there since the sales aren\u2019t growing very fast, what\u2019s left. I mean what is the cost that will come out for you to hit your synergy targets? Are there more plants to close or how do you conceptualize that?","Chuck Bunch","","Well, we still have -- we are working through the operations and supply chain portion, some of those changes take quite sometime as we are moving production obtained around the different plants, different distribution centers, we still have back office opportunities that we are working through as we integrate the two organizations those would be two of the bigger buckets left.","Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan","And now that we will annualize the Akzo business, what\u2019s the normalized SG&A growth going forward? Is it a couple of percent or is it [cashed] in that?","Frank Sklarsky","Looking for the company in total?","Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan","Yes.","Frank Sklarsky","We should be I mean if you look at the run rate where we are today, we will be going up from our current run rate in the first quarter. We should be continuing a downward trend, gradual downward trend in terms of SG&A as a percent of revenue.","Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan","All right, okay.","Chuck Bunch","And you asked the cash flow, the cash and I want to make sure you hit the right terminology here, you\u2019ll see the Q coming out in very near future obviously. But cash from operating activities from continuing operations, a $130 million of course that one and then you have some from [discops] and continuing ops about $160 million that\u2019s before CapEx obviously. And we\u2019ll spend between $500 million to $600 million this year in CapEx probably ramping up a little bit more (inaudible) a little less earlier in the year.","Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan","And then lastly, you bought back about $200 million from stock this quarter, how did you pick that number, why wasn\u2019t it zero or $500 million, where did $200 million come from?","Frank Sklarsky","We\u2019ve said that we will continue to have share purchase the integral part of our capital cash deployment strategy. Obviously we look at the entire landscape between dividends, organic CapEx, share repurchase and acquisition activity, we get a little bit of acquisition in the first quarter [high-temp] coatings that was announced, a couple other very small ones that we announced. And we had a remaining offer on our existing share repurchase authorization when we close the year and that was enough that we felt prudent about for the quarter.","Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Chuck Bunch","Thank you, Jeff.","Operator","","All right then. We have one more question coming from line of Rich O'Reilly from Revere Associates. Please proceed.","Rich O'Reilly - Revere Associates","Hi. Thank you all. Jeff, beat me to the question about Akzo. Okay thanks a lot guys.","Chuck Bunch","","Thank you.","Vince Morales","","Thank you.","Operator","At this time we have no further questions and I would now like to turn the call back over to Vince Morales for closing remarks.","Vince Morales","","Okay. And I\u2019d like to thank everybody for their time and interest in PPG today. If there are further questions please contact me in the Investor Relations section.

My name is Jamie, and I will be your conference specialist today. [Operator Instructions] Please also note today\u2019s event is being recorded.","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference call over to John Bruno, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.","John Bruno","Thank you, Jamie, and good afternoon, everyone. Once again, this is John Bruno, Director of Investor Relations. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our second quarter 2018 financial results conference call.","Joining me on the call from PPG are, Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, July 19, 2018. I will remind everyone that we have posted detailed commentary and associated presentation slides on the Investors center of our website, ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the opening comments Michael will make shortly. Following Michael\u2019s perspective on the company\u2019s results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&A session.","Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the company\u2019s current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG\u2019s operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risk, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements.","This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG\u2019s filings with the SEC.","Now, let me introduce PPG Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.","Michael McGarry","Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone.","Let me start by reminding everyone that we communicated on June 28 that PPG's Audit Committee had completed its investigation in the allegations of violations of PPG's accounting policies and procedures. We have filed restated financial statements for the fiscal years 2016 and 2017 and certain quarterly periods within those fiscal years in order to correct PPG's previously issued financial statements. The restated financial statements, additional details regarding these restatements and the findings of the investigation are contained in PPG's Form 10-KA and Form 10-Q that were filed on June 28, 2018.","As you all know, PPG has been in existence for 135 years and has earned a reputation as a highly ethical and credible organization. I am disappointed that there was a need to restate our financial statements. Our Audit Committee and I are participating in the oversight of the remediation plan.","As I said in our press release, we are 100% committed to take actions that are consistent with our ethics and values and fully meet the expectations of both internal and external stakeholders.","Unwavering adherence to our core standards of financial integrity and honesty remains a top priority and a focus for all PPG employees. To date, we have made good progress addressing the corrective actions identified during the Audit Committee investigation. I am personally committed to ensuring that PPG will have a robust control environment and look forward to reinstating our reputation.","As we have disclosed, we have proactively communicated with the SEC on this matter. It is PPG's policy not to discuss matters that are being reviewed by regulatory bodies. Finally, I want to share my appreciation with all our stakeholders for your patience as we have worked our way through this investigation.","Now I will move on to our second quarter results. Today, we reported second quarter 2018 financial results. For the second quarter, our net sales were approximately $4.1 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.90. This represents an adjusted EPS growth rate of nearly 6% for the quarter which included benefits from a lower tax rate year-over-year.","The earnings growth we achieved was despite elevated raw material inflation and higher logistic cost during the quarter which we partially offset with selling price improvements and strong cost management.","In addition, we continue to benefit from our ongoing cash deployment focused on earnings accretion. For the second quarter, our reported net sales were up almost 9%, while our sales in local currencies increased by about 6%. Supporting the higher local currency sales were volume growth of more than 3% with balanced contribution from both of our reporting segments. For the first half in aggregate volumes grew nearly 2%.","Selling prices increased more than 2% in the second quarter marking the fifth consecutive quarter of improvement over the previous sequential quarter. While modest in overall magnitude in certain business units, we continue to decline some volume as we pursue higher selling prices and prioritize margin recovery.","Foreign currency translation was still favorable year-over-year, but by a lower amount in comparison to the first quarter, as the U.S. dollar strengthened during the quarter against several key currencies.","Sales were favorably impacted by approximately $90 million from currency translation and pretax income favorably impacted by about $15 million. We expect foreign currency translation to turn to a headwind in the third quarter based on current exchange rates.","Looking at some of our business trends in the second quarter. In the Performance Coatings segment, aerospace coatings delivered an excellent quarter with slightly more than 10% volume growth led by above industry performance in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. Automotive refinish continue to grow organic sales by mid single-digit percentage supported by above market performance in all regions.","Architectural coatings EMEA sales volumes were down slightly in the quarter, as consumer demands due and we are prioritizing selling price initiatives. Sales volumes in architectural coatings Americas and Asia Pacific grew at low single-digit percentage aided by continued strong organic sales growth in the U.S. and Canada Company owned stores.","Volume in our DIY business in U.S. and Canada were slightly higher as sales to Lowe's continued albeit at a lower rate than the prior year. Also we benefited from a successful launch of our award winning PPG Olympic stain products at the Home Depot.","Sales volumes also grew at our Mexican PPG Comex business including the benefit of opening an additional 52 stores in the second quarter. Protective and marine coatings sales volume increased with continued strong protective coatings sales in Asia. The marine business has stabilized at a low base and is expected to gain more traction in 2019.","Our Industrial Coatings segment delivered solid organic sales growth of approximately 3%, which included continuing improvement in selling price from the previous quarter. Sales volume in packaging coatings were up mid single digit percentage as the adoption to our INNOVEL interior can coatings products continued.","Selling price increases were also achieved. Automotive OEM coatings sales volumes increased at low single digit percentage and were similar to global industry automotive builds. This business outperformed the market in Europe and Latin America. As expected in China our sales volume increased by high single digit percentage, matching the improved industry bill rates for the quarter.","We also continue to grow sales volume in general industrial business with above market growth rates in Europe and Latin American regions. In addition, our general industrial selling prices continue to gain traction in the quarter.","From a regional perspective, for the company overall sales volume growth was the highest in the emerging regions. Sales in the Asia Pacific region were driven by strong growth in our aerospace, automotive refinish, and protective coatings business. Sales in both China and India grew at low teen percentage. Our China business met our expectation of a strong quarter after softer first quarter.","Going forward, we anticipate sales growth in China could be more uneven as the recent uncertainties around trade policies and tariffs potentially impact economic activity in the country.","Sales grew at a high single digit percentage in Latin America, supported by continuing outperformance by the businesses in Industrial Coatings segment and strong automotive refinish and architectural coatings sales volumes growth.","Sales volumes were higher year-over-year in Europe. A mid single digit percentage increase in the Industrial Coatings segment was offset by slightly lower sales in architectural coatings EMEA. We anticipate that the Industrial Coatings business continue to deliver growth in third quarter as the regional industrial production remains favorable for a broader continued economic recovery.","Sales volumes were also higher in the U.S. and Canada in the second quarter supported by strong sales volumes in our packaging and aerospace coatings business along with solid sales growth in automotive refinish business.","From an earnings perspective, our second quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.90 was nearly 6% improvement versus the prior year quarter. Our earnings were impacted by elevated raw material and logistics cost inflation in the quarter including the impacts from elevated oil prices.","In aggregate, raw material inflation was about a mid single digit percentage increase year-over-year and \u2013 cost and availability to transportation equipment were also higher the second quarter 2017. We expect both these costs to remain elevated during the third quarter.","In the second quarter, we continue to make progress at our selling price initiatives. Prices increased by more than 2% on a year-over-year basis as both of our reporting segments realized higher selling prices. We have secured further price increases for the third quarter and will continue to prioritize collaborating with our customers on further selling price initiatives.","In addition to selling price initiatives, we are making good progress with our efforts on raw material efficiency. As one example, we now expect to further reduce our TiO2 requirements by more than 1% this year. We also remain focused on aggressive cost management.","Our December 2016 restructuring program is tracking to our targeted savings and in the second quarter we initiated a new restructuring program to help mitigate the previously-announced architectural customer assortment change and to further offset the inflation we're experiencing.","This new program will result annualized savings of about $85 billion upon full implementation. In aggregate we expect these restructuring efforts to deliver between $45 million and $50 million of savings in the second half of 2018.","In addition, earnings per share benefited from our ongoing cash deployment actions. This includes the impact of our repurchase of more than $450 million of PPG stock in the second quarter. In the quarter, average diluted shares outstanding were 5% lower versus the second quarter 2017.","Our effective tax rate was 22% in the second quarter, which is lower than the 24% rate from the second quarter 2017. The reduction is related to recognizing certain discrete tax items in the second quarter and the tax reform legislation that was implemented at the start of 2018. We still anticipate a full year tax rate between 23% and 24%.","As we look ahead, we still expect continued positive momentum and overall global economic growth. Our third quarter sales are typically lower than second quarter due to traditional seasonal trends and we anticipate normal seasonal patterns this year. The heightened uncertainty around certain recent trade policies could create uneven growth by region and industries in the second half of 2018.","In particular, we are closely monitoring our business in China for any possible impacts. Currently the new tariffs are starting to add some modest cost to our raw materials. Based on the strength in the U.S. dollar in the second quarter, we expect foreign currency exchange rates to have an unfavorable impact to our sales in the third quarter. Based on current rates the unfavorable impact is expected to be between $60 million to $80 million for the third quarter.","Specific to our businesses, we expect housing starts in the U.S. to continue to improve in the second half of 2018. We believe that U.S. regional automotive industry builds in the second half of 2018 should be higher than 2017 due to the natural disasters that last year impacted automotive production.","In Latin America, we anticipate similar economic expansion as we experienced in the first half of 2018. Growth rates in Asia are expected to modestly decline in the second half mostly driven by uncertainties in China.","We expect automotive build growth rates in China to grow in the third quarter but at lower levels than those realized in the second quarter. We expect economic expansion to continue in India after a very strong first half.","Economic growth in Europe is expected to continue in the second half at a similar rate that we saw in the second quarter. Favorable in use market trends are expected to continue driven by positive growth in industrial production and automotive builds.","For PPG this regional growth will be tempered by subdued architectural coatings demand. We will continue to manage all elements of our business within our control to ensure that we remain competitive regardless of economic conditions.","Based on the current cost environment, we anticipate that our selling price and cost management initiatives will drive improvement in our Industrial Coatings segment margins by the fourth quarter 2018. As previously communicated our sales of PPG Olympic products into Lowe's have stopped at the end of the second quarter.","As I mentioned earlier our launch of PPG Olympic stain products into The Home Depot has met our early targets and we are pleased to be working more closely with the outstanding team at Home Depot. We expect that the net impact of these customer assortment changes will result in reduced third quarter Performance Coatings segment sales of between 200 and 250 basis points and thus PPG's total sales of between 100 and 150 basis points for the remainder of 2018.","With the actions we have already taken and plan to take in the coming months we fully expect to offset the margin impact of this net sales loss in the year 2019. We are continuing to invest in growth initiatives including targeting certain growth spending in the third quarter with plans to spend up to an additional $5 million similar to the second quarter.","Finally, we ended the second quarter with about $1.1 billion of cash and short term investments which continues to provide us with significant financial flexibility. We remain committed to deploy a minimum of $2.4 billion of cash in 2018 on acquisitions and share repurchases as part of our previously communicated target to deploy a minimum of $3.5 billion in 2017 and 2018 combined.","The acquisition pipeline in our industry remains active. We continue to be highly interested in participating in our industry's consolidation but will remain disciplined in our approach. We plan to continue to repurchase shares in the third quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again we appreciate your interest at PPG.","And now Jamie would you please open the line for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Christopher Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Christopher Parkinson","Can you just give us a little color on the breakdown of the raw material basket and what you're currently leasing as well as your general outlook for the second half into 2019? And also just how you're assessing the potential to further raise prices in order to recover your margins? Thank you.","Michael McGarry","Well let's start with the easy one first. We have price increases announced in the second quarter and we are evaluating and will be announcing further increases as we speak. So that's the easy one.","The pressure on raw materials think about propylene as a significant driver of that. So you have emulsions up. That's a significant one. Of course you got the fact relates up then you have the pressure coming from the higher oil prices that's impacting solvents. And then we have packaging cost are also up.","And then my favorite of course is epoxy. So those are all ones that we're feeling pressure. The good news is for a number of these things we're taking actions. So whether it's a TiO2 or we're trying to optimize the formulas and I mentioned earlier 1% lower consumption packaging where we're looking at how do we optimize our packages, that one as well. So I would say those are the primary pinch points Christopher.","Christopher Parkinson","And then also I think we all understand why the focus remains on architectural volumes given recent developments. But can you talk about what you're seeing on a sequential basis in your general outlook for general industrial coil packaging? Just how should we should think about the growth there and also the margin contribution in the short and long term? Thank you.","Michael McGarry","Let me see if I can get all the business as you mentioned. Let's start with aerospace. Fantastic business. Terrific performance. I mentioned on the call that we're going to be up 10%, and we were up 10% in the second quarter.","Strong performance across all the different platforms whether it's sealants packaging, transparencies, coatings, all of them doing well. Military is strong. Commercial is strong. And we see General Aviation coming back. So a very solid team performing at a very high level in that regard.","General industrial the places that are I would say on the upper end of the range, so automotive parts are continuing to do well. Electronic Materials probably low-single digits, wood kind of flattish, coil doing well as you can imagine that's a strong commercial market, transco doing well. Appliance we started to see a little slowdown in appliance. You have the trade uncertainty the tariffs.","So I think our appliance guys are going to be looking at this a little cautiously. I don't see demand change. But I do see inventory in the system working progress change. And of course, heavy duty equipment remains very, very strong. So Christopher did I catch?","Vincent Morales","And about last one is packaging. Christopher, I'll tell you this is Vince. Packaging business for us as I know you know has been a increase good performer as we introduce our BPA-NI technologies further. We continue to outperform the market up mid-single digits this quarter, market that's low-single digits. We expect that to continue. We're in the middle innings of a BPA conversion process. So we still feel there's good runway left.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","David Begleiter","Michael on the U.S. and Canada Company owned stores, strong performance in Q2 also strong performance in Q1. What do the market grow either in Q2 or Q1 or combined? And how are you growing the market as it appears you are?","Michael McGarry","First of all, I don't know that we are growing anything, but at the market rate. I think if you look in our presentation where we have the heat chart you will see that where we color coded ourselves at market for U.S. So that would be my first comment. I think this trend of strong performance in the stores.","As you know, this has been a multiyear effort to close the gap in that area. And the team has worked really hard to close that gap and we're getting price. The market is strong. And of course, the shift from DIY to do it for me is what's really driving why the trade business is outperforming the DIY business.","David Begleiter","And Michael and Vince just on the $85 million of cost. Can you break down between how much was allocated to Lowe's and how much is in this designed to offset the other cost inflation you highlighted?","Vincent Morales","David this is Vince. Walking around numbers certainly more than half close to two-thirds would have been allocated to support what I would call our not only our customer assortment change, but look at geographically our U.S. business. And the remainder would be rest of world. We won't break it any finer than that. But we are battling, as you know David, raw material inflation everywhere.","So rest of world we're trying to offset that with pricing and the lever obviously is with efficiency and cost. And then again, the portion for the U.S. would be split between our architecture business and other businesses.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Roberts from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","John Roberts","Solvents usually follow oil more closely than other raws. You mentioned propylene as well. In the industrial segment I think probably has more exposure to petroleum based raws. Is that the biggest difference of the different margin performance we have between the two segments this quarter? ","Michael McGarry","I would say that is certainly one significant factor. You got to be epoxies that are in there as well, and so when you look at the raw material basket. And of course, the other factor is, it's much more difficult to get price with our global large OEM customers.","And although, we are starting to get it, it lags the other businesses. So we\u2019re -- you can see how we in Performance Coatings side that gap has closed much quicker than the gap on the Industrial Coatings segment.","Vincent Morales","That said, John I'll just reiterate what Michael said. We're out with customer increases -- or excuse me, selling price increases to our customers in Q3. Certainly, a portion of those are pointed at our Industrial segment and the businesses within that segment. And then we're comfortable, we'll get traction with some of those certainly increases.","John Roberts","And then Michael I think you mentioned the new tariffs were having a modest impact on your Chinese raw material cost. What would be the raw material most sensitive to the tariffs that have gone in?","Michael McGarry","John for us probably the more sensitive and direct one is what we call tinplate. So you can imagine a lot of tin goes into paint cans. And so that's the one that we're watching most closely with respect to the tariffs that are announced.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi from R.W. Baird. Please go ahead with your question.","Ghansham Panjabi","First off, on auto refinish and your expectation of moderating growth in North America. I think you called out lower collision claims and miles driven in the second quarter. Do you view that as part of the normal shift in the market during the course of a year? Or is there something more secular that concerns you?","Vincent Morales","Well, the miles driven is only up like 0.2%. And typically miles driven is more driven by the economy and employment. So this is a clear sign that people Ubering around and taking shared vehicles and public transportation and that as having a slightly, I would say, very modest impact on miles driven.","Collision claims, I would say, is much more cyclical. So you should have less accidents during the summer than you will have during the winter. And, of course, we will start to see the impact to some of my favorite activity, which is hail, which doesn't hurt anybody but yet leads to a lot of opportunities for our refinish business. So that would be something that you'll have some offsetting that's a positive during the August\/September timeframe.","Ghansham Panjabi","And then on packaging in Asia and the share loss that you experienced as part of your price increase initiatives. This business, in theory, has high switching costs. I guess, were you surprised at the share loss? Or was it sort of the coatings on the outside of the cans? Thank you.","Michael McGarry","Well, I would tell you that the - our Asian customers are willing to send messages much more frequently than our U.S. and European customers. So even though they are switching costs, sometimes they'll want to punish you. As you know, we've had five quarters in a row of price increases.","So one of the reasons why our volume was up this quarter is people have stopped punishing in us. But in Asia that \u2013 some of that behavior still exists.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Bob Koort","Maybe extending from that a bit, Michael, you had obviously very good volumes this quarter, two out of the last three. And I think you had suggested, maybe in the past, that the underlying demand was better but there was some blowback from the price hikes.","It seems like your competitors now are playing ball or at least talking of the same more aggressive moves on pricing. So should we expect that we can see this in more GDP type volume growth in the future? Or it is - it's still too early to call?","Michael McGarry","Well, first, I think it's too early to call because we're going to continue to prioritize margin recovery. Second, I think, we're going to be a little bit hampered as we tried to explain in the prepared commentary that the impact of the customer assortment change at Lowe\u2019s.","But by and large, we do see more customers taking price. We see more of our \u2013 more of the market talking the same need, have margin recovery. So there should be less opportunity for people to shift volumes around to take advantage of, what I would call, salespeople who aren't paying attention.","Bob Koort","And could I ask on Europe. It seems like architectural trends there have been pretty uninspired for quite a long time. And I guess I always envision the paint market has been fairly constant, maybe low growth, but reasonably sustained growth. Why can't you guys get better volumes out of the European markets in architectural?","Michael McGarry","Well, again, I would say that's a little bit choppy. So we've done exceptionally well. If you go back the last three, four, five years in the U.K., we had a little bit of a setback in the Benelux when the people that were not maintaining the \u2013 there's a large rental market in the Benelux and they've kind of prioritize cash recovery for a while. Now they're back painting. So we do see fairly decent growth there.","The Eastern Europe, I would say, is slightly better. The big challenge is, France is our biggest market by far, Bob. And retail is soft. And the one thing I would tell you is, I was just over there a month or so ago and I saw more cranes over in Paris than I've seen in a long time. Consumer sentiment is up.","I've been joking with my friends over there, the French one, the World Cup, hopefully that will take them to spend a little more money. But we do have to recognize that there is some portion of our business that people have a choice at where to spend their discretionary dollars.","And right now they're much more focus on experiences than they are in home improvement, unlike in the U.S. where you're getting a pretty significant return on your investment when you put your money in your house. So I don't - I haven't given up.","So if your question is, have I given up? The answer is absolutely not. And the good news is we're doing pretty well earnings wise. We just need to continue to capture our fair share.","Operator","Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.","Frank Mitsch","And Michael that World Cup cuts both ways. I'd imagine that productivity was probably a little bit lighter over there over the past several weeks. I wanted to\u2026.","Michael McGarry","But I don't accept that excuse for my team.","Frank Mitsch","I certainly I could understand that it would not be applicable to a company based in Pittsburgh. I want to come at the pricing question just a little bit differently. You've got a string of positive year-over-year prices. I think it was like 0.1% 3Q, 2017, 1% in 4Q, 1.6% in 1Q, 2.2% in 2Q. Is this something that we -- and you've got pricing initiatives in place, so should we think about the order of magnitude of price is kind of accelerating here and we're going to be approaching that 3% mark? How do we think about the overall magnitude of price?","Michael McGarry","Well I do think price is accelerating. And I think that's a reasonable assumption to make. And I do think that there's more to be asked for and gotten in this marketplace. When we think about the logistics now we stack logistics cost on top of raw material cost. So our sales teams are heavily focused on that capture.","Frank Mitsch","And then also going back on looking at the lovely heat map, seems to be a fair amount more green on the screen now relative to last few quarters and a little bit less red. And I think you were saying that you're expecting end use market activity comparable to the second quarter. So understanding that seasonality takes it down from 2Q. But on a year-over-year basis, it seems like absent the issue with Lowe's that you're still calling for a pretty good volume quarter. Is that correct?","Michael McGarry","Well I certainly would like to see that. I'm confident that team recognizes the importance of getting price first. So I would say your conclusions are probably accurate.","Vincent Morales","And Frank I think our - as Michael said in our prepared remarks, we generally feel the economies around the world are pretty healthy. And we think there will be so in Q3, obviously depending upon global trade discussions. So right now, we're running at a fairly good clip in most of our end-use markets.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Jeff Zekauskas","It looks like your cash flow from operations was down by about $250 million year-over-year for the first half. Is that roughly right? And are you going to be able to generate the same amount of cash you did last year in 2018? Or because of higher raw material costs that's too high a bar to reach?","Vincent Morales","Yes, Jeff I think your numbers are fair. The biggest cash use we have is the first six months of the year, even though our working capital as a percentage of sales is even with last year, our sales are up, so we actually have more working capital in terms of dollars. And that's by far that's the biggest use of cash year-over-year but your numbers are accurate.","Jeff Zekauskas","So, PPG use to generate much more cash than it did net income. And do your cash conversion over time this really come down where it's more or less equal to your net income. Do you have any targets or plans as to what your cash conversion should look like over a longer period of time?","Vincent Morales","As I think you're aware, Jeff the last three years we've shaved roughly 100 basis points off of our working capital as a percent of sales. And some of those years we were growing sales. So that was \u2013 the big contributor was the 100 basis point reduction. That's still our target this year. And again I think that will be a \u2013 that will allow us to grow our operating cash flow higher than our earnings to your point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from VRP. Please go ahead with your question.","Kevin McCarthy","Your corporate line, under operating profit looks like expense decline materially in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis and that was the case in the first quarter as well. Would you comment on what's driving that and what your outlook is for future quarters there?","Vincent Morales","Yes, I'll comment on the difference and then John is probably going to comment on the outlook. So, Kevin we made a significant amount of effort over the past couple of years in some of our cost post such as pension and OPEC cost. Those have driven that corporate expense line down. In addition the past - this year and past year the incentive comp number for the corporation is also bit lower.","And finally we did have in the first half of the year, positive intercompany foreign currency. This will be assets and liabilities between our foreign affiliates, obviously, our headquarter parent company when currencies move we have to take those intercompany balances and through them up $2. And in the first half the year for both quarters that was a positive. We do expect some of that to reverse as the currencies have flipped.","And John do you have the forecast?","John Bruno","Yes, Kevin this is John. So for the second half of the year we'd be looking at between 75 million and 90 million for both quarters. Yeah, I think as you go into next year, I think the run rate will come down from 2016.","So I think a lot of people have been looking at 2016 run rate. And through a lot of efforts but different actions whether it's benefits and pensions or through workforce reductions we have a lower base now. So I expect our run rate going forward to be lower as well.","Vincent Morales","And just for clarity the 75 million to 90 million is total for both quarters.","Kevin McCarthy","And then second question if I may relates to your new restructuring program of $85 million. What are the sources of those savings? And then I think you made a comment that you expect 45 million to 50 million in the back half of 2018 but I think that included year old program from December 2016. So maybe you can help us understand the flow through on the new 85 million and how much will be this year versus next?","John Bruno","Kevin, John again. So let's talk about the 2016 program. We have most of those actions are done. So now we're realizing the benefits. And that's working out to be a $13 million to $15 million quarter benefit. Per quarter that should sustain itself into Q1 of next year. The new program has started. We're going as fast as we can with the program. Probably be at a full run rate early 2019, but really a significant contribution as we get into Q4 on that program as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick Lambert from Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.","Patrick Lambert","Is the reception okay?","Vincent Morales","We can hear you Patrick.","John Bruno","It's just the French, Patrick.","Patrick Lambert","Yes, it's pretty far away from you guys. A few questions. The first one, I think your comments on EMEA did curve volumes but you somehow let go. If I heard correctly during the year, where do you think these volumes have gone if I may ask? First question. Maybe I'll ask the other question later following your answers.","Vincent Morales","Patrick this is Vince. As Michael said, we're prioritizing selling prices in the region over volume. There is a marginal volume that are going to folks who are not following the same philosophy as us and as you know, particular because you live in the region, that there are several much smaller players in the region than you'd find versus the U.S. market, so there are folks who are willing to take substandard profitability business.","Patrick Lambert","So mostly lower\u2026","Vincent Morales","Correct.","Patrick Lambert","The second question regards again sorry, I could not understand completely the Lowe's impact how to model the topline of the lack of contract there in H2 '18?","John Bruno","Right, Patrick so this is John, so the 120 to 150 range represents the net impact so it would be the loss at Lowe's and the gains at Home Depot and it would be off of our expected revenue, total revenue for the company.","Patrick Lambert","And the last one, last question on industrial margin. I think it was a good 400 basis points year-on-year difference of EBIT margin. Is OEM as I heard the OEM is likely to be the largest contributor to that, but is there any big discrepancies between the other sub-segment of industrial that can explain that big gap?","John Bruno","We typically don't provide our business unit details below the reporting segment. Again as Michael alluded to, we have very large customers in that segment, global customers. They're typically good at deferring price increases. We're starting to get traction as you see in the numbers now. We expect that to continue.","Patrick Lambert","And so we expect the prices acceleration also industrial actually maybe more pronounced industrial?","Vincent Morales","We expect further pricing in both reporting segments, correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from Don Carson from Susquehanna. Please go ahead with your question.","Don Carson","Michael you mentioned that you saw industrial margins could be better year-over-year by Q4. Are you expecting gross margins for the overall company to be better year-over-year by Q4 or is part of that improvement in industrial also some of your cost cutting? ","Vincent Morales","Don I'm going to take this. For us we're looking at the reported segment margin which Michael has alluded to. That would include pricing actions but also the cost actions that John mentioned. So it will be accumulative of both of those to get us on a reported segment business on a flat year-over-year. ","Don Carson","So said another way overall you don't think you're going to get improvement in gross margin year over year until you get into calendar 2019 for the overall company? ","Vincent Morales","It's too early to call 2019 Don. We're tracking the Q4 reported segment margins flat and that would include some benefit from items below gross margin.","Don Carson","Okay.","Vincent Morales","We are totally focused on the second half of the year and getting this margin recovery. ","Don Carson","And a follow-up on U.S. architectural. Two questions. One do you need more price there given the emulsions continue to go up and solvents and packaging costs are going up as well. So you have a third price increase in the table? And then secondly you've been getting such good volume growth in your company stores is there any side to accelerate your expansion plans on the company storefront in the U.S.? ","Michael McGarry","So there's no question that there's raw material pressure in architectural U.S. And the other one is logistics cost. And that's not just from our D.C. our customers but also for our plans starting D.C.","So you've got two levels of logistics cost in there. So we are actively evaluating the appropriate timing for that. We're not in a position that we can talk about that. But that is under active evaluation. As far as the store expansions we are selective in that.","So we've added in the markets that we're best in. So I think about the Texas market that's an area that we've continuing to invest in. But we're selective on where we're doing that. And we will do that on an as needed basis. Obviously we're more aggressive in Canada where we're the market leader. And we're less aggressive in certain segments where we're far away from the market leader. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","Duffy Fischer","First one just on Michael's comment on FX being negative $60 million to $80 million in Q3. Was that a sequential or a year-over-year number? ","John Bruno","Duffy this is John. That's a year-over-year number. ","Vincent Morales","That's a sales number. Sales number Duffy. ","Duffy Fischer","And then could you parse out the big buckets of raw materials. We've talked a lot around the different pieces and parts. But epoxy solvents TiO2 which do you see moderating in the back half and which do you see continued pressure operates and did get any relief in the next year in any of those buckets? ","Michael McGarry","Well I think we've talked about TiO2 moderating. So I think that one we see supply increasing in TiO2. So I think that's -- we're pretty consistent on that. The propylene one though is a bit of a concern for us. If you look at propylene in the U.S. it's up 28% year-over-year in the U.S. and 30% year over year in Asia. So there are still more pricing pressure likely to come through in anything that touches propylene.","Vincent Morales","And oil solvent derivative \u2013 the oil derivatives solvent your guess is as good as ours Duffy.","Michael McGarry","But WTI is up 40% year-over-year and Brent is up like 50% year-over-year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Byrne from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.","Stephen Byrne","Is there anything that kept you from being a little more aggressive about share repurchases in the second quarter just looking at the share price? I thought you might have been more aggressive. But perhaps it's a reflection of what you're looking at in your M&A pipeline?","Michael McGarry","Yes. I think you answered your own question. So we're always trying to keep our powder dry so that we can do acquisitions. And we're always looking at the pipeline we would prefer to do acquisitions. That's number one in our target list. But if we can't do it we're not going to let the cash sit on the balance sheet. So we're going to put it to work. So I think that's how we're looking at it.","Vincent Morales","And Steve we said all quarter the very active pipeline in the coatings space. There's certainly in our mind going to be deals done this year whether we're the one who tracks the deals are not or remains to be seen. We're going to be remain disciplined but it's an active pipeline right now.","Stephen Byrne","And on the inflationary cost pressures you've talked a fair bit about the ROS. But on the logistics side would you say that shift between those two is becoming a little more problematic on the logistics and transportation side? And does that, do you have the power to push price because of an awareness of logistics costs? Is it as challenging as it is with higher raw material cost? Or does this give you a little more support on pushing price?","Michael McGarry","Well, it's certainly not the magnitude of the raw material increases, right? But it's an adder. So if you think about high jumping let's add another foot to the high jump bar and all our customers are impacted by that. Some of them can argue, well, we don't oil we don't buy this and you should offset the raw materials. Well, I can assure there's no customer that isn't impacted by logistics increases. So that makes some of the selling argument that we have out there easier to sell because they can't deny that.","Operator","Our next question comes from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","John McNulty","With regard to the logistics, can you give us a rough idea of what that actual that nougat is for you in terms of percent of your either cost or sales just so we have a clue? And then how to think about how much it's up year-over-year?","Vincent Morales","Well, yes, again, a number we typically don't like to give out John. It certainly in the single-digits, call it mid-single digits as a percent of sales. We kind of give you some kind of guardrails. Right now, it's up a double-digit percent as most companies are seeing.","John McNulty","And then, I guess, if I think about the costs or the raw materials, I guess, and price, I understand it doesn't necessarily work on the margin percentages. But if I'm doing the math right on mid-single-digit cost inflation and 2% plus price, it looks like the 2 kind of net each other out. Are we thinking about that right? And then if that's the case, I guess, when you think about bucketing where some of the other headwinds are, how should we think about the bigger buckets and what the real pressures were this quarter?","Vincent Morales","If the two net it out, I think we'd be having a different dialog right now John. We're still climbing the hill to get the raw materials back with price. As you pointed out, we made good progress, good traction, but we still got more work to do. And then as Michael mentioned, we're stacking down on top of that freight. Some of that freight goes into the growth profit line so that might be another element for you to consider, but we have more work to do.","Operator","Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Please go ahead with your question.","P.J. Juvekar","So Michael, I think you mentioned that your reduced your TiO2 requirement by 1%, is that correct? And if it's true then, is that permanent? And just tell us how did you achieve that? And how much savings can you get from that?","Michael McGarry","So the first question is, it is permanent and it is how you formulate the paint. So unless you're a paint chemist, I'm not sure you fully understand the way we're doing it. But it is the spacing of the TiO2 within the formulation. So if you want more chemistry lesson I'll get you in here with our Chief Technology Officer. But the bottom line is, it is permanent and this is something that we're working on.","We have a number of suppliers that supply us other raw material ingredients that are dedicated to helping us work on the TiO2 spacing, and you have the hiding as well. And so they are also working on the hiding. So these are all things that the team is working actively on.","P.J. Juvekar","I would like to talk to your scientist to understand that better. And then secondly, one of your competitors started TiO2 pass-throughs. Have you thought about doing either pass-throughs of TiO2 or any other raw material, which would reduce volatility in your business and maybe allow you to focus more on innovation?","Michael McGarry","So I guess, P.J., we have not seen that initiative. Any of these single raw material initiatives have not really been successful. What's more successful is if you tie a basket, where all the basket goes up, where all the basket goes down and then netting of that basket.","And so we have a number of different pricing mechanisms with our customers. And they're all unique to the marketplace so that we try to work collaboratively with our customers to get the price. And some customers wanted in fashion A and some wanted in fashion B. and some wanted in C and D.","So we try to be unique with our customers, but this single thing of like a single TiO2 doesn't typically work, whereas a freight surcharge might be something that would take some -- might be beneficial, but that's generally not the way we do it.","P.J. Juvekar","And I just have a clarification question of the comment earlier. You mentioned that you expect uneven growth in China. Is that more of a slowdown in China? And have you seen that so far? Or is that an expectation? Thank you.","Michael McGarry","No. We've not seen it and it's all going to be the tariff related. Right now through the first to whatever it is, 18 days, the sales reports that I\u2019ve seen for China. They're having July very similar to the second quarter. And so we're just on the lookout for that. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Vincent Andrews","So just two quick ones. Could you help quantify the extra shipping day from a volume perspective? How much did that help in the quarter?","John Bruno","Vincent it was - this is John. It was mostly related to Mexico and the U.S. And so specific to those businesses and probably total revenue 50 basis points or less.","Vincent Andrews","And just as a clarifying question, in the comment earlier was that you expect TiO2 to moderate in the second half? I just want to make sure you \u2013 are you saying that the pace of the increase is going to be less year-over-year or are you actually expecting the price to go down? Thanks.","Michael McGarry","I would say that it should be every moderate increases if at all.","Operator","Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Laurence Alexander","One quick clarification and one larger picture question. Can you just clarify, when you commented on the sequential trends will reflect normal seasonality, does that supposed to \u2013 is that remark about the segment trends intended to be before or after the Lowe's adjustment that you then break out.","And secondly, a bigger picture question about the balance between pricing and productivity and innovation as ways to offset raw material pressure. Are there other opportunities to do a similar kind of blitz as what you've done on TiO2 at - on some of the other raw materials that you use to sort of materially change your input?","And can we expect those same split between productivity and price as a way to get margin back to be sustainable over time? Or is it going to get tougher to keep finding new sources of restructuring opportunities?","Vincent Morales","So Laurence, I'll answer the first one and Mike will take the second one. The numbers we gave you with respect to the customer assortment change in seasonality, you should take the seasonality effect first and then take the map on the customer assortment change after that.","Michael McGarry","And just to make sure you're clear on that. So the second quarter, you have the big box of building inventory and independent of paint season. And now they had their inventory, they're going to go work through the inventory to see how the year goes as they\u2019re \u2013 so they\u2019re ordering less as the quarter goes on.","In regards to the formulations, every year one of our scientists that's working on our formulations are encouraged to look at the total cost of the formulation. And so whether that's optimizing the TiO2, the solvent blend, the resin or how do they get more solid in a coating versus the alternative.","All those things, packaging, how can they deliver more active ingredients in a package versus less? So there's multiple different ways to look at it. And we don't mandate only TiO2 where \u2013 looking at the total cost of the formulation.","Vincent Morales","And Laurence, just to your question on overall innovation. I think it dovetails -- the -- we have formulators who do this. That's cannibalization of an existing product. We preferred to be in certainly a much more raw material environment and we can their resources to creating new-to-world-type products.","So this is cannibalizing from our ability to spend as much R&D as we would on innovation. We also have process or process innovation teams who try to allow us to produce this in a more efficient manner. So from a manufacturing perspective they work on that as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Arun Viswanathan","A quick question on volume. What would you say are the buckets that give you the most concern as to why you wouldn't keep this 3%-plus clip going? Would it be Europe, Asia or Latin America or -- and then maybe by business line, any areas that you're specifically worried about?","Michael McGarry","Well the first one is retail Europe will be the highest one. The next one would be Brexit. The next one would probably be, I would say the uncertainty around China. We're not seeing that yet. So it's probably a guesstimate at this point in time. But when I look at the other businesses I mean PMC is at a cyclical low. And so that's probably not going to get anything but better from this point on. Aerospace continue to perform well. Refinish continues to perform well.","Surprisingly, the OEM automotive had a good first half of the year, slightly better than expectations. And we see no reason why the second half will continue. The only negative there of course is whether or not people were trying to buy ahead of the tariffs right, so we won't know that just yet.","But we still see more transitions to our packaging of INNOVEL products, so there's still more gains we have there and our industrial business continues to perform well. I guess the main ones are China retail and Brexit.","Arun Viswanathan","And then I just had a question on price versus ROS. I mean, if we look back, this industry has done a pretty good job of recapturing raw material inflation and sometimes even pricing over ROS. It looks like now there was maybe an exacerbated lag maybe due to the M&A activity last year.","But is there anything else that has changed structurally as to why it's either taking longer for you guys to achieve price or to offset inflation? Or is it that the volume picture is just weaker that your customers are pushing back more? Any thoughts on if there's been any larger-scale changes here?","Michael McGarry","No industry change. Clearly there's probably more people focused on cash right now. And because of that they're making certain decisions. For us, we're going to be in this business for a long, long time. And so we're prioritizing the margin recovery. I don't think there's been any change though.","Arun Viswanathan","And then lastly, on M&A. You discussed that there was likely to be activity this year. I mean, is there any heightened kind of aggressiveness on your part to be involved in that? With their private equity folks, are they dropping their return requirements and valuations? I mean, what would it take for us to see some more deals from you guys this year?","Michael McGarry","Well, private equity is really not a factor in this space. They can't match synergies that the strategics can bring to the table. So we do get outdated at times and that's a fact of life. We're going to remain disciplined. But we do know what's in our pipeline and we are certainly actively engaged with a number of people. The biggest challenge is what I talked about on the first quarter were the bid and ask had widened because of raw material inflation.","So they're not getting their margins back and they want to get paid on let's call it their best 12 months in the last 36 as opposed we want to pay on the current performance. So that's what the bid and ask differential is.","Operator","And our next question comes from James Sheehan from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead with your question.","James Sheehan","On your auto OEM performance, looks like in most regions you were performing at\/or above the market or in Asia Pacific you're below the market. And I'm not used to seeing that. What can you provide some more color on Asia Pacific auto OEM?","Michael McGarry","Yes there's two primary factor that drove that. One is we still having our numbers in Australia where there was still an operating plant a year ago. And then the other one is our share in Korea. As you know the Korean business is significantly impacted. And so that's it. If we drew our box around India and China we're doing very, very well and I have absolutely no concerns. So it's really those two factors that are driving that.","James Sheehan","And on the accounting investigation. You wrapped up your own Pro but then I think there's also an SEC probe. Can you talk about the expected timing of that investigation?","Michael McGarry","We have absolutely no idea what the SEC timing will be and we won't be able to share anything until it was finalized anyway. So we'll be totally transparent whenever we can be. But right now we have no insight into what they're thinking.","Operator","And at this time, I'm showing no additional questions. I'd like to turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remarks.","John Bruno","Thanks, Jamie. I'd like to thank everyone for your time and interest in PPG.

Welcome to PPG's third quarter 2012 financial teleconference.","Joining me from PPG on the call today is Chuck Bunch, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Navikas, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer.","Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, October 18, 2012. I will remind everyone that approximately one hour ago we posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the Investor Center at our website, ppg.com.

Our earnings growth continued during the third quarter as we posted our ninth consecutive quarterly earnings record. Our adjusted earnings per share of $2.24 were up 14% versus last year and were up despite continued variation in regional economic performance. North America remained our strongest region with improved demand in most businesses, led by automotive OEM coatings gains. European volumes declined versus the prior year. However, the trend improved in comparison with the second quarter year-over-year results due to less customer inventory destocking. Emerging region demand was mixed by end-use market, ending flat in the aggregate. Currency translation remained a negative to sales and earnings.","We were pleased to deliver higher earnings in each region for the quarter and year-to-date despite the mixed regional economic performance and negative currency translation impact. This was aided by our total coatings segment earnings, which grew by 20% versus the prior year as local currency sales growth was supplemented by continued operational execution. Earnings in our remaining segments were lower year-over-year, including the impact from lower optical product sales due to customer inventory management initiatives, stemming from the upcoming introduction of our new Transitions Generation VII product and lower optical consumer end-market growth rates.","We also delivered strong cash performance, with year-to-date cash generation up over 33% and cash and short-term investments totaled $2 billion at the end of the quarter.","Our excellent financial performance in the quarter and year-to-date is a direct result of our aggressive operational execution and further illustrates the benefits of our broad global business portfolio and the effectiveness of our ongoing cash deployment.","Looking to the fourth quarter, we are heading into a seasonally slower period in most end-use markets and expect little change in the inconsistent performance of economies outside North America. We also anticipate measured economic growth in North America and expect we will continue to benefit from some of the highest growth sectors this year such as automotive OEM and aerospace. We will remain focused on aggressive management within the regions to maximize our financial performance and we expect to benefit further from the continued implementation of restructuring actions. In addition, we have considerable financial flexibility, and we continue to pursue acquisitions in a disciplined manner as a primary means of deploying our strong cash position for earnings accretion.","Finally, we remain on schedule to complete the separation of our Commodity Chemicals business and the merger of that business with Georgia Gulf, with closing expected to occur by early next year.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Now, operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy, representing Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I was wondering if you could provide us with an update on both the timing of the transaction with Georgia Gulf as well as your latest thoughts on the relative merits of split-off versus spinoff?","Charles E. Bunch","Yes, I can, Kevin. It's good to have you on the line. Right now, as I'd described in my notes, we anticipate a closing by the first quarter of 2013. We have several items that are still in process. And we have completed one antitrust review here in the U.S. We're waiting for final SEC filings to be completed by both companies. We're waiting for an IRS tax ruling and similarly in Canada. We have also the Georgia Gulf shareholder vote, which we anticipate later in the fourth quarter, November or December. So we're still on pace, we think. We haven't had any surprises so far and -- as we've moved through these items, so I would say we're still on schedule. Our thinking is still in favor of the split and that would be our recommendation today. We are obviously monitoring the financial markets as we go through and we continue to be, I think, buoyed by the strength overall in the response to the potential transaction, the performance of ours, as well as Georgia Gulf shares. So at this point, we are still pointing towards a split and believe that is the best avenue for PPG and our shareholders.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. As a second and final question, would you provide an update on your outlook for raw material costs and perhaps touch on TiO2 pigment, as well as acrylics where it looks like there could be some nascent upward pressure following an outage in Japan? Just would appreciate your updated thoughts on that for the end of the year here.","Charles E. Bunch","TiO2 costs, as we look at them in the third quarter of 2012, we're still up versus the third quarter of 2011, although the trend here in 2012 as we've moved through the years, has been for lower prices for TiO2 in all the regions. Pricing for the fourth quarter is still under discussion. But the overall inflationary trends for raw materials, I'd say, have been very moderate here this year. And I would say that in the acrylic chain, although there was a lot of publicity around the explosion in Japan and the plant outage, we've been watching the acrylic chain. Propylene pricing, that has been, I would say, moderate. We haven't returned to some of the higher prices in propylene that we've seen earlier this year. So I would say that, right now, we are not seeing any price spikes in the acrylic chain at this point here for the second half of 2012.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter, representing Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Chuck, on the same track, can you talk about your pricing discipline in the face of some lower raw material costs? Have you been forced to lower any prices? And can you actually quantify the gap that expanded -- that occurred or benefited you guys in Q3, as well as the drop in your selling prices that did not?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, I would say that we're still facing raw material inflationary pressure over certainly the last 18 months or a little longer. We haven't fully recaptured that. So as I described in TiO2, we've seen a moderation of the increases; in fact, some modest decreases here this year. But overall, we've seen more stability in terms of our raw material input costs, and pricing has remained stable during the course of this year. Vince, did you want...","Vincent J. Morales","Yes, Dave, I just wanted to add, that in several of our businesses in 2011, we absorbed a lot of inflation without the ability to push through price until this year. So over the last 18 or 20 months, as Chuck has mentioned, we're still in a recapture mode and that recapture continues into the fourth quarter.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's helpful. And Chuck, can you discuss your efforts to reduce your usage of TiO2? I believe you had a 4% to 6% target for this year.","Charles E. Bunch","Yes, and we're still on track. Through the first 3 quarters of this year, we were tracking at a little over 3%. So we feel that for the full year, we will be into certainly the 4% to 6% range. Probably as we roll up all the numbers, it'll be kind of on the low end of that range or a little over 4%, but certainly within our target. And we feel we still have opportunities as we go into 2013 and beyond to continue the more productive use of TiO2 in our formulation.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And lastly, can you discuss potential share buybacks with the $2 billion of cash on the balance sheet? How much of that cash is trapped overseas, Chuck? How much do you need to run the company, something on that track?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, we anticipate, as you see, the -- our cash balance was around $2 billion here at the end of the third quarter. Fourth quarter is usually a cash generator for us plus we have the $900 million that will be coming over the next few months from the split off of the Commodity Chemicals business. So if you think that we need $400 million to $500 million to run the company, we are probably sitting on in excess of $2 billion in terms of opportunity to either engage in share buybacks or also M&A activity. We're currently out of the share buyback market because of this Reverse Morris Trust transaction. We would intend to initiate modest share buybacks at the conclusion of the transaction. But we are keeping some of our balance sheet strength, let's call it, as we look at the acquisition opportunities. We announced one yesterday, as you saw, in our Industrial Coatings space, Spraylat. But as we go through 2013 and beyond, if we cannot find attractive acquisition candidates to deploy this, let's say, excess cash, we will become more aggressive in share buybacks. And we have a good portion of this $2.5 billion in cash here in North America. We have -- all of the cash from the Georgia Gulf transaction will be here. And so we think that, I think, 3\/4 of the cash balance that we have is here in North America and available for any of our uses, not only share buybacks and M&A, but also dividend payments or other payments here to any of our constituencies in North America.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John Nulty (sic) [McNulty], representing Credit Suisse.","Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Abhi Rajendran calling in for John. A couple of quick questions. So auto has been a relative bright spot for you guys. How should we think about trends in the auto OEM business on a regional basis looking to 4Q, and are there any customer shutdowns or any other factors that we need to consider?","Charles E. Bunch","The global trends for automotive OEM production are still good. And I think you will see, I think, a continuation of the trends that we've outlined here in the first 3 quarters of this year. One is continued strength in North America. We have good sales momentum. Inventory levels are moderate. And even the numbers in September, good sales levels, more production coming to North America from outside, so less imports into the North American market. So I would expect the North American market to stay positive, especially on the production side. Although I think you will see over the next year or more as the effects of the Japanese tsunami are moderated, you're not going to see this 20% necessarily growth rate during 2013 that we've seen this year. Europe remains quite weak. The first 9 months in 2012, we've had high single-digit declines in production in Europe. We had, I think, a similar, if not quite as negative production in the third quarter, but it's usually a difficult quarter in Europe to determine actual trends because of the vacation period. But right now, we haven't seen a turnaround in Europe and we're not expecting one as we move into 2013. Chinese market, a big one for us, has remained quite positive, 7% kinds of growth rates, still healthy. And India, which has struggled over the last few quarters with growth rates, now in the low single digits. We think there, we -- there's more time needed to turn the -- some of those economic headwinds in India. So at this point, as we look to the first half of next year, I would say a continuation of some of the same trends overall. Despite the weakness in Europe, this is a very positive story. I think we're doing quite well in our business and I think you're also seeing from PPG here is well positioned in leadership positions with all of the major car manufacturers, good regional strength, benefiting from some of the restructuring that we announced earlier this year. And also, I think a story that we haven't emphasized as much is what I would call improved localization of our production. We have -- the coatings businesses, as you know, are not highly capital intensive. Our capital expenditures have actually been modest over the last few years, but they've been pointed at positioning us, especially in automotive and in our Industrial Coatings market to localize our production capacity. So the investments that we've made over the last couple of years in China, in South Korea, in Mexico, which are still strong markets, we are really benefiting from the investments that we've made where we've localized resin production or waterborne coatings as examples. So we're benefiting there as well from I would call some of these strategic capital expenditures of the last couple of years and that's driving very good performance in our Industrial Coatings segment even though, overall, growth rates are moderate.","Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then a quick follow-up on the Spraylat acquisition. How should we think about the margins of the addition versus your Industrial Coatings segment margins, and then how should we think about potential incremental earnings looking out to 2013?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, we would hope certainly the business today that we acquired does not have -- that it is a positive in terms of earnings and cash flow. But margins, return on sales are not at our overall average for our Industrial Coatings segment. So we feel with -- it will be an accretive acquisition in 2013. We expect to close by the end of 2012. So we are looking for accretion in 2013, but I would say we probably need 18 months or so to get the full benefit and to see those margins being comparable to what we have in our Industrial Coatings segment.","Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then last quick one, if I may. In the optical parts, so there's several moving parts in the business in the fourth quarter, including the year-ago flooding effect, some continued inventory management and maybe some new product pipeline fill. I guess after the last few quarters of decline in this business, can we expect some growth on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter?","Charles E. Bunch","What we're going to see in the fourth quarter is, I would say, a modest growth in our Optical business. If we -- when we looked at our retail sales out the door, this is not our direct sales to customers but the sales of Transitions at the retail level, they were still positive in the third quarter at, let's call it, lower single-digit growth. So we did have at-market growth for Transitions. There was, as we discussed in our note, inventory management and destocking on the part of our customers. We think that this will be the quarter with the largest impact from that, but I'm not sure that it is entirely finished because there's still inventory of our current generation product that's out there and we'll start to see it -- towards the end of this quarter and certainly in the first quarter of next year some -- the start of shipments for our Generation VII product.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch, representing Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to follow up on the whole auto thing because I think even more importantly than what the market's doing is you seem to be articulating a viewpoint that you're gaining a fair amount of market share here. And Chuck, I heard you talk about localization of production. You mentioned technology. I was wondering what exactly are you attributing that market share gains to? And to some extent, could it be a side benefit, if you will, of the DuPont performance coatings sales process that may have driven a bit more into your arms?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, I would attribute our performance to, I think, good work over the last few years. We do have a new-generation electrocoat product, which has been very well received by our customers. We've been well positioned with what our -- some of our new waterborne basecoats and some of our new, more efficient total coatings systems. So in China, as an example, we're doing very well. We've been fortunate to be positioned with some of the strongest customers here in North America. And so I would attribute it to good strong execution. Obviously, the earnings are benefiting from the localization and some of the restructuring. And I think some of these decisions, especially on the OEM side, are longer-term, but I think we've been consistent. We\u2019ve -- this is our core business. We're committed to it and I think our customers are giving us, I think, a strong sense of commitment in return. So we feel pretty good about our current position and certainly the results speak for themselves. They've been great.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And if I could just ask on the restructuring charge -- I'm sorry, the savings that you're seeing. You indicated that in the back half of the year, you anticipate $40 million to $50 million in savings, the back half. Half of the back half of the year is over with the third quarter. So where do you think we -- where do you think you stand with respect to expectations on Q4? And I believe we're going to get the whole $140 million by the -- or at least beyond that run rate by the middle of next year. Where do you stand on that? Could there be upside? Could there be downside, et cetera? If you could just expand upon that, that'd be great.","David B. Navikas","Yes, Frank, this is Dave. I would tell you that in the third quarter, we got maybe 35% to 40% of the back-half savings, so the rest we would be anticipating coming in the fourth quarter.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. And then...","David B. Navikas","And then in next year, the $70 million to $80 million that we had indicated previously, we're still good with that forecast. Our actions are generally on schedule. The things that we need to get done are being accomplished and we expect to see those savings next year as well.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right, terrific. So you're talking about a delta of about $15 million sequentially, Q3 to Q4, in terms of savings strictly due to that. And then given the aforementioned comments with respect to raw materials versus selling prices, it looks like we're going to see 10 in a row.","David B. Navikas","We hope. We don't give guidance, Frank.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Don Carson, representing Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Chuck, a couple of questions on U.S. architectural. You talked about the overall volumes being up, but particular strength in your company stores and is that reflecting a shift away from big boxes back to the contractor channel in general, or is that just dynamics related to your own sort of store location areas?","Charles E. Bunch","I would say the third quarter sales growth was moderate and I would say the volumes were up slightly, lower single digits. Again, stronger in the stores -- in our stores network. But I would say that we did see on what I would call the national account or big box side, they're watching inventories closely. We don't know exactly how that is -- that's going to be positioned here for the fourth quarter or into 2013. But certainly, our customers there are mindful of inventory conditions. We've been tracking -- or it's a little less clear on the out-the-door sales. We get a \u2013 we have a better visibility with our own stores. But I would say there seems to be some inventory management going on with some of our customers there. But I would say that at this point, the volume trends are positive and we would say that for all the channels, but it may be more on the inventory side that you're seeing the differences.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And speaking of inventory, we've seen about a $0.13 per pound price drop in TiO2. Are you -- admittedly, it's a slow seasonal quarter for architectural paint, but are you drawing down your TiO2 inventories further in anticipation of more price reductions next year? And then a just clarification on your TiO2 reduction comment of 4% to 6%. Is that total TiO2 or is that high-quality chloride product and part of what you're doing is substituting the low-grade Chinese TiO2 into your formulation?","Charles E. Bunch","No, that\u2019s -- that would be total TiO2. That's not substitution of sulfate for chloride. That's not in that calculation. And as I mentioned in an earlier question, we still are going to hit at least the low end of that target, which is a 4% productivity improvement in the usage for our overall TiO2, our formulations. And on the inventory destocking, we probably had more inventory relative to sales early in the year. But as we've seen supply loosen up and the pricing stabilized, we've worked down that inventory. So I would say now heading into this fourth quarter and into 2013, we have what I would call normal inventory levels for TiO2, so we're not trying to further destock from this level.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Koort, representing Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Chuck, I seem to recall in the past on Transition rollouts, they were more staggered globally. Is that the same plan this time, or is the whole world moving over to the next-gen at the same time?","Charles E. Bunch","No, we're -- this is still going to be staggered. We're beginning in Europe. And so this one is not a -- your recollection is correct in that we're still going to stage this regionally beginning in Europe in the first quarter.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then if you could hazard a guess, what do you think in Asia or in China, specifically, industrial growth has been in the last 6 months and what might it be the next 6 months?","Charles E. Bunch","Industrial growth, I would -- if you look at the overall GDP, they're talking about 7% to 8%, probably in industrial production, 5% or so. And I would say that we're looking for a similar trend going forward. There was concern as we looked at some of the end-use markets in the second quarter and even beginning in the third quarter. But here at the end of the third quarter, September, was a more solid quarter for us in China. And we think that some of the end-use markets like consumer electronics haven't been that strong. Most of the construction businesses in China have been weaker than those overall averages. But in general, I would say we saw some pretty solid growth, automotive, automotive parts, automotive aftermarket, those were all still quite solid. And so we think that as you go through this transition at the government level and they get their decisions made on -- the economic stimulus packages and the fact that they've had a little less inflation over some of these latest measuring periods. So that's going to give them, we think, a little more flexibility. So I would say that we're looking for a more of the same. So solid growth, but certainly not at the levels that we saw in 2010 or 2011.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi, representing Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","On the Architectural Coatings-EMEA business, volumes down 3% during the quarter, quite a bit of an improvement versus 2Q and I guess in line with your guidance, but your competitor in the Netherlands has really shown the reverse of that profile with 3Q much worse, particularly in Europe and it doesn't look like the trend line has changed into the fourth quarter as well. Can you help us understand the deviation? Is it a geographic distribution or something else?","Charles E. Bunch","I'm not sure. I know Akzo was reporting this morning and we have our board meeting today, so I haven't been able to analyze completely what they have been saying. There is, obviously, a difference in terms of -- in growth rates or growth declines, depending on what regions that you are -- you're competing in. And we have very little exposure in the South, which has been -- that Mediterranean region has been the weakest. So that I would say that their profile, a little bit different than ours and maybe that is what's causing their volume declines to be greater than ours, although, certainly, you know, we feel good about the results in light of the volume declines, but there is not a lot of strength in the European market anywhere at this time and -- but certainly in the South, much weaker.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just going on -- back to the European auto production on Slide 8 where you have the forecast by region, et cetera, I think it was down 11% forecasted for the fourth quarter, basically in line with the trend line for 3Q on a year-over-year basis. But over the last couple of months, we have seen weakness out of Germany in auto sales, et cetera, that seems to be spreading across Europe. Chuck, just based on your conversations with customers, how should we think about the first part of 2013?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, right now, we're starting to come up here. You saw it in the third quarter, this third quarter, and again, now in the fourth quarter of 2012, we're starting to come up against some weaker comparables from 2011. And the market started weakening in the third quarter of last year. Fourth quarter was quite weak. So kind of the year-over-year comparisons, although still negative, are somewhat easier to make. The Germans were quite strong, at least the export-oriented German luxury manufacturers were still strong through the first quarter. We haven't seen -- they haven't fallen off a cliff. The biggest weakness we've seen is in kind of that middle market, the middle market manufacturers. We haven't seen a turnaround yet. I think the beginning of 2013 is going to be -- in the first half looks to be still weak. We're going to see if there are government actions that could try to, let's say, try to make that trend a little less negative. But we're hunkered down and you've seen our results. And despite the weakness there, we continue to do well and we're hunkered down. We're watching everything, every expense, every discretionary item. We're hitting on all the restructuring targets that -- and automotive was a big part of that. So we're aware of the conditions and we're responding appropriately.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander, representing Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Two quick questions. First, could you give an update on your thinking about alternative TiO2 supplies in the sense of either encouraging technology distribution in China or the projects up in Canada with, I believe, it was Argex?","Charles E. Bunch","Yes, we're continuing to pursue these initiatives and opportunities. As I mentioned earlier, the TiO2 pricing, although moderating now, is still up year-over-year if you look at the third quarter of 2011 and not insignificantly. So that I think that the trends would say that we're not going to back off our initiatives either on productivity or expanding our supply base or in trying to use our history in manufacturing in the TiO2 business to enable current TiO2 suppliers to improve their capabilities. We're not backing off any of those initiatives because we've had a few months of stable to slightly lower pricing. So those are continuing and we feel that they will help to position ourselves and hopefully the entire industry to be in a better supply-demand balance going forward.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And secondly, could you give a update on whether you're seeing any share shifts in the BPA -- due to the shift to BPA-free coatings inside cans? And if share is starting to shift, do you have a sense for what timeframe it might be material?","Charles E. Bunch","Right now, all of the \u2013 the major suppliers are all trying to qualify BPA-free coatings. We have seen a lot of activity over the last 18 months, more so than -- we've been preparing for this for quite some time. You're starting to see approvals for PPG and some of the other participants in the market. We've seen a little bit of a slowdown in terms of our end-use customer schedules for when they would convert to BPA-free coatings. And I think we're trying to gauge right now when they would be ready to really launch more products into the metal packaging industries. So right now, I would say, looks like everyone's -- is ready from a coatings supplier standpoint, lots of approvals. We're saying we're ready to go. And we're waiting now for confirmation on when these products will actually be used in the marketplace.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas, representing JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","When I look at your Industrial Coatings operating income year-over-year, it's up a little bit more than $50 million, and that's what your sales are up. So can you sort of help us understand why the incremental margins are so high and why the incremental performance is so much better in Industrial Coatings than it is in any of your other divisions?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, Jeff, it's good to hear from you. I think what I indicated in some of my earlier comments, one, we have focused many of our restructuring actions on our Industrial Coatings businesses, so you're seeing the benefit there of our restructuring actions and higher volumes as we've seen them in most of the regions. So our efficiency is improved. But I think if you recall these comments around localization, the single biggest capital spending project last year for PPG was the construction of an electrical resin facility in Zhangjiagang, China. This benefited our Industrial Coatings businesses, both automotive and industrial and potentially packaging. And this really localized resin supply in China. That helps us to not only meet local demand, but avoid tariffs, duties, freight, all of these incidental costs. The plant came up beautifully. It's been performing. We're at capacity there. And so we are seeing more, let's say, financial benefits from that investment. So that's in the emerging markets. And I think I mentioned that we've done similar things in South Korea, in Mexico. So we have, I think, positioned our assets in these emerging regions where we've been driving a lot of our growth over the last few years to now be self-sufficient at a lower cost basis. And it's timely because the U.S. business, as an example, was supporting many of these other emerging regions. So now as the U.S. and North American growth are coming back, our assets here are able to support those businesses and we're more efficient and lower cost in supporting the businesses around the world. So if you take the effects of restructuring, localization and productivity and overall expense controls, that's why you're seeing such a nice improvement in terms of earnings going to the bottom line from the sales growth.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, is it fair to say that going into the fourth quarter, there's no business of yours that will have higher sequential pricing?","Charles E. Bunch","From the third quarter?","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","From the third to the fourth.","David B. Navikas","There's pockets, Jeff, where we try to get different price at different times of the year. I would say, in general, you're accurate. I wouldn't say exclusively that's correct.","Charles E. Bunch","Yes, overall, I would say that probably is the case.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ivan Marcuse, representing KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Most of them have been answered. I just have a couple quick ones. In the -- once the commodity business is divested, where would you expect your tax rate to be going forward in 2013?","David B. Navikas","The tax rate is going to be in the range of, I would say, 23% to 24%.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then if raw materials sort of stay where they're at today and then going forward into next year, would your raw material total basket be still up on pricing year-over-year or would it be -- or would it essentially be flat to down?","David B. Navikas","2013 if they stay where they at -- where they were at, it'd be close to flat, Ivan. Little bit up to close to flat. And we did see inflation through the first 6 months of this year.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. And then the last question I have is you've mentioned that, and I understand there's a big seasonality in your European business, but then you also called out Europe being a little bit worse. Is there going to be a significant impact on the year-over-year or on profitability, or would you still sort of eke out a little bit of a profit like you typically do, like a 1% or 2% type of margin?","David B. Navikas","Ivan, if you look at the Dura business, it is more seasonal than the architectural business because of the product array. So we'll see -- that part of our earnings growth in that segment year-to-date have been this business. So we'll see some of that benefit. Some of that benefit will be absent in the fourth quarter. So we'll see a more decided seasonality impact.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn, representing Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","A couple of questions and a lot of them have been answered. Just revisiting the Optical for a second. After you get the customers drawing down the inventory and then relaunching with the Generation VII, what's your sense of the sort of the underlying market strength, particularly since you're starting out in Europe where customers don't have as much a disposable income as they did a couple of years ago. Should we expect sort of a single-digit ramp-up or something stronger as you get through at least the first couple of quarters of channel sales?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, I would say because of the European market is positive but not strong, that certainly a single-digit ramp-up is probably a more appropriate growth rate.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then on the other part of the specialty part of the Optical and Specialty, can you just talk a little bit about these other businesses, the silanes businesses, the stuff that's going into the tire market and the automotive market? What's going on there in terms of demand and pricing and any raw material pressures or lack thereof?","Charles E. Bunch","The silicas business continues to perform well. We've seen this year a few regional differences by quarter. So Europe, as we've discussed, in the automotive market has been weaker. North America, a little bit better. But you have in the tire business probably more of an aftermarket. That's bigger than the OEM side. So we've seen some differences. But overall, we're -- there's a solid growth. There's not a lot of raw material pressure in the precipitated silica business. This is sand, soda ash, natural gas. And we have been adding capacity both in Europe and here in North America. And so we think the business is well positioned in North America. The OEM business has a lot of momentum. The aftermarket, not quite as strong with miles driven or not quite as strong and the aftermarket has probably not been quite as robust here. But we think the business is well positioned and poised for continuation of moderate growth if you look at the combination of Europe and North America.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","No raw material shocks for us to watch out for; everything is more or less stable in that area.","David B. Navikas","No raw material shocks. We think natural gas is going to be stable. And if you look at the value that -- the biggest value that precipitated silicas bring to the automotive tires is improved rolling resistance and therefore improved mileage or miles per gallon for the vehicles. And that's still a longer-term trend. So we think that's very positive with the CAFE standards for the automotive industry here or similar trends in Europe. So we think there is solid fundamentals for continued improvement in the precipitated silica business. And right now, no, we don't see any raw material spikes that would threaten kind of the short-term margins on the business.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Very good. And switching gears to your Performance Coatings business, particularly the 2 sort of longer-cycle businesses that you have there, the aerospace business and the marine business. From the marine business point of view, I know you have an order book to look forward to and we knew that this year was not going to be a good year for that business. As you look out into 2013 and maybe even the second half of 2013, is there sort of a light at the end of the tunnel there? Are we starting to see some positive comps coming our way?","Charles E. Bunch","Certainly, in the first half of 2013, we think the current trends of these double-digit declines in marine OEM builds are going to continue. In the second half of 2013, we start to see some moderation of that possibly. We are trying to fill the order book with what I would say would be more of the drilling ships and the natural resource vessels that are under construction in South Korea more than the kind of the ocean-going containerships that are lower value in China. That's been the more effective sector. And we're trying to push for what we would call the protective side of protective and marine coatings. And we think with all the infrastructure spend that's going on around the world, the protective markets offer some good opportunities to kind of mitigate the negatives that we see continuing for a while here in the marine business.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Very good. And then final question on aerospace, can you give us an idea of what your lead times are relative to aircraft deliverables? Obviously, 787 is now starting to ramp up production and I know you have a big component of -- per plane of your products going in there from window coatings to structural adhesive and coatings on the body. The carbon market has, from what I remember, about an 18-month lead time, but obviously yours is a little bit more downstream and close to the completion. So are we looking at 6 to 9 months or sort of a 12-month lead time for your product sales going into the Airbus and Boeing-type markets?","Charles E. Bunch","Right now, we feel that certainly, over the next 12 months, there's good visibility in terms of commercial aviation completion or construction. It's a longer lead item. They don't like to change production schedules in the short term. So I would say that we still feel good on the commercial aviation side, with Boeing and Airbus, that the current trends will continue into 2013. If you start to see declines in the order book going forward, you tend to see them making adjustments later in the cycle. So I would say that if there is more weakness, you may see that in 2014, but certainly not in the near term. There has been -- in some of the other markets, they tend to react maybe a little more quickly, in some cases, general or business aviation. But we, again, haven't seen any strong trends there. Military, which is not a big component of -- or market segment for us, has been already declining. But both the OEM and the aftermarket on the commercial side have stayed what we would say is strong.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar, representing Citi.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","This is Dan Jester sitting in for P.J. Just one quick question. Now that we\u2019re seeing better construction and housing data, how should we be thinking about new U.S. paint store openings over the next couple of years?","Charles E. Bunch","For us, we feel that going forward, our store count will increase. So we are now trying to do our planning for 2013 and beyond. And I think as you know, we've stabilized over the last couple of years in this recessionary environment at around 400 stores. So I would -- I view that as now a floor for us, and you will see a higher store count going forward as we continue to see improvement. And I think that the improvement that we've seen so far has been certainly encouraging, but I wouldn't say it's going to be a rocket ride up here. I think this year, certainly the first quarter, was very strong with some of the improved weather. It stayed positive and I think that trend will continue, although we don't see the growth rates just gearing up and really requiring an acceleration of our plans for store openings at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer, representing Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","When I read through the press release on your use of cash, the sentence, primary means of deploying our strong cash is going to acquisitions, which seems like a more aggressive way you guys are talking about acquisitions now than 3 or 4 years ago. 1, is that true? And then 2, if it is, what are you seeing differently now that you would be more aggressive with acquisitions? Are more people raising their hand and willing to sell businesses today? Have multiples come down? Can you kind of just talk about what you're seeing in the acquisition front and maybe across your businesses where you see more fertile ground?","Charles E. Bunch","Duffy, well, if you go back 3 or 4 years ago, you're talking about 2009 or end of 2008 and we were just starting the Great Recession and we were focused on pretty much hunkering down and getting through this. So since that time, probably as we've come out in 2010 and beyond, we've been more optimistic about and also talking more about acquisitions. We haven't made as many. We did in the fourth quarter of 2010, we bought Bairun in China. We closed on 2 earlier this year, Dyrup and Colpisa. And now we've announced this acquisition at Spraylat. So I would say that -- I think we've been talking about it probably for last 1.5 years or so. We haven't executed as many, but I think now is what you're seeing, and especially in some parts of the world where the growth rates aren't as attractive as they were a few years ago and I think probably in many regions whether it was in the emerging regions where, for a while, they thought these growth rates were going to continue for years or maybe in Europe where they thought the growth declines would be short term and then they'd return to growth, and I think you can tell from our comments that it's a more challenging environment. If you're well positioned, you can do well as we're doing. But I think there's a little more realism on the part of many of these coatings companies or maybe companies more broadly that this reality may be with us for another year or 2 where it's not so easy to be successful. And I think we've seen a little more realism in terms of what their expectations are on the selling prices. So I think you're seeing better dialogue between potential buyers and sellers.","Operator","We have time for one final question. Your question comes from the line of Kevin Hovar (sic) [Hocevar], representing Northcoast Research.","Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research","I wanted to -- with the split option, I know -- I think the initial goal was to get 12.5 million to 13 million share count reduction using the split option. And based on the current dynamics of the market, the stock price of PPG and Georgia Gulf, is that still the goal? Is that still the -- attainable or would it might be a little less than that?","David B. Navikas","Yes, I would say that it's a little bit less than that. I would put more in the 11 million, 11.5 million share kind of range. But obviously, that's a function of the price of the 2 companies' stock.","Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research","Sure. And then just another real quick one. What -- in terms of the packaging coatings, it sounds like the emerging markets was strong, developed markets were a little weak, could you put -- give a little bit color on that and what's driving the emerging markets strength? And then also, how does that \u2013 how does kind of the volume compare to the developed markets?","David B. Navikas","Yes, Kevin, I'll add some color there. The growth in the emerging markets really is driven on a move to more recyclables in those markets away from items such as glass containers, which are heavy in energy intensity and there's a shift again to those recyclable cans and a growing middle class in those emerging markets, so the consumer requirements and consumer desires for more recyclables. If you look at our delta in terms of volume, we were up very solidly in the emerging markets, Latin America and Asia, and we were down modestly in U.S. and Europe, similar to Q2.","Vincent J. Morales","I would like to conclude the call. Thank you for everybody's time, and we appreciate your interest in PPG.

We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our first quarter 2019 financial results conference call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, April 18, 2019. I will remind everyone that we have posted detail commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the Investor Center of our website, ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the opening comments Michael will make shortly.

Today, we reported first quarter 2019 financial results. For the first quarter, our net sales were approximately $3.6 billion, and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.38. Two primary factors that impacted our adjusted EPS were lower global industrial production and significant foreign currency translation headwinds.","On a constant currency basis, our adjusted EPS was modestly higher than the prior year. We\u2019re in the early stages of a margin recovery and delivered higher year-over-year operating margins for the first time in two years. This achievement is one quarter ahead of our internal target as we\u2019ve benefited from continued and further progress and selling price realization and strong cost management during the quarter.","For the first quarter, our net sales in constant currency were flat with the prior year. Sales volumes were down about 3% impacted by weaker global industrial production, most evident in the automotive OEM in market and geographically in Asia. Also half our sales volume decline related to prior year customer assortment changes and our U.S. architectural DIY business. We will anniversary this assortment change after the second quarter. Our selling prices were 2.6% higher marking the eighth consecutive quarter of higher sequential pricing.","In addition, we passed on modest amount of business this quarter as we prioritize margin recovery. Finally, net sales were negatively impacted by significant unfavorable currency translation of more than 4% or about $160 million. We expect unfavorable currency translation to continue into the second quarter and be in the range of $130 million to $150 million.","Looking at some business trends for the first quarter, in our performance coatings reporting segment, aerospace coatings had its fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit percentage sales volume growth led by above industry performance in all major regions. In our automotive refinish business, we continue to see flat industry demand in developed regions. As an example in the U.S. automotive collision claims were down 1% in the quarter. Our refinish business began the integration of the SEM acquisition, which is off to a great start and delivering above segment margins.","And we are beginning that process of expanding their geographic commercial scope. We were pleased that the architectural coatings EMEA sales volumes increased for the second consecutive quarter, a combination of positive sales volumes and higher selling prices supported by mid-single digit percentage net sales growth in the quarter. Importantly, all major sub regions were higher.","As we discussed in the past, this business and this region delivered high incremental margins on increased volumes as we do not need to add any additional costs to support the growth. Our sales volumes in the Mexican PPG Comex business were slightly lower year-over-year driven by the timing of Easter holiday promotion, which will occur in the second quarter. Paint sales in Latin America are historically higher in the weeks leading up to this holiday.","We expect stronger sales volumes in the PPG Comex business in the second quarter. During the quarter, we opened 25 new stores in Mexico and Central America. Sales volumes in architectural coating in Americas and Asia-Pacific decreased due to lower net DIY sales of about $60 million stemming from the prior year customer assortment changes.","We did have positive year-over-year sales growth at our other two key DIY customers for the quarter. Same-store company-owned sales growth in the U.S. and Canada was up a low-single digit percentage impacted by soft market demand for most of the quarter. Protective marine coatings continue to deliver excellent sales volume growth of more than 10% for the quarter. In our industrial coatings reporting segments, sales volumes were adversely impacted by our soft industrial activity and most of the major regions of the world.","Automotive builds were significantly lower in China and Europe. In aggregate, our automotive sales volumes are lower by a half or by high-single digit percentage consistent with global industry build rates. The automotive OEM business made good progress in implementing selling price increases, realizing sequentially higher price in each major region of the world.","Soft global industrial production activity also impacted our general industrial coatings business, most notably in the coil and general finishes segment. As expected, our packaging coatings sales volumes decreased modestly and in comparison to strong above market growth in the prior year, driven by customer adoption to our INNOVEL interior can coatings products.","From an earnings perspective, our first quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.38 was slightly below the prior year quarter. Our earnings were negatively impacted by about $20 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. As I mentioned earlier, excluding this impact, our adjusted earnings per diluted share were modestly higher than prior year. During the quarter, we continue to be impacted by raw material inflation, which was nearly all carry forward inflation from 2018. This was our 10th consecutive quarter of raw material inflation.","In addition, we encourage logistics and wage inflation in the quarter. Recent increases in crude oil prices and some supply disruptions in China and Texas could affect our input costs unfavorably in the next quarter. Selling price increases 2.6% with comparable contributions from both of our operating business reporting segments.","In addition, we made excellent progress on our business restructuring actions delivering more than $20 million in cost savings during the quarter, pacing with our targeted savings. Our effective tax rate was about 24% in the first quarter, which is higher than the 21% rate in the first quarter of 2018. The increase mostly relates to recognizing non-recurring favorable discrete items in the prior year first quarter. We\u2019re still anticipating a full year 2019 tax rate between 23% to 25%.","As we look ahead, we expect global economic activity to remain subdued in the second quarter. We anticipate improvement as the year progresses. Global automotive production is expected to decline in second quarter compared to the second quarter of 2018 and general industrial demand is likely to be modest and uneven by end market and region in the second quarter.","Positive developments around regional and country trade dispute could spark return to higher industrial activity in the second half of 2018. Specific to our business, we believe that more stable interest rates in the U.S. will help drive modest growth in the U.S. housing market and also favorably impact automotive OEM sales.","For the second quarter, we expect U.S. industry automotive builds to be flat. Our U.S. architectural business sales volumes will be down about $60 million, due to the unfavorable customer assortment change. This will be the final quarter for this impact. In Latin America, we intend to face higher sales volumes from normal seasonal demands in the PPG Comex business. Growth rates in Asia are expected to remain soft with some modest improvement compared to the first quarter. We expect our sales volumes in the automotive OEM business to be stronger in the second half of the year based on recently implemented stimulus, and easier comparisons to the prior year.","Overall economic growth in Europe is expected to remain weak with no clear catalyst. We expect sales volumes in our automotive OEM business to be lower than prior year and similar to the first quarter as decreases in industry production builds are expected to continue in the second quarter.","The delay of Brexit will probably continue to lead to higher levels of uncertainties and could impact consumer confidence and overall demand. We expect our regional architectural coatings business to produce favorable sales volumes in the second quarter. We will continue to manage all elements of our business within our control to ensure that we remain competitive regardless of economic conditions.","In addition, the execution of our research and programs will carry on and we expect about $20 million of additional incremental savings to be realized in the second quarter. As mentioned in that earnings press release, we continue to closely monitor the macro economic environment and we will be prepared to implement further cost reduction actions if necessary.","We provide EPS guidance specific to the second quarter of 2019. This guidance is $1.76 to $1.86, which includes an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of $0.05 to $0.07 per share remain fully committed to delivering on the full year targets we announced in January for 2019 of 3% to 5% sales growth and 7% to 10% of adjusted EPS growth, both excluding foreign currency translation.","Our focus on cash generation continues. In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was a net use of cash. This is consistent with our normal seasonal pattern of using cash in the first quarter to prepare for higher sales activity in the second quarter. In addition, this year we intentionally build inventories due to our preparation around Brexit and anticipation of a second quarter ERP conversion in our U.S. automotive refinish business.","This ERP conversion is the last major conversion for all of our U.S. and Canadian businesses with all the previous U.S. coatings businesses successfully converting over the past two years. In addition, the recent SEM and Whitford acquisitions added to our working capital. Our goal for full year remains to reduced working capital as a percentage of sales compared to 2018. We completed the Whitford acquisition in the first quarter and just recently announced the completion of the Hemmelrath acquisition.","The three recently announced and completed acquisitions including SEM, we\u2019ll add about $400 million in annualized revenue and provided with a broader range of products and technology to grow our business.","Accretive earnings acquisitions continue to be our cash deployed preference and our acquisition pipeline remains active. In addition, acquisitions, we continue to invest organically in our business. Capital expenditure is expected to be about 3% of sales in 2019 and we continue to invest in research and development at similar levels as we have done historically. We ended the first quarter with more than $800 million of cash and short-term investments and we continue to have significant financial flexibility.","Finally, as I stated in our annual meeting this morning, in 135th year of business, PPG, 47,000 employees around the world are focused on strengthening our position as the world\u2019s leading paint, coatings, and specialty materials company. We remained steadfast and our commitment to provide innovative solutions for our customers most pressing challenges delivered consistent growth and power people to grow and succeed, create value for our customers, operate our businesses safely, sustainably, and effectively while delivering value to our shareholders. I\u2019d like to thank and recognize the outstanding employees of PPG who help us deliver these objectives each and every day.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG and now Andrea, would you please open the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Kevin McCarthy","Yes, good morning. Michael. I was wondering if you could expand upon your outlook for China in the release, you indicated that you are cautiously optimistic and expect a better back half of the year. Just wondering, how much of that is predicated on a trade deal or are you starting to see stimulus related benefits, any color there would be helpful.","Michael McGarry","Kevin, as you know 13th National People\u2019s Conference took place in the first quarter. The VAT for coatings was dropped from 16% to 13%. VAT for cars was dropped from 10% to 9%. Social insurance contributions were reduced. So, there\u2019s a lot of what I would say, I don\u2019t know, total stimulus is the right word, but there\u2019s a lot of influence in the marketplace that lead to better performance. As you know, we do see automotive numbers in real time. And so we\u2019re optimistic that the second half of the year is going to be better than the first half and we do have insight into, like I said previously, 90 days we have a fair amount of confidence 60 days, 30 days. We have high confidence. So we\u2019re starting to see the early signs of that.","Kevin McCarthy","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, state side, what is your outlook for U.S. architectural and perhaps you could touch on the subjects of whether weather was an impact at all in your first quarter. And what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the macro indicators for architectural coatings demand in the U.S.","Michael McGarry","Well, okay. NOAA, as you know, reported the wettest January and February around. But as we always tell our operating teams, we have to be able to function because somewhere else in the world you get good weather always have a different put and take on that. So we\u2019re not going to point to that. We do see our customers have a good backlog. You know, we do have a slightly different mix and maybe some of our competitors, as far as our stores. But overall, we still think this is a very good market and we\u2019re anticipating favorable comps going forward.","Kevin McCarthy","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Sison of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Michael Sison","Hey guys, nice quarter.","Michael McGarry","Thanks, Mike.","Michael Sison","In terms of the second half of the year, you\u2019ve talked about maintaining your outlook for sales growth ex-currency. So can you maybe walk us through by some of the sub businesses, what type of growth you\u2019re going to see in the second half to sort of hit that full year number?","Michael McGarry","Well, Mike, if you look at the various pieces, let\u2019s start with aerospace. We\u2019re going to continue to see very, very good growth in that business. The underlying trends are very nice. So whether it\u2019s the build rates, whether it\u2019s the military, however you want to frame it, aerospace is going to have a very solid quarter and back half of the year. Refinish, we had a lighter comp numbers in the third and fourth quarter last year, so we\u2019re going to be comping against a little bit easier. PMC, as you saw from the first quarter, are up double digits. We continue to see a recovery in that segment. Marine bouncing off the bottom, strong protective sales in that segment.","So I would tell you that we have a lot of confidence in that. And probably the most encouraging one is architectural Europe. We try to kind of lead you to this conclusion in prior calls. We were the first one to raise price in Europe. We raised it significantly. So last year, we were giving up share preferentially to get prices up. Now our competitors are up. They\u2019re raising price to that business that has historically been ours. It\u2019s been flowing back to us. We had a very good quarter in the first quarter. We anticipate that trend line continuing the second quarter as well as the back half of the year. Comex and our team is just doing a phenomenal job in Mexico, Central America.","So I would tell you that, that\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re getting price there. We\u2019re having customers trade up. Ever since we\u2019ve owned Comex, we brought higher value-added products in there. That\u2019s been a positive. Automotive OEM is a little bit of a wildcard. We see the U.S. as relatively stable, 16.7, 16.8, somewhere in that range. Europe kind of ticking down marginally. But eventually, they\u2019re going to have all these diesel things behind them, and it\u2019s a solid market. So we anticipate a better second half of the year. And then when you think about Asia, similar to what I said earlier, we\u2019ll have very soft comps to compare against in the third and fourth quarter. So that will be better. General industrial, more the same. We see the stimulus having a little more positive impact. So I think there\u2019s a lot of things we would point to that gives us this confidence.","Michael Sison","Great. And then, just a quick follow-up on 2Q earnings outlook. The year-over-year decline in EPS is larger than basically flattish in the first quarter. So are some of the headwinds more daunting in 2Q than they were in 1Q? Because it seems like maybe it should be less. But just curious on your thoughts there.","Vince Morales","Mike, this is Vince. Just a couple of key items to put forward. One, the customer assortment change that Michael talked about earlier, that actually was announced last year March 1. Once that was announced in 2018, we took out most of the support costs before we got to Q2, but we had a full sale in Q2, we would take or pay with that customer in Q2. So they took a full allotment without the support costs. So that assortment is a bit more penal in 2019. We did have obviously a strong automotive market last year in Q2, we didn\u2019t see erosion in the auto market until Q3. Q2 is typically a higher seasonal quarter. So bigger impact in Q1.","And finally in Q2 of last year, if you look at our corporate line, we started to make adjustments to our incentive compensation on our corporate line. I think our corporate line was in the mid-20s \u2013 $20 million range last year and we gave out a projection in the release that will be almost double that in Q2 of this year. So those three of the primary factors that put this a little bit different than Q1.","Michael Sison","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Ghansham Panjabi","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone.","Vince Morales","Good afternoon.","Ghansham Panjabi","I guess first off on auto refinish in Europe and some of the weakness you called out Michael in your prepared comments. I know you touched on pre-buy in Europe, that benefited 4Q. How would you characterize overall market conditions in the region specific to auto refinish?","Michael McGarry","The market over there is not that much different than the U.S. and you have a slightly softer, less collisions down the 1% or 2%, slightly more totals. But overall, we\u2019re still gaining the shops over there, so that\u2019s a positive. Prices, we\u2019ve been able to successfully raise price over there. So I don\u2019t see the trends in Europe any different than I do anywhere else. Now, obviously sequentially, second quarter will be better than first quarter for refinish Europe because of the timing of the price increase. But, I\u2019m not concerned at all about that refinish sales volumes.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay. And then just sticking with Europe and architectural EMEA, last couple of quarters have been positive. They are smaller quarters on a relative basis. I know you mentioned the pricing dynamics and sounds like just some reversion from a market regained perspective. But taking that in context with what you said, Michael, in terms of just the European macro and Brexit, what do you think that is reasonable to expect for the market itself to grow in 2019 there?","Michael McGarry","Well, we still have the same kind of perspective is that it\u2019s going to be a low growth market, let\u2019s call it zero to 2%. But I think what we\u2019re most excited about is the share that\u2019s flowing back to us. And I think the fact that, we do see a number of countries, especially Eastern Europe, which we always view as a good sign when Eastern Europe is doing well. That\u2019s a very good market for us. They\u2019re having some strong numbers and probably a little bit of a surprise to us is UK and Ireland. They\u2019ve outperformed our expectations, we thought with Brexit it would be a much slower market. But surprisingly, we continue to grow nicely in that market.","Ghansham Panjabi","Perfect. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Roberts of UBS. Please go ahead.","John Roberts","Thanks. First a short one and then I have a question on raw materials. Do you think you\u2019ll have the portfolio review by the outside consultants done in time for your Investor Day in early June or do you think it\u2019s going to take until the end of the quarter?","Michael McGarry","John, we\u2019re looking to have something by the end of the quarter.","John Roberts","Okay. And then, is the potential raw material disruption in Texas related to the tank farm fire that occurred in the shipping terminals or is it something else? And how do we think about the volatility in oil prices? Some of your raw materials like solvents follow oil quickly, some a lot more slowly, so they probably didn\u2019t change much in the quarter. And then customers often look at oil is kind of a leading indicator of price. So, I don\u2019t know if you had maybe more pushback on price early in the quarter and now you might have some tailwind here with the oil coming up?","Michael McGarry","Yes, John the fire in Texas didn\u2019t impact anything we buy. But what it does impact is the access to the other products that are in that terminal. So that\u2019s been the challenge. So we regard that as a one quarter disruption. As far as oil, remember we have a \u2013 I always like to say, we have like nine different buckets of raw materials. You got half of them up and half of them down, one of them flat. Oil will impact solvents. But most of our other raw materials are impacted by supply and demand derivative. So, obviously we\u2019re encouraged to see that propylene remains weak, ethylene is \u2013 we view ethylene as the long-term over supplied market, which will help us. So I would tell you that, we still remain firm on our raw material projection, which is low single digits. And that the back half of the year comps will be much easier on raw materials.","John Roberts","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Michael, just on raws again, TiO2. Do you expect to see higher TiO2 prices in 2019 versus last year?","Michael McGarry","So David, our response is the same one we gave in the fourth quarter that we don\u2019t think we need to be talking about TiO2 this year. You have some pluses and minuses but overall it\u2019s a nonevent in our market basket. So that would be the way we would describe that.","David Begleiter","Understood. And just on auto OEM, Michael. Very good job on pricing but obviously weak volumes. Are the weak volumes jeopardizing at all your price initiatives, your price traction in OEM?","Michael McGarry","David, I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m viewing this the same way we saw with architecture. We were the first ones out with price, we\u2019re the most aggressive and trying to hold our customers accountable for us to recover our margins. We provide a lot of values to our customers, a lot of new technology. And obviously we\u2019re getting price across the world in that. So when our competitors are getting as aggressive as we are, if they do that, then we would expect to see some of that volume flow back. Right now it\u2019s more important for us to get price and that\u2019s our number one objective.","Vince Morales","And David it\u2019s Vince. I think our customers clearly understand that calendar year 2017 and calendar 2018, we got little to no price. So we\u2019re still well in arrears in terms of value capture for what we delivered to them.","David Begleiter","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Chris Evans","Good afternoon, guys. Chris Evans on for Bob. So on pricing, eight quarters in a row of improvements, recognizing your industrial coatings margins are still pretty depressed. How much more price is needed there to recover the loss profitability. And then maybe more specifically does the consolidated 1Q pricing you printed this quarter represent a high watermark for the year as comps get harder throughout?","Vince Morales","Yes, Chris this is Vince. I\u2019ll take the second part of your question. We\u2019re still on pricing in Q2. We\u2019re still doing surgical and targeted pricing in not only the industrial segment but in other businesses. So I would definitely not consider as high watermark. And I think you alluded to it properly, we\u2019re starting to stack price on top of price. We still got some need to recover in certain businesses or regions. And we\u2019re going to continue to push to try to fully recover this over the course or balance of this year.","John Bruno","And Chris this is John. Maybe on your cumulative question, if you look at the past 10 quarters, raws are up in cumulative amount of low single digits and pricings maybe up 3% \u2013 a little bit more than 3%. We typically say, we need to get half for the raw material inflation to be even. So that\u2019s the delta we\u2019re looking at.","Chris Evans","Very helpful. And then just sort of stacking that on top of the raw material commentary. And you put up a pretty good \u2013 the best margin performance year-over-year in quite a while. So how does the cadence of your margin sort of trends as the comps in your raw material basket gets lighter and you continue to push price?","Michael McGarry","Well, I think the way I would answer that Chris is that, Vince said that we\u2019re all recognizing that when you compare margins at 2017 and 2018 below our 2016 levels, we need to get back to those levels. The sales teams are well aware of the gap that still exists and the marching orders have not changed. So we\u2019re going to continue to work hard to capture that gap. Our customers know that gap still exists and it\u2019s up to us to get the additional price but also provide additional value to our customers. So it\u2019s a win-win.","Chris Evans","Very clear. Thank you.","Vince Morales","Thanks Chris.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Parkinson of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christopher Parkinson","Great. Thank you very much. So it appears you guys were successful in getting regional OEM pricing all synchronized positively, which I\u2019m sure your team is pleased with. Can you just comment on whether or not this is simply a functionality of just prior price initiatives and obviously everything you\u2019ve been fighting for a while or any additional pricing actions for 1Q? So just basically asking on what assurances does the investment community has that the trends of sustainable moving forward. Thank you.","Vince Morales","Yes, Chris, it\u2019s Vince. Again for us, we worked extremely diligently the past 12, 18 months to secure the pricing that you\u2019re seeing here in Q1. We fully expect that to carry forward for the balance of the year. And again, we do have additional targeted pricing coming in not only in auto OEM but other businesses. So again, our emphasis is to recover our margins fully. But to Michael\u2019s point, we\u2019ve got to make sure we\u2019re demonstrating to our customers the value we bring.","Christopher Parkinson","Got it. And then also in just on the capital location front, given your socks that had a bit of a run here and where you see leverage, just how are you assessing share repurchases on a go forward basis versus mid and potentially large size M&A? Thank you.","Michael McGarry","Yes. As we said coming into the year, it\u2019s pretty active acquisition pipeline and our preference right now remains to vet those acquisitions before we make any considerable decision regarding share repo. But our active pipeline will keep us busy for a little bit of time and will determine whether those are value creating in auto, whether we\u2019re considering them for our portfolio. If that doesn\u2019t work out, we\u2019ll reassess how we\u2019re going to deploy our cash.","Christopher Parkinson","Thank you very much.","Michael McGarry","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Please go ahead.","P.J. Juvekar","Yes. Hi, good morning. Michael, the China\u2019s stimulus, automotive stimulus went into effect I think on April 1. Is that why you feel more positive on second half? And I think a lot of companies are talking about secondary recovery. I mean, do you see any momentum in second quarter now that do you think could last into second half?","Michael McGarry","P.J., we do see how our customers are preplanning. And so we have insight into that. So that\u2019s one item that gives us a little more confidence. Clearly, we see the current production levels that we see in April, but that\u2019s 15 days. Remember, China\u2019s had, if I remember right, nine or 10 consecutive monthly declines \u2013 10 monthly declines in a row. So I\u2019m not going to jump out in front of this right now. Let\u2019s wait until we see how the actual numbers turnout.","P.J. Juvekar","Okay. And then on architectural business, it seems like your store business is growing at or better than the market. So I guess, my question is why not accelerate the store growth by opening more stores? Because the national retail stores and the independent stores seem to be lagging here. So why not grow your own store ways? Thank you.","Vince Morales","Repeat events. Yes, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re growing better than the market. We didn\u2019t say that. We do have a definitional difference with some of our competitors. We include industrial coatings and our industrial segment. Other folks can include those differently. And our industrial business was, as Michael mentioned it, lighter this core in Q1. So again, I would not say, we\u2019re outpacing the market. For us, we go to market with a multichannel approach. We\u2019ve always done that. We do well, certainly, with the Home Depot and other major merchandisers. Our dealer channel, albeit a lower growth channel, is a good channel for us with a low cost to serve and we certainly support our trade network as much as possible. And we\u2019re doing selective additions. We\u2019re doing selective pruning in all those channels.","P.J. Juvekar","Thank you.","Vince Morales","Thanks, P.J.","Operator","Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch of Fermium Research. Please go ahead.","Le\u2019Veon Bell","Yes. Hi. Good afternoon. This is Le\u2019Veon Bell sitting in for Frank. Michael, in a difficult macro environment, in the first quarter, you were able to post a nice result. Especially, relative to the guidance that you guys had issued. So I mean, I just curious as to what were the key factors for PPG to be able to outperform those expectations.","Vince Morales","Hi, this is Vince. A couple things that differ from the beginning of the year, one, we certainly secured pricing at a level that we had \u2013 as hope a little bit better than that. The second issue, as we were very aggressive on our cost management, given the uncertainty in the economic backdrop. And we\u2019ve also seen currency coming in a little better than we anticipated at the beginning of the year, but still negative year-over-year. So those are the three primary factors that deviate favorably from our guidance.","Le\u2019Veon Bell","All right. So we might want to dial in all three of those factors in for Q2 relative to the $1.76, $1.86, just kidding. On the restructuring side, you posted, you said $20 million or I think better than $20 million in savings during Q1. And you said that you\u2019d get that again, in 2Q, or at least I think you said that, where do you stand on 2019? I think I heard you guys talk about $80 million savings in 2018 and around $70 million in 2019. What sort of expectations should we expect that of \u2013 out of the cost cutting actions that you guys have underway?","John Bruno","Yes. This is John. So our number one priority is to complete the restructuring initiatives. We\u2019ve identify those alone. We\u2019ll probably get as close to $70 million and we have additional initiatives that are not necessarily restructuring, that are other costs areas throughout the business, throughout the world that will get us to the $80 million. So we still feel very comfortable with that number.","Le\u2019Veon Bell","Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.","Don Carson","Yes, thank you. A question, a couple of questions at architectural. You mentioned that obviously you lapse the Lowe\u2019s loss in Q3. But how about your Home Depot business in some of the new branch you have there? What kind of year-over-year growth can we expect as we get into the second half of the year? And then on EMEA, can you remind us where you are in terms of volume is relative to your 2007 peak, and what we should think of as incremental margin, so that business as you load more volume.","Michael McGarry","Yes. So Don, I\u2019ll take the first half and let Vince take the second half. We started shipping Home Depot early May, so we\u2019ll have three months of Home Depot versus two months in the second quarter. Obviously, there was a lot of confusion in the marketplace. Olympic was at both Lowe\u2019s and Home Depot. This year, it\u2019s only at Home Depot. So they were still be some people looking around and make sure they find the world\u2019s greatest thing Olympic. But I would envision that, we will continue to have positive comps. I won\u2019t speculate about how much because I think that\u2019s Home Depots business. But the relationship is very good. They\u2019re the best retailer in that space and we\u2019re very privileged to be a partner with Home Depot. So maybe Vince, you want to tackle\u2026","Vince Morales","Yes. In terms of your question, Don, around where we are versus the 2007 peak. We were down still almost 20% in volume for the whole architectural Europe region. So we still have not seen this is the really the first signs of recovery. We\u2019ve seen since the recession in our volumes. That\u2019s a holistic comment. We certainly seen differences by countries, as Michael mentioned, the UK has been a good country for us for the past couple of years, but we\u2019ve seen other markets that have continued to vein. But holistically, we\u2019re down, just under 20% cumulative since 2007. We are recording very high incremental margins, as Michael mentioned in his prepared remarks. These are coming in somewhere in the vicinity of 35% to 40%. So that volume is extremely lucrative to us when it does occur.","Don Carson","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Arun Viswanathan","Hi, guys. Sorry about that. Good afternoon. Just a quick question for you guys on the margin. So obviously, a little bit better than what we had thought. How would you characterize them versus your own expectations? And you mentioned three things as far as slightly better FX, price and cost. Could you kind of bucket that out for us on Q1 and how those three were potentially progress through the year?","Michael McGarry","Well, I think, Arun, the cost management, something \u2013 we were watching our order book every day, where we\u2019re taking necessary actions, business by business, region by region, based on the order book. Q1 was very choppy in terms of the macro. So several of our businesses took immediate and swift action to minimize any cost. If we see the volume come back, I think we\u2019ll have a more traditional cost structure. From a pricing perspective, the only thing we did was get price a little earlier than we anticipated. We thought some of those would drag on into Q2, but the level of pricing that we achieved is what we were targeting. We just had a little earlier than what we anticipated in our guidance. With respect to currency, I\u2019ll let you guys \u2013 you guys are the experts on currency. We just make paints. We don\u2019t predict the currency markets. I\u2019ll let you guys opine on that.","Arun Viswanathan","Okay, thanks. And as a follow-up, your discussions around on margin recovery, I mean, if you guys have targets as to where you want to get back to as far as percent margins. If I went back to the 2008 to 2010 period, it looks like they suffered by 500 basis points and they actually recovered within a year or two. Is it fair to assume that something like that could happen in industrial, because we\u2019ve seen that kind of deterioration over the last couple of years. Thanks.","Michael McGarry","Yes, just generically speaking where we\u2019re targeting 2016 as a marker. There\u2019s a lot happened in the world from 2016 to 2019. So it\u2019s not going to be a straight linear comparison, but 2016, the point in time where we\u2019re using as a marker from our margin perspective. We have work to do as you pointed out. We were targeting to get margin parity by the middle of the year. We were glad to get there in Q1. And then we\u2019re open to improve on our margins year-over-year in the back half of the year.","Arun Viswanathan","And just lastly on that point, would you need incremental volume growth to get back to full parity or continue with that trend? Or could you potentially continue to see margin recovery even in a kind of sluggish volume environment?","Vince Morales","Well, there\u2019s two sides to that equation. We certainly welcome volume. That makes the story a lot easier. In a nascent volume environment, we would expect supply\/demand to work in our favor on the raw material side.","Arun Viswanathan","Thanks.","Vince Morales","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Haynes of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Steven Haynes","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to quickly clarify. So you\u2019re talking margin recovery came in ahead in 1Q 2019, and you\u2019re commenting that will be up in 2Q 2019 as are in the second half of 2019. Can you just comment on whether or not the first quarter was an inflection for margins and how we should we be thinking about that for 2Q.","Vince Morales","Okay. It\u2019s Vince again. Just reiterate, I think we\u2019re anticipating doing the margin parity in the first half of the year, so by the end of the second quarter. Again, we got there a little earlier. Let\u2019s be clear, we\u2019re still several 100 basis points below our targets. So we still have a lot of recovery underway and we\u2019re going to start working our way back there for the balance of this year.","Steven Haynes","And then if I could just get a quick follow-up too. So, the press release talked about you guys passing on some business. Could you just maybe talk a little bit about what categories you are foregoing business in?","Vince Morales","Well, automotive is clearly one, industrial is another. So those are the two biggest areas. And China and Asia in general, what we\u2019ve said is getting price in China is not easy. You have to do it a lot of times by backing up your request for price by saying if you won\u2019t meet the need that we have, we\u2019re happy if you take your business somewhere else and then they get serviced at a, I would say, lower level. And then they\u2019re happy to come back and pay the higher price, and\/or if they\u2019re missing the technology, which is generally the biggest thing they miss, so they come back to us and say we really need that better technology, whether it\u2019s a waterborne, whether it\u2019s the products that help their productivity in their plants or whatever it is, that generally is important because once it\u2019s showing up in their manufacturing line and once their manufacturing people have to account for it, that\u2019s when the purchasing people have less power.","Steven Haynes","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick Fischer of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Mike Leithead","Hey guys. This isn\u2019t Patrick. This is Mike Leithead on for Duffy. Hey, I guess, circling back to volumes, volumes seem to have decelerated the last three quarters even if we exclude some of the customer assortment changes. Can you maybe just talk about how we should think about volume trending into 2Q in the back half? And then, maybe I was hoping you could quantify how much volume or the volume impact from the businesses you\u2019ve passed on in the quarter?","Michael McGarry","So, I think I\u2019ll pass on saying how much we passed on. I think that it varies by business and it varies by region. But what I will tell you is that in the second quarter, we\u2019re still anticipating a little bit softer on the volumes. But when you look at the third and fourth quarter, you\u2019re seeing us comping against a different environment from the third and fourth quarter of 2019. Plus we see the stimulus impact is going to be a positive. We see the U.S. continue to be good market, Mexico continuing to be a good market, and some slight recovery in architectural business in Europe. So, I think there\u2019s enough things out there that give us good confidence level that our predictions are going to be relatively accurate.","Vince Morales","And Mike, I got to add, I think the volume erosion, if you look over the past four quarters or three quarters, as you mentioned, is really coming in the industrial segment. That segment had been producing 3%, 4% volume growth up until really the third quarter last year. And everything we see in that particular segment has really been macro-driven. Obviously, with China auto coming off, European auto coming off, the halo effect of that around the general industrial businesses that get affected by kind of Tier 1, Tier 2 suppliers. So that\u2019s all macro. And again, we\u2019re going to anniversary some of that as we go into the back half of the year here.","Michael McGarry","And Mike, just to put that in perspective, we had 13 quarters in a row of positive volume in our industrial coatings business. So I\u2019m not going to \u2013 I don\u2019t like this quarter, but we\u2019re still looking at our sales teams doing a very good job on the marketplace.","Mike Leithead","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then if I could drill into aerospace, strong solid green, and when I look at your slide, and above-market growth in every region. I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit more about what\u2019s driving that growth, whether it\u2019s product mix or new share gains or other factors that\u2019s driving the above-market growth there?","Michael McGarry","Well, it\u2019s actually a factor of everything. Our sealants business continues to gain share. Our coatings business continues to gain share. And certainly, our transparencies business has done a phenomenal job of winning new programs left and right. So every one of those is a positive. You have commercial aero. Commercial is doing very well. Military is doing very well. And the only semisoft would be the general aviation. But our biggest customer, who is very large in that general aviation market, is winning share. So we\u2019re also affiliated with the right customer. So we did factor into our second quarter guidance some of the most recent commentary from one of the large OEM plane makers. But overall, we\u2019re going to have a very solid second quarter and a record full year in aerospace.","Mike Leithead","Great. Thanks, guys.","Vince Morales","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Shmois of Longbow. Please go ahead.","Gary Shmois","Hi, thanks. Now that margins have recovered year-over-year and pricing is like set now on pace. Wondering if there\u2019s any lessons over the last couple of years that you could take forward if inflation does again start to ramp so that you can offset inflation maybe faster than expected?","Vince Morales","Yes. I\u2019ll let Michael answer the question, but I want to make sure for our salespeople on the phone, our margins are not recovered. So we\u2019d be very clear for that. We still have room to go. Go ahead, Michael.","Michael McGarry","So, clearly, as I tried to explain the last time, there were two events that clearly impacted the rate of initial early recovery. And the first one is our friends in Cleveland, Valspar, I think the Valspar team, without speaking for one of my peers, they were a little slow off the block. That was a challenge. We were trying to buy our friends in the Netherlands. At that time, they immediately went into a mode of saying they were going to grow 4% volume. And that doesn\u2019t work in an environment where raw materials are going up, you need to be focused on getting prices up. So the competitive environment is the challenge at that point. So clearly, a couple of us got off a dime and were moving quickly than the others. Now, not everybody, but most everybody is on looking at their margins and getting a lot of pressure from the shareholders and they\u2019re trying to recover margin. So I think that\u2019s one lesson learned. And maybe the other lesson learned is we need to stick to it and maybe we should have walked away from some volume a little bit earlier. And so maybe that\u2019s the lesson learned.","Gary Shmois","Thanks for the color. A follow-up question on, just going down I think $10 million from $55 million to $60 million, not a $45 million to $50 million, is that part of the cost savings program? Or is there something else going on?","John Bruno","Gary, that\u2019s our normal seasonal trend. Our corporate cost are historically higher in the first quarter for some different reasons and then the second through fourth quarter normally are at a lower level, but similar.","Gary Shmois","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Vince Morales","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. Nippon Paint seems to have agreed to buy Dulux in Australia. Was that a property that you were interested in and you didn\u2019t want to pay as much as they paid? Or was that just not a property that interested you at all?","Michael McGarry","Jeff, this is Michael. What we always tell everybody is on every acquisition in the coatings, paint and specialty products space that we have, we\u2019re always interested in looking at everything. And just because we don\u2019t get something doesn\u2019t mean that we aren\u2019t interested. But what I will tell you is that if we were always winning, then people would be concerned. But at the same time, every company makes their own decisions about what is the right price to pay and how does that impact their shareholders. And so I would say different people have different answers for the exact same acquisition. So all I will tell you is that we try to be active, we try to look at everything. But for PPG, right now, we\u2019re very comfortable where we are.","Vince Morales","The other thing I thought just to add thought, I think you know this of course, but we have a very good architectural business in Australia and a growing business there. So we are on the continent and we\u2019re number two on the continent.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. Can you talk about what your operating cash flow was in the quarter and are you having a very different experience in your raw material price changes in the United States versus your raw material price changes in the offshore markets? And that it seems that, propylene is pretty weak in the U.S. but the oil price has really left it in the offshore markets. So are we seeing inflation in the offshore markets and deflation in the domestic markets and again, what was your operating cash flow in the quarter?","Michael McGarry","Jeff, I\u2019ll take the first one. Vince will jump on the second one. So our operating cash flow was a use of cash, I believe it was $66 million used, which is less than a use of cash than we had in the first quarter of last year. We\u2019ll have our full cash flow statement released here shortly when our Q was filed.","Vince Morales","I do want \u2013 I\u2019ve mentioned something again, we were pleased with the results in the quarter, but one of the metrics we were not pleased with was our \u2013 we had a little bit of growth in working capital. A couple of the causation factors there. We along with most other companies build a lot of inventory around Brexit and now that that\u2019s been extended out, we\u2019ll be able to work that down.","Michael mentioned, we\u2019re going live with the new ERP system and our refinish business in the U.S. we\u2019ve built inventory ahead of that as a contingency and both the SEM acquisition and the recently close Whitford acquisition, we actually have stepped up that inventory as part of acquisition accounting and until that inventory flows through cost of sales and that\u2019s a high level of inventory ahead of retail price. All that being said we got to get our working capital down to prior year levels. We have the teams in last week talking about that specifically, so we\u2019re focused on that.","So again we\u2019re in better in our cash flow in last year, but still more room to go. With respect to raw material inflation, we don\u2019t see any differences really at this point by geography. We think it will be more driven by supply demand as opposed to the things you mentioned. The supply demand situation is different in each of the major regions and that\u2019s typically \u2013 especially in a light volume environment, that\u2019s typically more of a predictor of which way the raw materials may go by region. But we haven\u2019t seen anything to-date.","Michael McGarry","Jeff, the only thing I\u2019d add is, Latin America south, so if you go all the way down to the southern part, that\u2019s more U.S. dollar based, so the weakness in the currency can have impact. So but no real material, when we think about our total sales in Latin America south, that\u2019s not a material number. So you should not assume that there\u2019s a material difference between the regions.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Michael McGarry","Thank you, Jeff.","Operator","Our next question comes from John McNulty of BMO. Please go ahead.","John McNulty","Thanks for taking my question. Michael, you indicated, I believe not only where there are supply disruptions in Texas, but it looked like there may have been some in China. Can you articulate what products are affected? What\u2019s necessarily disrupting that supply and also the timing on when you think it\u2019ll be remedied?","Michael McGarry","Well, let\u2019s start with the original issue. Going back a year ago is the Blue Skies initiative for China in 2018 led to a lot of disruption and we saw coming into 2019 that they had delegated from Beijing to the provinces, the enforcement of environmental actions. And so they were much more focused on employment and so the supply was much more readily available. But once they had the explosion in Jiangsu province, this has led that province to get much aggressive on some of the under performers.","And so the impact of the things that you probably can\u2019t see in your numbers, but think about the antibacterial products that you might buy, making sure the paint in the cans are healthy, that would be one. There are some unique epoxies that would be coming out of there. That would be another one, but overall what we see is that it\u2019ll take a little while for them to resource themselves out, we\u2019re paying most attention to is what the enforcement level is going to be post the next say quarter two, quarter three, whether it\u2019s just going to be contained as a Jiangsu province or whether they\u2019re going to \u2013 again, much more aggressive if you will and re-institute the controls out of Beijing that\u2019s what we\u2019re paying attention to.","John McNulty","Got it. Thanks very much for the color.","Michael McGarry","Thanks John.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Byrne of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Steven Byrne","Yes, thank you. We\u2019ve seen PPG sales reps in the Home Depot paint aisle, I just wanted to ask you, what\u2019s the scale of that initiative and is it getting any traction with respect to either driving more paint in Home Depot or specifically PPG brands versus their?","Michael McGarry","All major suppliers to all the major home centers have sales reps that are covering the stores. Dependent upon the agreement with the various vendors, you get X an amount of sales rep for X number of stores. So, the good news is I think the Home Depot team has a very solid approach where everybody focuses on the customer and driving conversion in the store. And that\u2019s the metric that they hold us and our competitors are accountable for. And I think our teams have been doing a very good job in Home Depot plus a number of our retail partners as I said on my opening remarks, we had positive comps at the other large DIY change, which is good, but we\u2019re not doing anything different than what our peers are doing.","Steven Byrne","And Vince, you mentioned the fact active acquisition pipeline kind of given your commitment in Home Depot is that pipeline that you\u2019re looking at include any potential shelf space expansion within Home Depot to branch out into different products within the retail DIY channel?","Vince Morales","Yes, I would call it an acquisition possibility. Again, we worked with Home Depot on what products, what value we can bring to them on a product-by-product basis. So again, I wouldn\u2019t consider that to be any type of an acquisition relationship.","Steven Byrne","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Harrison of Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.","Mike Harrison","Hi, good afternoon.","Michael McGarry","Hi Mike.","Mike Harrison","Michael. I was wondering if you could comment in a little more detail on the weakness that you saw on the Latin America architectural market during the quarter. I know you mentioned that the timing of the Easter holiday was a factor. Can you maybe talk about other factors there and whether you\u2019ve seen those trends improve?","Michael McGarry","Yes. The only other factor that is relevant is really the fact that we have done a lot of value selling up the chain, so when we bought Comex, there\u2019s been some additional technology brought in, so there\u2019s a lot more premium products being sold to them. The coverage of the premium products is better than that what I would call the value products. So that leads to a little bit on a share or I wouldn\u2019t say net share but the volume numbers being negative, but when you look at the overall impact to the EBIT, it\u2019s very positive.","So we actually even though our volume was marginally down we actually had a record quarter for the PPG Latin America team and we\u2019re anticipating the same. Overall though the timing of Easter \u2013 there\u2019s two major holidays in Mexico, Easter and Christmas and Christmas doesn\u2019t move, but Easter does and that\u2019s the impact. So we kicked off our Easter promotions a couple of weeks ago and so all that falls in the second quarter instead of the first quarter.","Mike Harrison","Got it. And then in the protective and marine business, it looks like that marine piece is growing faster than the protective piece. Wondering if you could just comment specifically on marine and the growth rates that you\u2019re seeing in those key markets, I feel like you\u2019ve said in the past you\u2019ve said you have pretty good visibility on what\u2019s going on in the marine business, so is the strength there going to be sustainable?","Michael McGarry","Yes. So we started taking up the orders in the second half of 2018. They\u2019ll generally paint the ships 12 month to 18 months after the order comes in, but this is off a very low base. So you know the marine business is probably down 60% from its peak. So we are coming off a very low bottom, overall the business though is positive both in protective and marine that lead that double-digits, and we anticipate that a trend line continuing.","Mike Harrison","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my call. Quick question on the \u2013 sort of the construction market and I know you\u2019ve sort of pushed off the question on whether and how big of an impact it had on construction, but other companies are not so shy about the siding rather than as a delaying factor in getting the construction teams in North America ramp-up. Have you seen anything improving in terms of March and first couple of weeks of April here that can give us confidence that, that market is coming back and whatever built-up demand and backlog your contracted customers and stores are experiencing, will be fulfilled over the next couple of quarters.","Vince Morales","Yes, Dimtry this is Vince. One of the issues we had with the comparison in early April is the Easter. Easter fell very late at April last year. So really the proxy is diluted in order for us to compare, you normally can get a good pickup there by now, but it\u2019s a bit diluted. I would say we\u2019re not displeased with what we\u2019ve seen in April, but it\u2019s too early to make a call and whether we\u2019re seeing some pickup from March.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay. All right. That\u2019s it. Thanks for Vince. Second question in the three acquisitions that you\u2019ve done \u2013 that you\u2019re carrying into 2019, what kind of revenue contribution should we be thinking about for these businesses? Are we talking about 1% to 2% incremental growth to your organic growth or is that going to be something lower than that?","John Bruno","Dmitri, this is John, I\u2019ll take that. So annualized these three acquisitions total about $400 million of annual revenue. The majority of that\u2019s going to be the industrial coatings, Whitford and Hemmelrath posted at the Industrial Coatings segment. In our initial guidance we provided in January, we said about $250 million benefit, this year that could be a hair higher because we have been able to complete both acquisitions maybe a little bit faster than we originally thought.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then finally on the refinish side of the business, you talked about the overall market being flat, little bit of about 1% decline or so in collision rates in Europe and U.S., your business was down volume wise, you\u2019ve talked about low single-digits so let\u2019s say 1% to 2%. Is that in line with sort of what the market declines you saw?","Are you still kind of suffering from being the price leaders and therefore we should see that performance improve as the year unfolds and you recapture some of those business?","Michael McGarry","I think last year we were a skosh below the market 1% maybe, but overall, when I look at our customer base and when I see the market and the fact that we\u2019re still having a number of shop wins. I feel comfortable that we\u2019re a relatively close to the market.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Got you. Okay. Thank you very much.","Michael McGarry","Yes, Dmitry.","Operator","Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Laurence Alexander","Good afternoon. Two quick ones then, first, for the share gains above the market in the aerospace. Is your spread against the market getting wider as you look at the wins that you have in the pipeline? Or should we think of it as roughly steady state?","And secondly, on raw materials. Can you give us a little bit of a longer-term kind of perspective on how you\u2019re thinking about your raw material chain? Because several parts of the channels, suppliers appear to be talking a lot more than they use to about higher hurdle rates for reinvestment. And so are you worried about \u2013 are you seeing any though risk of capacity lag, in your raw materials lagging your expectations for demand growth over the next say three, five years?","Michael McGarry","Well, I\u2019m not worried about them investing right now, because their incremental margins are very high. So if you look at most of our suppliers, I won\u2019t name names, you can do it yourself. But they\u2019ve had a very good run the last few years, so I\u2019m not worried about them from that standpoint. I think our short-term perspective, we said it would be low single-digits on the low side of low single-digits, we still see that, we\u2019re still holding to that. And so I think we\u2019re in the right spot, Laurence.","Vince Morales","Yes, and then Laurence your first question I have that is again, I think what we\u2019ve \u2013 this is an industry that values technology sort of really plays into our sweet spot. I think we\u2019ve been able to work with our customers once they gain share, we\u2019re gaining more than our share of new products or new entrance and the new products that are \u2013 they\u2019re putting into the marketplace. So that\u2019s really where we\u2019re winning in aerospace.","Laurence Alexander","Thank you.","Michael McGarry","Our next question comes from Jim Sheehan of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.","Jim Sheehan","Thank you. Is it correct to say that the Whitford and Hemmelrath acquisitions are \u2013 those businesses are below average PPG margins? And if so, how long do you think it would take for you to expand those margins to average levels?","Vince Morales","Hey Jim, Vince. As Michael said in his prepared remarks, SEM is performing at above their segment margins that was a highly accretive acquisition for us, good array of products, very well recognized brand in the marketplace and that\u2019s performing above segment. Whitford and Hemmelrath will come in as traditional acquisitions below segment margins and it\u2019ll take us 12 to 18 months to scale those up as we work through the synergy capture.","Jim Sheehan","Perfect. And regarding M&A in global coatings, how would you characterize deal multiples in the sector? Do you think they\u2019re mostly frothy or are you seeing some reasonable numbers today?","Michael McGarry","Well, Jim it really differs based on geography, based on market \u2013 end market, so it\u2019s hard to call a singular answer to that question. There are certainly things that we looked at as we probably won\u2019t act on or didn\u2019t act on. And there\u2019s other things based on synergies and post multiples that we have an interest in. So it really depends \u2013 it\u2019s episodic by what\u2019s out there today. And then again, I\u2019ll just reiterate, there is a certainly activity in the marketplace.","Vince Morales","And Jim the other thing I would add is, we bought some Whitford and Hemmelrath and each one of them had a different multiple. But the way we look at is post synergy, what does that multiple look like? And they were all in the single-digits range, so you have to really parse these things into the acquisition, what\u2019s your pain, what\u2019s your synergies are, what\u2019s your growth is. And so there is a lot of other factors, so you just can\u2019t look at just the multiple.","Jim Sheehan","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Hocevar of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.","Kevin Hocevar","Hey, good afternoon everybody. Vince you mentioned pricing, that you realize pricing a little bit quicker than you thought in the first quarter. And you also mentioned that it might not be the high watermark of the year. So does that suggested the \u2013 in the second quarter you\u2019ll see a bit of a higher year-over-year growth rate in pricing?","And then I think on last quarter\u2019s call you mentioned about 2% of the 3% to 5% constant currency sales growth would be from price. Did do you view that as having a little bit of upside based on how the year started?","Michael McGarry","Well, two things we do expect the higher absolute dollar pricing in Q2 versus Q1. But I\u2019ll remind you, last year we started to get price throughout the year. So again, we\u2019re stacking on top of a harder comp. So the percentage remains to be same Kevin, but on a pure staff dollar basis, we definitely expect higher Q2 pricing than in the prior year.","Kevin Hocevar","Okay. Got you. And then on the \u2013 you mentioned in the press release, ready to take action if need be on the cost savings front. Is that just simple blocking and tackling in areas where there might be weakness or is there PPG has done $8,000 million type cost savings programs, couple of those over the last couple of years? Or is that something bigger like that?","Michael McGarry","I think those comments are primarily focused on what you would call traditional blocking and tackling. We can\u2019t hide from the fact that the economies out there is dropping, there\u2019s a lot of things that aren\u2019t within our control. And we \u2013 if we see something going sideways or down even in a more draconian way, we\u2019ll take whatever decisive actions we need to take and that could be deeper than blocking and tackling. But I think the mention we had in the prepared remarks is really around blocking and tackling.","Kevin Hocevar","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.","John Bruno","Thank you, Andrea, this is John Bruno again, I would like to thank everyone for their time and interest in PPG.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Vincent J. Morales","Thank you, Philip, and good afternoon, everyone. Again, this is Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations for PPG Industries. Welcome to our third quarter 2013 financial teleconference. Joining me on the call today from PPG is Chuck Bunch, PPG's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Sklarsky, Executive Vice President of Finance and CFO.","Our comments relate to the financial information we released today, Thursday, October 17, 2013. I will also remind everyone that approximately 1 hour ago, we posted commentary and accompanying presentation slides at our Investor Center on our website at www.ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call, and they provide additional support to our opening commentary.

As all of you can obviously tell, I have been having issues with my voice these past few days. I've been told I need to limit the amount of my talking to rest my voice so it can return to normal. So I am going to leave the vast majority of the earnings call commentary today to Frank and Vince. I will stay on the line and participate in the call. I want to express my regrets to everyone for this unexpected issue.","Now I will turn the call over to Frank to go over our prepared remarks.","Frank S. Sklarsky","Thanks very much, Chuck, and good afternoon, everyone. We do appreciate your continued interest in PPG.","Today, we're very pleased to report our third quarter financial results, which included records for both sales and adjusted earnings per share. Our sales in the quarter of $4 billion were up 17% versus last year. Our adjusted earnings per share of $2.44 from continuing operations exceeded our prior year record by 31%.","Similar to last quarter, we more than fully replaced the earnings per share reduction stemming from the separation of our former Commodity Chemicals business. Feeding our performance in the quarter were improvements in overall market conditions, and compared with the first half of 2013, our year-over-year sales volume trends improved in each major region during the quarter. Our growth rates in North America improved and were more broad-based and included continuing benefits from aerospace, automotive OEM coatings, and Architectural Coatings, as well as contributions from most other businesses. In Asia, higher demand occurred in most end-use markets we supply. However, marine new-build activity remains sharply negative on a year-over-year basis. Lastly, while volumes remained slightly negative in Europe, the trend has significantly improved versus the earlier quarters this year as we experienced some initial signs of stability in the region. Our volumes were down 2% in the Euro region during the third quarter compared to mid to high single-digit percentage declines experienced in the first half of 2013.","Another contributing factor to our performance is the ongoing aggressive management of our cost base. Our cost actions included the continued implementation of the business restructuring actions that were approved and started in early 2012, as well as other ongoing discretionary cost reduction initiatives. As a result of both the improving regional demand trends and our proactive cost management, PPG team delivered record third quarter earnings in all major regions, once again this quarter, including Europe.","Another element contributing to our overall stronger financial performance was the result of our cash deployment, including the sales and earnings benefit from the North American Architectural Coatings business we acquired from AkzoNobel on April 1. Sales in the quarter from the acquired Akzo business, approximately $400 million, and we achieved an earnings return on sales in the upper mid-single-digit percentage range.","We continue to integrate the business and with good progress. Within 6 months of closing on the acquisition, we've already achieved, on a run-rate basis, over 50% of our full acquisition synergy target of $200 million. While we still have a considerable amount of work to complete, we're pleased with the team's progress to date. In addition, we spent $180 million in the quarter on share repurchases, bringing our year-to-date total to about $325 million or slightly higher than 2.1 million shares repurchased.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect to continue to benefit from the gradual growth in global demand trends. The fourth quarter is seasonally slower than the third quarter in many of our businesses and especially Architectural Coatings. We're expecting a larger magnitude of sequential seasonality this year as Architectural Coatings now represents a larger proportion of our revenues following the previously mentioned acquisition. Regarding regional trends, we expect the U.S. economy will continue its modest growth supported by increasing demand in the many markets we supply.","Emerging region growth is expected to continue and remain inconsistent by end-use market and country. In Europe, where our volumes are still down about 20% versus prerecession levels, demand appears to be stabilizing, and we remain poised to benefit from the operating leverage based on any volume improvement given the actions we have taken there to substantially reduce our ongoing cost structure.","Also from an overall PPG perspective, we remain focused on achieving additional cost efficiencies and have started implementation of the business restructuring program that our Board of Directors approved during the quarter and was included in our reported earnings today. The elements of the program include securing remaining synergies in the acquired Architectural business, along with targeted actions in certain businesses that continue to face challenging market conditions, including protective and marine coatings, Architectural Coatings EMEA and fiberglass. As these actions are now just being implemented, they will only provide nominal earnings benefit in the final quarter of 2013. However, given the rapid payback nature of these actions, we expect to realize the majority of the savings benefit in 2014.","Finally, our year-to-date cash from operations is $1.3 billion, up about 25% versus last year, which includes the benefit of our strong earnings results, coupled with improved working capital performance. We once again ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and with cash and short-term investments of about $2.2 billion.","We remain focused yet disciplined on timely cash deployment geared towards earnings accretion, and we continue to assess potential acquisitions and other growth-related uses of cash with attractive rates of return, including organic capital spending. We expect additional free cash flow in the fourth quarter, which is traditionally our strongest cash generation quarter seasonally. And in the continuing heritage of returning cash to shareholders, we are increasing our targeted full year 2013 share repurchase level toward the higher end of our previously communicated range of $500 million to $750 million.","Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now operator, would you please open the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, on your prepared comments, you noted that auto refinishing was a little bit weaker in North America. Just curious as to why this is because previously you talked about weakness in Europe, but was it just a tougher comp in North America or was there something else there?","Frank S. Sklarsky","Yes, I think that's it. It's still doing very well. It's just really the comparison as you mentioned. This is still performing quite nicely with good profitability. So no significant issues there.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just sort of on Europe, just given your commentary of Europe stabilizing or less bad, if you will, does that region get more attractive for you? As you start to think about future acquisitions, are you sort of repositioned for the upturn in the various countries there?","Frank S. Sklarsky","Certainly, the acquisition of pipeline that we're looking at is going to include a variety of opportunities in all the regions in a variety of businesses. So we certainly wouldn't shy away from that should a good opportunity present itself. But yes, I mean, when we look at the outlook for 2014, fourth quarter and 2014, things are stabilizing and turning. The decline rates in those businesses that are still showing decline are moderating substantially. Auto business continues to do very nicely, aerospace and some of the others. So yes, we would not shy away from Europe as a region.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. Chuck, I hope you feel better soon.","Charles E. Bunch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes. Chuck, let me offer my well wishes for a speedy recovery of your voice. Frank, a large part of the transcript and some of the commentary did revolve around Europe, and you're seeing pockets of growth there and you're suggesting signs of stabilization. What gives you the confidence? And where are those pockets of growth? And looking at that Slide 9 where you see how the year-over-year volume trends are moving in the right direction, I mean, are -- is it fair to say that we're going to get close to the breakeven point in the next quarter or 2 and then start seeing positive comps there?","Frank S. Sklarsky","I mean, if you look at it from a macroeconomic standpoint, all the economists are projecting a very modest GDP growth next year. And we're kind of seeing the same kind of outlook when we talk to our businesses. The recent trends have pointed very clearly to dramatically reduced decline rates. We see that in Architectural, we see that in the Industrial segments and the refinished segments, PMC, and so forth. And auto continues to be very positive and strong, and that has not subsided. So the vast majority of our businesses are starting to migrate toward that breakeven lines and a few of them already have crossed that. And so we are cautiously optimistic and see more favorable trends. And certainly, as we get into next year, if the GDP prognostications are correct, I mean we expect things to turn. And again, as we said, we think there's some really nice operating leverage out there in the months and years ahead, given all the work that's taken place on the cost base.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","You're already seeing, in some avenues, positive comps already but the expectation is that 2014 will bring a lot -- or more of it if the forecasts are correct. And speaking of 2014, obviously, you guys have a lot of self-help measures in place. The comments about Akzo synergies running a little bit ahead of schedule, at least on a run rate basis. Then you talked about restructuring benefits. How should we be thinking about the year-over-year delta benefit 2014 from those sorts of actions? Can you kind of quantify it and size it for us?","Frank S. Sklarsky","Yes, I mean, if you -- if we start with the synergies from the Akzo acquisition, as we said, we are a little bit more than halfway to the $200 million on a run rate basis. So if you look at the end of this year, call that $100 million-plus out of the $200 million on a run rate basis. And then by the end of 2014, expecting to be upwards -- to the $175 million to $180 million on a run rate basis by the end of the year. And if that occurs evenly throughout the year, which we fully expect, you would book about half that increase actually in the year. So that's that piece of it. On the restructuring programs, of course, when we had the program in 2012 and the benefits from that, we accrued some of that last year. We expect an amount around $80 million in addition this year and then the trailing amount of a modest amount, low double-digits in 2014 to accumulate to the total benefit that we had originally anticipated. And then the new program, we're really not going to see anything significant in terms of benefits in 2013 as we're just getting things underway. But I would say the majority of that new program, the one we announced, the $98 million, the majority of that is associated with achieving the synergies that we've already talked about for Akzo and then a more minority piece, but still significant, is associated with some of the other regions and businesses as we described, and we expect to get most of that remainder occurring through 2014.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs.","Neal Sangani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is actually Neal Sangani, on for Rob. Can you maybe, just going back to the synergies, talk a little bit more on the revenue side about what you're seeing and what the outlook is and others, maybe some store closings left to do? And what synergy opportunities are you seeing in brand rejuvenation or anything else on the revenue front?","Vincent J. Morales","Neal, this is Vince. With regards to the Akzo business, the acquired business, we've gone through our process to rationalize the store network already. So we've done that, and that process had been completed. As we noted, we still had for the acquired business about $400 million of sales, which is comparable to what Akzo had last year when the business was still owned by them. With respect to any further revenue synergies, we didn't have any revenue synergies in the project. And again, we're maintaining the top line with a smaller, a more consistent store base, let's say.","Neal Sangani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the aerospace side, what contribution is the Deft acquisition having on the top line?","Vincent J. Morales","What we said is that's about a $50 million a year business on the top line. And it's fairly prorated throughout the year, so each quarter's a little over $10 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer from Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","You guys have a pretty good history of macro analysis, I guess. So you've just gone through probably your '14 planning reviews with all the business leaders, where do you think your guys are more or less negative than kind of the consensus economic stuff that you're reading?","Frank S. Sklarsky","Yes. We're still finalizing and in the process of our 2014 planning, so not complete there just yet. But I would say that, overall, our folks internally are relatively consistent with what you'd see out there from the economists. We start with the GDP projections and also get projections on things that are industry-specific, automotive OEM, for instance, and then look at how we participate in those markets and what new products or offerings that we can offer and put our planning process together from there. But in general, I would say, to your direct question, we don't see -- we don't have any major differences with the major economic assumptions out there with respect to either GDP or exchange rate or things like that.","Vincent J. Morales","And Duffy, I'd say in one instance, which is in Asia, I think we've been a bit more bullish regarding Asia all year. I think our numbers have been -- outside of the Marine business, our numbers have been supportive of our stance. And we have a very good array of businesses there that are really focused on middle-class consumption, automobiles, auto repair, packaging, refinish. And those are what's being propped up, if you will, in China with all the -- their 5-year plan. And so, again, I think we -- our bullish stance there has been warranted.","Frank S. Sklarsky","Right. And I guess, just to add to that, we don't have as significant a presence in the Architectural, which is not -- doesn't particularly bother us right now given maybe some of the modestly -- more modest growth rates in the residential and commercial real estate in the China market right now. So I think things are in fairly good shape.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then in the written commentary, a number of points around the seasonality, kind of Q3 going to Q4, which would lead one to believe that numbers need to come down a little bit, is there something different about the seasonality this year versus what we should expect going forward or what's the right template to think about what a Q3 going into a Q4 should look like with the new footprint?","Frank S. Sklarsky","When we think about the trends, Q3 to Q4, that has not really changed. That same dynamic occurs. All we're trying to do is make sure that there's a common understanding around the fact that because the North American Akzo business, we acquired it on April 1, this is the first quarter, this year's fourth quarter is the first fourth quarter where we will have that business in the mix. And given its significance, the fact that it will exhibit a similar seasonality decline rate from Q3 to Q4, that will just make up a larger proportion of the mix. That's a $1.5 billion business on a run rate basis, let's say. So -- but we said about $400 million of revenue in the third quarter, that declines to 25% per the slide we published this morning. As the other Architectural businesses, it's just making sure there's an understanding of that dynamic. It's just a bigger piece of the pie, but the dynamics really haven't changed at all.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.","Robert Walker - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","This is Rob Walker, on for Laurence. I guess on Europe, so this year, your volume is down mid-single-digits, earnings are likely up mid-teens year-over-year. I know a lot of that's restructuring. I guess, is it normalization improvement you're seeing there? If volume is flat next year, how much can profits grow or do you need volume growth to get the incremental margin benefit?","Frank S. Sklarsky","Yes. I would say if you look at where our earnings profile is right now, if there were to be no change in the volume run rate versus where we are in Q3, you would see an incrementally better profitability story, certainly, in the first half of 2014 because we've gotten a lot of cost rationalization as we have come through the year 2013. But any modest improvement in volume, because we do not have to add structural cost either in the area of capacity in most cases or back office, you're looking at a 30% to 40% profit contribution to the bottom line from incremental volume improvements. So you'll get some improvement in the first half of next year because of the cost improvements that were achieved during that time in 2013 and then any uptick will accrete in a slightly larger way because of the -- you're dropping the profit contribution margin without having to add incremental fixed costs in a big way.","Robert Walker - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Great. And then on raw materials, overall for the basket, how much were -- I guess if you could split it out inorganic and organic, were they up or down year-over-year in Q3? And what's your expectations for Q4?","Vincent J. Morales","Yes. Rob, if you look at our raw material basket, again, it's fairly benign as it's been all year. If you look on the 2 sides, as you mentioned, propylene costs on a year-over-year basis are up more than 25%. TiO2 costs, on the other side of the equation, though, have come down from last year's level. So net, again, if you look at our total raw material basket, it's been fairly benign all year with some ups and downs.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar from Citi.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Chuck, I hope you feel better. Frank and Vince, a couple of questions. On automotive OEM, your volume growth at 10% continues to outpace the global OEM industry. So can you tell us which geographies or which areas are you gaining share in?","Frank S. Sklarsky","Well, when we talk about the volume uptick, we gain volume by serving our customers. We have very good relationships with our customers and we bring value-added products and services to them. In some cases, we will pick up business at different facilities with different customers based on our product offering. And so, if we add a facility, you could argue that, that is market share. But we look at it on a manufacturer-by-manufacturer basis, on a plant-by-plant basis, and that's how we pick up business. Now the other dynamic that's taking place that we benefit from is we do not participate with the Japanese OEMs in Japan. As those manufacturers continue to localize their production in the markets that they may have traditionally exported to, in Europe and North America, Latin America, wherever, we have tended to do well in those facilities. And that's another area where we have been able to solidify our market position. So I guess that's the way I would answer it really, that it's the increase over the market. While we may not be able to sustain double-digit increases vis-a-vis market growth forever, where we have been able to pick up business based on our product offerings, our multigenerational product plan and some of the Japanese OEM facilities, that's how we've been able to do that.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just a quick question on sort of M&A divestitures. In Glass, you've seen your segment at its highest in 3 years. So with that kind of recovery, is this now a candidate for divestiture? And then on M&A front, you had mentioned earlier that you guys were interested more in Asia. And can you just talk about what kind of landscape do you see there, and have the bid and ask spreads on these deals coming in?","Vincent J. Morales","Yes, P.J., on Glass, well, the sales have moved up a little bit to our highest level in a couple of years. From an earnings perspective, it's still below the corporate average, and we're just now starting to see -- I think we were a little more bullish on commercial construction coming into the year. That didn't pan out for us in the first half. We did start to see a little bit of a creep-up in volume and commercial construction in 3Q. So some of the end markets that Glass is supplying, we're just starting to see in the early stages of recovery. So we'd like to see that go further, profitability a couple of years ago was in the double-digit range in EBIT and return on sales. So we still think those businesses have some improvement left. I'll let Frank answer the M&A question.","Frank S. Sklarsky","Yes. I guess, we wouldn't want anybody to believe that we're not looking at opportunities in all the major regions because there are opportunities for acquisition, for bolt-ons either in the technology nature or help us solidify a market position or whatever in each of the regions. Certainly, emerging markets are attractive because they can add to our growth profile but so are some opportunities in other regions where we can achieve either revenue or cost synergies or, like I said, solidify market position. In terms of the multiples, multiples are -- we believe are healthy for a couple of reasons. So one is the fact that money is still cheap and valuations adjust based on the fact that cost of capital, at least in the short term, is still very affordable. And then the other piece is that, as some of these markets come out of -- still come out of recession, particularly late cycle types of companies, that's reflected in the present value of their, as you know, future earnings and the multiples will reflect just that. But that doesn't necessarily scare us away from good, solid, high-quality acquisition targets. And like I said before, the pipeline includes a variety of things in all the markets. And all we'll say is that we will continue to focus on our core Coatings businesses as well as close adjacencies to build the portfolio.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson from Susquehanna.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","A question on capital allocation. I'm just wondering, you bumped your share repurchase to the top end of your $500 million to $750 million range. Should we regard this range as a good number for annual purchases from cash flow? And then when you do one-off transactions, whether it was chlor-alkali earlier this year or the TRANSITIONS sale next year, that, that would lead to significant onetime reductions in shares outstanding?","Frank S. Sklarsky","I guess, we wouldn't, at this point, want to nail down a specific number that we would necessarily do on an annual basis. But we would say this, and we have stated this before, and we want to make sure that everybody understands that we're living up to what we've said in terms of our commitments on our capital allocation model. Our priority is continue to invest in -- on organic growth, keep driving the top line, whether that's in technology or incremental CapEx to build for capacity actions, which are highly accretive, number one. Number two, continue to -- sustainable dividend increases along the lines that we've seen in the recent past and even before that. Number three, acquisition targets we just spoke about. And then, where there is excess cash, continue to have share repurchases be an integral part, an important integral part, of our capital allocation philosophy. And there's no reason to believe that, that won't continue. In terms of specific amounts and specific timings, some of that will depend on the exact timing of what we -- identification and completion of certain acquisition targets. But I think it's reasonable to expect that the share repurchases will continue to be an important part of that capital allocation model. And obviously, we disseminate that, updates to that and news about that into the marketplace as soon as our board makes the decisions along those lines.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","One follow-up on U.S. Architectural. You originally targeted, I think, a 10% operating margin for Akzo once you had the synergies behind you. You're already in the upper single-digits. So have you expanded your outlook for the potential margins from that acquisition, and for your overall U.S. Architectural business?","Vincent J. Morales","Don, this is Vince again. I just -- if you look at our targets, we were looking at about a 12% return on sales upon achievement of the full synergy range. We're not changing that outlook. We've got good traction to date. We have a lot of work to do. But I think that's still a good target for us, again, 12%, 12.5% for that acquired business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nils Wallin from CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","First off, Frank, you mentioned something about M&A and coatings adjacencies. So I was curious if you would clarify that a little bit, what you mean by adjacencies.","Frank S. Sklarsky","Yes, I mean, when we talk about adjacencies, we're not going to go too far afield. But we could explore things in coatings and sealants and adhesives, things that are closely aligned with core competencies in material science where you have a common customer base, we can take advantage of our supply chain, things we know well, things where we can get revenue and cost synergies. So that's what we're really referring to there.","Vincent J. Morales","And Nils, we're in those businesses.","Frank S. Sklarsky","Right.","Vincent J. Morales","They're embedded in our current business structure. Like in automotive and aerospace, we already sell sealants into those markets.","Frank S. Sklarsky","Right.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Got it. Okay. Since Akzo had the same number of sales year-over-year, if I heard you correctly, and yet a lower store base, does that mean that you just got rid of stores that had really poor sales or was the growth rate in the -- on the lower base just much higher than your base business?","Vincent J. Morales","Well, what I'll remind you, Nils, is the market is growing. And so, while we'd like to think we would keep every dollar from every -- of sales from each store we close, that's not realistic. But we've had very high retention where we've had overlap in stores, and we've got the benefit of market growth. So again, that's how I would characterize how we've been able to maintain that top line.","Frank S. Sklarsky","And in some of the stores, we're in very close proximity to each other geographically. And so, you try to rationalize that in a sensible way. And also there were some that were performing less so and, obviously, that was part of the mix, too.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Great. And just one last, if I may. On the Industrial Coatings businesses, great, great volume growth year-over-year. But pricing growth has been pretty moderate, which is surprising, given how well auto OEM is doing. Is there something I'm missing there? Is there a mix effect? Just curious as why price growth hasn't been as strong as volume growth.","Vincent J. Morales","We typically price, Nils, in reflection of raw materials. We do get, certainly, new products, we're able to price a little higher. But our focus on pricing is to cover raw material inflation and transportation inflation. And we -- as I said earlier in the call, raw material inflation's fairly benign. We do have transportation inflation this year, which is what we're trying to do with our pricing this year.","Operator","And your next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Frank, in Industrial, you're doing quite well on OEM autos, you're doing okay in packaging. Can you add a little more color on the industrial portion of that business, I guess, as the mix trends in Europe versus the rest of the world?","Frank S. Sklarsky","Yes. I think that when you look overall, first, globally, in Industrial business, the areas that are doing well are heavy-duty equipment, some of the automotive parts and accessories kinds of things where we coat certain components there. The part that is probably a little bit softer out there is the consumer electronics, and we've said that before, no secret there. But other than that, we continue to see some pretty good volumes and some pretty good recovery. And as the commercial construction -- when the commercial construction recovers, we expect to see continued strength in that heavy-duty equipment sector.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's a good segue into China. I know you made some comments about China in Q4. What's your expectations for China demand heading out of Q4 into 2014?","Frank S. Sklarsky","I mean, I think we're pretty pleased with the mix of business we have in China. As Vince said before, automotive OEM, refinish, some of the Industrial categories are still doing well. The experts are saying around 7% growth in China next year, which might be a little bit less than it has been traditionally. But 2 things there: one, the law of large numbers is starting to take over; and number two, some of the downdraft is because of residential and commercial construction where we probably have less of an exposure. So we're still pretty optimistic about China for the businesses where we compete. Clearly, we've said before, Asia, on marine new-build, not expected to come back anytime in the near future. But the other businesses, again, we're still optimistic about those for the rest of the year and for 2014.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just last, some of the TiO2 guys have put forth some price increases with a Jan 1 implementation. What's your view on potential for TiO2 price increases in 2014?","Vincent J. Morales","Dave, we still -- we're not having any problems getting any supply. We're exiting, really, the peak of the paint season now, and our view is that market has sufficient supply. We may come to a situation where we go back to, what I would call, a more seasonal pattern of inflation in some of our raw materials where in parts of the season, they are in more demand; in other parts, they are not. But our view is that market remains sufficiently supplied.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ivan Marcuse from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Real quick. In Europe, you mentioned in your commentary that it's projected that European automotive is expected to grow, which is consistent with some other data, in the fourth quarter. So how meaningful of a business would that be for you in improvement? And then, if you also look at Europe, you're saying you're going to miss 2 days. How much of a drag in terms of volumes would those 2 days be on that region?","Vincent J. Morales","Ivan, the 2 days less -- 2 less shipping days in the fourth quarter are really an only architectural-driven event. The auto companies and most industrial companies run 24\/7. So they're not affected by that. So it's more retail-oriented. So I would say that that's a small -- that's a typically light season anyway, but it's 1% or 2% in terms of just pure math. With respect to automotive OEM, again, if you look at our mix of business geographically, our auto business is about 1\/3 U.S., about 1\/3 Europe and about 1\/3 Asia. So we've got a good mix. And certainly, one of those portions of those businesses have been a downdraft, which is Europe. And from an industry perspective, we perform well. We're glad to see that start to turn the corner. And we would hope that, as Frank mentioned earlier, that it continues, and that'll give us a lift because of the cost we've taken out of the region.","Frank S. Sklarsky","Right, and the operating leverage because the capacity is in fairly good shape at the European business. So any incremental volume will accrete at something closer to the profit contribution margin versus the just the bottom line PTPI margin.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. And then -- and would that contribution margin be in the same sort of degree that you -- on an increase of volume that you described, previously, in that 30% to 40% range?","Frank S. Sklarsky","I think it's a good rule of thumb to use overall.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in North America, you may have mentioned this, was there a significant difference between sales in your stores versus your mass retail?","Frank S. Sklarsky","Yes. I mean, I think the mass retail is doing well. The company-owned stores are doing well, and I think we stated that the one spot that is doing okay, but not as well as the other 2, would be the PPG legacy and the Akzo dealer store channel. But other than that, things are going fine, continue to benefit from the residential recovery.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So would the stores and the mass retail be up about the same in terms of volume?","Vincent J. Morales","Stores were up a little higher, Ivan, and the mass retailers were up but not as much as stores.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of John McNulty from Credit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a quick question. On the Akzo stores, in the second quarter, I believe the sales rate was about 475, and it dropped to 400 in the third quarter. I know there's a little bit of seasonality, but not quite that much. Is it all just the store closures or is there something else that may be going on, at least temporarily, in that business?","Vincent J. Morales","No, John. If you look -- I'll remind you in the first quarter, on our first quarter call, we put out projected seasonality for that business. And we're tracking almost to $0.01 with what our projections were and what they did last year. So that seasonality you saw, it's about a 15% haircut, it's consistent with history for that business, and it's also consistent with our U.S. legacy business, about a 15% downdraft from Q2 to Q3. And I'll remind you, Q3 to Q4, again, for seasonal reasons drops about 25%.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then one last question on the stores. Can you give us your outlook potentially for pricing in 2014, if there's room to push higher? Because I think you probably would have to launch it relatively soon if you're going to do it in time for the contract season next year.","Frank S. Sklarsky","I mean that -- a lot of that would depend on the change in raw materials. But as Vince said, that we expect that to be relatively modest, particularly in those materials that impact that segment. So as long as the raw material environment remains relatively benign, we would expect a relatively stable pricing environment.","Vincent J. Morales","Yes, with the -- again, the other thing we're watching, John, is freight. So if that moves up, that's a big -- it's a distribution business.","Frank S. Sklarsky","Right.","Vincent J. Morales","That does have a hefty freight component to it. So if freight costs move up, which they have been, that would be another -- it would be a catalyst for some further pricing.","Frank S. Sklarsky","And OEM was, obviously, one of the drivers of that also on a delayed basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","On a per pound basis, did you pay less for TiO2 in the third quarter than you did in the second?","Vincent J. Morales","Yes, Jeff, we typically don't talk about our particular raw materials in that level of granularity. What I can say on a more broad sense is we're not seeing any -- outside of some propylene transitory inflation, everything else is fairly benign.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. You indicated that you lifted your share repurchase target to the upper end of $500 million to $750 million range. But given that you have $2 billion in cash on the balance sheet and you have more coming in, in the fourth quarter, it seems that you've made a decision to retain a lot of cash that is -- I think in the old days, you had a target of maybe having $1 billion cash balance. So what's changed in your thinking? Is it that you bought back so many shares last year, you don't want to buy back too many over a shorter period of time? Or why does it seem that you want to hold more cash now?","Frank S. Sklarsky","Yes, and I would say that, that is not necessarily the case at all. Going -- as we said, we've done about $325 million so far this year. And if we go to that upper end of $750 million, by the end of the fourth quarter, that is buying back over $400 million worth of stock in one quarter, which is a pretty healthy clip. And so, I guess, what we would reiterate is that, as we go forward, as we continue to assess the pipeline of acquisition targets, we also will be looking at making sure that the share repurchases continue to be an integral part of that capital allocation model. And of course, all decisions around that, obviously, are reviewed with our Board of Directors, and they make the final call. But I think we would all, here, internally, our Board of Management agree that, that model that we've used will continue. And no, we do not necessarily believe we need to hold a substantial amount of excess cash on the balance sheet. Let's keep in mind, too, that the TRANSITIONS deal is not yet complete. We expect that by mid next year. But you're correct in saying that we have a very healthy cash balance. We will continue to generate cash, and we will make sure we continue to deploy it in a manner that's accretive and value-creating for the shareholders.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, you increased your environmental reserves $56 million. Have we come to the end of that or are we going to see another, I don't know, $100 million or $150 million increase in reserves over the next couple of years?","Frank S. Sklarsky","Some of these projects and sites go for a long period of time. And parts of those projects are more predictable than others. We took this reserve now because we had done more work on one of the key sites, in the Jersey Chrome site has been disclosed and, obviously, have more granularity in terms of information and rigor of analysis as we go through time. So we felt this was the appropriate time to take that reserve, it made all the sense in the world. As we go through time, we'll continue to assess the remaining exposures we have at that site and other ones. And the other thing I would say is that when you look at the amount of the reserves, not just for this site but for all the other sites, it is a number of years over which we typically discharge these liabilities. So the amount of cash expenditure in any given year is not really material to our results or our ability to deploy cash. So it should not be a significant concern.","Vincent J. Morales","And Jeff, if you look, we have in our filings some mentioning around what environmental projects we're working on. I think we've been very descriptive in all of our filings about the current and future situations. The cash comment, I just want to elaborate on a little bit from Frank. We spent about $60 million a year in 2010 and '11 on environmental cash deployment. We moved that up about $30 million or $40 million to $100 million, which is the rate we're going to run at for the next couple of years. So Frank's comments that we've not -- we're not spending a lot of cash, this will be discharged over a long period of time, I think are important to understand from a shareholder perspective.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just want to follow up on store count, Vince. I think you'd mentioned you've completed the rationalization of the Akzo store network. A couple of questions. How many stores did you close there? Also, what was the change in count on the legacy PPG side? And then if you look ahead for, let's say, 2014, how many stores would you plan to add? And what does that future trajectory look like?","Vincent J. Morales","Yes. Kevin, if you look, we started with roughly 1,000 stores. We -- as Frank mentioned, some of those were in very close proximity to each other, in some cases, right across from each other. And we've rationalized, let's say, 5% to 7% of our store network. And so, that's 80 to 90 stores net and, on a go-forward basis, we'll be targeted in store additions. I don't want to give a rule of thumb number, but it's not going -- it's going to be, in a given year, anywhere from 20 to maybe 30 or 40. It depends on the year and what locations we're looking at geographically. So again, I think we'll be measured -- we've got, as you know, 3 different distribution outlets. We got the stores business. We also have the national accounts or DIY business to have another customer touch point in the dealer network. So we want to grow in all those networks.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just to shift gears, a clarification, if I may, on Optical. I think you've said in the past, you would expect the divestiture to close in the first half of 2014. I guess we've got maybe 2.5 months under the belt now. Any updated thoughts on when you would expect that deal to close? And then also in Optical, I think you're rolling out Gen VII in the U.S. So can you comment as to the 4Q versus 3Q pattern? Is there a loading of the channel to come there?","Frank S. Sklarsky","Yes. And I'll first -- the first question around the timing -- our expectations haven't changed around the timing of the deal, it's still going through the typical normal regulatory approval process in the various regions, and still expect an outlook of first half, by mid-year next year, the closure of that deal. In terms of the Q3, Q4 dynamics, I'm -- recall last year in 2012, Q3, there was some destocking around the circuit, which made the Q3 comparison -- aided the Q3 comparison in terms of a favorable look versus the prior year. In Q4, probably a more typical comparable performance Q4 over Q4. We do have the loading that has been taking place already in anticipation of the January launch in the U.S. of TRANSITIONS VII, that continues. But Q4, last year, was very solid. So probably a more comparable comparison vis-\u00e0-vis the very favorable performance this Q3 because of the destocking last year Q3.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn from Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Chuck, I hope you'll feel better with your voice. A couple of things that I want to touch base on that haven't been discussed already. Number one, when you talk about the Industrial segment, you've done a good job outlining what's going on in automotive and provided some ideas on general Industrial. Can you talk about packaging coatings of the business in the third quarter and your outlook for the fourth? Crown came out with results that were not that spectacular in terms of volume growth on the can business, particularly in the European food pack and U.S. beverage. So can you talk about what you're seeing in the end markets, how your BPA share gains are progressing, and just give us any commentary you can on the Packaging business?","Vincent J. Morales","Yes, Dmitry. We're seeing -- let me give you a little bit of background. As you know, we've got a lot of good activity going on in Asia in terms of just overall market growth. We've got a good position there. And our emerging region growth has really helped us grow on a global basis. We're seeing, like our other European businesses, our business in -- our packaging business in Europe is down modestly. Again, similar to some other businesses in Europe. It hasn't been moving around much. The U.S. business or North American business is solid. It's not a -- it's a GDP-type growth business. With respect to BPA, we're seeing a lot of activity in Europe in terms of going through the testing process. There is some dates out there as you -- as I know you and I have talked about, with respect to what France's legislation is, so there's a lot of -- the can fillers, as well as the can makers are doing a lot of activity. And we're pleased with the progress we've made, but it's still a very small portion of the total packaging business at this point. We do expect it to grow certainly next year and in years coming. But right now, it's still fairly modest in terms of its total size.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Got it. And if I could ask just on sort of the trends that you saw towards the end of September and, perhaps, early in October. Some of the industrial companies pointed out that there was a little bit of a softness, particularly in the U.S., at the very end of September. Whether or not it had to do with what's going on with the government or not is a different story. But have you seen in any of your businesses, any kind of sort of late quarter pullback from customers in terms of their order patterns or maybe you're seeing it in the first couple of weeks of October or has this just not been an issue for you at all?","Vincent J. Morales","Just to the contrary, Dmitry, if you look at our progression as we went through the quarter, September was our best year-over-year month of all 3 months. So it's just the opposite of what you're describing.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, all right. So I was just curious because these were comments that were made by some industrial companies but not by others. So I was curious where you came out on that.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Charles Dan from Morgan Stanley.","Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a couple of clarifying questions. One, can you quantify how much of a drag on the Architectural business was the lost contract at Lowe's or what that sort of mid-single-digit growth rate would have been without that? I guess we can start there.","Vincent J. Morales","Yes. Charlie, as we said in the past -- I think I'll just give everybody a backgrounder. About 2 years ago, we picked up a position at Lowe's with our Olympic ONE brand. That for us was about $60 million a year. And in addition, this past year, we lost 2 price points at Lowe's. They were the $12 and $18 lower price points. That was a commensurate $60 million a year event. So about $15 million a quarter. And again, we did have positive comps in our DIY channel, so that market growth and the performance of our DIY channel overcame that. And so, we would have been up, obviously, mid to high single digits without that absence of business.","Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And just on the Marine business, can you give some sense for when -- we've seen sort of an extreme decline there, when those comps really get easier and could we potentially be lapping those really severe declines by the first quarter of next year?","Frank S. Sklarsky","Yes. I think to your point, we're within a quarter or 2 where the comps will start to look less unfavorable, start to sort of even out on a year-over-year basis. Keep in mind that there was quite a bubble a few years ago. We don't expect -- so we're sort of bouncing along at lower levels here, absolutely good, but I wouldn't expect any significant uptick in the new-build marine business, certainly, during 2014, perhaps sometime mid-late 2015. Keep in mind, these are long cycle projects, and we will typically participate in terms of ringing in the cash register in the latter part of the project when the coatings go on, on the ships. So the first stage is the RFPs go out, we bid. That can be up to a 12-, 18-month process, then the construction commences. And we put our part of the project in place, and then we generate the revenue and the cash, probably still a couple of years off before you see that happen in a meaningful way. But we are starting to see some repair in terms of deferred maintenance, which is the first glimmer of hope that you start to -- you see some of the shippers release the purse strings a little bit on some of the deferred maintenance and on a follow-on to that, obviously, they'll be doing RFPs on the new-builds. So compares will be a little bit easier, but a little bit of time before we see a significant uptick.","Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","If I could, just one quick question. You guys gave a lot of numbers on sort of the run rate improvements you're seeing in the Akzo synergies. Just so that everybody's clear, is it possible for you to give a range of sort of what your view is on the operating income line there for that business next year?","Vincent J. Morales","Charlie, where we are now is again upper mid-single-digits. We would expect that to go up next year with, again, the increase in synergies capture. So I'm not -- we're not going to put an exact number on it but, again, it'll be part of the way between where we are today and the 12.5% target.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts from UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Get well, Chuck.","Charles E. Bunch","Thank you.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","For the European recovery that you're seeing, can you talk about how much of that might be export automotive and aerospace? And what I'm getting at is things that might not be local European demand recovering but global recovery just being sourced out of Europe?","Vincent J. Morales","Yet, John, if you look, the -- I wouldn't call it a recovery, we're seeing less negativity and some improvement in a few markets, but it is broad. I mean, every one of our businesses in the quarter did better than the quarter or 2 quarters prior and the quarter prior. So it's more broad than just exports. I do agree with you, there's some additional exports, but this is more of a broad issue. Frank, you want to...","Frank S. Sklarsky","Yes. It's like if you look at the local GDPs in Western Europe, for instance, going from modestly negative to forecast to being modestly positive next year. And also, we're seeing some leading indicators showing that there is less of a decline in the leading indicators. So again, it's kind of mirroring the lower decline rates in the actual revenues. We do expect more of the growth to come from domestic consumption than export as -- now we'll certainly see, to the extent they're exporting to Asia and we see growth in Asia, that will continue. But the increase in the growth rate in Europe, we do expect a significant portion of that, going forward, to have to come from the domestic consumption. If that's a 2 percentage points from negative 1% to positive 1% GDP, that's where that's going to come from.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then secondly, for TRANSITIONS, will we see that as, again, discontinued beginning first quarter 2014 and it'll still be consolidated in the fourth quarter 2013 results?","Frank S. Sklarsky","Yes. We would expect to see it consolidated in the fourth quarter. It would move to continuing operations once regulatory approvals are received. That would be the triggering event to move it over to disc ops.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli from Gabelli & Company.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.","If I -- if we look at TiO2, does it make a difference to you, for your use of the TiO2, whether it is a sulfate-based or chloride-based process?","Vincent J. Morales","Rosemarie, we use both. It depends on a variety of factors, including location and geography. It depends on end markets. It depends on whether it's slurry or not. So we use a variety of different -- we use both grades in a variety of different ways. And what I would tell you with respect to TiO2 is we are, and we have been continuing to progress along our efficiency programs. And we announced a target a couple of years ago, and we continue to work on that. And we also continue to use more sulfate around the world than we've had in the past. So those are 2 trends that are continuing. But again, we do use both grades.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.","Okay. So am I correct in thinking that sulfate, there is plenty of capacity and, therefore, you are less likely to get price increases than the -- from the chloride process?","Vincent J. Morales","I would -- there's probably a little more to the algorithm than that. But what I would tell you is that there is certainly excess capacity, in our view, in sulfate, especially in Asia. And again, where we can use sulfate around the world, we're adding to our capabilities there. I would say, in terms of total global dynamics on TiO2 pricing, it's not a simple as what you described.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.","Okay, that would have been too easy. If I could ask one quick question regarding consumer electronics. You said that demand was weak. This is what everyone else says. Have you seen any sign of a change in trends for consumer electronics?","Frank S. Sklarsky","Not significantly in the recent couple of quarters, no. We really haven't -- not a huge portion of our business, but we haven't seen any major changes in trends.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude the question-and-answer portion of today's conference. I would now like to turn the call back over to Vince Morales for closing remarks.","Vincent J. Morales","Thank you, Philip. And again, I just want to thank everybody for their time today. And if there's any further questions regarding the quarter, please contact me and Investor Relations. Thank you.","Frank S. Sklarsky","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.

Conference Call. My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator for today. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Vince Morales, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Vincent J. Morales","Thank you, Regina. This is Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations for PPG Industries. Welcome to PPG's Fourth Quarter 2011 Financial Teleconference. Joining me on the call today from PPG is Chuck Bunch, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Dave Navikas, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer.","Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, January 19, 2012. As a reminder to everyone, based on our modified quarterly earnings call process, about 1 hour ago, we posted detailed commentary and the accompanying presentation slides on our Investor Center at ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call. We don't read those prepared remarks during the call. However, during the call, Chuck will make some opening comments reviewing the company's results and then we will move directly to Q&A.","Both the prepared commentary and discussion during the call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements.","This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on the website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. For additional information, please refer to our filings with the SEC.","Now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch.","Charles E. Bunch","Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. Today, we announced fourth quarter 2011 sales of $3.5 billion, up 4% versus the fourth quarter of 2010. Our fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.39 established a new fourth quarter record for the company and was achieved despite moderating global growth rates during the quarter. We delivered record earnings per share of $6.87 in 2011, with new records established each quarter despite persistent raw material inflation, uneven economic conditions globally and continued anemic construction activity in developed regions. Our continued record financial performance reflects strong execution by our global businesses, aggressive cost management and our amplified deployment of cash. Also, our end-use market and geographic diversity remained an important benefit during the year.","During the fourth quarter, overall sales volumes were flat as some customers curtailed inventory and remained cautious with their ordering patterns. This was most evident in our Commodity Chemicals segment where volumes declined 3%, and also in Europe, where we experienced a 1% volume drop. Emerging region volume growth continued, but was modest and tempered by lower Marine and Architectural Coatings volumes, along with the negative impacts resulting from the Thailand flooding which reduced our Optical Products activity levels.","We continued to benefit from improving global demand in Aerospace, Automotive OEM and several general industrial markets, and we supplemented this growth with PPG market share gains. Also aiding our sales was higher pricing with improvements in each business segment, marking the seventh consecutive quarter where the company has delivered higher pricing. The higher pricing offset raw material cost inflation as inflation rates stabilized during the quarter. We are implementing further pricing in 2012 to offset inflation we absorbed in 2011.","Lastly, cash generation remained strong and was about $1.4 billion for the full year, up nearly 10%. Throughout the year, we deployed our cash with a focus on earnings accretion and continuing our heritage of returning cash to shareholders. We purchased 2.7 million shares of stock in the fourth quarter and 10.2 million shares during the year. We also raised our dividend, marking 40 consecutive years of annual dividend increases. In total, dividend and share repurchases equaled $1.2 billion or 85% of the cash we generated from operations. We ended the year with about $1.5 billion in cash and short-term investments.","Looking ahead, we anticipate first quarter 2012 growth to remain uneven by region and vary by industry, similar to the fourth quarter of 2011. We expect Europe to remain the most challenging region. We anticipate moderate strengthening in the U.S. economic recovery, supported by an enhanced global cost position in the industrial sector due to lower natural gas prices. Aggregate emerging region growth rates are expected to remain high compared to developed regions, but more moderate and erratic that they have been in the past. As a result, we will be very proactive in managing our businesses as we deal with these uncertain market conditions. Also, we intend to continue to prudently deploy our strong cash position towards earnings accretion and rewarding shareholders, and are targeting to end 2012 with a cash balance below $1 billion.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Now operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question today comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This is Rob Walker on for Laurence. I guess, in terms of -- just kind of get your thoughts, between automotive and construction end markets, I guess, which do you expect to see a larger increase in volumes, just kind in order trends in Q1 and kind of what you've seen so far?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, we see good momentum in the Automotive OEM markets around the world, with the exception of Europe. So we're looking forward to a -- good growth rates continuing in North America and Asia in particular. Construction activity, however, I think there's some early signs in North America, but still, I would say modest growth as we start up here in 2012. And Europe, we finished on what I would say would be a very modest growth rate. We're all concerned with the macroeconomic environment in Europe. Right now, we haven't seen any significant downturns, but we do not expect Europe to be strong in the construction markets nor do we think they're going to be particularly strong in Automotive OEM. That Automotive OEM business will be stronger in regions outside of Europe.","Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then if you could update us on kind of consolidation pipeline, kind of and do you expect to use a larger portion of cash in 2012 for M&A than you did in 2011?","Charles E. Bunch","You said consolidation pipeline. You meant acquisition pipeline?","Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Correct.","Charles E. Bunch","We closed this month on 2 acquisitions that we have previously announced, that was Dyrup in Europe, Architectural and Colpisa which is a Colombian, South America, Automotive OEM and refinish coatings company. So we are actively pursuing a number of small- to medium-sized bolt-on acquisitions. The pipeline, we think, is solid. But we have to make further progress to bring them along to closure here in 2012.","Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, thanks. And then just kind of, overall, in terms of the chlor-alkali kind of outlook in Q1. And then just if you can touch on sort of whether you see further risk there, that pricing and costs, it won't keep up with the price declines in chlorine? And whether you think that the restocking will come or in Q2 versus Q1 in terms of just more of a general industrial -- in terms of your general industrial outlook going forward?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, why don't we answer your -- we'll answer the chlor-alkali question and then we'll open it up to some of the other questioners. But in chlor-alkali, we expect a seasonal upturn here in the first quarter from what were some lower operating rates in the fourth quarter. We do expect price increases to move the average cost of pricing up in the first quarter. Although as you commented, chlorine prices remain weak, but overall, we think it'll be slight positive for the first quarter. So I think we're looking forward to some return to more typical seasonal patterns here in the first quarter. And obviously, we're watching the natural gas markets, which are, right now, encouraging for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Chuck, you talked about pushing through price increases because of the inflation that you faced in 2011. Can you talk about, starting from January 1, how you see that price versus raw material balance playing out? If you say raws are kind of in balance right now, it would suggest that you should see some margin improvement there. Can you talk a little bit about that?","Charles E. Bunch","Right. We've been chasing, let's say, the raw material inflation really for about the last 18 months or so. And that continued through 2011, but started to moderate in the second half of the year and the fourth quarter, Frank, with the exception, as we've talked about in the past, of the TiO2 pricing. So overall, we think here as we went into the latter half of 2011, we have a moderating inflation outlook and we're still catching up in terms of raw -- or pricing for our product. So we think that we still have some catch-up to do. We didn't fully offset inflation from raw materials in our Coatings businesses and we are trying to now complete that catch-up process because we really haven't completely offset those inflationary impacts. And so I think there is an opportunity for us if we continue to see this moderating trend in raw materials, to show some margin improvement in Coatings as we go through the year. Some of that will also depend on volumes, but if we continue to see overall economic growth, we think that will aid the margin improvement opportunities.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right, great. And speaking of TiO2, it was just over a month ago, I guess, that you talked about your ability to take 46% of TiO2 out in 2012. Now that we're 1 month further along, do your R&D people still feel confident in that regard?","Charles E. Bunch","Yes, they still feel -- we have a -- this is not a challenge that we threw out lightly to our organization. We have all of the goals and objectives, metrics by function, by business unit and we still feel that's an appropriate target level for us in our formulations, and it's still early in the year, but we are tracking it. And we feel that we will hit those targets.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America.","Aleksey V. Yefremov - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Aleks Yefremov for Kevin. Chuck, what is your outlook, overall, for your raw material costs in the Coatings business given higher TiO2 and lower petrochemical-based raw materials?","Charles E. Bunch","We think that the overall outlook is flat. We think that what we've seen, in terms of the declines in the organic side of the raw material basket will offset what appears to be some continued increases on the TiO2 side, especially here in -- among the Western chloride producers.","Aleksey V. Yefremov - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then moving to Architectural Coatings. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned that volumes in Asia were weaker. Do you think this is a function of sort of where you are in China geographically? Some sort of a share shift mix, share shift, or this is a sign of sort of cyclical problems in the Chinese construction market that might persist?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, we think, overall, that the Chinese construction growth will be moderating, and we've seen that here in the latter half of 2011. We think that will continue at least here in the near term in 2012. We have a relatively small business in Architectural in China. We are focused more in the Eastern half of the country where growth rates are probably even more modest. More of the growth has been in the second- and third-tier cities, and in the West. But I do think that there is a moderation of growth rates in the construction industry in China and certainly we felt that effect here in the latter half of 2011, in our business.","Aleksey V. Yefremov - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And a final question, if I may, on transitions and the rollout of Vantage (sic) [HomeVantage]. With increased sales cost, do you think you can still increase margins year-over-year in 2012 or hold them flat or down?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, for us, the Vantage product launch, which for those of you who aren't familiar, this is our clear-to-polarized, new-to-the-world technology. This will be the first time you've ever seen a product launch that will darken and darken to a polarized state in -- and so we're very excited about it. But it is, at this point, a rather limited launch. Limited geographically, limited by channel. We are quite excited about it but I would say, overall, even though the margins here will be very attractive for us, we don't think that we'll have, overall, an effect that would lift up our margins more than what you've seen just because of the -- at this point, it represents a relatively smaller volume for our Transitions business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Chuck, 2 questions. One is on the anticipated level of share repurchase in 2012. Do you think it'll be as large as last year or do you have a specific amount targeted at this time?","Charles E. Bunch","We talked, at our Investor Day in December, we had close to $1 billion in share repurchases in 2011. Our target for this year, I would put in -- more in the range of $250 million to $500 million. That would be what I would project. Obviously, it depends on successfully finding additional uses of cash for bolt-on acquisitions. But I would expect that we're going to be aggressive with the share repurchases, but not quite at the targeted -- at this point, targeting that level from 2011. So little -- half of that rate would be, I think, a good Benchmark.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And a follow-up on chlor-alkali. What was your all-in natural gas acquisition cost in calendar 2011, including the hedge you had, I think you had 12% of your needs hedged at about $7.25?","Charles E. Bunch","It all in was around \u2013 it was a little under $5. And so this represents, I think, an opportunity as we've -- here in the first quarter of 2012, will be the last of those earlier kind of pre-shale gas hedges. So we were under a little under all-in costs of $5 and obviously we're going to start out in 2012, here in the first quarter, below $4. We did put some additional hedges on, but only over the last few months, at relatively modest level. So it does represent a nice opportunity for us especially with further reductions we've seen over the last week to 10 days in the market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Chuck, you made some comments in the notes here, about the refinished demand suffering from some of the inventory management. And I guess I was a little bit surprised, I didn't think that particular customer segment was as sensitive to those inventory and working capital adjustments, nor was the pricing volatile enough where they might be trying to gain some advantage in buying later. So am I wrong and that does tend to be a much more volatile purchasing decision there? Or what happened in the refinished market?","Charles E. Bunch","I think we -- typically, it's not as volatile. We saw some inventory management. If you go back over the last few years, there were inventory reductions, certainly, as we went into the recession in 2009, more so than we had typically seen. And I would say, here in the fourth quarter, there was probably some -- if you look at some of the markets in Europe, as an example or even in some markets in Asia where there's some economic uncertainty, I think the distributors and the overall customer base were somewhat cautious, I would say, in terms of ordering patterns. So I wouldn't think it's anything -- a noticeable trend but it is something we felt we needed to comment on.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And is there something structurally different in the European markets that, in a weaker environment, DIY would go down instead of going up as it's done in the U.S. or was it just the jarring economic anxiety there that stifled demand?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, I think in Europe, you have also some customer issues. And I think the big retailers are also being quite conservative about inventory levels and their outlook, especially the ones in the U.K. I think we saw, earlier this week, I think it was Asda in the U.K. or Tesco and some of the home improvement chains. I think they have been somewhat concerned about the economic environment in the U.K. and been, I think, quite cautious, of inventory levels. But I wouldn't say it's a pronounced trend difference between here and the U.S. at this point. It's still a little too early to tell, Bob.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Saul Ludwig with Northcoast.","Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research","How much did FX help you in 2011? And what type of headwind are you, at least, thinking about as you put your 2012 plan together?","Vincent J. Morales","Saul, it's Vince. On the sales line, it was -- we provide that each quarter, as you know, in our distributed slides. But it was up around, let's say, $400 million year-over-year on the sales line. On the earnings line, we typically drop, say 7% to 10% of that to the bottom line.","Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research","Okay. So call it about $30 million. Now does that become a headwind this year?","Vincent J. Morales","We're not currency traders, we'll leave that up to you. But based on today's rate it's going to be a headwind. We -- primarily, the rate we're talking about is the euro.","Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research","Right, right, right. Okay. In the U.S., you commented that your Architectural volume was flat, which I guess it was pretty decent. Did the flat volume and price cost give you better earnings or lower earnings in that segment of the Architectural business?","Charles E. Bunch","North America and Architectural earnings were slightly lower in the fourth quarter on flat volumes, so.","Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research","Okay. And then, when you think about the dividend and your dividend payout policies, it's been pretty consistent for a lot of years now. With the sharp increase that you have in earnings, is the dividend going to move more commensurate with the earnings growth or will the modest rate of dividend growth likely to continue, and thus, be a lower percentage of your earnings?","Vincent J. Morales","Well, I think what you've seen us do, Saul, over the past couple of cycles, is we've actually reduced the amount of time between dividend increases. So I think the last 3 increases were either 6 or 9 months. So we've been trying to keep in lockstep with the earnings accretion.","Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research","I was asking about the payout ratio.","Charles E. Bunch","Well, I think, we're committed to increasing the dividend and to be in line with what we think is our -- we're already positioned at the high end of our peer group in terms of overall yield, dividend increases and payout ratio. Obviously, our cash flow has improved over the last few years as we've continued to move the portfolio. So our view is that we're going to continue to, I think, be consistent with the dividend, increase the dividend and increase it commensurate with overall earnings growth and cash flow. So if this is sustainable as we feel it is, you'll see us continue to increase that dividend and maybe at a rate that's higher than we've seen over, let's say, kind of coming out of this recessionary period where we did try to be a little more conservative.","Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research","And my final question, Chuck. As you look at the stable of plants that you have around the world, are you kind of finished with the restructuring and -- or is there going to be any further need for restructuring activity? And if so, how should we think about the cost of that as we put our model together for 2012?","Charles E. Bunch","As we look at 2012, it's obvious from our comments and how we saw the end of the year playing out, that we have more concern over the course of the European recovery and we have made, recently, a couple of acquisitions. So we're going to be reviewing here as we go into the first quarter what we think we're going to need going forward. Are there any synergies, especially in Europe, with the acquisition that we've made and our overall ray of facilities across our businesses. With some, I would say, some additional focus on Europe if, in fact, growth trends or some of the concerns that have been talked about, externally, play out and we're dealing with a low or 0 or potentially negative growth in Europe.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Jim Sheehan in for Dave. Chuck, just wondering about, do you have any update on the situation in Thailand as far as when you think some of your suppliers will be up and running again? I know that you didn't have a lot of clarity on that back at the Investor Day.","Charles E. Bunch","Right now, our operations are in good shape, both on the Optical Materials side, as well as Transitions. Some of our customers there were -- or are a little slower in getting up to speed. But we think, now that there\u2019s been good recovery across the optical industry in Thailand -- so if there are some lingering effects here in the first quarter, we think they're going to be minimal.","James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just as far as caustic availability is concerned, I know that that's an issue in the fourth quarter. How much longer will caustic availability be an issue and where do you think operating rates will play out in Q1?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, caustic availability is a concern, right now, because of where the industry finished or operated in the fourth quarter. So you had lower operating rates, very low caustic inventories. Now things are tight, and that's why I think I commented that the pricing for caustic is moving up in the first quarter. So I think we're going to see higher operating rates for the industry and that's a seasonal factor that may alleviate some of what's, obviously, now a tougher supply-demand situation. But if we can get the operating rates to come up and stay here in the first quarter, I think we'll be in, as an industry, in pretty good shape. You still have this Japanese DCM planned outage that is affecting caustic supply globally. So there\u2019s a few other short-term effects that are, I think, serving to keep the market tight.","James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just with Architectural Coatings volumes declining a couple percent in the quarter and volumes seeming to be weak across the board on a regional basis. Did you see any substantial inventory build of TiO2 in the quarter?","Charles E. Bunch","I can't really comment on what was happening with TiO2 inventories. I think I've commented, in the past, that probably many customers in Coatings or elsewhere were probably keeping inventory levels higher because of concerns over price initiatives from the producers. So at this point I'm not aware of, certainly, any shortages or any supply concerns in TiO2. But overall inventory levels, I really don't have any basis to give an opinion.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","A couple of questions. First of all, the decline in operating margins in the Performance Coatings business, I mean you've been running at 15%, 16% pretty much for the past 6, 7 quarters and now we're down to just about just a shade over 12%. Was that just a mix issue or were there some onetime costs that have flown through the quarter, that impacted the profitability of Performance Coatings?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, I think we indicated in our notes, we had -- there are 4 businesses in that segment, 2 of them performed well; Aerospace being one of them, extremely well. Refinish had a solid quarter. Protective & Marine Coatings had a weaker quarter, and again, that was focused on the Marine side of the business. And the Marine business in Asia, this is China and Korea, volumes were down on the OEM build side of the Marine sector. Price did not keep pace with inflation in that business. And in the Marine segment, we have a slightly different raw material basket. We also include some metals that go into Marine OEM Coatings, notably zinc and copper. So they had a higher run-up during the year. We were still working off higher-cost inventories in that business and we had same activity in Marine. So that was one of the business units that had lower earnings, the other one was in Architectural. Now within Performance Coatings, we have the Americas and Asia\/Pacific together in the Performance Coatings segment. So the European Architectural is in its own separate reporting segment. And there, in the Americas and Asia\/Pacific Architectural business, we had lower earnings. This was, I mentioned slightly lower in North America, but lower in the smaller business in South America, in Brazil and Chile. Again, primarily price not keeping up with inflation. And in Asia\/Pacific, similar challenges. I commented earlier on the China Architectural, so that had lower earnings; again, price not keeping up with inflation. And the volumes moderating in Australia, similar story, price and inflation. TiO2 is more important in these Architectural businesses. So there is, let's say, more inflationary pressure there. So if you have markets where the price initiatives aren't keeping up with what's been happening in TiO2, in particular, you're going to see some margin deterioration. So that's where I would focus your attention in terms of the Performance Coatings segment.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Got it. That's very helpful, Chuck. You also, in your prepared remarks, said something intriguing that I want to follow up on. When you're talking about growing in some select segments or seeing good growth in some select segments of Industrial Coatings business, can you give us a little bit more detail on what those segments are, what's driving them and what the outlook for 2012 is?","Charles E. Bunch","There are some good segments in the Industrial or General Industrial business outside of Automotive OEM, and 2 examples would be Heavy-Duty Equipment. So you've seen some of the results of some of the big players that are out in ag and construction equipment. These guys are, I think, are booming in some respects and so that Heavy-Duty Equipment segment is a very attractive one. Consumer Electronics as well. Even if Consumer Electronics overall, in the second half, as an end-use market, was maybe -- the growth rates weren't as attractive. We're seeing increased paint and Coatings usage for a number of these devices, more devices being painted, color and design, more important. So that would be another example of an end-use market in Industrial or General Industrial that's growing in addition to Automotive OEM.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, that's very helpful color. And then just a couple of bookkeeping questions. Your Commodity Chemicals business, I understand that you sell a lot of your chlorine as not chlorine but some sort of a -- this or another. Can you give us a rough idea of how much of your chlorine business, if you will, is sold as non-chlorine?","Vincent J. Morales","Dmitry, this is Vince. That's going to fluctuate based on what's happening in the virgin chlorine market itself.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","For 2011, what was it?","Vincent J. Morales","I'll have to get back to you on the number. I don't have it at hand. But I would consider it just \u2013 chlorine\u2019s just a pass-through to those derivatives.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Right, right, I understand that. But my point is that you're not really shipping chlorine in a lot of cases. So I just wanted to understand what the percentage of the non-chlorine business was. So that's fine. We can take it offline. And then the last question. What kind of a tax rate should we be using for 2012? It's been coming down pretty significantly every year. Should we be looking at neighborhood of 25% or something lower than that?","David B. Navikas","Yes, Dmitry, this is Dave Navikas. The 25% rate that we achieved in 2011 would be the rate we're looking to maintain in 2012.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I just have a couple of them real quick. On Optical businesses, will you see some pent-up volume, do you think, in the first quarter from the orders and shipments that got delayed from the fourth quarter? Or do you expect it to just get back to more of a normalized type of business level?","Charles E. Bunch","I would say it's still early to tell. I would say that we're only 2 weeks into this. So I would say, at this point, we're not seeing any negative signs. So I would say, at normal activity levels, maybe a little bit higher as there's a little catch-up from some lower inventory levels and customer kind of, little bit of de-stocking there in the fourth quarter also tied to the Thailand floods.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. And then I think I missed it earlier in the call, your estimate [ph] on your 2012 outlook for raw materials. Did you expect them flat from where they are right now to go across or flat for on a year-over-year basis?","Charles E. Bunch","Flat from where we are now, yes.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So where would you think about it on a year-over-year basis for 2012?","Vincent J. Morales","From a year-over-year basis, Ivan, that would be mid-single digits in terms of inflation rate. Collated all last year.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","All right. And then my last question is the Architectural Coatings in emerging markets, was it just in China where you saw a decline in demand or was it in other regions and what regions were there? And then in China are you just primarily in the Tier 1 cities? Could you just tell me on the scale of about how big is that business and where do you mainly sell into?","Charles E. Bunch","Okay. Well, you had about 3 questions in there. But I would say that China was -- and I would say that what I described was moderating growth rates. And that would be the case in China, as well as Brazil as an example. So growth rates were being lowered in our China business, Relatively small business, so less than $100 million. And again, more concentrated, as I explained to the earlier questioner. In the Eastern half of the country, more in the bigger cities and the growth rates have been higher in the tier 2, 3 cities and in the Western region.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You talked about share gains in Coatings. Can you discuss sort of which segments you gained share? Was it in Autos, Aerospace? And secondly, with your paint plus primer product at Lowe's, were you able to gain share there?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, as you saw from our Industrial Coatings segment, we thought we did well in that overall segment in Auto OEM, in General Industrial Refinish, even if the market is, let's call it, a more mature market, we felt we were well positioned globally. And that's a more difficult market to get a, especially a near-term share picture, but we felt we've been doing well in that market. And Olympic ONE for us was a very good launch. We certainly exceeded our initial targets in Olympic ONE and we consider it a successful launch for us. And I think our customer for Olympic ONE, Lowe's, was also pleased with the performance of our product, both at the quality and the level of support that we were giving it, plus the reception on the part of the customers.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, quickly on TiO2. How much of the TiO2 that you buy is sulfate versus chloride-based? And are you using more Chinese -- can you just qualitatively talk about what are you doing with the Chinese TiO2 to counter the Western producers?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, the overwhelming use of our products, especially in North America and Western Europe, is chloride. We have introduced sulfate grades in those markets now and that's part of the targets that we have for improving our utilization of TiO2 in the formulas. I would say that, where you see much more sulfate usage for us is in the Asia\/Pacific region, most of the Chinese-domestic producers are sulfate producers. And both through acquisitions and our own activities, we have learned how to work with those grades of TiO2 much more effectively, so we have a higher usage of sulfate TiO2 in Asia\/Pacific and in the developing or emerging region.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just would you say that sulfate is maybe 10% of your overall purchases?","Charles E. Bunch","Yes, that's probably -- maybe higher than that, P.J.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","One question about housing starts. They've had a fairly nice year, and probably up low-single digits, and you've seen in the back half of the year some acceleration. Yet Architectural volumes are kind of flat and chlor-alkali is negative. So are we seeing some sort of delay in order patterns? Has the overall picture of seasonality somehow changed? Or was there may be a pickup in demand that was in 2010, that was really pulled forward from 2011? What's going on here? Why aren't we seeing higher volumes given where housing starts are?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, housing starts, in our view, are still very depressed. And we started to see, over the last quarter or the last few months of 2011, a little more encouraging signs, but off some very low volumes from previous years. So I would say that we're still in the very early stages of a housing recovery. And so it wouldn't be significant enough at this point to really see big volume increases, especially at this time of year where we're still in the winter and this is not a seasonally strong quarter. So I think if this kind of nascent recovery continues, we'll probably see more volume improvements as we go through the year. And I think all of us have been waiting for a housing recovery for a few years. I've predicted it incorrectly to have happened certainly last year, probably the year before. It hasn't. I'd like to be encouraged here, as we see a few of these signs, but I'm going to probably wait until we get a little further into this thing before I declare that, yes, we're in the early stages. And we have to remember that these levels of housing starts and things are still very, very low. I think they'll come back. We talked about automotive people said, \u201cHey, automotive\u2019s never going to come back, 8 million or 9 million builds is the new normal.\u201d I think now everyone believes we'll get back to the old levels in the automotive industry. And I think we'll make more of those cars here. And I think eventually housing will correct. I think it'll improve a little bit, but at this point, we're still at very low levels. So even if the increases are, let's say, a little more than they have been, we're still increasing off some very, very low levels. So we won't -- if you look at it, overall in the industry, probably not yet significant.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. On your Architectural EMEA share gains, would you kind of give a little bit more qualification around what were the regions or particular end markets? And then given that even with Dyrup, you're still perhaps somewhat underrepresented in Germany. Is there any interest in growing there? I mean, given that you still are seeing very, very nice rises in German housing prices?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, for us, most of the European market, and our business in Europe as well, is in what we would call the Maintenance segment, both Residential and Commercial Maintenance. There's not as much of a new build or new construction market in Europe. So the improvements that we've seen have been in that segment. And we have some of our stronger businesses in countries that have held up better economically and the construction businesses have held up a little better. So that would be France and the Benelux countries. As we've described, we don't have much exposure at all to the Southern Mediterranean countries. We have a business in the U.K. that I would say is weaker than these Western European countries. And we\u2019ve still been seeing some, I would say, some slight growth in markets where we're pretty strong, like Poland, as an example, in Eastern Europe, that haven't been affected too dramatically yet by all this weakness in the rest of Europe. In the German market, we have a relatively small position. I don't follow the housing prices in Germany, but overall, the economy\u2019s been better there. They're well served in Germany. They have a number of small- to medium-sized German paint manufacturers. It's a competitive market. We'll pick up a little more sales in Germany from the Dyrup acquisition and I think, longer term, it does present a growth opportunity for us. But we're looking in Europe although we're cognizant of the fact that growth rates, right now, aren't that exciting. And so to the extent that we can find the right acquisition at the right of value, we'll be interested. But we're in that market, so we know growth is not going to be the big driver for earnings over the next year or so. So we're being, I would say, cautious and discriminating as we look at acquisition opportunities. And there are some of it there because the market is less consolidated than it is in North America, as an example.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","That\u2019s helpful. And just one final one, if I may. On Olympic ONE, with the introduction of that product, obviously, there was some advertising costs. Are those costs going to continue through 2012 or do you have an opportunity to help some margins on that side of the business?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, we obviously supported Olympic ONE in the second of the year and then wanted to support the launch, and I think that went well. We want to continue that, I think there's some momentum in the brand. Our customer has encouraged us to continue to support it. So at this point, we would like to keep that momentum going and we're just not going to strip out all the costs in order to drive some, let's say, near-term margin improvement, although all of us realize the pressures in the Architectural business. But we're going to try to stay the course here.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Gregg Goodnight with UBS.","Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Your Industrial Coatings margins, you mentioned were up 200 basis points, and you mentioned a couple of things. Number one is lower gas prices and you implied that you've also taken some actions in that segment. My question is, which was the bigger effect there? And if natural gas prices decide to go up, are you going to be able to keep most of that margin improvement?","Vincent J. Morales","Gregg, I think the factors in Industrial, we cited, were higher volumes.","Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, 4% volumes.","Vincent J. Morales","Yes. Natural gas was not a factor in that. We got higher volume and higher price versus prior period.","David B. Navikas","And then manufacturing costs, Gregg.","Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Manufacturing costs. So it was some fundamental improvement that contributed to that also?","David B. Navikas","Right.","Charles E. Bunch","But natural gas has a bigger impact on our Commodity Chemicals and our Glass segments. It's not a direct raw material for our Coatings business.","Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. That make sense, appreciate the clarification. In the Performance Coatings area, you mentioned in Marine Coatings, there was some increase in customer claims. Would you characterize that as low- to mid-single-digit-type impacts and will this continue?","Charles E. Bunch","Yes, I would characterize it as low-single-digit kind of numbers and we wouldn't expect that to continue. You have this happen periodically in the Marine Coatings industry. These are products that are working in harsh environments and that fourth quarter item was triggered more to a resolution of a longer-standing claim. So you would expect that this is not a continuing quarterly item but you do get that from time to time in Marine Coatings.","Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. Last question, if I could. The $1 billion end of year cash target. What is the assumption on your asbestos settlement? And if the asbestos settlement happens, does that impact your share repurchase targets that you mentioned a little while ago?","David B. Navikas","Well, it would. It's a factor, Gregg. It goes into the calculus of how we're going to deploy the cash that we have available to us. So we're not trying to predict when that is going to occur, but certainly, would that to occur and we have that use of cash in 2012, it would tend to push down what we spend on share repurchase. But then the other dynamic is the extent to which we're able to bring acquisitions to a conclusion. So we're really trying to balance those 3 factors as the year unfolds.","Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And what is your best guess in terms of the settlement? Will it happen this year or is this no way to tell?","Vincent J. Morales","No way to tell, Gregg.","Operator","Your next questions come from the line of John Roberts of Buckingham Research.","Gaji Balakaneshan - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","This is Gaji Balakaneshan on for John. Maybe start off with a clarification. Are you guys thinking that the first quarter of 2012 is going to be sort of equivalent to the fourth quarter? Plus the seasonal change in demand or is it maybe a little better than that?","David B. Navikas","I think what we articulated was the macro-environment feels the same, with some seasonal uptick.","Gaji Balakaneshan - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay, I got it. And then given the de-stocking that you saw in the second half of 2011, have you seen an end to de-stocking or maybe any restocking or possibly expecting that to occur in the near future?","Charles E. Bunch","It's still early in the quarter. We're only a couple of weeks into this. I would say, in Europe, we're asking because we're trying to be very mindful of the situation over there. Right now, we have not seen any significant movements of de-stocking or restocking in Europe on top of what we saw in the fourth quarter. Chinese New Year for the Asia\/Pacific region is early this year, it's coming up this week. So that's kind of -- it's going to throw off a little bit of our calculations, so we're going to have to wait until we move through the Chinese New Year and get further into the first quarter to see how activity and inventory levels are going to be in Asia. And I would say, here in North America, most of the activity that we're seeing is normal seasonal activity. And that means that there is some seasonal uptick in a normal pattern. So we have not seen anything that is out of the ordinary in terms of the trends that we finished the year with.","Gaji Balakaneshan - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And then lastly, are there any businesses or geographies that have irrational levels of inventories? So maybe certain levels are too low given the end demand that you're seeing?","Charles E. Bunch","Irrational levels of inventory, no. We don't have any irrational levels of inventories. We're watching it. I would say, from what I can see at our customers\u2019 inventory levels or suppliers\u2019, I think everyone has been fairly cautious but not overly so. So there is no either outright pessimism or unbridled optimism out there in inventories and I think it's more steady-as-she-goes.","Operator","Our final question today is from the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just with regard to the pricing that you're going to be putting through in the Coating space to catch up to the 2011 gross margin moves that you saw. Does that make any assumptions for the TiO2 prices that are currently -- the hikes that are currently on the table or would that need more incremental pricing from you?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, I would say at this point, we're still discussing TiO2 prices and trying to determine what's going to happen with the rest of our raw material basket. So we're still operating, at this point, off of the increases that we saw in the fourth quarter for TiO2, depending on where things go. Overall, for our basket, we'll have to develop our strategies once we see the general direction, it's not strictly from a TiO2 standpoint, and we're still under discussion for impacts in 2012.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And just on your comments on the demand environment from the housing space. Do you think the demand is actually strong enough there to warrant or support the TiO2 hikes that are out in the industry or is that up for debate at this point?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, I made some comments on that in the past. Overall, we haven't seen a big improvement in demand in the housing sector. It's still early in the season. Certainly, we haven't seen a lot of strength over the last couple years. I've described today, moderating growth in markets like China or Brazil, concern about weakness in Europe. So I would say, overall, the construction markets are still tepid overall. And we may see a little bit of improvement as we go through the year. But I think there\u2019s been, maybe a lot written about these nascent signs of improvement here in the U.S., but from a volume standpoint, we haven't seen dramatic improvements here, just early here in January.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's event. I'd like to turn the call back over to management for some closing remarks.","Vincent J. Morales","Thanks, Regina. I just want to thank everybody for your time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","I'd now like to hand the call over to Mr. Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Vincent J. Morales","Thank you, Angela, and good afternoon, everybody. Again, this is Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations for PPG Industries. Welcome to PPG's First Quarter 2013 Financial Teleconference. Joining me from PPG on the call today is Chuck Bunch, PPG's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael McGarry, Executive Vice President; Dave Navikas, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer; and I'd like to introduce Frank Sklarsky, Executive Vice President, Finance, who just joined PPG this week, and welcome, Frank.","Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, April 18, 2013. I will remind everybody that approximately 1 hour ago, we posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on our Investor Center at our website at ppg.com. These slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to our opening comments that Chuck will make momentarily. Following Chuck's perspective on the company's results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&A session.","Both our prepared commentary and discussion during the Q&A may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements.","This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures.

For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC.","Now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch.","Charles E. Bunch","Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. We delivered another strong earnings performance in the first quarter with adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.58, up 12% versus the prior year. We achieved these results despite notable differences in demand levels by region, with strong North American demand continuing, growth resuming in most Asian end-use markets and broadly weaker activity in Europe. We were able to deliver higher earnings due principally to our proactive cost management actions, coupled with continued strength of several end-use markets, including automotive OEM, aerospace and U.S. construction.","A few key business highlights from the quarter were the aggregate coatings segment earnings growth we achieved of 13%. In addition, our coatings earnings grew in each region, including Europe, despite the persistent economic weakness in that region. This performance was delivered despite volumes that were down about 3% versus the prior year although the prior-year period included 2 additional sales days which impacted comparisons in several of our businesses.","From a strategic standpoint, we have also been very active. We completed the Commodity Chemicals business separation transaction in late January. As a result of that transaction, we received about $900 million of cash, reduced our share count by 10.8 million shares or about 7%, and recorded a nonrecurring gain relating to the business separation of about $2.2 billion in the quarter. Additionally, on April 1, we completed the acquisition of AkzoNobel's North American Architectural Coatings business. Since the acquisition was announced in December 2012, we have been very focused on a seamless integration for our customers and to ensure we are creating shareholder value. As a result of our progress to date, we have identified further synergy opportunities and have increased our 3-year synergy target for the acquisition to $200 million, up 25% versus our initial target. This target includes $60 million of cost reductions that we realized when the transaction closed. Results for the acquired business will be incorporated into our second quarter financials and we look forward to updating you on the integration process in upcoming quarters.","Looking ahead, we plan to continue to build on our strong first quarter performance. We remain optimistic about growth prospects in several of our businesses. This includes many of our businesses serving North America where demand remains solid and consistent, such as the U.S. construction market where we have more than doubled the size of our U.S. Architectural Coatings business with the addition of the acquired AkzoNobel business. Additionally, automotive OEM and aerospace remain global growth platforms in the coming quarters.","Also, many of our businesses in Asia and specifically, China, are expected to continue to grow as our products are focused primarily on serving local consumption and general industrial activities and have only minor exposure to weaker end-use markets such as construction.","Demand in Europe is likely to remain challenging and we expect that the implementation of our restructuring program and our focus on aggressive cost management will continue to offset the impacts of these weak market conditions. Our balance sheet remains very strong with about $2.4 billion of cash and short-term investments at quarter end.","One thing to note is that we paid just over $900 million on April 1 for the acquired AkzoNobel business, which will be reflected in our second quarter financial statements.","During the first quarter, we repaid $600 million of term debt that matured near the end of the quarter and was carrying a high interest rate based on current rates. And we spent about $140 million on share repurchases, primarily in the months of February and March after the Commodity Chemicals separation was completed.","We continue to analyze prudent cash deployment opportunities, focused on growing our earnings and rewarding our shareholders, including today, as our Board of Directors approved a $0.02 dividend increase, raising the quarterly dividend to $0.61.","Overall, I was pleased with our first quarter financial performance in the face of somewhat difficult and mixed economic conditions and in comparison to a tough period last year. However, given these diverse market conditions will remain -- will likely remain, we will continue to demand operating and cost excellence from our businesses and apply the same focus on our customers as we had demonstrated in the past.","Thank you for your attention. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  Please stand by for your first question which comes from the line of David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Chuck, can you update us on your discussions with Essilor on the Transitions joint venture?","Charles E. Bunch","No, we have no update today on the discussions, other than the disclosure that we made early in the first quarter.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Very good. And just as a follow-up, in terms of the Akzo business, talk about some of the -- some profitability metric you might look at for 2013, given these initial cost savings in there?","Michael H. McGarry","David, this is Michael McGarry. In regard to that, the most challenging aspect of the Akzo business is the stores network so that will be where we focus. Obviously, we have some synergy levels in a lot of the places overhead, as well as other locations as far as how we operate the business versus there, we have a lot more rigor that I think -- in our business so it will be where we're focused.","Operator","Next question comes from John McNulty from Credit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","With regard to the synergy target, you've obviously -- you've had some chance, a little bit of time, to actually look at them and obviously, it's a pretty big increase to the $200 million. So I guess if you -- I was wondering if you could give us some clarity as to which of the kind of major buckets you're seeing the biggest changes in. And then as the follow-up, if you can give us any color as to maybe any working capital opportunities you may see in the assets as well now that you've got a chance to dig into them?","Michael H. McGarry","John, this is Michael again. The West Coast is an opportunity for us. As you know, we had a nice store network on the West Coast so we'll be shifting volume from their plants into our Reno network, so that will be one. We have a deeper understanding of the logistics across both networks, that will be one. I talked already about the stores opportunity in -- and SG&A, so those will be the other ones.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And on the working capital side?","Michael H. McGarry","Working capital, I would say they're fairly decent. And so that's clearly an area of focus for the entire company and not just for architectural.","Operator","Next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I admit, Chuck, I'm a little bit lost if I can't ask a question about caustic or chlorine?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, you know where the -- I'm sure you'll be asking those questions at [indiscernible] and some of the other market participants but...","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I will get my fix elsewhere. You started on that share buyback in February. You guys are targeting like $500 million to $750 million in 2013. I'm wondering if you could update on uses of cash, whether it -- whether you think you'll proceed at that pace that you had in the first quarter on the share buyback side or what you're looking at in terms of M&A opportunities?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, I would say that, that target range for the full year is still appropriate. Obviously, it's going to depend somewhat on acquisition opportunities and other potential uses of cash. And right now, as you saw, with our recent announcement concerning Deft, we are still active in the marketplace. We did announce, as you know, at the end of the fourth quarter, the Spraylat. So we're continuing to actively look at acquisition opportunities and we will have some further news as we go through the year.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And the -- your performance in auto OEM, particularly in Europe, with the industry down and yet -- down double-digits, and yet you reported a volume increase there, how did you do it? What can we expect there because that was somewhat surprising?","Charles E. Bunch","It was an excellent performance overall for the business unit and especially in Europe. And as you know, in automotive OEM, these are longer-term commitments but we have several new products, what we call our compact process for the full coatings materials on an automobile, as well as our new electrocoat product that have been helping us to gain new business. We also had what I would call a good customer mix. So we were with the right customers and the right plants that really helped us, in Europe, offset some of the declines. But we're very well-positioned here and in China, as an example. So I think it was an across-the-board excellent performance from the business unit, in addition to very good cost management. And we benefited, obviously, there from some of the restructuring activities that we started last year and actually during the previous recession in '08 and '09.","Operator","Next question comes from Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Chuck, I was wondering if you might give us some more granularity on the comments you made in the prepared comments about channel differentials in U.S. architectural. It seems like you had different growth rates across the different channels. Could you give us maybe some explanation of what was going on there?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, we had what we felt were good growth rates in the stores channel, this is the PPG stores channel here in the U.S., as well as the home center channel. Where we saw more weakness was in what we would call the independent dealer channel. And there, because you're going through a 2-step distribution process on occasion, especially when you straddle a quarter like this and the seasonality as it's changing and some of the weather patterns, I think we saw some of our dealers just move purchases or inventory over the last month or 2. But that was definitely the channel that we saw some weakness to, but I don't know that it's a longer-term trend. We'll have to wait as we go through the second quarter to make sure that we're seeing a consistent pattern. And I think that the dealers are well-positioned, should be able to take advantage of this improving market. So at this point, I wouldn't take too many conclusions from the weakness of that 1 channel, especially because of the 2-step nature of distribution.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And I think you just provided some commentary about the admirable results in your auto OEM and being on the right platforms and\/or, in some cases, geographies. Should we expect -- you gave commentary that you'll continue to outpace the industry, but should we expect a more modest out-performance versus the industry going forward?","Charles E. Bunch","I think the second quarter, some of those trends should still be in place. Obviously, the European market was very weak, and we're seeing the lowest auto builds there in a generation. But I would say that, if you look ahead to the next quarter or 2, the U.S. and North American markets, very healthy. And I think the production levels should be sustained versus prior year, if not slightly higher. And the China automotive market, very strong. We're looking for 10% growth now in the Chinese automotive and we're well-positioned, again, with many of the best customers, best plants, new technology. So we're looking to continue the momentum that you saw in the first quarter.","Operator","The next question comes from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Chuck, a question on gross margin, you had a strong gross margin. I'm just wondering how much of that was better than expected raw particularly with propylene coming down, which I know you have a big exposure to, versus how much of that was productivity? And then maybe if you could comment on your sort of raw material outlook for the year for coatings and whether that's changed?","Charles E. Bunch","I would say the margin improvement was largely the result of the cost and restructuring activities. Raw materials were just down slightly. Overall our inflation index, if you take all the transportation and distribution costs, was slightly up. And so I would say most of the improvement was, again, kind of mix and productivity and restructuring. Raw materials, for us, again, down slightly in the first quarter, primarily in Europe. Europe has been, as you know from our results here, was by far our weakest region. Volumes were down in almost every business. And we saw some raw material price weakness in Europe that did help. Our overall outlook for this year is flat to slightly negative raw material pricing. What we are seeing, however, over the last few weeks, some more weakness in commodity prices, with the exception of natural gas. But in -- as you know, propylene for us is -- we're not usually buying it except in resin formulations. And so we don't usually see the immediate benefit of declines in propylene prices. So we may see that later in the year if these trends continue but certainly, we're not looking for it here in the near term.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And just as a follow-up, given your view that raw materials might come down, obviously, some of your large customers in coatings track that as well. Do you see any pressure to reduce Coatings prices from the big boxes?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, as I said, most of the raw material weakness was in Europe. The raw material here, the raw material basket here in North America and actually in Asia as well, is just slightly down. It was close to 0 but low single-digit numbers so at this point, our pricing is stable.","Operator","Next question comes from John Roberts from UBS.","John Roberts","I was a little surprised that the packaging business also, I think, was strong in Europe. And then as a follow-up, were you a little surprised that the Industrial Coatings business in North America wasn't strong, given there's fair amount of auto and other related things over in your Industrial Coatings area in North America?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, you asked about a couple of businesses. I would say in packaging, the strongest regional market for us has been in Asia Pacific. I would say that volumes in North America and Europe for packaging are stable but the growth that we did experience was in Asia. And in Industrial Coatings, it is, what I would call, a mix story by both region and end-use markets, automotive parts being one of the strongest. We've seen some weakness in consumer electronics, although it was moderated, I guess, on our Industrial Coatings side. Heavy duty equipment was, I would say, flat and some of the construction-related -- the industrial markets that serve the commercial construction still -- it's still early days in any recovery and Europe overall was somewhat weak. So I think it's really a mix story. But we've done well overall in industrial, again, good restructuring, good support in Europe through productivity. Some help in Europe on the raw materials, but it's been a mixed bag.","John Roberts","And the 4-quarter seasonal breakdown for the Glidden business that you gave in your handout, does that imply, the first quarter, which wasn't included in your results, was a pretty normal seasonal quarter for them?","Vincent J. Morales","Yes, John, this is Vince. We saw normal seasonality in all of our businesses essentially, including that business based on what we have exposure to.","Operator","Next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I went to my local Lowe's and I saw sort of shelves of Valspar's new propane and I saw very little Olympic. Is it the case that your share at Lowe's is decreasing? And is it perhaps the result of the AkzoNobel acquisition? And will losses of share at Lowe's offset the increased productivity that you see in buying the AkzoNobel business?","Charles E. Bunch","The new prop program at Lowe's is being supplied by Valspar. So that was a competitive situation that PPG did not win. That decision was made prior to the Akzo announcement so it was based on the merits of the bidding process and the decisions of the customer at that time. So it's -- in our case with the Akzo acquisition, we're looking at that as an opportunity. We have again had good discussions with all channels, all customers. And we're confident that we will be able to perform well in the integration of these businesses, thus the increase in the synergy targets that you saw today.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, can you talk about the weakness in the domestic optical business in a bit more detail?","Charles E. Bunch","The optical business in North America from all our customer and at-market data, so it was not just in our Transitions business but broader, whether that was due to changes in insurance reimbursement plans, weather, less the falling of Easter. It's not sure but there was more weakness in the first quarter in the at-market sales of all the products in the optical industry, not just Transitions. So at this point, we're going to see how that performance manifests itself here in the second quarter going forward before we can really say that this is a longer-term trend.","Operator","Next question comes from Kevin McCarthy, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Chuck, I thought your commentary on the Asian coatings market was perhaps more positive than I might have anticipated. I think you described notably improved activity in the region, mid to high single-digit growth, x marine. Can you comment on what is driving that and what is your degree of confidence that Asia will continue to grow at that sort of pace or a different pace?","Charles E. Bunch","Kevin, if you look at the Chinese market in particular, obviously, with the exception -- well, let's say the -- by far, the weakest market is the marine new-build market and that affects our business in China and also Korea. The first quarter was no exception. We've been talking about this for the last year or so. Those trends continued. We think the comparable data in the second half of the year will improve there. But right now, we're still experiencing notable declines in the business. In China, the construction market, let's call it the residential construction market, was also somewhat weaker. Although we have a relatively small business there. We actually gained slightly in terms of volume but off a very small base. The big businesses for us in China, automotive OEM, they had an excellent quarter, a lot of momentum as we've talked about. Automotive refinish, good volume growth as the carpark continues to expand in China. The Industrial business was also solid. Again, the -- for the most part, the strengths that we saw in automotive parts, actually, our customer mix in consumer electronics, was not too bad and the packaging business, as I've referenced was also solid in China. So if you look at our biggest market there, we had, on balance, good support, again led by automotive OEM builds which are going to be up some 10% and again, with some of the -- our new product introductions, our customer mix, we're poised to continue to deliver in Asia more broadly but specifically, in China.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","As a follow-up, Chuck, when do you expect the marine business to hit a cyclical trough?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, I think the second half of this year, we're expecting this -- let's call it, this precipitous decline to level off. You haven't seen more broadly the industry start to recover. China went down for -- earliest, I guess, in this new-build cycle and Korea sustained its new-builds longer. Now we've seen a little bit of more weakness in Korea as well but I think the second half is going to moderate in terms of the market declines. But in terms of an upturn, we're probably at least a year away from seeing these things increase build rates in -- for new oceangoing vessels in Asia. Now the half of that business is protective coatings. So despite the weakness in new-builds in Asia, protective Coatings is growing. It's doing well here in North America. It is also growing in Asia. And we're doing a good job in Europe from a restructuring and productivity standpoint. So I don't want to paint a too gloomy picture of the strategic business unit because it does include -- half of that market is doing well but we have seen a sharp decline in marine new-builds. We're, again, leveling off second half of this year but probably won't start an upturn until next year.","Operator","Next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citibank.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","If I look at Slide 16, Akzo had Glidden brand in pretty much every channel. Is there potential brand repositioning you can do to avoid any channel conflicts?","Charles E. Bunch","We're going to look at our brand positioning and I think we'll have an opportunity. It was -- it's really early days, and I think these -- the first thing that we're trying to do with this integration is make sure that all the current customers are being supported and supplied and so we think that we're not going to make any quick changes in terms of brand or channel but it's certainly something that we're going to look at and there'd be maybe some opportunities to provide more clarity among the channels in the future. But right now, we're moving forward to protect all of the customers that we have in those channels.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then your optical sales were down 6%. Is there more competition for Transitions coming in at the low-end from competitors like Zeiss or Hoya?","Charles E. Bunch","We have been competing with Zeiss and Hoya in photochromics, in Hoya's case, for several years. Zeiss started early in 2012 and actually, in 2011. And so I don't think that there is any new product introductions here. We do see the Chinese market growing. That's an opportunity for all the optical manufacturers, although there is a manufacturing base in China that we will watch as -- in the coming years as they develop their capability.","Operator","Next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Akzo this morning was calling out a trade-down effect in architectural paints in Europe. Can you just give us some color on what you're seeing at the region there?","Michael H. McGarry","Ghansham, this is Michael. The -- our numbers in Europe were negatively impacted by our trade business. The trade guys react very quickly to weather. And as you know, over in Europe, we had the worst weather in a couple of decades, and so we were right in that minus 10% to 12% downrange.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, so most of the weakness was just weather-related versus any sort of trade-down then?","Michael H. McGarry","Yes, we don't think we lost any share.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just can you give us some more color on the Deft acquisition, too? What was the attraction there? Was it technology, customer alignment, et cetera?","Charles E. Bunch","This -- the Deft acquisition, about 75% of Deft sales are in the aerospace industry, and that's one. And we are the industry leader in aerospace coatings so we felt it fit nicely, and not only from a position, but they have some excellent products, especially water-based primers. And so we felt that it filled some product niche opportunities for us, expanded our presence in the space. And so we look forward to what we feel is going to be an excellent acquisition, not only for the aerospace but we also have some industrial and architectural products that are part of that acquisition. But the primary driver was product opportunities in aerospace.","Operator","Next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.","Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This is Rob Walker on for Laurence. I guess, as you think about volume trends this quarter U.S. had a tough comp because of weather. Europe had a tough comp because activity didn't fall off until Q2 last year. So I guess, shouldn't the comp get easier notably in Q2 and do you expect coatings volumes overall to be solidly up year-over-year in Q2?","Charles E. Bunch","Yes, we think that we should face some easier comparables in the second quarter. And I would say that in Europe, and we feel that the business will get better overall in Europe. And the first quarter was very weak, but we don't feel that this trend is going to accelerate here in the second quarter and the comp should be favorable here and in Europe as well.","Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then I guess could you update us on what you're seeing in the TiO2 market and your progress on the various initiatives you're doing there to continue to improve the situation?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, we hit our target last year of more efficiently using TiO2 in our formulas between 4% and 6%, so we were within the range on the lower end of that. We saw some continued improvement but not at the same pace here in the first quarter so we're continuing to derive some benefits for more efficiently using the raw material. Pricing right now in TiO2, I would say that, as I indicated earlier, Europe has been the weakest market. We don't know exactly the trend for TiO2 in the second half of the year, and we're discussing right now second quarter pricing. So I would say that the trends at this point seem to be slightly -- slight moderate or on a slight moderate decline on a global basis, again, mostly in Europe. And I would say flat to overall in raw materials for the first half of the year.","Operator","Next question comes from Andy Cash from SunTrust.","Andrew W. Cash - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just couple of things. You mentioned in your release about how aerospace and the Performance Coatings was doing well, solid demand. Yesterday, Textron had mentioned the business jet market is weak right now. I'm just curious if you're just really a small supplier to the business jet market or is it more big jets? I mean, why the difference there?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, I think there are several different market segments within business for general aviation. And of that segment, it's continued to do well for us. Again, some of our products are concentrated in, let's call it, the bigger iron in that bizjet market. And overall, we did see a slight improvement in volume overall for our business. And so commercial aviation has continued to be a strength for the business over -- it's been now on a 1 to 2-year upcycle and that continued despite some of the qualification issues around the 787. So we're still seeing good support there in commercial aviation and business aviation. We're not probably as big a player overall and I think the market segments that we participate in are doing a little better.","Vincent J. Morales","And Andy, this is Vince. We also have a very big aftermarket presence that is much more stable.","Andrew W. Cash - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay, so that outweighs that.  Just one other question, if I could. I know you're just still integrating Akzo, you're early days there. But if you look at your overall store count, and perhaps you're going to rationalize some stores. But if you think about your company-owned stores over the next few years, what kind of sort of growth rate should we anticipate there?","Michael H. McGarry","Andy, this is Michael. If you look at it, they have a very good network in Canada so we'll be adding stores in Canada. The overlap was primarily in the southeast and southwest where we have the Porter stores and the Monarch stores so that's where we'll be looking to optimize the network there.","Andrew W. Cash - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Yes, do you have a sort of a growth rate in mind? Do you know how many new stores you want to add once you sort of get things to sort of a steady state?","Michael H. McGarry","We don't have a figure that we're willing to share right now, but we're certainly looking to improve this store network that we've gone from 400 stores now to 1,000, so that will be a focus area for us.","Operator","Next question comes from Nils Wallin from CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Quick one on architectural coatings. It look likes year-on-year, your revenues were down $60 million and depending on how we do the cost savings numbers and allocation, cost savings I don't think explains all of that improved or excuse me, the stability in the EBITDA part of that segment. So would you help me understand what the other offsets might be in the architectural EMEA business that's contributing to this pretty good result despite very tough headwinds?","Michael H. McGarry","I'll take that one. Yes, if you look at Europe, we had very strong cost down performance. We also had the restructuring gains. In North America, we also had a wee bit of price. And if you look in other markets, we did pretty well in that regard. So cost is certainly a significant driver.","Vincent J. Morales","And then -- and Nil, the cost, again, as Michael mentioned, is really 2 buckets. It's the restructuring savings that we've been implementing over the past 12 months. And we haven't anniversary-ed last year's savings as of yet, as well as what I would call discretionary costs that -- some of that, given the volume drop that Chuck mentioned earlier, more than 10%, we were able to pull the lever on some of that discretionary cost.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Got it. And just on the architectural in the U.S., I mean, mid to high single-digit in company-owned stores, that sounds like some share gains compared to competitors. Are you taking share in the company-owned store business or is there something else going on there?","Michael H. McGarry","I don't believe we're taking share in that segment.","Operator","Next question comes from Charles Dan from Morgan Stanley.","Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First, could you give some sense to the magnitude of the increase in your U.S. architectural business? I know you mentioned that it was up, but sometimes you give a little more detail there?","Vincent J. Morales","Magnitude of the -- in sales? We were up collectively in the U.S. business about 3%, which included higher growth in stores, comparable growth in our national accounts, and, as Chuck mentioned earlier, our dealer network was down.","Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And in your general industrial business, could you give us a sense for the breakdown sort of by geography in terms of the trends?","Vincent J. Morales","Well, as Chuck mentioned, Asia was up mid to high single-digits. Europe was down mid to high single-digits and U.S. was essentially neutral.","Operator","Next question comes from Ivan Marcuse from KeyBanc.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just had a quick question. On U.S. commercial, where -- which one of your businesses do you typically see is a leading indicator and it gives you a sign that it's coming back and are you seeing any signs that commercial construction or nonresidential construction is coming back in some way in the U.S.?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, the business unit that is the -- has the clearest indicator of commercial construction activity is the flat glass business. It actually reports to Michael. And there we've seen what I would call early signs that we are seeing improvement in U.S. commercial construction, it's because of the business -- our business is primarily focused here in the U.S. If you look at the Architectural Billing Index, that's up slightly but I would say that it's still lagging the recovery that we're seeing here in the U.S. in residential but we believe it's coming. So we think that this commercial construction activity is building, it was the last to go into the recession. It probably went in maybe 1.5 to 2 years later than the -- than residential in the previous decade. So we think it's following a similar pattern, but we're seeing early signs of improvement.","Operator","Next question comes from Kevin Hocevar from Northcoast Research.","Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research","Could you give a little more color on the introduction of the next-generation Transitions lenses in Europe? Could you kind of elaborate on how that's been going compared to your expectations, better or worse or maybe compared to prior next-generation lenses? And also, when is kind of a rollout date for the U.S. with that product?","Charles E. Bunch","The performance in the first quarter for our gen 7 Transitions in Europe was actually encouraging. The overall European market for many of our other businesses as you've heard on the call was very weak. So we were pleased that we saw strength in Europe from the introduction of gen 7. We have better transmission, gets darker, better clarity and less temperature sensitivity. So we feel that the product has real features and benefits that we are encouraged that the market is recognizing. The introduction in North America is scheduled for late this year. So you will see -- we feel a good growth opportunities towards the latter half of the second half. So we're talking about the fourth quarter where we should see some improvement from the introduction of gen 7 here in North America. So we're encouraged with what we see.","Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research","Okay, and then just one quick follow-up. The -- you expect to save as part of your couple year $140 million I believe is the number of cost savings. You expected another $70 million to $80 million of incremental savings this year. I just wonder if you could comment on how you have progressed toward that number. And is there any additional possibilities especially given the -- kind of the prolonged outlook for European weakness to maybe even come at the high-end or maybe even higher than those levels?","Vincent J. Morales","Kevin, this is Vince again. There's a couple of different numbers you threw out. The $70 million to $80 million was the remainder we had on our restructuring program and that was a full year 2013 number. We got just under $30 million of that in the first quarter. We expect similar but slightly larger amount in the second quarter. And then we're going to start to anniversary some of our savings from last year, so we'll see lesser amounts later in the year and even a little minor spillover into next year. The number you didn't mention was the $60 million of annual synergies we get as we close the Akzo acquisition. Those were primarily fixed cost so they break out evenly per quarter. So that would be roughly $15 million a quarter beginning immediately. And then we have $140 million of first 3-year synergies from the Akzo acquisition. As you can imagine, we'll get very modest amounts in the next quarter or certainly 4 or 5 months as we begin the integration process. Then we expect those to ramp up thereafter. So hopefully, that's what you were looking for.","Operator","Next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn from Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","A couple of questions. If you look at the cost savings -- if you could just look at the restructuring cost savings that you talked about that's benefiting a number of your businesses. Vince, you mentioned that it's going to anniversary sometime this year. Sort of what is the run rate once it anniversaries that we should be looking forward to carry over into 2014?","Vincent J. Morales","Well, from the time that we started the process, we'll be looking at a run rate of about $140 million a year. As you could see, this past quarter, it was about $30 million so that would be about a $120 million run rate. So we still have a little bit more accretion per quarter. But from beginning of last year, using that as the index, it would be about $140 million of savings once we get to, let's say, 2014.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, all right. So there's still several tens of  millions of dollars on a year-over-year basis in restructuring benefits that you'll see in 2014?","Vincent J. Morales","Yes, we'll see some mild spillover into 2014.","Charles E. Bunch","Dmitry, it's in the remaining quarters of 2013 that we'll see that incremental benefit. But by the time we get to the first quarter of 2014, there'll be only a small portion of that $140 million cumulative savings yet to be realized for the first time.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, I was coming up with about $25 million, but okay. All right, maybe it's smaller than that. If you look at your -- the acquisition of Akzo, have you and maybe you've already shared but I just don't remember. Can you talk about what the incremental depreciation amortization is going to be for you guys that were -- put it differently what's the D&A for the year, including this business?","David B. Navikas","We expected -- we're still working through the numbers, Dmitry. We won't have those finalized until later this year, but if you look the business we're looking at about $40 million to $50 million of D&A for the business on an annual basis.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","After all the write-ups and everything, so that's going to be the net adder?","David B. Navikas","The net D&A -- gross and net D&A.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, very good. And then you also mentioned some share gains in Europe in discussing your Industrial Coatings business. So can you talk a little bit about that? And also have you seen any issues with heavy equipment or the ag equipment business that one of your competitors referred to seeing in the January quarter?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, the Industrial Coatings segment that we referenced, the sales growth and the share gain has been in automotive OEM coatings. And again, as we discussed, it was focused on new product introductions being with the right customers and the right plants. So I would say that the sales growth momentum that we're seeing in the segment is primarily being driven by the automotive OEM segment. Heavy-duty equipment, that has been, let's call it, modest or flat growth, so we've seen some weakness overall in the market. In some regions, Asia, a little bit stronger, Europe, a little bit weaker, very flat here in North America. So again, not seeing that same kind of overall growth for the market that we're talking about in automotive in heavy-duty equipment. And we hope that that's a trend that reverses itself or we see a recovery of growth as the year goes on.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","But you're not seeing a significant decline in demand in heavy equipment particularly in Asia. You mentioned Asia was actually a little bit stronger for you?","Charles E. Bunch","Yes, we're not seeing a big decline. There's been some discussions in the marketplace about will the mining or commodity segment be hurt by what we've seen over the last couple of months in the market for commodities or mining stocks. The ag guys, to me, feel pretty strong right now. But there's probably been a little more weakness compared to the ag guys in, let's call it, construction and mining equipment.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have a question from Richard O'Reilly from Revere Associates.","Richard O'Reilly","To help some of us with our commodity taxes, can you talk about how much exposure you have now to natural gas without the chlorine business?","Michael H. McGarry","This is Michael, Richard. Our exposure is down 75% and that leaves, what's remaining, the 75% of that is actually in our glass businesses, both glass and fiberglass. And that's becoming a less and lesser important commodity to us.","Richard O'Reilly","Sure. How would natural gas compare with, let's say, the pie of stuff in the coatings business? Would it be as big as pigments or what would it be like?","Michael H. McGarry","It's a much smaller number than pigments.","Richard O'Reilly","Okay, fine, okay. And second quick or just a math question. I thought the Akzo business was acquired for $1.05 billion, yet you talked about cash of $900 million plus. Am I wrong or what's the difference?","David B. Navikas","Richard, the value of the deal was announced at $1.05 billion. The expected cash had originally been $875 million because of some deductions related to the pension plans in Canada that were being assumed, so that would be the difference. We ended up -- they put some additional cash into the plan before we closed. So we ended up with an overall cash out for the acquisition of about $950 million.","Operator","I'd now like to hand the call back to Vince Morales for closing remarks.","Vincent J.

[Operator Instructions] Please also today\u2019s event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference call over to John Bruno, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","John Bruno","Thank you, Jamie, and good afternoon, everyone. Once again, this is John Bruno, Director of Investor Relations. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our second quarter 2019 financial results conference call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, July 18, 2019. I will remind everyone that we have posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the Investor Center of our website, ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call, and provide additional support to the opening comments Michael will make shortly. Following Michael\u2019s perspective on the company\u2019s results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&A session.","Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the company\u2019s current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG\u2019s operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements.","This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the Appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on the website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG\u2019s filings with the SEC.","Now, let me introduce PPG Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.","Michael McGarry","Thank you, John, and good afternoon everyone. I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. Today, we reported second quarter 2019 financial results. For the quarter, our net sales were slightly more than $4 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.85.","Consistent with our improvement targets, we delivered higher year-over-year operating margins for the second consecutive quarter as both gross profit and segment margins improved versus the prior year. Our margins benefited from continuing selling price realization and strong cost management across all our businesses and regions. We were still in the early days of margin recovery, and while we are building some momentum we still have more work to do. Our overall objective is to return to the aggregated segment margins that we have maintained prior to this recent inflationary cycle.","To provide some additional color on our second quarter results, our net sales in constant currency were higher than in the prior year by about 1%. Sales volumes were down nearly 4% impacted by weaker global industrial production that significantly affected global automotive production in many of our general industrial end-use markets, and was evident in all major regions.","Also, about one-third of the total sales volume decline relates to the prior year customer assortment changes in our U.S. architectural coatings DIY business. We have now reached the one-year anniversary of these changes and it will no longer be a comparison deviation. We remain committed and are on track to fully offset the earnings impact of this assortment change in the third quarter.","Selling prices were 2.3% higher marking the ninth consecutive quarter of higher selling prices. We're continuing to work with our customers to ensure we are receiving fair value for our products and services and expect selling prices to increase at a similar rate in the third quarter despite comping against improving gains in the prior year third quarter.","Finally, our net sales were affected by significant unfavorable currency translation of more than 3% or about $130 million. Going forward, we expect unfavorable currency translation to continue albeit at more modest levels with our current estimate for the third quarter of on unfavorable sales impact of between $30 million and $50 million.","Moving to some business trends in the second quarter. In our Performance Coatings reporting segment, aerospace coatings continued to deliver very strong volume growth, outpacing industry performance in most major regions.","In automotive refinish, sales volumes were lower year-over-year reflecting lower collision claims in the U.S. which were down 2% for the industry in the second quarter and in comparison to strong sales volumes in the prior quarter. We expect refinish volume comparisons to improve on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter as our prior year included an unfavorable impact of PPG-specific customer inventory destocking.","Year-over-year organic sales were higher in our architectural coatings EMEA business driven by higher selling prices. Aggregate sales volumes were slightly lower as wetter-than-normal weather patterns impacted overall regional demand during the quarter.","In Mexico, our PPG-Comex business increased organic sales aided by higher selling prices. Sales volumes were tepid as consumer demand reflected increased uncertainty around Mexico's economy and economic policies. PPG-Comex business continues to perform very well and continues its growth by adding nearly 70 concessionary locations in the first half of 2019.","Sales volumes in architectural coatings Americas in Asia-Pacific decreased due to lower net DIY sales of about 60 million stemming from the prior year customer assortment changes. Same-store company-owned sales growth in the U.S. and Canada were relatively flat including impacts from fewer shipping days year-over-year and wet weather that impacted most of this region during the quarter.","Led by strong growth in the Asia region, our protective marine coatings business continued to deliver above-industry organic sales volume -- excuse me, organic growth of high single-digit percentage during the quarter. We are very excited that this business was recently awarded a five-year contract with the U.S. Navy to supply coatings and technical services to the military Sealift command which includes about 125 ships.","In our Industrial Coatings reporting segment, sales volumes were adversely impacted by soft industrial demand in most regions of the world. Most acute were automotive OEM industry build break which declined by nearly 20% in China and remained soft in Europe.","In aggregate, PPG's automotive sales volumes were lower by high single-digit percentage consistent with reduction of global builds. One statistics we track is automotive OEM dealer inventories, which decreased as the quarter proceeded, which may help demand in the second half of the year. As a partial offsets our automotive OEM business realize higher selling prices in each major region for the second consecutive quarter with similar expectations for Q3.","Softer global industrial production activity impacted many of our general industrial coatings business sub-segments, most notably coil, general finishes, appliances and transportation and markets. Also our packaging coatings sales volumes decreased modestly in comparison to above-market growth in the prior year, driven by customer adoption to our INNOVEL interior can coatings products. Our packaging business has achieved above-market growth in the past five years of about 20% compounded. We expect this business to return to growth by the end of the year.","From an earnings perspective, as I mentioned earlier, our second quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $1.85. Our earnings were negatively impacted by about $20 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.","On a constant currency basis, our adjusted EPS is modestly higher than the prior year. Our effective tax rate was about 24% in the second quarter, which is higher than the 22% rate in the second quarter of 2018. The increase mostly relates to recognizing nonrecurring favorable discrete items in the second quarter of 2018. We are still anticipating a tax rate between 23% and 25% for the full year 2019.","Our EPS results were supported by the increase in our selling prices, improved manufacturing performance, aggressive cost management and excellent progress in our cost savings programs, which delivered about $20 million in cost savings during the quarter in line with our targets.","As we look ahead, we expect global economic activity to remain sluggish in the third quarter. We expect global automotive production in general industrial demand to remain unfavorable year-over-year and roughly comparable to what we experienced in the second quarter. Positive developments around regional and country trade disputes could provide a spark to industrial demand as inventory levels in many of our end-use market remain low.","Specific to our businesses, we believe that the potential for lower U.S. interest rates could aid growth in the U.S. housing market and also favorably impact automotive OEMs and U.S. architectural sales.","In Latin America, we anticipate economic activity to be similar to that experienced in the second quarter and we'll continue to add new PPG-Comex concessionary locations to expand our customer reach. Also we have a new manufacturing facility under construction in Panama to localize production and support our sales growth in Central America.","In Asia, demand rates are expected to remain consistent in comparison to the second quarter as we move back into the back half of 2019, sales comparisons to last year will become easier given the weakness in Asian demand that began to occur late last year. This will result in easier comparison and relative performance improvements year-over-year.","We intend to remain laser focused on our cost structure. We remain confident that demand growth will eventually return in China. Economic growth in Europe is expected to remain tepid. And our automotive OEM business year-over-year growth will be difficult in the third quarter as last year benefited from inflated sales from purchases brought forward ahead of the WLTP implementation.","Later in the year, the year-over-year comparison should improve into positive territory. We expect our architectural business to continue to grow, driven by higher selling prices and strong cost management.","Brexit uncertainty is not yet impacting our business trends. However, we expect to closely monitor the situation and prepare contingency plans to best address the potential impacts to overall demand and relating inventory needs. With ongoing uncertainty over global industrial production, we have intensified our cost management and costs, including working with our supplier base to ensure that our input costs are reflective of current industry demand conditions.","In addition, our focus on our cost structure remains elevated as evidenced by our recently announced approval of a new cost savings program, which is a result of a comprehensive internal operational assessment to identify further opportunities to improve our profitability. We have begun implementation of this program, which we expect to have a full year run rate savings of $125 million upon completion of the program.","In addition, we are on the final stages of the execution of the cost savings programs announced in 2016 and 2018. We expect the total benefit from all of these programs to be about $20 million of additional incremental savings to be realized in the third quarter.","Earlier today, we provided EPS guidance specific to the third quarter of 2019. This guidance is $1.57 to $1.67 and includes an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of $0.01 to $0.02 per share. We are also reaffirming our full year 2019 adjusted earnings per share growth of 7% to 10%, excluding currency translation impacts.","In the second quarter, we generated operating cash flow of about $550 million, nearly $200 million more than last year and through the first six months of the year have generated about $350 million more operating cash flow than the same period last year. Our focus on cash flow generation will continue and our goal remains to reduce working capital as a percent of sales compared to 2018.","We completed the Hemmelrath acquisition earlier in the second quarter. I'm happy with the early progress and performance of these three recently completed acquisitions Hemmelrath, SEM and Whitford, which will add about $400 million in annual revenue, of which approximately $100 million is in the Asia-Pacific region.","Acquisition remains one of our preferred cash deployment options, given the value that these have driven for our shareholders over the years. And currently, our pipeline remains solid. In addition to acquisitions, we have progressed our key capital expenditures during the second quarter and we expect total spending to be about 3% of sales in 2019.","Also, earlier today, our Board of Directors approved a $0.03 per share dividend increase. We have paid uninterrupted annual dividend since 1899 and 2019 will mark 48 years of increased dividend payout. And we are pleased to continue to reward our shareholders in this manner. We ended the second quarter with more than $1 billion of cash and short-term investments, which continues to provide us with significant financial flexibility.","Finally, I'd like to thank and recognize PPG's 47000 employees, all over the world, for their continued support and strengthening our position as a leading paint, coatings and specialty materials company. Every day our employees are driving our cultural initiative the PPG way to provide innovative solutions for our customers' most pressing challenges and to deliver value to all our stakeholders.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And now Jamie, I would you please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Michael just on raws, how are you looking at raws in the back half of the year? And what do you expect to happen with the TiO2 prices in the back half of the year? Thank you.","Michael McGarry","David, you know there's been a lot of focus on raw materials in-house. But when you think about it, we have some of our commodities. Most of our commodities are near flat. Maybe one of them is still up, and we have a couple that are trending down. But overall, between that and overall inflation with salaries and everything else, we are still in a marginally inflationary environment. And we still not recovered all the margin from our pre-inflationary peak. So as you heard in my opening comments, we are still progressing with price increases, and we anticipate having further price moving forward.","In regard to TiO2, what I would say is the same answer I gave at the very beginning of the year is that TiO2 is really a non-event this year. And we are going to continue to focus on using TiO2 very efficiently. And our program, as you know has been to optimize our formulation to minimize TiO2 usage. And this year, we are on track again to take an additional 1% out of our TiO2 consumption. So I don't see the trends really changing, you know, there's excess capacity on the sulfate side. And later in the back half of the year you have the chloride plant coming on. So that's why we remain confident that TiO2 will be a non-event.","David Begleiter","And Vince just on buybacks, what were buybacks in Q2? How should we think about buybacks in the back half of the year? Thank you.","Vince Morales","Thanks, David for the question. In Q2, our share count was relatively neutral year-over-year. We did minimal if any buybacks in the first six months of the year except to offset some dilution we did with an acquisition. The \u2013 for the full year, our focus remained on not building our cash position. We have on a year-over-year basis we have an active acquisition pipeline, which Michael alluded to in the opening remarks. That remains an important part of our cash deployment strategy for properties at the right price, create value for our shareholders. Absent that, if we can't execute on those we would look to share repurchase.","David Begleiter","Thank you.","Vince Morales","Thank you, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Roberts from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","John Roberts","Thank you. There's a Bloomberg report about PPG being among others looking at Axalta. I don't expect you to comment on the speculation, but could you just remind us how concentrated the auto OEM and auto refinish markets are maybe just in general terms?","Michael McGarry","Well, I think the way to think about that is that \u2013 the different numbers vary by region and by automakers. So, it's probably inappropriate for us to comment on not just the speculation but actually market share because we could overestimate or underestimate the various people shares. And I wouldn't want to put incorrect information out there, so I probably would prefer to pass it.","John Roberts","It's all right. Sorry, I didn't mean to put you on the spot. In the U.S. DIY retail channels we've had some share shifts first at Lowe's then at Home Depot now Ace. If you look in aggregate at the U.S. DIY retail channels, have market shares in aggregate changed much over the past year? Or just been a lot of shuffling around between different channels?","Michael McGarry","Well, if you go back and look at the space over 20 years, you'll always see some movement as the various retailers try different strategies. By and large I would say that market shares have stayed relatively constant by and large. There's been a little bit of shift here in there, but not that much. More of a rounding there what I would call it.","John Roberts","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Bob Koort","Thank you. Mike I noticed in your heat map that refinish seemed to be in the marketplace a little bit weaker. Is that -- you mentioned accident rates, but is there any function of price hikes and volume patterns of your customer base of the market that has shifted from one year to the next?","And then secondly you mentioned I guess you're lapping some very robust trends in the packaging market that sort of stalled out but you indicated getting back to growth later in the year. Could you give us some more specifics on why that happens? Thanks.","Michael McGarry","Sure Bob. So let's start with refinish. We had a very strong 2Q last year with refinish. There's a couple of very large what we call multiline or people who buy refinish from multiple suppliers. We had a pretty robust 2Q last year with those guys. Then they elected to not purchase in the third quarter. A lot of this is what I call trying to take advantage of the pricing cycle in refinish.","So, from a demand standpoint though we're still picking up share. Our net gains on shops is a nice positive and pricing has been very good in that sector. Claims are down about 2% and totals are up 1% to 2%. So, that puts that negative overall at about minus 3%.","So, our team has just rolled out new technology in Europe on precision metering of refinish products. It's got an excellent traction so far. So, we are looking forward to seeing how that -- since we're very early we just rolled out a month ago we are very, very early in that. But we anticipate that we'll continue to gain share in refinish given our strong water-based technology and the fact that we've converted more shops at water than anybody else -- everybody else in the industry combined.","As for the packaging side, we still have very good technology and we are trialing some additional new technology for the packaging space. That goes -- pack tests are going on right now. Once those pack tests are completed we anticipate that the customers will be shifting some additional business our way, which will be a net positive for us. So that's what we are looking at. Obviously we have to wait till the conclusion of pack tests, but we\u2019re feeling pretty good so far.","Bob Koort","Great. Thank you, Michael.","Operator","Our next question comes from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","John McNulty","Yeah, thanks for taking my question. Look there's a lot of noise between the weather and home sales and I guess the contract that you lost last year. Can you give us your thoughts going forward now that you've anniversaried that, how we should be thinking about the architectural -- the health of the U.S. architectural market and how you're thinking about the next 12 months the overall volume growth in that market?","Michael McGarry","Yeah, John we see that market is growing. This year we would have said 2% to 3%. Given in the challenging whether that we've had, they'll try to pick up as much of that as they can. So we might finish 1% to 2% for the year. But overall our customer still have very good backlogs and they feel very confident. They still are challenged to find enough labor to get all their projects done. But they've been able to successfully continue to win business that trend again from DIY to do it for me. That's going to continue.","So overall we feel like we\u2019re in a good position. Plus as you heard in my opening remarks, we have committed and we are on pace to out-earn in the third quarter what we are making pre-customer assortment loss. So business has been focused on that and they're going to be in a position to start delivering that in the third quarter.","John McNulty","Great, thanks. And then just a question on the architectural EMEA market. It sounds like you're expecting the usual seasonal dip. It did sound like the second quarter was a little bit washed with bad weather. Is there a way if we have a normal seasonal weather pattern if there is such a thing these days that that you could sequentially see stable to maybe even up scenario for EMEA architectural? Or is that too aggressive?","Michael McGarry","Well, first of all we have -- we're going to have positive sales growth because of pricing. Right now through the first whatever you want to call it 17 days, volumes have been more consistent to the prior patterns. But as you know Europe takes August off. And so we\u2019re always hesitant to predict the third quarter until we see how much vacation time all our big painters take and then how they come back. So I would be -- if I were sitting in front of your model right now, I would use the same prediction you've used for years past, but knowing that we are getting nice price gains in that business in Europe.","John McNulty","Got it. Thanks very much for the color.","Michael McGarry","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi. Please go ahead with your question.","Ghansham Panjabi","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. In your slide deck, you basically commented on additional pricing actions for the Performance Coatings segment in the third quarter. Is that specific to any region or business? And I didn't really see same comment as it relates to Industrial Coatings. I guess, are you where you need to be in that business at this point as it relates to pricing?","Michael McGarry","We have positive price in every business in every region of the world. And it's been a positive story now. We've had positive price for nine consecutive quarters. We're still not where we want to be. We've had 11 quarters in a row of inflation, so we still have some catch-up to do. But when I look at our Industrial Coatings segment and our industrial business within that, they're doing pretty well. And so, I'm not concerned. Obviously, the biggest gap is in the automotive piece and that's where we're working the hardest to get prices up. But we still have more traction in all our industrial businesses.","Ghansham Panjabi","Got it. That's helpful. And then, just in terms of the outlook, you commented on 3Q volumes basically mirroring 2Q. How should we think, Michael, about the fourth quarter? Your comparisons are quite a bit easier. You commented on auto dealer inventories in China, for example, as a potential positive. Just as we cycle into 2020, how are you sort of thinking about the world at this point? ","Vince Morales","Ghansham, Vince here. Little early to call Q4, we got to make our way through Q3. But in the back half of -- really in the back half of 2018 we had several key issues that make the 2019 period, make it a little easier from a comparable basis. We did have refinished destocking, Michael alluded to earlier.","We did have just started the customer assortment changes. We will anniversary very shortly the China automotive downturn. And just from a top line perspective, currency has been a negative in the first part of this year and it mutes out in the back half of the year. So we have several things specific to PPG that we think give us some comfort in our forecast.","Ghansham Panjabi","Thanks so much, Vince.","Vince Morales","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Sison from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Michael Sison","Hey, guys. Nice quarter there. In terms of the outlook for the second half of the year, it certainly seems that demand is weaker. Volumes are going to come in a little bit weaker, I guess, than prior expectations. When you think about what has been -- what you've been able to do to offset to that, can you may be frame up, was it mostly the cost savings, the new cost savings program? Are you getting a little bit of price raws? And any other factors that might help you stay on track with your earnings guidance.","Michael McGarry","Yes. So Mike, I'd say, it's everything. With 2.3% price $20 million of costs down, better manufacturing, we pretty much have hit on all cylinders, everything within our control. The team has executed very well on. So we're going to continue to look at that. Volume in a lot of our businesses has been pretty good. Aerospace has had a very good volume quarter. PMC has had good volume quarter. So there are pockets of success. Unfortunately, when you look at OEM-type businesses, they've been a little struggling.","Michael Sison","Okay. And then, a quick follow-up on architecture Americas and Asia Pacific. Your outlook's low single digits for third quarter. Are you seeing -- do you need to see that now? And is it kind of a fluid on a month-to-month basis as the year unfolds? Or is there any lumpiness in that outlook for the third quarter?","Vince Morales","No just picking up what Michael said earlier, we -- there's growth in this market in the U.S. It's been tempered by the weather patterns. Anytime we see decent whether we see a good pickup in sales. So we think there's some pent-up demand there. And we do expect growth in Q3 and a seasonally lighter quarter in Q4, but continued growth. So there's definitely a backlog of demand here.","Michael Sison","Great. Thank you.","Vince Morales","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Frank Mitsch","Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Hey. You had a difficult comp on auto refinish in 2Q. You're suggesting that 3Q is going to be an easier comp due to the vagaries of the year-ago period. So I was just curious so. How should we think about the underlying volume growth and sales growth that you can get in the refinish business?","Michael McGarry","Frank, I still see refinish as a flat long-term market. We are going to get positive price. We are going to work through our water. More people are going to convert to water, which uses less products than solvent. At some point in time China will start to put in regulations. We are the number one guy in China. So when you factor in the solvent to water conversions, you will see some negative volume over a longer period of time. But we don't see collisions changing materially in the near-term. Collision rates in Asia continue to happen. So \u2013 and of course, there's still a growing car park around the world. So this is a great business for us as you know, and we are one of the global leaders. And we are still very excited about this business.","Vince Morales","And just to expand on that Frank, our customers pay for technology. We're part of the leadership in terms of technology in the industry. So as Michael refers to price, we really talk about price\/mix. The whole mix of the industry is moving up reflective of the technology that everybody is bringing to the table. So even though the absolute volume might be down a little bit, the costs per unit or cost per liter is up, because of the mix component.","Frank Mitsch","That's very helpful. And I guess my follow-up will be it's been about two months since you did your strategic review and decided to keep the portfolio as is. I'm just curious in terms of the feedback that you've received from your shareholder base. Is there any color you can provide in terms of the positive or negative feedback that resulted from that decision?","Vince Morales","Yeah. Frank, we talk obviously to a lot of shareholders. Those are conversations we have individually with them. The feedback we look at is what happens in the stock every day in the marketplace. That's what I would reference you to.","Michael McGarry","Yeah. And Frank one other thing I might add back on the refinish question, I should have pointed out. We do have a light industrial piece of that business and a commercial transport. And both of those segments are growing. Of course, they're much smaller than the base refinish business, but those were help offsetting some of the trends we talked about earlier.","Frank Mitsch","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. I was looking at your corporate expense. I think for the first half, its $90 million versus $66 million than a year ago. And I think for the third quarter you said, your corporate expense will be $45 million and maybe last year it was $26 million. So it looks like that through the first three quarters your corporate expense will be up I don't know $40 million or $45 million. What's going on there? What's behind that? Or is it a timing issue and corporate expense in the fourth quarter comes down a lot?","John Bruno","Hey, Jeff. This is John. I think there is two key drivers. One is last year we made some adjustments to our incentive compensation accruals in the second and third quarter. And last year, we had a little bit more favorable pension expense, but based on the different items like the discount rate and consensus data that we have. So, the former is the bigger driver but a couple of things there Jeff that are driving the upswing this year.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. And then for my follow-up the -- your SG&A costs year-over-year were down a little bit both in first quarter and the second quarter. But last year your SG&A really fell pretty sharply in the third quarter. It went from I think something like 9.41 to 8.67 from the second to the third quarter. Is your SG&A going to be lower year-over-year or roughly lower year-over-year in the third quarter? Or does it rise maybe because of the compensation expenses you're talking about? How does the SG&A look year-over-year in the third quarter?","Vincent Morales","Yes Jeff, those two questions I think your first questions are interlinked. Some of the numbers John mentioned are located in our SG&A cost pool, so there's variability in there. Currencies if you look at it on an absolute number basis currency is a big impact to just absolute numbers. So we did have a weaker foreign currency last year so that has an impact as well. We're -- our steady run rate we're adding Q2 of 2019. We expect to be comparable as a percent of sales in Q3. We do have lighter seasonality in Q3 versus Q2 as well so that's not--","Jeff Zekauskas","Sure. Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Vincent Morales","Thanks Jeff.","Operator","And our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Please go ahead with your question.","P.J. Juvekar","Yes. Thank you. So, Michael you talked about China auto inventories coming down and that's a good thing. When you talk to your customers in the OEM market what signals do you get when you look at their production schedules for 2020? Do you think market can grow come back to growth again in 2020 for Chinese auto OEM?","Michael McGarry","Well, I do believe it will be up in 2020. I think it's a little early to call that though. I don't think the trends that we're seeing right now are going to continue. But the single biggest factor in this is the trade war if that's what you want to call it.","People have money in their pocket in China. People are employed. It's a lack of consumer confidence. These -- our Chinese employees themselves they're also looking at the same thing. I was just over there six weeks ago. And the fact of the matter is for major purchases, they are sitting on the sidelines to see how this turns out.","So, the first thing that I'm looking for is a settlement where everybody can move on from the current positions that everybody has staked out. Consumer confidence will flow very quickly because it's not like they have to get people reemployed over there. They are already employed and they are saving money right now in this environment. And so they have a lot of firepower to put to work.","So, I think whenever this dust settle, we will see a pop not too much different than we saw what quarter was it? It was third quarter last year when they changed the tariffs or the VAT. So, I think there'll be a pretty good movement in that.","P.J. Juvekar","Okay. Thank you. And for my second question recently there was a market share change at Ace Hardware and you talked about that a little bit. Was PPG involved in any of those discussions? And then when you lost some volumes at one of your retail customers, are those volumes still available if you get an order? Or do you shut that capacity down?","Michael McGarry","P.J., I don't think it's appropriate for us to discuss specific customers. You should assume that any place there's somebody buying paint that we're actively talking to those customers. From a paint plant standpoint, we did shut down some plants in response to the customer assortment change, but we still have capacity in the marketplace. And as you know ramping up a paint plant sometimes is as simple as adding as another shift running over time. So we are definitely flexible enough to respond to the market.","P.J. Juvekar","Great. Thank you.","Michael McGarry","Thanks, P.J.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Arun Viswanathan","Thanks a lot. Good afternoon. Just a question on the guidance. Last quarter you had mentioned that embedded within your guidance there was a little bit of recovery in China. And, obviously, production rates have continued to lag on the auto side, potentially seeing some continued slowing due to the trade scrimmages. So I guess where do you stand on China? Is that part of the -- what would push you to the seven -- to the upper end of the 7% to 10% of recovery there? Maybe you can just give us your comments there? Thanks.","Vince Morales","Yeah, Arun if you noticed we did talk about the sales guidance being low single digits. I'd see a stretch to get to the bottom end of our prior range on sales. So that's really where we saw the down take. We didn't -- they're up, we didn't experience during Q2.","We do have as we walk into every quarter three, four, five, six weeks of order book in hand for most of our OEM customers not just our auto customers. So we typically have at least early read on what each quarter is going to look like.","We don't -- as Michael mentioned in the opening comments, we don't see a significant uptick in Q3 in Asia or China specifically. So again we lowered our sales guidance for the year. As you would expect from us we're compensating on the cost side to account for the lower sales.","Arun Viswanathan","And just as another follow-up on the raw material side, obviously, there was some deflation in Q2. When you see that flowing through your system? And maybe you could just relate that to the inventories of raws that you have? Thanks.","Vince Morales","Yeah, couple of points therein. One, we're still seeing pockets of inflation. And, secondly, we have to recognize there's still two years of inflation we absorbed. So we still have a lot of catch-up to do on the pricing side and we're going to work through that. Furthermore, if we do see changes in our raw material basket, they have to flow through inventory. We\u2019re getting to a period of the year where, obviously, sales seasonally are going to be lower. So we typically hold on to our inventory a little longer. ","Arun Viswanathan","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Christopher Parkinson","Great. Thanks guys. When you think about your progression back towards prior peak margins just generally, how should we think about your expectations for industrial and performance just towards the end of this year and 2020 just very broadly? I mean what additional levers can you even pull now given the volume environment? Or could you even just pull them harder to get back to this level? Just any key moving parts will be appreciated. Thank you.","Michael McGarry","Chris this is Michael. The levers are going to still be the same. We talked about having more than 2% price in Q3, so that's going to be a positive moderation, and the inflation that's going to be a positive. We're going to have additional cost savings. That's going to be positive.","The teams are working really hard on the manufacturing side. So that's going to be a positive. So, I think, the trend lines that you've seen will continue in that regard. The big challenge we have is, obviously, we needed a lot more price in our automotive business and a little bit more price in our industrial business, to get back to where we need to be. And so, that's front and center.","Christopher Parkinson","Got it. Hey, can you just talk a little bit about more of your performance in aero and how sustainable that is, just in the intermediate to long term? I understand you're obviously doing a lot more than paint in the end market, including, obviously, a growing presence in services. So how should we just generally think about your long-term strategy, versus, let's say, the core growth on the coatings side? Thank you.","Michael McGarry","Well, we expect to outperform industry for quite a number of years in this business. If you look at the segments that we're in, we're leading in coatings. So we're going to be slightly better than the market there. If you look at our transparencies, we've been -- our customer pull on new programs has been quite significant.","And so, we have customers that are asking us to bring them new technology, which they're more than willing to pay for it and that's been a significant win. And then, of course, on the sealant side, our new technology on lighter weight sealants and cure on-demand is going to be trend lines that our customers all value highly and it drives tremendous productivity in their businesses. So they're going to stay on top of that.","And then, for a lot of our customers, because we're so important to them, we provide chemical management services or unique packaging to help their productivity on their lines. And so, we have consistently -- so you look at in this past quarter, the industry grew about 5%.","And we almost grew double digits. We grew double digits to prior quarter and we're going to go somewhere in that double-digit range in the third quarter. So even though this has historically been a lumpy capital-intensive business, this is a market that we're super excited about and we continue to outperform in all the major segments.","Christopher Parkinson","Thank you.","Michael McGarry","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from VRP. Please go ahead with your question.","Kevin McCarthy","Good afternoon. Vince on slide 9, I think, you indicate anticipated cost savings of $17 million to $20 million in the third quarter from your restructuring efforts. My question is, what does the glide path look like in 4Q and beyond as the new program ramps and the older ones are executed upon? Is that a relatively steady pace we can extrapolate?","Vince Morales","Yes. We said 80 -- 70 to 80 for the year, Kevin, for 2019. We're pacing slightly ahead of that right now and that's basis of the old programs we have. We'll pick up a few million dollars in the fourth quarter on our new program. But the new program won't really kick in earnest until early 2020 and there are some longer lead items in there. So by the end of 2021 we'll be at $125 million run rate. So I would assume a linear progression, as we go through 2020 into 2021.","Kevin McCarthy","Great. And then, shifting gears, the text of your prepared remarks indicated that you had some customer wins in Latin America. Can you comment on which businesses those were in and how large they are? I'm not sure if they're material or not.","Vince Morales","Yeah. These are mostly in our industrial segment, Kevin. We have some benefit in our auto business. We \u2013 it's really customer mix. We underperformed in the U.S. We over-performed in Latin America, really serving the same market. But given we give regional outlooks in addition to business outlooks we had to flip between those two regions.","John Bruno","And Kevin just on top of that, this is John. Packaging has been doing very well in South America.","Kevin McCarthy","Did you win business in packaging there?","John Bruno","Correct. South America packaging has been winning business.","Kevin McCarthy","Okay. Thank you very much.","Michael McGarry","And of course Comex continues to win on a daily basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Byrne from Banc of America Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Stephen Byrne","Yes. Thank you. That sealants and adhesive technology that you have in your aerospace business is that suitable to be transferred to one of your other businesses such as autos end markets or construction?","Michael McGarry","So we have sealants and adhesive business in our aerospace, our automotive, our architectural and a teeny tiny bit in our industrial business. We share technology across segments. So when we launched the most recent liquid nails product, it use some of the technology that we had in our aerospace business. And that was a win. We currently have also launched some new products for the U.S. military. And that technology can also be shared across the various platforms. So we routinely share technology across our various business segments.","Stephen Byrne","And then on this most recent cost management program this $125 million program it reads basically three buckets so manufacturing consolidation some trimming of low-margin businesses and then headcount cuts. Can you allocate that program into those three buckets? And were these readily identifiable? Do you see another round after this one?","John Bruno","Steve, this is John. So we are not going to get to that specific level of detail. But these are opportunities we've identified both in continuing to improve our cost structure and inflection of the demand environment that we have today.","Stephen Byrne","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Harrison from Seaport Global. Please go ahead with your question.","Michael Harrison","All right. Good afternoon.","Vince Morales","Hi, Michael.","Michael Harrison","Just a question on the regional pricing dynamics in auto OEM and on the sustainability of pricing there. You had said that pricing has increased in all regions. I believe that was the comment last quarter as well. So how much was pricing up? And if there were any differences from region to region what was driving it?","John Bruno","No, Mike. We have pretty much similar pricing across the regions. You can well imagine, we deal with global customers. And you're dealing with people that are very sophisticated in how they deal with you. So we are getting it across the regions, and across the platforms. And we are getting it with the local Chinese in case that was your next question as well.","Michael Harrison","Okay. And then my other question is related to the refinish business and these lower collision claims in the U.S. I mean is that accident rates coming down? Are we starting to see the impact of collision avoidance system? Any thoughts on what's behind that?","Michael McGarry","Well, really what you have is a plateauing. Collision is driven by congestion which is driven by implement which is driven by miles driven. And right now unemployment has plateaued at let's call it 3.8, 3.7 whatever you want to call it and so that leads to less collisions when it plateaus. And there has been some impact from lane departure and smart cruise control. But you have the negative impact of distracted driving which I hope you're not doing Michael. But overall I would say you should assume a minus one is kind of what you should probably think about in the long-term.","Vincent Morales","I mean again as we said earlier Michael there's a value uplift in this business as it there been for many years as all the participants add new technology. And the technology is definitely desired by the body shops for productivity purposes.","Michael Harrison","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","Duffy Fischer","Yes, good afternoon. First question is just around the delta between inventory -- or not inventory between volume being down 4% and GDP being positive 1% or 2% a pretty big gap. Anecdotally when you talk to our customers are they destocking? Or maybe they're real consumption is running at higher levels in that and so we'll get a bounce back sometime in the next couple of quarters.","Vincent Morales","Yes. Duffy we really look at industrial production not GDP. GDP includes services. So, industrial production is one -- has certainly not been strong in the first half of the year. But more like to the heart of your question we see most of our customers running lean on inventory, leaner than we've seen in the past. Michael again alluded to that in the opening comments. If there is any surge in demand, there might be a little bit of a two stack here not only in the demand surge, but also inventory replenishment. So, that certainly possible.","Michael McGarry","Yes. And Duffy I would say think about the volume more at a two level not a four level because of the customer assortment changes.","Duffy Fischer","That's fair okay. And then just last one quick one Vince. The $1 billion in cash you have now if you found a place to use now how much cash do you need to run the business? How low can you take that cash balance?","Vincent Morales","Well, that's a seasonal question. We obviously are building inventory at the beginning of the year. We run that down in the back half of the year so we need a little less cash on a daily basis. Somewhere between $400 million and $700 million depending on the season.","Duffy Fischer","Great. Thanks guys.","Michael McGarry","Thanks Duffy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Shmois from Longbow Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Garik Shmois","Hi thank you. I know it's early to be looking out to 2020 and thinking about pricing. And you've been very committed to getting price over the last several years. But in slower volume environment, just wondering how long can you keep pushing this 2% or so price cadence?","Vincent Morales","Well I'll start Michael can finish the question here. But we saw our suppliers push price for two and a half years. And we had an amiable demand environment when that occurred. Again we're just trying to catch up maintain the value chain. So, that's -- again we saw it on our -- coming into our front door for 2.5 years.","Michael McGarry","And I would add innovation, our customers are always very willing to pay for innovation. And if you think about the cost of the paint versus the cost to their final product, if we can get one more car to the body shop or one more heavy duty equipment out, we can make the packaging line run a little quicker. Anything like that they are more than willing to pay for it. So that's why we\u2019re so focused on innovation. And sometimes innovation leads to slightly lower volumes but at least a richer mix with higher pricing. So that's also something you should factor in.","Vince Morales","And if could just speak up one, because what we typically do see when demand is a little choppy like it is today, customers are looking for ways for cost savings. And it plays right into the innovation center that we have.","Garik Shmois","I just want to get an update just on paint store openings in the U.S. how that's tracking year-to-date? And what the outlook is for the second half?","Michael McGarry","Yeah, I tried to always get people up this question. For the U.S. it's not the key driver for our business. We\u2019re focused on servicing our customer needs. We have an authorized dealer network. We have our own paint stores. We have our own DIY customers. So for us, we\u2019re doing different things in different markets.","So we add stores in place that are growing like Texas and Florida. And we might be subtracting stores from contracting markets. So for us our store count was relatively flat overall. And that's not a metric that we're a driver of in the U.S. If you want to look at Mexico where we have a 50% market more than a significant share down there, we are driving additional store growth down there. And we are continuing to take share.","Garik Shmois","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Sheehan from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead with your question.","Jim Sheehan","Thanks. Regarding China, you mentioned the unexpected early implementation of China 6 emission standards in large cities. Did you see that impact retail buying patterns at all? Or was that just an impact on OEM production schedule?","Michael McGarry","Well, you do see a little bit of it, because the dealers are trying to get those vehicles off their mark -- off their lots in Shanghai so they don't have to move it to tier three type city. So you did have sales were up I think 6% in June. And sales in July appear to be trending positively as well. But I would tell you that it's hard to parse between how much of that is the change in emission standards versus the actual demand.","Jim Sheehan","Terrific. And then there's some deals in the coatings space announced recently including aerospace coatings. Are you seeing a lot of competition for M&A given the attractiveness of the aerospace market?","Michael McGarry","Well, what I would say is that any asset that comes up for sale in the coatings space always attracts interest. There are some natural buyers. There are people who are consolidators on a continuous basis. And you should assume that when any asset comes up for sale that unless there's an issue with it that's going to trade at a pretty reasonable multiple.","Jim Sheehan","Thank you.","Operator","And our last question today comes from Dmitry Silversteyn from Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in there. A lot of my questions have been answered, but I'd just like to go back to Vince's response to Gary's question on pricing. You mentioned that you've taken price for 11 quarters, when the demand conditions were amenable and we've had strong economic conditions. We're seeing a pretty meaningful slowdown across the globe, when it comes to industrial economy. And if you kind of read the early signs, it may actually gets worse before it gets better.","How does this environment, given that, yes, you are aiding technology, but you're competing against other very competent players out there with technologies of their own, are you -- am I fair in citing that you may be sacrificing a little bit of volume growth to make sure you get the pricing? And that is to the most important part of your strategy in the short term, is to restore your margins through price and then worry about volumes later?","Michael McGarry","Dmitry, that's 100% accurate. We are expecting to get paid appropriately for the technology we deliver. If we haven't been able to get that, we've been willing to walk away from volume. We -- as you saw our volumes in 2018 in architectural Europe were down as we were the only ones out there leading price.","Now that the other parties are up there leading price along with us, volume is flowing back our way. We've always said that, we might get short term penalized for raising the price. But ultimately most of our customers want to do business with PPG. And as soon as our other friendly competitors, if they decide to raise price independently, some of that volume cloud flow back to us and we do see that happening sometimes.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay. That's very helpful. And just a follow-up, just a couple of housekeeping items. In your drill industrial business, you talked about your revenue being down. What was -- there's got to be a price component in there. So what where the volumes in GI down? And then, a similar question on European paint, what was the foreign exchange impact on the European paint business?","Vince Morales","Those are granularities we typically wouldn't give Dmitry. We did say that the segment volumes, I think, were down about 5%, general industrial. Auto is more than that. Excuse me, in our industrial segment auto is more than that. General industrial was less than that. I think, the proxy for currency in our architecture EMEA business would be just euro to the dollar, to get you pretty close.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Got you. Thank you. That\u2019s all I have.","Vince Morales","Thank you. Great. Appreciate it. ","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remarks.","Michael McGarry","Thanks, Jamie. I'd like to thank everyone for their time and interest in PPG. If you have any further questions, please contact our mix relations department. This concludes our second quarter earnings call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded.

My name is Jasmine, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference to Mr. Vince Morales, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may proceed.","Vincent J. Morales","Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. This is Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations for PPG Industries. Welcome to PPG's first quarter 2012 financial teleconference.","Joining me on the call today from PPG are Chuck Bunch, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Navikas, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer.","Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, April 19, 2012. As a reminder, based on our modified quarterly earnings call process, approximately 1 hour ago, we posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on our Investor Center at ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call. We do not read those prepared remarks during this call. During the call, Chuck will share his perspectives on the company's results for the quarter, and then we will move directly to Q&A.","Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the company's current view about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements.","This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. And now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch.","Charles E. Bunch","Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. PPG continued our earnings growth momentum during the first quarter, posting record adjusted earnings of $1.81 per share. This marks the seventh consecutive quarterly record for the company. This 30% increase in our earnings was driven by strengthening sales in the combined Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials segments, with earnings growth in these segments averaging about 25% versus the prior year. In addition, the Commodity Chemicals segment matched its excellent 2011 performance.","Excluding acquisition and currency impacts, Coatings and Optical sales improved by more than $200 million versus the prior year's first quarter. The primary region of improvement was the United States, where all of our Coatings businesses delivered higher volumes. Growth continued in the emerging regions, but was at lower rates and with less consistency throughout the quarter than in the recent past. European activity levels were weaker in most end-use markets. ","Our improved sales also reflected higher selling prices in each Coatings business as we continued efforts to recover inflation absorbed during 2011 and additional, more modest inflation in the first quarter. Our strong focus on cost management also continued during the quarter. And operating margins in all segments, except Glass, improved versus the prior year, aided by our sales performance and our continued operational discipline. Lastly, we purchased 1 million shares of stock during the quarter and ended the quarter with about $1 billion of cash, well above our historical first quarter cash balance.","In summary, our record results in the quarter and excellent performance over the past 2 years reflect the benefits from our broad and global business portfolio and effective deployment of cash. Looking ahead, we have further growth opportunities as demand in some of our larger end-use markets such as Automotive OEM and Architectural Coatings continues to recover. The second quarter is typically our best quarter seasonally, and we expect year-over-year growth in the United States to be similar with the first quarter, coupled with lower regional natural gas input costs. ","We anticipate that growth in emerging regions will accelerate, supported by higher Chinese industrial activity. We expect European demand to remain muted. However, we remain proactive in dealing with these mixed market conditions and are implementing restructuring actions focused mainly in Europe with anticipated cost savings of $0.20 to $0.25 per share in the second half of this year and larger cost savings in 2013.","Finally, we already have a strong cash position. And based on the seasonality of our businesses, our strongest cash generation quarters are later in the year. We expect to continue to deploy cash throughout the year with earnings accretion remaining the focus. ","That concludes our prepared remarks. Now operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A quick question. With regard to TiO2, I know you started the year expecting to be able to reduce your consumption by 4% to 6%, and I guess I'd love an update as to where you stand on that right now. And then as a follow-up, you had mentioned -- I guess you had put out a release recently with a venture with Argex, and was curious as to -- I know in the release, you said it was going to be limited capital intensity for you guys. But can you -- if you can quantify that a bit, that would be great.","Charles E. Bunch","Well, the first question on the metrics around our targets for reducing TiO2 consumption on a per-gallon basis, we said 4% to 6% for this year. If you looked at the first quarter, John, we're between 1% and 2%, so on target with what we're looking for, for a full year reduction or productivity improvement in TiO2 usage. But we're where we said we would be, we obviously have focus teams, a big commitment from our R&D organization and all of our Coatings businesses to accomplish this. So we're on track there. And yes, we did make a announcement with our collaboration with Argex. At this point, we have not made a decision on what will be the full extent of our participation with them. And that could include, among other things, an investment on our part. But we're working closely with them now as they continue to advance the opportunity that they see in TiO2 production.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Chuck, you made the comment that you're expecting the pace of business in the U.S. to show a similar type of increase in the second quarter as it did in the first quarter. And I guess there's a fair amount of speculation out there that the first quarter saw a material benefit from the warm weather, and that was one of the reasons why you saw Architectural Coatings being as strong as it was. And so then that begs the question, was there some move from the second quarter into the first quarter because of weather? But your commentary that -- about pace of growth would indicate that you don't think so. Can you elaborate on that?","Charles E. Bunch","We still feel optimistic, Frank, about the recovery here in the United States. It's a little bit uneven, and I think we continue to receive a collection of data points and not all of which are kind of straight positive. But if you look at some of our markets, our important end-use markets like Aerospace or Automotive OEM, these markets have been very strong here in the U.S., and they continue that way. And I'm looking for a very good year in automotive production here in North America in 2012. On the architectural side, I think we've been open about the fact that we had a very mild winter; that, that probably contributed to some of the improvement that we saw in our architectural or construction-related businesses. I would say that I think there is underlying strength, though, in the market. We've seen the new home, on average, continue to tick-up over 10% from arguably a very low level. The home improvement area, apartments and some of those other end-use markets for Architectural Coatings continue to show, I would say, improvement. So I don't think it's just weather-related. We've argued here about what we think the pull-forward may have been. Most of our guys say, \"Hey, it's probably about 2\/3 or 3\/4 of actual improvement, and the rest is weather.\" I can tell you as we look at the first few weeks of April, weather has continued to be pretty good, and I said we -- I would say we're off to a good start, continuing what I talked about in Automotive or Aerospace or Heavy-Duty Equipment, but also I think we're seeing more, more consistent strength on the architectural side.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. Terrific. And you mentioned in the release the fact that you've got lower natural gas pricing, that it's been helping parts of the company. I was wondering if there was a way that you might be able to quantify what your expectations are there in terms of this gift of lower natural gas pricing.","Charles E. Bunch","This has been the gift that keeps on giving. Normally, we say with our usage that $1 of natural gas cost will benefit us anywhere from $50 million to $60 million, and we have as now burned off all of the hedges after the first quarter of this year where we had a very low couple of percent of the older hedges, the $6 to $8. We're virtually unhedged now, and so we have full exposure here in our North American Commodity Chemicals and Glass businesses to these lower natural gas costs. Now we're not sure that they can continue indefinitely at this. I saw it touching $1.90 today -- an MCF. So those are -- that's a great value for us. It's still in the kind of the middle of the month. So it doesn't -- it's not the final numbers for May or June, but certainly these are attractive, and that's kind of upside earnings potential we see. Vince, did you want to add something?","Vincent J. Morales","Yes, just for everybody's benchmark number, we paid just over $3 in the first quarter all-in for our natural gas. And again, as Chuck mentioned, that included a couple percent of some aged hedges, and those hedges have burned off so that we're naked at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Actually, just a follow-on on that natural gas, Chuck. With the $1.90, have you thought of hedging again or you've had your fill of hedging given the recent history?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, we still talk a lot about it, Don. But yes, we've had mixed results in hedging, certainly. And over the last 3 years, since all the shale gas came on the market, we've -- I think, we've been burned a little bit. Earlier in the last decade, we did benefit when the hedges or the prices ran up. So I think we think about it. We look at the forward months. So it makes some sense in the next 3 to 6 months if you wanted to lock it in. But you do start paying a premium if you go out 4 quarters or more. And I think to some extent, the market still seems to be -- have a high supply-demand ratio. There's talk of the inventories are full. There's not any more storage. But we did benefit, obviously, this year from a very mild winter. So we didn't get much of a drawdown. So I think as we get through the second into the third quarter, we're going to probably talk about this some more and look at it. Now, in the past, as you remember, Don, you'd also try to hedge around the hurricane season because most of that natural gas production came out of the Gulf. That's not the case as much now, but we still have to be sensitive around the winter usage, I think. And longer term, I think you will probably see some gas getting shut in. So we're not sure $1.90 is a going-forward assumption for the next 3 to 5 years. So I think your question is a good one, and we're going to continue to look at it.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","On Chlor-alkali pricing, do you think it's peaked here? We've seen a few initiatives on the caustic side. They haven't gotten much traction. I guess even the chlorine one didn't. And rates are below where they were a year ago with soft Chlorovinyls exports. Is your sense that the next move in ECU pricing could be down here?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, right now, yes, we're seeing the same things that you just talked about. There have been pricing initiatives on both the caustic and chlorine here over the last month up, but I would say that here in the near term, it looks like pricing is stable. We are attempting to get the increases that have been announced, but I would say going into the second quarter here, we're looking at stable prices. If you look at what's going to be happening later this year, I think there are a few variables. So right now, it's a little too early in the year to say how the second half's going to shape up. But certainly, I would say your comments are accurate around stable pricing here in the second quarter, although, I think ourselves and maybe other producers are trying to get some of those increased.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just wanted to talk a little bit about Optical. Obviously, you had a meaningful disruption in Thailand in 4Q. You've bounced back strongly from that episode. How much, if any, restocking benefit was there in the first quarter? And maybe you can elaborate on your expectations for how the year could play out there from a penetration -- market penetration and a profit perspective, please?","Charles E. Bunch","For us, I think there was at the end of 2011, both with some of the uncertainty in the market in the fourth quarter, as well as some of the Thailand situation, I think there was some de-stocking. So in the first quarter of this year, we have benefited, I think, from a return to more normal inventory levels. But as we look especially here in the U.S. and the European markets where we get better and faster market data, I would say there's been a nice recovery. I think the consumer is healthier here in the U.S. market, which is our strongest for Transitions. But we saw good at-market sales improvement in Transitions, and that was encouraging. So it certainly wasn't a case of just a restocking after the fourth quarter. We think that the second quarter is going to be another good one. We think that the consumer is getting healthier here in the U.S., and we're continuing to support the brand and the business at the same level. So we're looking for a good year this year.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then on Coatings, Chuck, you touched upon TiO2 briefly earlier. But if I look at the broader basket of raw materials for Coatings, what would be your updated outlook for cost inflation in 2012 versus 2011?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, we've been saying that we've thought that we may see raw material, full basket, 3% to 5% kind of increases, and that would have included TiO2. And we came in for the year or we finished 2011, I would say, with a little more muted inflation on some of the organic raw materials. We've seen those -- some of those prices move up here in the first quarter on the spot side. Now you look at propylene pricing, ethylene, which we're not quite as sensitive to in some of our Coatings businesses, but you've seen some of the run-up in those costs here in the first quarter on the spot side. So that could lead to some pressure, continuing pressure on the organic side as we go through the year. Right now, I don't know that it's going to get any worse than I told you in terms of our forecast in the second quarter. But the second half, we'll have to see. You see oil prices coming down, but you do have some spot costs here on some of these building block chemicals moving up at least in this market. Now Asia and China, a little different story. Some of these raw materials have come down, including TiO2 in China is lower now. So I think we have -- you're going to have to look at the broad geographic picture here, and you're going to have some puts and takes. But certainly, Asia, with the growth rates a little lower than they have been and prices coming down, Europe with some of the weakness there, you're not seeing as much pressure. So it just depends on the geographic area, but I think overall, the percentages that I gave you are probably in the range.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Now housing starts were pulled forward in 1Q. So 6 months later when that house is ready, you're going to need to paint again, right? So if that's the case, what are your expectations for spring and summer selling season for this year? And last year, Chuck, you've gained some share with your Olympic ONE paint. I mean, do you expect that momentum to continue this year?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, I would say what we're seeing, I think, we're all concerned that maybe how much did we pull-forward into the first quarter. I've described here in the U.S., anyway, that we're off to a decent start here in April. And I'm optimistic that we're going to see some continuing strength here in the housing market in the -- and in the home improvement area as well. I think that's been a pretty consistent story for us. As far as our share gains, we had good volume across all channels and combined with the pricing. We felt pretty good about all of the markets here in the U.S. Commercial construction, at least, the new commercial construction, hasn't been as strong, and that's been impacting our flat glass business. But we feel pretty good through the balance of the year. The new home construction is not the biggest part of the residential market, as you know. It's more tied to home improvement, anyway, both at the DIY and at the contractor level. So we feel pretty good about that, and we're pleased with what we've been able to accomplish with the new product introductions. You mentioned Olympic ONE. We had a very nice start for that product launch in 2011 in the middle of the year. That success appears to be carrying through here in 2012. So we're quite pleased with that introduction and where we are generally in the market and in the channels.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Chuck, you've been vocal about potentially selling the remaining part of your Glass business. Now I was wondering if you have -- if you were to expect any actions in 2012.","Charles E. Bunch","Well, if you look at the first quarter results, they were, I think, for us disappointing in the Glass segment. We have -- I felt, at least, in the case of the flat glass business, here have been fairly patient with the recovery that we're looking for eventually in the broader construction markets here in the U.S. and in the commercial construction market. So absent a really attractive offer that creates value, we're going to be patient and wait for what we think is good timing. We don't need the cash right now, but we are open to listen to opportunities if there are really interested parties in the business -- in either of the businesses in our Glass segment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Chuck, I guess -- the Street normally has a pretty high regard for your ability to keep costs in check. I was a little surprised by the scale of your restructuring savings that you've lined out. Can you give us a little more granularity on where those savings specifically come from? And then also the high component that's in the SigmaKalon Architectural business, I would have thought that was pretty scrubbed down. So maybe a little bit more detail there as well?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, I would say, Bob, that as we've looked at all our businesses in Europe, especially with the weakening conditions -- if you were to go back in time a few years, we bought SigmaKalon at the beginning of 2008. And at that time, the markets were, I would say, relatively stronger at that time, and certainly stronger than what we were seeing in the U.S. They didn't go into the recession as deeply. They didn't have some of the banking problems. And so we felt that we were well-positioned. Yes, we did take some costs out in those restructuring announcements at the -- in the third quarter of '08 or the beginning of '09. They weren't necessarily focused on SigmaKalon. Now with what we see overall in the market, I would say that that's -- there's an opportunity there in that business, in particular, to consolidate further in many of the functional areas to integrate further with the rest of our PPG businesses in Europe. And with the outlook in the market being as weak as it is, we thought it was better to move forward now and do the restructuring that we can do now in -- I wouldn't say in advance of the downturn because we're experiencing that now, but try to get our cost position even better to withstand and hopefully improve on the earnings that you're seeing in this weak market. But if things do deteriorate further, which we're not seeing -- I mean, we're seeing weakness, but we're not seeing a free fall in the businesses there. We felt that we would be better positioned going forward.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","For my follow-up, Chuck, you -- I'm just curious from a board level how you guys think about the stock price and valuation. I mean, it seems like your margins in paint are superior to your paint rivals, yet your multiple's substantially lower. And I recognize there's a commodity chemical element in there, but frankly, your multiples' not much higher than some of those commodity chemical guys. So do you think about this? Do you worry about this at all? And if you do, what's the path to rectifying the problem?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, I've talked about this over the years, and I think that was one of the goals as we focused the portfolio more over the last 4 or 5 years to make sure that we were getting recognized as a coatings and specialty company. And I think by and large, if you looked at the years after the SigmaKalon acquisition and the divestiture of half the Glass business that was at the -- in 2008, I thought that we made significant progress. And we're being, I think, viewed more closely aligned, let's say, to coatings and specialty peers. That gap's opened up a little bit again. We're aware of that. Is it the Commodity Chemicals? I'm not sure because the business is performing quite well. We do have more European exposure than some of our peers. So I would say that we're aware of it. We tried not to look at this thing on a short-term basis and react. I try to let the analyst community, you and your peers, kind of try to educate and guide the market in terms of our company and what we're doing, and -- but we're not unaware, I would say. And I think if it persists, we have opportunities, whether it's share buybacks or further focusing on the portfolio, which we are prepared to do. We've shown we will make acquisitions. We will pursue organic growth in Coatings and specialties, and we are willing to make divestitures when we feel that we have a good opportunity to create shareholder value. But I note -- duly noted, I'm not going to go on a value rant, Bob, but we're aware of the opportunity for us and maybe it's that we have to do a better job here for making sure people understand our company and what we're doing. And I think our performance has been very strong, and we're going to just try to keep delivering and hopefully, that will be recognized.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","When you look at your architectural business and you compare your DIY to the stores -- to your stores, was either one of those groups stronger than the other? Significantly, that gives you some sort of optimism towards housing or just the construction markets in general? Or was it just -- were they equal, I guess, in their year-over-year growth?","Charles E. Bunch","I would say we had, as I mentioned earlier, we had good growth, both overall sales growth and volume growth in all 3 of the channels. That's the DIY, the -- our store network and our independent dealer channel. I would say DIY may have been slightly stronger. But it's hard for us to say this early in the season if that -- what was happening out the door versus some elements of de-stocking and the like. But I would say that foot traffic on all the stores and including the ones that I visit both on our own or our local Lowe's stores, foot traffic's been up consistently, and so we're encouraged that it's broader-based.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great, and then on the acquisition front, I saw that your -- I mean, you know that your cash position is about as high as it's ever been in the first quarter and your share buybacks were lower at least on a year-over-year basis. So does this imply that you have some acquisitions that you expect to complete over the next 6 to 9 months? And if not, would you see a pretty substantial acceleration in your buyback?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, at this point, we are -- we're continuing to look at acquisitions as we historically have. I really can't comment if anything is imminent, but we continue to work the pipeline that we have. We've tried to remain a disciplined buyer and find the right valuations. And I would say obviously, as I have in the past, if we can't find those acquisitions with the cash that we have on the balance sheet, we would accelerate share buybacks through the course of the year. If you look last year, we were around $900 million in terms of share buybacks. We were certainly well below that rate in the first quarter, and so we have some dry powder if, in fact, acquisitions don't materialize. And our organic capital spending, we're not seeing anything out of the ordinary here. So I think we're prudently funding the businesses. Our biggest projects, which were 2 that we did in China last year, the Zhangjiagang resin plant plus the Tianjin automotive coatings and industrial coatings plant in China. Those were our biggest projects last year. They're -- the resin plant up and running, successful. So we think that it's -- we're going to have what I would call a modest organic capital spending profile this year. So we will have some flexibility if we can't find the acquisitions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","In Performance Coatings, 2 of the SBUs there, one auto refinish and the other marine. Marine, just because of what's happening in the boat business itself, was down. Can you kind of comment? Do you think we're at the trough as far as your inputs go into Marine with where shipbuilding is? And then in auto refinish, when your competitors was talking about auto refinish being a little bit weaker, are you seeing that as well? And are you seeing kind of any degradation, I guess, in the quality of that very good business?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, if you looked at the components of -- or the SBU components of the Performance Coatings, I would say for us, the biggest SBU in there, automotive refinish, had a good -- it had a solid first quarter. It wasn't a shoot-the-lights-out quarter. We had pretty good growth here in North America, actually, in Asia-Pacific also quite well. Europe, on the auto refinish side, was a little weaker. But overall, it was -- there was volume growth, and it was a fairly solid quarter, I would say. And on the protective and Marine side, Marine has been one of the businesses we've talked a lot about, especially the Chinese OEM marine building. The first quarter actually wasn't quite as weak as it had been here in the second half. Korea was a little better. The protective side for us here in North America and actually in Europe kind of took up some of the slack. So I would say the protective and marine market was okay. But the real strength in our Performance Coatings, Aerospace had a really excellent quarter, and they are doing very well across all their product lines. And with our inroads into -- with some of these new products in the commercial aviation and the strength of some of our customers like Boeing and Airbus, those guys are doing really well, and doing really well in terms of an operational excellence strategy. So we're really pleased with that business. And also the architectural business in North America is in that Performance Coatings segment. And as we've been describing, they had a very solid first quarter. So it's kind of -- it was kind of mixed, but I would say, overall, there weren't any really weak stories, but some certainly a little stronger than others.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. And then if you just think about kind of the seasonal or normal seasonal progression, January to February to March to April and you look across all your businesses and geographies, are there any that weren't following kind of the normal progression of getting better as each month gets towards summer?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, are you talking about architectural or more broadly?","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","No, across the whole business. So across all your businesses, all your geographies, is there just anywhere that's not following kind of the seasonal pattern of improving as we go along into the summer?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, let's just talk about the regions. I think you've heard from my comments, we're optimistic on the North American market and the U.S. across all of the end-use markets. We're not seeing anything here in the U.S. that's particularly weak. Yes, some are stronger, like Aerospace or Automotive OEM, but Architectural's been good, and a lot of the other industrial activity is also good here. In Europe, there's a couple of markets that are a little better. Aerospace there is quite good. The packaging business has been good, but Europe is weaker in auto OEM, slightly weaker in auto refinish. And our volumes were down slightly in European architectural. They were offset with productivity and some pricing action. So overall, you saw our architectural earnings grow, and the margins were up slightly in kind of an off -- in this first quarter, which is the off season. So Europe was weaker with a couple of segments that weren't quite as bad. In China, a slightly different story. And usually, what we've seen, Duffy, is you come out of January and February, depending on where Chinese New Year falls, then you really see -- you things roar back in after Chinese New Year and in -- certainly in March. In China today, I would say the construction markets are weaker than they've been, so we didn't see that pick up. We thought that consumer electronics, which affects our -- both our fiberglass and our Industrial Coatings segment, those were weaker through the first quarter even given that Chinese New Year effect. Now there's some other segments that we think are okay, Packaging. Automotive refinish was a good business in China, and now we have a little more optimism on China here in the second quarter. We don't think that -- we think that the -- the Automotive OEM market is going to be a little better. We're not looking for a pick-up on the construction side. But we're starting to see some improvement also in consumer electronics. So it's a little out of the seasonal patterns over there. But we do have a leadership change in China later this year. Usually, the government has an impact on economic activity over there, whether it's trying to provide incentives around the infrastructure building or incentives for buying more fuel-efficient cars and the like. And we think we'll see some of that as we go through the year. They're trying to manage this inflationary pressure that they're feeling. You saw some of the movements on the currency as well. So I think China, we're going to continue to watch, but we didn't see anything that was really alarming in the first quarter. Out of season, yes. Second quarter, actually, we're thinking things are going to be a little better, although, the growth rates aren't as high as they have been in the last few years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Chuck, a couple of things. First, on European architectural, do you expect volumes to be down year-over-year in Q2 and Q3? Or should it be more flattish?","Charles E. Bunch","I think the overall market will be down slightly. If you look at -- and then it's going to just depend on the country or the market. But right now, I would say there's probably more countries that are weaker than stronger. So you still have the problems in the Mediterranean countries, where we don't have a lot of participation. Eastern Europe, with the exception of Poland, has been weak. You see markets like France and Germany and the Benelux, which have held up relatively well, I would say, over the first quarter. And we're not seeing anything that's dramatically different as we go into the second quarter.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just on your European restructuring for Coatings, are you walking away from any lower margin business in that process?","Charles E. Bunch","Lower margin business in any of our Coatings businesses or...","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Well, it's tied to the restructuring announcement.","Charles E. Bunch","No, we're not closing. There are no plant closings in Coatings in Europe with this restructuring. And so at this point, we are using this as productivity improvements. We're not trying to shed unprofitable business. If you remember last year, we did lose one customer; not to something that we did, but they -- this was in the U.K. where we had a large customer declare bankruptcy in the second quarter. So that volume went away, and we had a charge in the second quarter of last year, which we don't expect to repeat here in 2012.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just lastly, Chuck, on this Argex collaboration, can you -- what percent of your U.S. TiO2 needs will it satisfy? And can you just frame a potential savings versus current market prices you might realize?","Charles E. Bunch","David, it's really too early in our collaboration. And they're in the early stages. They have ore -- access to ore supplies. They have the beginnings of a process, but I would say we're some time away from having a good assessment on what the volumes or what our relationship is going to be. You're probably, at this point, better asking those questions at the Argex team rather than us at this point.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And lastly, do you expect any impact on auto builds from this Nylon 12 disruption?","Charles E. Bunch","This is an emerging issue for us. We're just starting to talk about it this week with some of the publicity and with some of the things that the auto companies are doing. We had this experience last year around with the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. So it's -- and this is a -- it's not part of our supply chain. So we're not fully aware of all the impacts that this is going to have. I'm a little -- I think I'm learning about it as many of you are and I'm concerned. But at this point, we have no information on what the impact would be and we're following events closely.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Saul Ludwig with North Coast Research.","Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research","In the Coatings businesses, what was the net price versus raw material less spread in the first quarter? Did you get 100%? Where were you? And if you were short, how many dollars short were you? And then how do you see the price ROS ratio looking ahead?","Vincent J. Morales","Saul, this is Vince. For the first quarter, we were very close to parity. Price ROS, I'd tell you, we still absorbed a tremendous amount of inflation last year. And although we were parity for the company, some of our businesses still have some room in order to get pricing to match raw inflation. As we look ahead, as Chuck mentioned, we expect moderate inflation. We are getting select pricing in a few of our businesses in Q2. So I expect we'll again be close to parity, and in some businesses, offsetting some of that absorbed inflation from last year.","Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research","And so just to clarify what you said earlier about ROS, you think for the full year, ROS are going to be up by 3% to 5%?","Vincent J. Morales","That was our first half, and it's probably little too early to predict the second half at this point.","Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research","And then finally, on the cost savings that you're going to be achieving in Europe, will we see the lion's share of that flow into the EMEA segment?","Vincent J. Morales","Saul, in the presentation we had on our website today, it had a detail by segment for the second half of 2012, as well as all of 2013. So we broke our projected savings down by segment for you and your peers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Couple of questions; a lot of them have been answered. But on the Optical business and -- the Optical and Specialty, I should say, business, the strong margin you've delivered, I mean, it's been a strong margin business all along. But I think this is the first time you've seen north of 30% margin there. Was it largely a sort of a clawback from the fourth quarter on the Optical side? Or did you see better demand from automotive and better pricing in volumes on the silicate side? Can you take us through sort of what drove that business performance in the first quarter? And also what -- how should we be thinking about margins in that business, is 30% plus sustainable?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, we would say if you looked within the segment, the Optical business was stronger than precipitated silica business and the Teslin business. Precipitated silica and Teslin had very good quarters. But I would say that if you looked at the improvement, it was driven more by the recovery in the improvement in Optical. And those margins, I would say, have been fairly consistent over the last few years. We had a couple of quarters last year where they weren't quite as strong in Optical, but they were picked up by Silica. So I think in general, we're going to see margins around what we've talked about here. Going forward, I think I described that the second quarter looks solid for both segments. And so I would say we're looking to sustain margins around that 30% level over time, which -- and I think we've been fairly consistent these last few years.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, very good. To follow-up on the comment that you made on packaging Coatings business, I thought -- if I remember correctly, you said that it was a pretty strong business in the quarter. Can you update us on what's going on with Bisphenol-A-free coatings? I know there's been some rulings or postponement of rulings in the U.S. Is there a customer pull developing for this technology? Or customers are still holding off until they get the official ruling from the regulatory bodies?","Charles E. Bunch","I think what we're seeing -- we've been actively developing these products for a number of years. In fact, this is a trend that we've been preparing for, for some time. The regulatory environment is, I think, still favorable for changes, but I think what we're seeing now is more of a pull from the consumers. And the consumer packaged goods companies are more aware of this. I think they view it as an opportunity to engage with their consumers and drive value and positioning in the market. So some of the -- what I would say some of the inertia in supply chain or the value chain over the years has now, I think, changed. And you see the end users -- or in packaging parlance, the fillers -- actively engaged in the qualification and -- of these new BPA-free or BPA non-intend products. And I think it'll be an opportunity for all of the packaging coatings companies to provide solutions, create additional value that will have benefits for the consumer. So I think right now, this is actually a more favorable environment than over the years when we've been developing the products, but really didn't know when or where they were going to be introduced or qualified.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Do you expect any sales this year from this product or not?","Charles E. Bunch","Oh, yes, we have sales right now. In fact, we had sales last year of these initial sales. Obviously, still modest, but we see that picking up. So this is -- these are not just future potentials. We're seeing it right now. And, in fact, many of the exporters in Asia or some of the food producers that bring food into the developed markets as well or -- whether it's in tuna fish or whatever, they're also actively working on programs here. So it is, I would say, it's more broad-based and yes, the sales are there right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Goodnight with UBS.","Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","The -- you mentioned titanium dioxide price increases have slowed down. Presumably, you meant the implementation of the increases, because the announcements sure have not slowed down. Could you comment on the -- how you see the trajectory of that market? I mean, we're hearing that January, February's a bit slow. March has picked up. I mean, Coating volumes are certainly up. Is -- are prices for TiO2 going to reaccelerate?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, that's hard for me to comment on, I think, fully. You'd -- I think the better source is the TiO2 producers. I think earlier in the Q&A, I commented that, obviously, the market here in North America is stronger, including the architectural market. But Europe, as I've been talking about, is actually a bigger TiO2 market and that's been weaker, and the volumes have been lower. And also in Asia and particularly in China, where the volumes are lower we have the Chinese -- albeit sulfate producers for TiO2, quite active. So I would say the pricing dynamics for TiO2 are -- appear to be different depending on the region of the world, and there have been a lot of announcements. We have said that there are probably some increases that we will have to accept in certain regions from certain suppliers. But we are actively in discussions now to try and minimize the impact to our company of what's going on in the TiO2 market.","Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. You mentioned your cash balance and your interest in deploying your cash in accretive efforts. I would assume you consider share buybacks sufficiently accretive at these prices that you would support that. Could you comment on the level of share buyback you're looking at this year? I mean, last year, $1 billion was effectively 100% of your free cash flow. Is it going to be to those sort of levels? Or do you see substantially lower share buyback this year?","David B. Navikas","Gregg, this is Dave Navikas. At the latter part of last year, in December, we had indicated an expectation of cash deployment for share buyback in 2012 in the range of $250 million to $500 million, and that was putting some focus on the acquisitions that we're hoping will develop. And we also indicated that we would see that may be more back-end loaded in 2012 than in the first part of the year. So we're still evaluating acquisition possibilities. And I would still say that, that $250 million to $500 million kind of figure is a good one relative to our expected share buyback activity.","Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. That shapes it. Could you comment just generally on the environment for M&A? Are the evaluations reasonable? Are there sufficient targets out there that seem interesting enough to pursue?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, I would characterize it as there are -- if you look at the 2 acquisitions that we made in Coatings that we closed on in January, one in Europe and a smaller company in South America, now, I would say those are more typical of the opportunities that we see right now. I think there is still more consolidation to take place in Europe. So I think there's potentially more opportunities. But again, as we've been talking about on the call, growth rates are not as good. It's a very weak economic environment over there. So if you do make acquisitions in Europe, you're going to have to extract synergies and the like to justify the acquisition. So again, opportunities over there, but I think you have to be selective because the overall economic environment is so weak. In Asia, I think that things are changing a little bit. Growth rates are coming down overall for the economy and some of these end-use markets, but I'm not sure yet that the kind of the expectations of the companies that could be for sale have changed in view of the lower growth assumption. So I think there may be some give-and-take here if we're going to see completed acquisitions in Asia that we're all going to have to come together on what we think the expected future growth rates are going to be and what that's going to do in earnings. We haven't seen as much activity here in North America. There's not as many available properties, so it's difficult for to me to say. But I'd say Europe because it's weak and Asia because it has been strong, and the people may be a little -- still trying to get some of those values, are going to be where you see more activity.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This is Rob Walker, on for Laurence. I guess, first -- most of my questions have been answered. But just a quick question on what's your expectations for the tax rate going forward?","David B. Navikas","Tax rate is held at 25% in the first quarter as we look out for the year. And I would say that, that continues to be a good value to use as you think about the remainder of 2012.","Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then just on your raw material expectation, I think you said 3% to 5% for the first half of the year year-over-year including TiO2. I mean, with TiO2 prices coming up pretty dramatically, depending on what you guys are seeing, it's somewhere in the range of 20%, 30% or so, I'd imagine -- and with a large portion of your ROS coming from TiO2. I guess what portion of -- what are you seeing falling year-over-year to get to that 3% to 5%?","Vincent J. Morales","Rob, just a quick -- because our architectural business is about 30% of our total Coatings business, architectural is where majority of our TiO2 is consumed. So a smaller profile there helps us relative to some of the peers. We've seen some of the organics come down year-over-year. Inflation, as Chuck mentioned earlier, has been spotty in those organics with oil. That would be the biggest decline.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I had a question. On Protective and Marine, was that a drag on earnings or was it flat?","Vincent J. Morales","It was a 0. As Chuck mentioned, our activity was a little better than we expected in the quarter. So it wasn't a drag or it wasn't a benefit either.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. So from what I take from the comments, it sounds like Protective offset Marine a little bit. And when you think of Protective, it seems like a kind of a lumpy business. So do you expect that ability to offset Marine to continue? Or is it -- or maybe I'm wrong, maybe it's not lumpy.","Charles E. Bunch","Well, the way we look at the global market, it's about half Protective, which is big infrastructure projects or maintenance spending and manufacturing locations, and about half Marine. But that half of Marine is split between the OEM or new builds and the aftermarket. And I would say that the longer-term trends on the Protective side, I wouldn't describe as lumpy. Typically, the most cyclicality that you would get on these segments would be the Marine new build segment, and this is the one that we probably highlighted more over the last 1.5 years because we have -- we were working off a very big backlog. And then after the big recession and some of the declines in global trade and what was happening in the shipping industry, you saw them working through that backlog, and that will -- that's still coming down. And we've seen some of that -- some of those freight, the freighters or -- being replaced by, let's call it, the drillships and things that are more tied to oil and gas exploration and the like. So I would say that protective should have an opportunity if there's a global upturn in infrastructure spending. And certainly, some of the governments like China are spending a lot as is Brazil, as is the recovery here, this whole manufacturing and industrial recovery in the U.S. So all these, I think, are positive signs on the Protective side. And that's going to be a positive and stable growth as opposed to what we still see as some continuing weakness on the Marine new build.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. In your Architectural Coatings in Europe now, you don't have much exposure to Spain and Portugal, which I'm sure you're probably glad about. But I'm just curious if -- and clearly you -- Chuck, you spoke of earlier that you had to have very compelling reasons to look at a property there. But I'm wondering if things have turned there yet to make distressed properties or any properties get so distressed that they are compelling.","Charles E. Bunch","Well, I guess -- I think we're starting to see prices come down in Europe for some of the properties. But again, it's -- you have to make some assumptions about when you're going to see an upturn. Even our Dyrup acquisition, which we think will be a positive one, our expectations for top line growth are limited in that business, and we are trying to develop good plans for synergies and integration with the rest of the business. So we're -- there's a lot of maybe, and could be especially in these Mediterranean markets, distressed properties. And yes, I think we talked earlier on the call about even though -- we think we've demonstrated that our European business is, even in this weaker economic environment, is fine. I mean, we have our earnings growth in our EMEA architectural business, albeit modest, but -- so we think we're going to be fine. But I think some people have been waiting to see how we will perform with the European business that we have. So we're not afraid of Europe. We'll make additional acquisitions if we think any fit. But right now, we are also focused on executing and getting our cost lower. So we'll be fine, regardless of whether things continue weaker or yes, we see an eventual upturn.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Gaji Balakaneshan with Buckingham Research Group.","Gaji Balakaneshan - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","First off, I was just wondering if your thinking has changed at all regarding the chemical business. So is that something that you would consider possibly monetizing or either expanding?","Vincent J. Morales","I think, Gaji, we've said all along that our core business is our Coating and Optical. That hasn't changed in certainly the 7 years Chuck's been CEO, and that's been our strategy: to grow in Coating and Optical.","Gaji Balakaneshan - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And then secondly, kind of an open-ending question, but from the prepared remarks, it sounds like the emerging regions were a little bit uneven in Performance and Industrial Coatings? Can you just elaborate on what you're seeing there?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, I think we've seen some variability in the numbers of the markets. We've talked -- I think we talked about some of the end-use markets in China, and some were pretty good. Others, we saw some more weakness. So I think I commented that Poland was pretty good in Eastern Europe, but some of the other Eastern European countries were weaker. South Africa, not a really big market for us, but we do we have a decent-sized business there. That's been weaker. So it is, I guess, spotty in terms of how the -- these emerging markets or even what you describe as emerging markets. And arguably one of the situations we're watching, although, we don't again have a huge exposure, is Argentina where there's a lot of interaction now going on at the government level with economic policy, and it's one where we do have some concerns as an example. So these would be 4 or 5 examples of yes, things are in general good, but we can find markets, either countries or end-use markets, that have some stress in them or not as consistent growth as we've seen in the past.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, the Q&A session has ended.

We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our first quarter 2018 financial results conference call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. ","Now let me introduce PPG Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.","Michael McGarry","Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported first quarter 2018 financial results. For the first quarter, our net sales were approximately $3.8 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.39. This represents an EPS growth rate of nearly 4% for the quarter. The earnings growth we achieved was despite continuing an elevated raw material inflation during the quarter, which we partially countered with selling price improvements and strong cost management. ","In addition, we continue to benefit from our ongoing cash deployment focus on earnings accretion. For the first quarter, our reported net sales were up almost 9% while our sales in local currencies increased about 3%. Supporting the higher local currency sales were increased selling prices of nearly 2%, marking the fourth straight quarter of improvement over the prior sequential quarter. Total sales volume increased modestly, but were negatively impacted by fewer shipping days in the first quarter 2017, lower European architectural coatings volumes due to harsh winter weather that caused several days of store closures during the quarter and lower U.S. architectural DIY coatings sales volumes. ","In addition, we passed on some business this quarter as we pursued higher selling prices and have prioritized margin recovery. Foreign currency translation was favorable as several key currencies strengthened against the dollar, with sales favorably impacted by approximately $200 million and pretax income favorably impacted by about $25 million. We expect a slightly less favorable impact in the second quarter. Looking at some of the business trends in the first quarter, our Industrial Coatings segment delivered solid organic sales growth of about 2%, which included a 200 basis point improvement in selling price from the previous quarter. Organic sales volumes at packaging coatings were up mid-single digit percentage as the adoption of our INNOVEL interior can coatings products continued and selling prices increases were achieved. ","We also continue to grow sales volume in general industrial and specialty coatings and materials, delivering our ninth consecutive quarter of above market growth rate, driven by strong sales growth in the Europe and Latin American regions. In addition, the general industrial selling prices gained notable traction in the quarter. Automotive OEM coatings sales volumes were flat consistent with the global industry automotive builds. We continueD to outperform the market in Latin America due to new business we received in prior years. In China, our sales volumes were modestly lower and in line with the overall industry, which was expected following the December expiration of the tax subsidy that was previously available in the country. ","We anticipate China automotive builds growth both for the industry and PPG to improve in the second quarter. In the Performance Coatings segment, aerospace coatings had high single-digit percentage volume growth led by above-industry performance in U.S. and Asia Pacific regions. Automotive refinish grew organic sales by mid-single-digit percentage supported by above-market performance in Europe. Architectural EMEA sales volumes were down in the quarter, as I mentioned, impacted by fewer shipping days and harsh winter weather. This business has progressed their selling price initiatives working to counter raw material inflation during the quarter. ","Sales grew a solid mid-single digit in Latin America with contributions from our Mexican PPG-Comex business, Brazil and Central America. During the quarter, we opened an additional 45 stores in Mexico and Central America. Sales volumes in architectural coatings Americas and Asia Pacific were flat and sales organic growth in the U.S. and Canada company-owned stores were offset by lower DIY and independent dealer network sales volumes. Our company-owned stores delivered their strongest quarterly growth in over 4 years on an adjusted day basis. Our PPG timeless products continue to be added to more Home Depot stores and had good in-consumer pull through the quarter. ","Protective and marine coatings sales volumes were up -- excuse me, were flat compared to last year with solid protective coatings sales driven by Asia, offset by moderating weakness in our aggregate marine coatings sales volumes. Shipbuilding orders in Asia continue to increase, boosting the prospects of a recovery in the marine coatings in early 2019. This will begin to add 8 paint sales volumes later this year. From a regional perspective, sales volumes growth was the highest in Latin America driven by a market outperformance in the Industrial Coatings segment and strong architectural coatings sales volumes. Sales volumes were slightly lower year-over-year in Europe. A solid mid-single-digit percentage increase in the Industrial Coatings segment was offset by lower sales in the architectural coatings EMEA segment. ","We anticipate that the industrial business will continue to deliver growth in the second quarter as regional industrial production continues to remain favorable for a broader, continued economic recovery. Sales volumes were flat in the U.S. and Canada in the first quarter. Strong sales volumes in our aerospace coatings business and solid organic sales growth in automotive refinish, general industrial and packaging coatings were offset by lower automotive OEM sales volumes, including the decline in regional industry automotive production. ","Sales in the Asia Pacific region were flat with prior year as we experienced softer demand in China as our customers had a longer shutdown after the Chinese New Year. We expect stronger sales in China during the second quarter, led by higher automotive OEM demand. Sales volumes in India grew by low teen digit percentage with broad-based contributions across many businesses. From an earnings perspective, our first quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.39 was more than 4% improvement versus the prior year. Our earnings were impacted by elevated raw material inflation in the first quarter that while impacting most of our businesses had a heightened impact on the business on our Industrial Coatings segment. ","In the first part of the quarter, epoxy resins, which is a key input for automotive OEM and packaging coatings, increased by more than 40% due to production curtailments in China. In addition, elevated oil prices impacted solid base raw materials and logistics costs. In aggregate, raw material inflation was about a mid-single-digit percentage increase in the quarter, which is on top of raw material inflation we incurred in the first quarter 2017. We expect raw material inflation to continue in the second quarter of 2018, but expect increases to current inflation levels to moderate. ","During the first quarter, selling price initiatives gained momentum with our most significant sequential improvement since the current cycle of raw material inflation started a year ago. Noteworthy are the gains realized in our Industrial Coatings segment, which achieved 200 basis points of sequential improvement. We are continuing to work with our customers on further selling price initiatives focused on offsetting this persistent raw material inflation. In addition, we are making more progress in our efforts on raw material efficiency with more expected as we progress through the year.","In addition to selling price initiatives, we are partially mitigating raw material inflation through continuing cost management. We reduced selling, general and administrative cost by about 140 basis points compared to last year, including good progress from our business restructuring actions. We have raised our targeted restructuring savings now to between $50 million and $55 million in 2018 from our prior guidance. ","In addition, earnings per share benefited from an ongoing cash deployment actions. This includes the impact of our repurchase of $600 million of PPG stock in the first quarter. In the quarter, average diluted shares outstanding were 3% lower versus the first quarter 2017. Our effective tax rate was 23.5% in the first quarter, which is lower than the 24.9% rate from the first quarter 2017. The reduction mostly relates to the tax reform legislation that was implemented at the start of 2018. We are still anticipating a full year tax rate between 23% and 24%. ","As we look ahead, we still expect continued positive momentum in overall global economic growth. We are closely monitoring and evaluating the possibility and ramification of new tariffs. Currently, we do not see a significant direct impact to our company, but any disturbance to free trade would be concerning. Specific to our business, we still expect better growth in housing starts in the U.S. during 2018. We believe the U.S. regional automotive industry builds will be relatively flat year-over-year. In Latin America, we anticipate continued economic expansion of South America, in particular for Brazil. Growth rates in Asia are expected to remain generally consistent with 2017 with continued industrial production growth in China. We expect stronger automotive build growth rates in the second quarter based on lower inventory levels and easier prior year comparisons. We expect economic expansion to continue in India after a strong first quarter.","Economic growth in Europe is expected to continue, but remain varied by subregion and country. Favorable end-use market trends are expected to continue, particularly in automotive OEM coatings as industry build growth rates are expected to remain positive. We will continue to manage all elements of our business within our control to ensure that we remain competitive regardless of economic conditions. We will continue to execute on our 2016 restructuring program focused on reducing our overall cost structure. As we announced this morning, we will be launching our highly rated Olympics stain products in the Home Depot during the second quarter. Olympic has been America's most trusted stain brand since 1938. We're very excited to expand our relationship with the leading do-it-for-yourself retailer in the world. We will work closely with the Home Depot to optimize its success. ","As mentioned in our earnings press release based on a change in customer assortment that we experienced in the first quarter, we are further evaluating our cost structure and will be diligent to and execute on any opportunities to reduce cost, which is what you'd expect from PPG. While we do this, we will not forgo our efforts and investments to continue our growth initiatives, including targeting certain growth spending in the second quarter with plans to spend an additional $5 million. ","Finally, we remain in a position of strength as we ended the first quarter with over $1.4 billion in cash and short-term investments, which provide us with significant financial flexibility. We remain committed to deploy a minimum of $2.4 billion of cash in 2018 on acquisitions and share repurchases as part of our previously communicated target to deploy a minimum of $3.5 billion in 2017 and 2018 combined. Our acquisition pipeline remains active. We plan to continue to repurchase shares in the second quarter. ","This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And now Jamie, would you please open the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question today comes from Ghansham Panjabi from R.W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi","I guess, first question on North American pain stores and the mid-single-digit increase during the first quarter. How does that parse out between volumes and price? And just given the ongoing weakness in independent dealer channel in the share shift in the home improvement channel, how are you thinking about your store footprint, I guess, more broadly in terms of incremental investments there?","Michael McGarry","Well, we had nice volumes and we had positive price, is the way I would describe that. We opened seven new stores in the first quarter, and that was despite, as you know, weather in the north continue to be exceptionally challenging as we closed the month of March. So I was quite pleased with our store performance.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay. And I guess, second question as it relates to your comments on raw materials. I think you said mid-single-digit increase in the first quarter and some level of moderation as the year unfolds. But crude oil prices are up quite a bit. The curtailments in China have been in place. I guess, what's giving you confidence that you will start to see that moderation as the year unfolds on the cost side?","Michael McGarry","We still anticipate mid-single-digit increases. We will have increases in the second quarter and continuing. I think what we see, first of all, certainly, oil is up significantly year-over-year. So that's not going to change. Propylene is up in all the three regions, and that's up sequentially as well. Ethylene is the one thing that is down. So I guess, I'm trying to put it in perspective that Q4 was a very large number, Q1 was a very large number and we're going to continue to see significant numbers, but maybe not to the exact same significant increase that we saw in Q4 and Q1.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Parkinson from Credit Suisse.","Christopher Parkinson","When we think about the Industrial Coatings segment specifically volumes, can you just take us for a quick walk-through to your comments on general industrial packaging versus your expectation for auto, not in the first quarter, but how you see '18 evolving and into '19? And then also just what's the best way for all of us to think about your ability to achieve price in the segment, once again, by end market versus last year?","Michael McGarry","Well, let's start with price because I think that's a really positive story. We had price in every single of our businesses without exception. We also see price coming in the second quarter as well in every single one of our businesses. So the traction has improved significantly because. As we have said, we're prioritizing price over volume. And that message is clearly received by the entire team in PPG. When you break it down into the various sub segments of industrials, so I'll take the Industrial Coatings first. Heavy-duty equipment continues to perform well. Electronic materials is a positive. Coil is a positive. Transportation is a positive. Our coating services business, because of all the wins they had in Mexico, they're doing well. So the one area of negative, of course, is wood. China is shifting from people painting in the houses to painting in the factories, and that has as a change in -- where it's happening in the marketplace as far as the channel that the product is being sold. So that's the one negative. When you look at packaging, that's been a continued success story for us. ","Our new INNOVEL technology has been positively received and we're really pleased about that. OEM coatings, again, you have to break that down into regions. So the U.S., we went into the year thinking the U.S. volumes would be slightly down. As you saw, March SAAR was very strong at about $17.5 million. The one caveat would be Europe even though we see Europe being up, registration in Europe were more modestly down. Year-to-date, they're flat. But we still are very optimistic. We think it'll be up probably 3% in Europe. And Latin America will be strong, as you know, plus our share gain in Mexico. And then I was pleased when I looked at China. For March, inventories are in very good shape there. Dealer inventory and the lots are in good shape. The OEM inventories are in good shape. And March sales were actually up about 3%. So I think that's going to be good. Of course, India had an outstanding month.","Vincent Morales","And if I could add, Chris, the expectations in China for the first quarter were modest, as Michael mentioned in the prepared remarks. We were coming off a tax incentive that we believe pulled some business in the 2017. So we were again pleased with March stepping up after, again, a brief pause.","Christopher Parkinson","That's helpful. Can you also do a quick walk-through of your EMEA architectural business, specifically walk through in Europe. I'm assuming France is still weak. But what about the Benelux, U.K. and Central Eastern Europe on a sequential basis? Just any comments on growth and the competitive landscape would be helpful.","Michael McGarry","Yes, so the Benelux did pretty well. Got to remember, Benelux is a market that has a lot of exterior painting. So the fact that we had such tough weather in March is part of what dragged that down. But when you look at the underlying backlog of our customers, it's still quite good. Retail Europe is by far the biggest concern. Retail Europe is down high single digits. I'm sure you've seen some of the reports from some of the folks in that space. We did get a little cautious on the U.K. We saw some early signs of Brexit, but it's hard to parse out the Brexit versus the fact that they had snow in England, which never happened. So I think that's part of our concern. When you look at some of the Eastern European countries doing pretty, what I would -- I'd say hanging in there, they were more impacted by weather than anybody else. And then you come back to France as a country, our trade business did very well, actually, in the first quarter, but it was offset by the weakness in retail. So no recovery yet for France as a country, but we are in pretty good shape as far as the business.","Operator","Our next question comes from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets.","John McNulty","With regard to the volumes, you had indicated there was some pressure around pricing where you were walking away when they weren't taking the pricing. I guess, could you articulate how much of the volume impact that was in the quarter?","Vincent Morales","Yes, John, this is Vince. Again, in several of our businesses, we saw marginal volume that we had, we thought we've had booked or had booked that with a lower price, went to somebody else. It's not quantifiable, but we definitely anecdotally and qualitatively saw that happen in several of our businesses.","John McNulty","Got it. And then just as a follow-up. Your corporate and legacy line. I think their original guide had been for $220 million to $240 million of kind of an expense this year. And I guess, you've revised it to a $175 million to $190 million. I guess, what are the major takeaways on that, that are -- that it's getting it as low as it is? I know you had been working on cost cutting all along. So that was -- I would imagine, that was partially in the original guide. So, I guess, what's the big change there?","Vincent Morales","The two biggest things that have lowered that number since we can provide any guidance. Number one, we did receive a revised actuarial information from our pension plan. I think, as you know, John, we've done a lot of work over the past three or four years to help immunize our pension plan and as actuarial information, which we do received periodically, but we received it after our original guidance. And it was a big factor. And also, we made some structural changes to our retiree health care, OPEB programs, that are rolling through. That's a pay-as-you-go process.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Roberts from UBS.","John Roberts","Could you talk about the range of price increases that you achieved sequentially? I'm guessing packaging coatings was up the most given the epoxy situation and perhaps the increases were minimal in weaker areas like European Deco or U.S. DIY?","Vincent Morales","John, we typically don't get into details by business. We did provide in the prepared materials the information by segment, which is our traditional reporting protocol. So I'd ask you to just refer to that.","John Roberts","And then I thought last quarter was a record quarterly repurchase rate for the company and now this quarter is 50% higher. How do we think about the pace of buyback as you complete the cash deployment targets?","Vincent Morales","Well, I think as we've said many times in the past, we don't provide our pace or type of cash deployment from quarter-to-quarter. We use a multitude of factors to determine what we're going to do with our cash, and those include our acquisition pipeline. And so we still are committed to the $2.4 billion for this year on both acquisitions and share repurchases and we'll honor that, but we won't give the cadence by quarter or type.","Operator","And our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.","Daniel Jester","It's Dan Jester on for P.J. So if I look at the heat map in your slide deck, it seems like there's a couple more end markets which you logged below market growth in this quarter, packaging in Asia Pacific and a couple of businesses in EMEA. So is that related to some of the business that you walked away from because of margins? Or there's something else going on those markets that we should be aware of?","Michael McGarry","No, you hit the nail right on the head. As you can imagine, epoxy prices were up significantly. And we were raising price, and we wanted to get value for the market-leading technology we provide. And if we didn't get it, we were aggressive in saying then see if you can find your coatings needs from somewhere else.","Daniel Jester","Okay. And then logistics cost is something that's come up a bit, not just for yourself, but for other players in the industry. I'm wondering, is there anything that you can do with regards to your own production plan to help optimize or limit your logistics cost? Or is that just another line item data that eventually you need to pass longer customers and get them to pay for?","Michael McGarry","Well, we are always looking at our manufacturing footprint. That's a constant item. And so we are looking how we can continue to optimize that. But as you know, especially here in the U.S. and it's not just the U.S. had problem, but there is less trucking availability and availability of trucks on a short notice is also a challenge. So if you need something short then you need to pay more or you don't get it. So that's a challenge for us. But as you know, that's not nearly as big a promise to what we have with epoxies, emulsions, TiO2 and some others.","Vincent Morales","But we are working on our customers on both of these categories with respect to selling price.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from VRP.","Kevin McCarthy","Would you comment on the timing of the rollout of Olympic stain across the 2,000 stores at Home Depot and perhaps characterize the size of that when as you work to backfill the foregone sales at Lowe's?","Michael McGarry","Yes, Kevin, I think it's up to Home Depot to tell you when it gets in their stores. What we did put in the release is that we are shipping and it will be a second quarter event. So that's a real positive. The other thing is how quickly they responded within two days of the announcement from the other big box retailer. We were in Atlanta mapping out plans jointly. And that was a brand that they valued for a long time. And jointly, we're going to work very hard to make this a success. So I think the way to think about the overall sales dollars, though, is when you think about any big box, pain is always bigger than stain and Home Depot is always bigger than Lowe's. So I'll let you kind of do that. Now what you have to remember is there was product already in Home Depot, and so they'll have to work their way through that product and work their way into ours. So there is some of that timing issue that you'll have to factor in. So our sales in 2019 will be significantly bigger than 2018.","Kevin McCarthy","And then as a second question, I wanted to come back to your price contributions. You've seen some nice acceleration there over the last couple of quarters. Michael, as you look at the balance of the year, do you think you can sustain this level of price contribution for the overall company, accelerate from here? Does it tail off at some point because you get to harder comps? How should we think about the cadence of those contributions this year?","Michael McGarry","No, the traction is getting better and we will have more to come. You have to remember, we typically like to be 6 to 9 months behind the raw materials. We're a little bit later than that now. So we have more to catch up. So we're still, even with the nice traction, we still have to do a better job in this area. And so you're going to expect to hear us talk more about price gains in the next quarter as well.","Vincent Morales","Kevin, you're right. Back half of the year of 2017, we did see some modest price traction. That went back to year-over-year numbers. But on absolute basis, we're continuing to pursue higher pricing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank Mitsch","Let me ask Kevin's question a different way. Where do we stand right now second quarter to date in terms of price increases that you've been able to achieve relative to Q1?","Vincent Morales","Frank, our expectation is that's going to be higher year-over-year than we saw in Q1. So we again, we saw in Q1 1.6% selling price increase. Again, everyone of our businesses where we think we'll be tracking higher in Q2, we're not going to quantify that. But again, it should be higher than we saw in Q1 on a year-over-year basis.","Frank Mitsch","All right, terrific. That's helpful. And then I did notice your net debt-to-EBITDA went up to 1.5x at the end of Q1. Where is your comfort level? Where should we be thinking about your targeted leverage ratios?","Vincent Morales","Yes, Frank, Vince again. Yes, we did borrow approximately $1 billion in Q1. We like the interest rate at the time when we borrow that all in. It's about a 3.6% interest rate. We certainly have a lot of financial flexibility and a lot of balance sheet capacity. As an industry and as a company, the coatings industry can support a much higher leverage ratio than we have today and we're not going to put a quantification of that. But if we find the opportunities, we will certainly exercise the balance sheet within reason and our only biggest criteria would be to remain investment-grade.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter","Michael and Vince, when will selling price increases fully catch up to these higher raw material costs, which quarter, is it Q2, is it Q3?","Michael McGarry","I think the back half of the year, David, is probably the most likely scenario. As you know, this is not a perfect science. Every day, every sales rep in the world for PPG is talking about price and has their own deliverables on that. But I would definitely say the second half, the last half of the year is it.","David Begleiter","Very good. And Michael, just on volume after the soft numbers in Q1 for variety of reasons. Can we get back to, let's say, 2% volume growth in Q2 year-over-year do you think?","Michael McGarry","So as I told you on the fourth quarter call, the 3%, we don't want to draw a line, use the one data point. We saw the one less selling day in the first quarter, so we were trying to be a little cautious. We obviously did not predict the tough weather. April hasn't started out very well from a weather standpoint in the U.S. So that will have some moderation on it. But the customers all have strong backlogs. When we talked to our big contracting customers, they really are bullish on the year. So I would say that we should be closer to your number than our first quarter number.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Evans","This is Chris Evans on for Bob. Just wanted to check in and see if you're seeing in different product categories that your peers are as committed as PPG has been to pricing. Any specific product categories or maybe you're not seeing the same disappointment that you guys are expressing.","Michael McGarry","Well, I think the only way to answer that question is our comment where we said that we'd walk away from some business. So every company has to make their own independent decisions. And so PPG has made their decisions. And you probably are better off asking our peers about their own independent decision.","Christopher Evans","Great. And then maybe just talk a little bit about the product line rearrangement that happened earlier in the year. Maybe just if you could deconstruct maybe what happened there, it seems like that came as a bit of a surprise. And then I'd be curious to hear opportunities where you might be able to shift those architectural gallons that we haven't seen yet. And then maybe lastly as part of that, do you expect the Home Depot new product launch to be EPS positive in this year? Or is there any additional costs associated with that?","Vincent Morales","Yes, Chris, Vince. I'll try to take at least the first part of that question. With respect to the customer assortment change, I'd simply classify that as a customer -- the customer made the decision that we certainly were disappointed with. But certainly, any customer's decision to select our product or somebody else's product and if you need any more information, you certainly would need to inquire with that customer. I think your last question, Michael is going to answer the middle one. I think your last question on Home Depot is certainly, our intention is for that to be accretive in Q2 and in succeeding quarters. As you know, Q4 is a light quarter, especially for stain. So that one, we'll have to see what the customer pull through is as we will in Q2 and Q3. But given the volumes in Q, we expect hopefully to achieve in Q2 and Q3, we'd expect that to be accretive.","Michael McGarry","Yes. I think as far as the volume, I think, I covered that earlier. Home Depot is 100% behind this. And you'll see when they start to put in the store the type of assortment and type of highlighting of the product. But again, that's really for them to comment on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Jeffrey Zekauskas","There was $15 million other income net benefit in the quarter. What was that?","Vincent Morales","Jeff, we had about a $7 million charge last year for one of our legacy items for a plant we no longer operate and haven't operated for quite some time. And we had a -- we had an equity investment that started in Q2 of last year. It may have been early Q3 that had equity income. Those 2 items combined comprise the delta.","Jeffrey Zekauskas","Okay. Second, you've been trying to raise prices in the industrial area for roughly a year and you're now up 1% and you have rising raw material cost. They're rising much faster than 1%. Can you diagnose what happened in Industrial Coatings that's really led to the slowness and successful price realization?","Michael McGarry","Jeff, I think that really boils down to several factors. The first one is people have got to see that it's sustainable raw materials and maybe last year-end, they weren't thinking that it was quite as sustainable. So that may have affected how some people are thinking about that. The second thing I would say is we had some of our peers who had publicly stated they were going after volume. So that naturally impacts the ability to get price. And then, third, our industrial customers are very large and very sophisticated and it has historically worked this way every time. We get price in industrial after we get price in the Performance Coatings segment. The good news is we're starting to get it in every business, that includes automotive. And that also includes the very large OEM industrial customers as well. So I'm disappointed it's taking this long, but the pace of which is coming is apparent and the teams are doing a much better job.","Operator","And our next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn from Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Just revisiting the European situation particular with respect to paint. If you sort of exclude the impact of weather, and obviously, it's been a big problem for the region in the first quarter. How would you sort of characterize the overall market fundamentals with respect to construction spending, remodeling activity? Anything going on there that the weather elements have hit in the first quarter that should become more apparent as we get into the mid of the painting season?","Vincent Morales","Hey, Dmitry, Vince. Again, I think you classified it properly. Our visibility on a lot of that is fairly opaque given the weather situations. I think the one trend Michael called out which was visible throughout the quarter was lower -- the lower retail sales and especially in the home centers throughout the region. So that's the one item we can say we have some comfort is the trend. And we also did see just some generally lower in the U.K., not paint specific, we saw some generally lower retail overall sales, which again maybe the early or middle effects of Brexit. But beyond that, it's really hard to decipher what's going to occur throughout the paint season.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay. In terms of the Olympic product that you're getting into Lowe's, I mean, into Home Depot. It's good to see that you guys are able to benefit that quickly from the fill-in in the second quarter. One of the businesses that Home Depot lost obviously was interior paint -- interior stains as well. Is there a kind of -- sort of future announcements possibly coming from you in Home Depot on that? Do you have a drop-in product? Or is that something that you're working on? Can you give us some visibility or perhaps something that we can look forward to?","Michael McGarry","Well, I can't give you any visibility on that. Obviously, Home Depot is very interested in having competitive products. They were and continue to be the largest seller of interior stain and they fully expect to be, in the future, the largest seller of interior stains. So they've set that objective and how that plays out in the future when we have that clarity, we will be happy to share it with you.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Got it. And then final question, just on the overall automotive OEM market. It sounds like we're getting a little bit better results out of China and the U.S. SAAR as you mentioned, were perhaps a little bit stronger than expected. Europe is expected to grow. As you look at the business right now for the balance of the year versus how you look at it at the beginning of the year, would you say that your overall sort of impression of what the industry growth would be has gotten a little bit better? Or is it still fairly kind of low to no growth environment?","Michael McGarry","No, I would say I'm marginally more positive. But whether you're going to be able to pick that up is -- whether that's going to be material or not is not known. But I would tell you, it's put a nice, solid floor on anything that may happen. So I would say I'm marginally more positive.","Vincent Morales","And Dmitry, just as Michael mentioned earlier, we're pleased with the inventory positions in the U.S. The industry inventory positions in the U.S. and China coming into what is typically the highest selling seasons in the U.S.","Operator","Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays.","Patrick Fischer","First one is, can you just shed a little bit of light on the accounting issue in your comfort level that kind ring-fencing it at that small $5 million level?","Michael McGarry","Okay, Duffy. So first of all, I'm so thankful that this was brought forward as we are finalizing our earnings report. As you know, at PPG, we hold ourselves to a very high standard of business and professional conduct. Our reputation for being ethical and respectful company is a competitive advantage. We believe it's our responsibility and commitment to ensure the long-term success of our company. And that benefits all our stakeholders, whether it's customers, shareholders, employees, suppliers or neighbors. We take this matter very seriously. We're conducting an investigation concerning these potential violations. The Audit Committee is comprised of independent directors of the company's Board of Directors, and they're overseeing it with the assistance of outside counsel. We're not able to predict the timing of the outcome. All I'm saying is that the investigation is ongoing. I'm sorry, I can't provide any additional information at this time.","Patrick Fischer","No, fair enough. And then second one, the Ford City judgment that hit a couple of papers yesterday. Is that meaningful? And if it is, what's kind of the timeline of how that will play out?","Michael McGarry","Well, first of all, the judge said that the other party was not responsible. So that's the first thing. So that was what the court case is about. Second, we have been working with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection on this issue for 10 plus years. We are in very good shape with them. We have a very good remediation. And we have, I would say, as far as you and as an investor were concerned, this will not be a meaningful issue.","Patrick Fischer","Okay, perfect.","Michael McGarry","And the other thing I'd say is our current actions are protected with the Human Health and Environment, just to be -- so everybody is clear.","Operator","Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander","Two quick ones. First on the general industrial and packaging outlook comments, where you say it's similar to Q1 in terms of the year-over-year volume growth. If Q1 had the tough comparisons in Asia, what is the comparable offset that makes Q2 similar to Q1? And secondly, in terms of productivity, where do you still see areas for significant products [indiscernible] gains given how many years you've been pushing staff on that?","Vincent Morales","Yes, Laurence, I'll take the first one and I think Michael will probably take the second one. I think i heard you your question was with China -- hard comp in China in Q1. I think it was actually coming out of Q4, we expected softness because of a buy ahead, as the tax incentive expired, I would say Q2 last year was a traditional quarter. Q4 of 2017 was the one we thought there will be a buy ahead. So again, I would say the comps for Q2 in automotive China would be normal.","Michael McGarry","And Laurence, in regards to your question about cost. As you know, this is a never ending quest for PPG to get more efficient. And so we're always looking at our manufacturing footprint. As you know, we have gotten other acquisitions in the past 12 months. And so that means that there's other labs that are overlapping, other plants that are overlapping. So we'll be working hard to get those things out. So I don't think that we're ever going to stop in this area. So and plus I think we will be looking at how we reposition our architectural U.S. business with the announcement of the customer assortment change that was detailed earlier in the quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews","Maybe you could just give us an update on what you're seeing out there in the M&A environment. I know you guys have your eyes on a variety of things over the years. Is there anything changing about those conversations with those targets? I'm going to assume based on the size of your repo in the first quarter, that you're not close on anything material. So just thoughts on where all that sits would be helpful.","Michael McGarry","Yes. So the biggest challenge we have right now, Vincent, is the fact that when you're trying to buy somebody who's earnings are going down, they want to look backwards to what they were doing 12 months ago and we want to look at either what they're doing today or what they're going to do in the next quarter. And they want to get paid on what their business used to be. And of course, we're going to be the ones that will be improving it. So I would say the conversations right now are a little bit more challenging. We have a very healthy number of people we're talking to. In fact, we had a new one flying in last week. So I would tell you that the pipeline is still there. But as you can see by our Q1 response, we're going to moderate our, I mean, our purchases of shares basis our pipeline. And we've always preferred acquisitions over share repurchases. So we're going to continue to look hard at acquisition. But if we can't do them, then we'll buy back stock.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. And just a follow-up on the logistics cost comments from earlier. I might have missed this if you commented on it before. But is trucking a part of the issue of what's going on with driver hours and things like that or is that not -- is it just fuel expense?","Michael McGarry","No, it's trucking. A, it's availability. And B, when they don't show up then sometimes you have to ship LTL to keep your customer going. Because we have so many customers that run just in time. So then that ratchets up the cost to serve that customer and during that period of time because of the lack of availability. So you have two factors going on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Sison from KeyBanc.","Michael Sison","EPS growth was up in the first quarter, and it sounds like your general economic outlook is positive. Pricing is starting to take some place. So when you think about EPS growth going forward, does it get better in 2Q? And to what degree? And trying to gauge your confidence in generating better EPS growth this year versus last year in total.","Vincent Morales","Yes, Mike, as you know, we don't give guidance, long-standing practice of ours. And I'd tell you that the elements to look out for as we go into Q2, we try to give you some anecdotal information on which is we're still seeing raw material inflation. We hope to offset a little more of that with price. The volumes in architectural, as Michael mentioned, leased early in April are more reminiscent of March than they would be off a better weather season. And other than that, emerging region growth looks good. So I think we're hoping a higher volume number, as we said earlier, higher price number, but we're still battling with inflation.","Michael Sison","Got it. And then it sounds like that you may still have to walk away from some volume in 2Q to get some of the pricing. And is that the case? And what would the impact be on volumes if you do have to continue to do that?","Vincent Morales","Again, I'll reiterate what Michael says that our priority is margin recovery. I would say there will be no more incremental impact than we saw in Q1 in the second quarter as we continue to work with our customers on pricing. And again, I think we'll see the same situation where certain customers will move to a lower price without us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets.","Arun Viswanathan","Just a question, if I could, on that same question I'll ask a little differently. Do you expect to be kind of caught up margins in industrial maybe Q3 or Q4? Or are you still going to be lagging year-over-year?","Michael McGarry","I think it'll be hard to get there in Q4, but that's currently our target.","Arun Viswanathan","Okay. And then in the past, I guess, you had mentioned that potential inflection point could be improvements in Europe, and that will be maybe the best opportunity for you guys to start growing again. Maybe you can just help us understand if that's still the case and any other kind of signpost that we should be looking for as to see an improvement or anticipated improvement in your businesses?","Michael McGarry","Well, I think when I walk around the world with some of my commentary, Mexico, even with the challenges with the election, is still going to be a good market for us. We saw Brazil getting better. That's -- so Latin America is going to continue to grow. You saw that China GDP number was 6.8%, if I remember right. It was a good, solid number. So that's a positive. I talked about India being up basically double digits. And so another positive, obviously, would be if we could get this whether behind us and look at our industrial businesses as well in Europe. I mean, we dropped 35% or 40% of any sales growth in Europe down to the bottom line. So I would say that Europe still has a very positive outlook and we're well-positioned with our customers, and the team is performing well in a difficult environment.","Vincent Morales","And I'll just append to that, Arun, that we did see -- we did continue to see in Q1, even despite again some harsh weather conditions, very solid growth in our industrial segment in Europe. And as we said many times in the past, typically, the segment that leads a region into growth. So we still remain optimistic, but that's a potential outcome in the near future.","Arun Viswanathan","Great. And then just last one, if I could. Just on the M&A side. Understanding that the businesses want to get full value for potentially depressed earnings. I mean, do you think that could change? And if not, why not get more aggressive with price on some of these deals? I mean, if M&A is the preference because it would seem that from a long-term perspective, the M&A still probably is a higher return on capital use of that than buybacks?","Vincent Morales","You're exactly right, Arun. We will be as aggressive on price as the outcome of the return dictates. We want to be prudent with our acquisitions. We are preferential on them when they have a good return and we're not preferential on them when they don't. So again, I think we're going to be prudent, but I do think you hit the nail on the head with respect to what we're looking at, which is what's the return on the potential acquisition itself, which would certainly be dictated by the purchase price.","Operator","Our next question comes from Don Carson from SIG.","Donald Carson","Question on architectural. Last year, TiO2 was your raw material that went up the most. This year, it shifted more to industrial side. But, A, do you still see TiO2 growing up of this year as much as your mid-single-digit overall raw material basket increase projection? And two, if you look at TiO2 and emulsions, is there a need for a third price increase in your U.S. company stores to keep margins growing?","Michael McGarry","So let's take the TiO2 question first. Supply and demand is what drives TiO2 pricing. And I would say that, clearly, when people report all their earnings across Europe and other place, you'll see that demand will be weak, in our opinion. And so we're going to be fighting for rollover type pricing in TiO2 because we think that's reflective of supply and demand. So we'll wait and see exactly how that all turns out because, as you know, we fight the last day on any price -- taken any price increase. But as far as emulsions, that's driven by a number of factors, propylene being the biggest one. And sequentially, we see that it's likely to be heading south in this regard, which should lead us to an opportunity to try to get some lower pricing in that regard. It's too early to speak that way, but that's certainly our expectations. As far as needing more price, I will tell you that we're aggressively capturing price within that segment now and we haven't gotten everything we want to date. So let me focus on getting that done first.","Donald Carson","Then, Vince, a housekeeping follow-up. You mentioned an accounting change the last -- on the last call that would hurt gross margins by 50 to 100 basis points. Did that turn out to be the case? And would you expect that to be recurring for the full year?","Vincent Morales","Yes, we adapted the new guidelines with respect to revenue recognition. Those numbers are still valid, Don. And again, that's adapting the new GAAP guidelines.","Operator","And our next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America.","Ian Bennett","This is Ian Bennett on for Steve. Do you expect SG&A expense to decline or increase in 2018?","Vincent Morales","Well, again, our first quarter, we were down 140 basis points in SG&A. We continue to be very active in controlling our costs. As Michael alluded to earlier, we're assessing situation with the customer assortment loss and we'll react to that as well. So I think our projection would be for that to continue to be lower. I won't give you a specific number, but we're definitely working on productivity initiatives, as Mike alluded to earlier.","Ian Bennett","Okay. And just a follow-up on the gross margin. Did I hear that correctly that gross margin, the expectation is for not positive year-over-year growth until the fourth quarter or 2019?","Vincent Morales","I think the question that Michael answered was around the industrial segment margins. And those are the ones that would be challenged until certainly the latter part of the year. If you look on the gross margin basis, I think we are off around 300 basis points. Our goal is to get that up closer to neutral. As we go into the earlier part of the back half of the year, the Performance Coatings business, where we were able to achieve pricing earlier, would help prop that up faster than the Industrial Coatings segment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Harrison from Seaport Global Securities.","Michael Harrison","You saw a really pretty good growth in company-owned stores in North America during the first quarter. Can you give a little bit of color on what's been driving that? And maybe address if company-owned stores become a little greater focus in light of the change that you've seen in the customer base with the big box retailers?","Michael McGarry","So this continued improvement in our company-owned stores is multiple factors. The biggest one, though, is the fact that they're are more do-it-for-me people. The baby boomers are aging. And therefore, they're asking people to do their work and then you have a lot of the younger folks who never learned how to do it. So they're getting it done for them. So that's the biggest trend. So the company-owned stores are winning in that space. The second one, of course, is we've done a lot of improvement in our stores. So when you think about the rebranding initiatives, the customer initiatives, those have all been a positive, our ability to deliver more timely basis. That's been a positive. So there's a lot of underlying activities in that regard, and we did open up seven new stores in the Q1. So it will continue to be a focus area for us.","Michael Harrison","And then you announced the -- a price increase for auto OEM customers in the Americas in mid-March. I was wondering if you can just give us some color on how those negotiations are progressing with customers and how you guys are seeing the competitive environment in auto OEM right now?","Michael McGarry","Well, I've never seen a time where the competitive environment in auto OEM was anything but fierce. You have super sophisticated customers and the benefit is they clearly see the inflation. There's no denying the inflation is there. We've worked ourselves through a number of gates, if you will, with these folks. And so we are getting traction. And so what I'll tell you is it's been good for us to get additional price increases out there in the marketplace and we are getting price. So you should expect to see more in the future.","Operator","And our last question today comes from James Sheehan from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","James Sheehan","Mike, could you evaluate your efforts to reaccelerate organic growth? How effective has your rebranding and other initiatives been?","Michael McGarry","Well, the rebranding has been very positive. You can see -- again, this quarter was the best quarter we've had in our stores in more than 4 years. That's been doing really well. Also, the branding that we've done overall in PPG has helped us in a number of areas. So I'm pleased with that. The clarity on which brands and which markets has helped as well. So overall, I would say I'm pleased.","James Sheehan","And on raw materials, you gave some color on several of the different raw materials. Just wondering on epoxy resins in particular, do you think those prices have peaked yet?","Michael McGarry","Well, I'd like to say the answer is yes. A lot of that will depend upon some of the plants that were forced down in China in Q1, how quickly can they get up and running, are they able to run the rest of the year or will China be diligent? I think China will continue to be diligent in their enforcement actions. And so I think we're going to have a period here where we're in pretty good shape. But then I think on, as we move into winter, you will see China again continue to very aggressively enforce the environmental regulations.","James Sheehan","Great. And what's your read on the U.S. paint season thus far?","Michael McGarry","Well, disappointing. I wish I had a magic wand that could get rid of all the snow. I mean, even in Pittsburgh, we've had 2 snow days this weekend and April 19. So -- but our customer's underlying book of business is strong. Every painter I talked to would like to have three more people painting for them. So the housing market is good, all the underlying demand is good. They want to be painting. So it should be a good year. And you can see the stores, even in spite of this weather, did quite well. So I would tell you, I'm still optimistic.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, at this time, that will conclude our question-and-answer session.

Please also note today's event is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. John Bruno. Sir, please go ahead.","John Bruno","Thank you, Jamie, and good afternoon, everyone. Once again this is John Bruno, Director of Investor Relations. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our third quarter 2017 financial results conference call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information released today Thursday, October 19th.","In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, all periods present the former Glass segment as discontinued operations. About one hour ago, we posted detailed commentary and accompanied presentation slides on the Investor Center of our Web site ppg.com.","The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call, and provide additional support to the opening comments Michael will make momentarily. Following Michael's perspective on the Company's quarterly results, we will move to a Q&A session.","Both the prepared commentary and the discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the Company's current view of future events and the potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance.

For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC.","Now, let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.","Michael McGarry","Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported third quarter and year-to-date 2017 financial results. Our net sales for the third quarter were approximately $3.8 billion, up more than 3% year-over-year and our reported earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.52. This quarter was filled with a lot of emotion and many operational challenges due to the number and severity of natural disasters that many experienced. I would first like to thank our employees for their commitment and support they provided and continue to provide. We will continue to support our impacted employees, their families and their communities as they continue to rebuild.","Turning more specifically to our results in the quarter. Our sales growth of more than 3% was driven by improving sales volume and favorable currency translation. Currency translation, which has been unfavorable for quite some period of time, reverted to favorable in the third quarter and is expected to be so in the fourth quarter based on current exchange rates. Regarding our sales volumes, I'm encouraged by the pace of growth in July and August before the hurricanes and earthquakes and by order book in the first few weeks of October.","Our overall year-over-year Company sales volume were up nearly 1% in the third quarter, including about $25 million of unfavorable sales volume impact from natural disasters. Industrial Coatings segment volumes improved by about 3%, while our performance coating segment volumes declined by about 1%. The performance segment realized most of the unfavorable sales impact from the natural disasters. Before the natural disasters, we were tracking about 1.5% of sales volume growth in the quarter, higher than our volume performance in the first half of 2017.","Let me quickly discuss a few specific business unit performance trends, where we're tracking both above and below the market. In the third quarter, general Industrial Coatings business growth again exceeded the rate of global industrial production, continuing a multi-quarter trend. Also, volumes returned to mid single-digit percentage growth in our packaging coatings business, stemming from increased customer conversions to our new technologies.","Our U.S. company-owned architectural stores once again grew same-store sales at mid single-digit despite the natural disasters, marking seven consecutive quarters of sequential volume improvement. Of note, during the quarter, we're pleased to have launched PPG Timeless, a new premium stain and new interior paint brand into the Home Depot, and we'll work to drive customer adoption of this new product. This includes some additional growth related marketing spend in the fourth quarter.","That being said, demand overall U.S. DIY paint market has remained soft throughout the year. During the quarter, our sales volume in architectural coatings EMEA were below market, while certain parts of our business remained solid, such as the UK where we continue to outperform the market. Demand in certain other important countries to PPG, such as France, remains weak. Also, we turned away certain business in the region due to either low profitability or lack of customer acceptance of selling price increases.","As I previously said, buying growth remains one of our key focus areas for the company. While I'm pleased with some of the measurable progress we have made, we continue to work on a variety of initiatives to accelerate our growth rate. From an earnings perspective, our reported EPS was consistent with our prior year adjusted EPS. The recent natural disasters reduced our third quarter EPS results by about $0.05. This was the result of raw material inflation, higher transitory logistics costs and impact to reduce sales volume.","In the third quarter, we made initial progress to begin recover our margin. Our contribution margin compression was lower year-over-year in the third quarter than it was in the second quarter. Specifically, in the third quarter, our contribution margin was 160 basis points lower than the last year's third quarter and would have been 130 basis points lower, excluding the natural disaster impact. Higher than expected raw material cost inflation was the largest drive of margin compression.","Our basket of raw materials were up mid single-digit percentage year-over-year, pacing much higher versus our expectations at the beginning of the year. The main causes continue to be various supplier force majeure issues in Europe and additional supply driven production curtailments in China.","Selling prices were up modestly versus the prior year with additional pricing secured for the upcoming fourth and first quarters. We continue to work with our customers on additional selling price initiatives, focused on further offsetting the persistent inflation. We now expect the current level of raw material inflation to last through the fourth quarter and anticipate inflation to continue, but at lower rate in the early part of 2018.","We are working with our suppliers to mitigate the increases and have also expanded our research, resources and efforts on another wave of raw material efficiency projects. We were able to mitigate some margin compression with overall productivity improvements through the aggressive manufacturing and overhead cost management. Through the acceleration of some of our actions from our restructuring program we announced in 2016, I now expect restructuring will benefit us by more than $45 million in 2017, which is towards the upper end of our initial target range.","In the third quarter, we completed the sale of the North American fiber glass business. This is a transformation milestone for the Company, and it completes the combination of our multi-year strategic shift in our business portfolio. The gross sale proceeds were about 540 million with the net after-tax gain recorded in discontinued operations.","In the third quarter, we purchased about $250 million of stock and on October 2nd, we finalized the acquisition of The Crown Group, a coating services company. Including The Crown acquisition, year-to-date we have spent about $725 million toward our multi-year target of $3.5 billion to be deployed on acquisition and share repurchases.","Looking ahead, we expect to remain in a modest overall global economic growth environment. Demand in the fourth quarter is seasonally lower historically and we anticipate normal seasonal trends this year. We expect recent favorable end use market trends should continue in refinish and aerospace. Additionally, we expect our general industrial growth to continue to outperform solid global industrial production and similar results in the packaging coatings industry.","Architectural coatings volumes in the U. S. are expected to remain mixed by distribution channel. Protective marine coatings volumes are expected to be positive globally aided by growth in protective coatings and very modest declines in marine volumes. Our U. S. automotive OEM coatings business is expected to return to at market performance in the fourth quarter, coupled with continued PPG outperformance in other major auto producing regions.","We expect our architectural EMEA sales volumes to remain mixed, sequentially with improved quarterly results in Northern Europe adjusted for seasonal trends, but offset by continued subdued end use market condition in certain countries including France, Italy and Spain. Finally, the automotive OEM and general industrial coatings business in Asia have a difficult fourth quarter comparison as sales volumes grew at low double-digit percentage pace in 2016.","One unknown entering the fourth quarter relates to the China tax subsidy on certain small engine vehicles. Last year, the subsidy was originally scheduled to expire at the end of 2016, but was extended at a lower subsidy rate. This subsidy is now slated to expire at the end of 2017. But any change in this could impact fourth quarter demand in a favorable or unfavorable fashion. As always, we have included additional segment and regional details in our presentation materials.","Also, for the fourth quarter, we expect additional transitory impact stemming from natural disasters. Specifically, raw material cost inflation and modest unfavorable sales impact, mostly from anticipated lower Mexican and Puerto Rico demand. We expect these have an unfavorable impact to our fourth quarter EPS of about $0.05. Finally, we will maintain our aggressive focus on cost management, and we will have also reduced our projected capital spending target for 2017 to be approximately 2.5% of sales to reflect the subdued growth environment.","To summarize our results, we delivered solid business results despite a variety of external factors, which impacted our sales, operations and supply chain. We're now beginning to deliver on margin recovery. We delivered excellent performance in many of our businesses, including continuation of an improvement in volume growth on pre-natural disaster basis. Going forward, we remain focused; first, on increasing prices in a collaborative manner with our customers to recover our margins; and second, on improving our sales volume growth trends, including continued focus on deploying technology and our technology advantaged products.","We ended the third quarter with $2.3 billion in cash. Our acquisition pipeline remains healthy. And we will continue to repurchase shares in the fourth quarter. Just as a reminder, we remain committed to deploying a minimum of $3.5 billion on acquisitions and repurchases in 2017 and 2018 combined. As a result, we intend to deploy an additional $2.8 billion of cash by the end of 2018. This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, thank you for your interest in PPG.","And now, Jamie, would you please open the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we'll begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Ghansham from Panjabi. Please go ahead with your question.","Ghansham Panjabi","Michael, you gave us some good insight into the fourth quarter in terms of term line. But as we cycle into 0'18, I guess, how are you thinking about the overall macro first off and then the related outlook for some of your major end markets?","Michael McGarry","Ghansham, I think 2018 will be somewhat of a repeat of 2017, volumes modest up in the majority of the markets. So if you start with automotive, the biggest wild card there is China, but I think China is going to grow 2% to 3%, that'll take up the global market in that 1%, 2%. I think the U.S. will be the one market that will be under pressure. Industrial production should be relatively decent. Obviously, you're going to have heavy duty equipment improving at a faster rate. So that's always good for us.","And then we're going to continue to have good adoption of our packaging business. So I think that's a real positive. I think from the refinish of steady eddy, you're going to have aerospace slightly up again the Boeing and Airbus have great backlogs, I just wished I would figure out how to make a few more planes each month. And then I would say architectural. We've been pleased with the pace in architectural. We see that growing 2% or 3% next year. So that's kind of a walk around the various businesses.","Ghansham Panjabi","And then maybe a question for Vince on the fourth quarter just in terms of the operating income year-over-year. Should we expect an improvement there year-over-year, or will that be difficult just given some of the higher raw material costs and also the residual disruptions from the hurricanes and earthquake? Thanks so much.","Vince Morales","Ghansham, as you know, we typically don't give guidance. I think for us we've worked to try to close the margin gap. I think you'll see additional margin recovery in Q4 on a year-over-year basis, similar to what we in Q3 versus Q2. And the key factors there again would be additional pricing, still stubbornly persistent raw materials that probably ticking down seasonally a little bit. And then again we'll see normal seasonal trends in most of our businesses.","Operator","Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer. Please go ahead with your question.","Duffy Fischer","Michael, I guess, question for you on the raw material side. Seems like a couple of quarters in a row that we've gotten a lot more dispersion geographically in the direction that raw materials have moved. Is that something that will normalize over the next couple of quarters? Is it just opening up some of your own transportation lines to move stuff around geographically? Or should we think about that is being structural going forward?","Michael McGarry","Well, I do think there is some structural piece of that, especially in China. If you've noticed in the last couple of months in China, they have been exceptionally focused on enforcing environmental rules, which is really positive, not just for the environment but also positive for us. With our water based technologies, that's a great place for us to be. And the fact that they're cracking down on dangerous goods warehouses, they're cracking down on plants that are in non-industrial parks, are not in chemical zones we think that's a positive for us.","So there will be more upward raw material inflation in China. We've had a lot of force majeures in Europe. Europe has historically been a place that operates very well. So I don't think, I think that's a more of a transitory impact. I don't view that long-term. And obviously, the hurricanes in the U.S., this is the first major hurricane that hits the U.S. in 10 years. So I'm not a weather forecast, I'm not going to predict anything. But historically, I view that also as transitory. So the only real place I see structural is China.","Duffy Fischer","And then on the back on the comment, does that mean if your raw materials are going up because some of the competitors are getting squeezed out or shutdown. Will your prices go up meaningfully more in China than they will other parts of the world, because again some of your competitors may not be able to sale products or people might have some mixed shift up to your higher quality water based products?","Michael McGarry ","Well, I would describe it this way Duffy. We would always expect and we currently have margins in Asia consistent with our margins in the rest of the world. And so, if we have additional raw material inflation in China, we would have to have additional raw material recovery in China. So, I would not expect the material impact. We would -- obviously, as you know, we lag getting price, but I would not expect that to be a long-term issue. So for us, I would focus more on the fact that if they continue to enforce the rules, there will be more water based products and that technology is with the limited subset of suppliers that will be good for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","David Begleiter","Michael, you've had very good success this year in the U.S. you finished. Can you remind us again what the drivers are of that success, and from whom you're taking business from?","Michael McGarry ","So the main drivers in refinish first and foremost is miles driven. So year-to-date miles driven are about up 1.5%. The next is collision or think about it as accidents. And higher employment leads to more miles driven leads to more congestion, more congestion leads to more accidents. And of course the real phenomena we see now is distracted driving. So this is a market that historically with flattish but we are doing well in this area. I would just say that given our strong technology base and our strong customer base, we\u2019re probably nibbling and getting a little bit of share from everybody. But overall, I would say, it\u2019s more driven by technology. Our water is the best in class.","Vince Morales","And David, if I could go back, if I can just add. We think this has historically been a very modest growth market in a developed region, that\u2019s continued. We haven\u2019t seen any changes in pattern with our customer base. And we haven\u2019t seen any changes in pattern in terms of the industry itself.","David Begleiter","And that was more of a next question. Michael, is there still real pricing power less than we finished? And again, no change in your view in terms of distributors exerting more pricing pressure, or MSOs is there a more pricing pressure? Thank you.","Michael McGarry","No, I doubt. I would tell you, it\u2019s still a highly fragmented market. I mean, if you grew out this MSO consolidation over 20-year period, you might could extract something. But there is so, I would say, it\u2019s not material in any near-term pattern. So it\u2019s not something we\u2019re worried about. We have positive price in refinish this year, and we would expect that positive price in the business next year as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Bob Koort","I was going to ask around the raw material side. I guess, some of us thought the TiO2 is going to go up throughout the year, so I am guessing that hasn\u2019t surprised you. Can you talk about which specific raw materials have seen that unexpected inflation, so that we might take a guess on what to give you some relief next year?","Michael McGarry","Yes, I would say the first one that was most unexpected was the emotions. So if you think about them has been a problem. Outside of the U.S., ethylene is down in the U.S. but everywhere else in the world, it\u2019s up. I would say that was probably not on my radar screen, given the significant ethylene expansions in the U.S. Obviously, there is more coming-on. So hopefully, there will be some relief there. I would tell you, TiO2 is up more than we expected. I\u2019ve cautioned some of the TiO2 suppliers, don\u2019t forget 2011, where they -- there was demand destruction.","So that has been my focus on that. The other thing that I would say is a little bit of surprise is packaging. So if you think about tin plate and steel, I think those things were probably a little bit higher than I would have expected. So we had low-single-digits in our plan and we\u2019re in the solid mid-single-digits now. So those would be ones that I would focus on.","Bob Koort","And Michael, can I ask you on the architectural markets, looking at both the U.S. and in Europe. In the U.S., this deviation between do-it-for-me and do-it-yourself seems pretty pronounced. Is there historical president for that different direction that persists? And if not, which you think happens is do-it-for-me in your stores numbers coming or does DIY market finally get some lift? And then maybe a similar question in Europe, I generally think of paint is being a very consistent end market and yet it sounds like either the market is not doing well or maybe you\u2019ve got some competitors that tolerate some pressured margins, which doesn\u2019t seem sustainable. So maybe just an appraisal to markets and what you expect? I think you said volumes will be good next year, but we expect may be on the price or margin side going forward.","Michael McGarry","Well, Bob, we normally allow only two questions, and that\u2019s like seven.","Bob Koort","It was all about architectural. That doesn\u2019t count as one.","Michael McGarry","I\u2019d say the big driver in the U. S. is two factors. One is unemployment, so you have low employment and so people would rather pay somebody to get it done. And the second one is baby boomers are getting older and the millennials aren\u2019t paying as much as their parents. They are not a DIY group as much as anybody else. So I would say that\u2019s the U. S. I think that\u2019s going to continue. We see real strength. I mean even our October order book in architectural has been -- has started out real well. So I think that\u2019s going to continue. I don\u2019t see a change in the unemployment situation. So we\u2019re all good there.","I think the difference between Europe and the U. S. now is the U. S. is a very much a branded market and Europe has way too much private label. I think the European big boxes have really aired in the way they\u2019ve gone to market. If you look at the average price of the paint in Europe versus the average price of the paint in the big boxes in U. S., it\u2019s clear that the U. S. big boxes have a different strategy. They are executing it very well. In Europe, there\u2019s not been a trend to branded. And that brings in significantly more competition. It also brings in, on a regional basis, a lot more folks.","So I think that\u2019s the big disconnect. I do think there are people out there still chasing volume. We\u2019re not going to chase it at this point of cycle. We see people trying to trade down. We\u2019ll let them trade down. We\u2019re trying to recover margins and that\u2019s been our focus. If you look back 2007, 2011, the last two raw material inflation cycles, we were first to get margins back. We think we\u2019re going to be in that top quartile again. And we can\u2019t control what other people -- how they make their own independent decisions on how to price.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Christopher Parkinson","Can you just talk a little bit about pricing trends across your various industrial platforms, such as auto, general industrial packaging? And just give us any broad expectations you have regarding the time line to recapture price costs, or maybe even achieve net price real longer term, if that\u2019s the theme? I think most of us understand that there\u2019s probably differences in contractual nature and distribution between the various inputs. But just any broad comments would be really appreciated? Thank you.","Michael McGarry","Well, I think the broad comment is we have very sophisticated customers in automotive, as well in the large industrial segment. These guys not only are sophisticated, but they have set up what I would call choice in their distribution or paint networks. And that allows them to move people in and out in some small segments to allow them and put pressure on their suppliers. And what you need to do is have faith that your technology makes it difficult for them to do that. And I would say it takes us longer to get price in those segments. But we do recover it. We already have pricing in those segments today. It will start to pick up a little momentum in late in the fourth quarter, early in the first quarter.","And I would tell you in the packaging area, probably the bigger driver on the pace of getting the packaging is that there was consolidation in the major packaging players. And so they were focused on trying to get their synergies. And so you have that trend going on at the same time as new technologies. So we were pushing the new technologies and there might have been some other folks that didn't have the new technology that we're trying to hang on to buy in using price, and that's probably the biggest differentiator in the packaging that's different than normal where historically in fact everybody was pushing the same technology. Now, you have some certain players that are very strong in the BPA nine and 10 and some of the others that maybe don't bring that same new technology to the table.","Christopher Parkinson","And just can you talk a little bit about some of your comments in EMEA architectural, specifically how you expect the volume headwinds to persist? And whether or not your price comments pertain broadly to the lack of acceptance among your customer base? Or is there more functionality of bad behavior among some of your regional competitors? Thank you.","Michael McGarry","I hate to throw our friends under the bus, so I won't do that. I think everybody makes their own independent decisions. And in this regard, we are very much focused on delivering margin recovery, and it's margin first, volume second. We have some very good markets. We're growing share in the UK. We're hanging in there in the Benelux. French retail has been a very challenging environment. We're doing well in Scandinavia, growing share up there. I would say Eastern Europe is more of a free for all and we have been actively pushing price aggressively in our African stores and our African countries.","And so it provides that mix-bag, if you will. But right now, bottom line is we yield a little bit of share in order to drive profitability. I regard these as transitory. If I look back in history, we've done this in the past and once this transitory period is over, we will not have lost any share in that regard. And good strong performing products always win in the marketplace long term, and we feel good with our product portfolio.","Operator","Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Frank Mitsch","Michael, for the first of my seven questions, I was wondering you're clearly making progress on reducing the margin compression year-over-year. You said it was 210 bps in the second quarter, 160 bps in Q3, or would have been 130 ex the hurricane. At what point, do you believe you're going to stop talking about year-over-year margin compression and start talking about year-over-year margin expansion?","Michael McGarry","I think, Frank, if I look at history, we're probably first quarter second quarter next year. I'd like to say it's first quarter. But I don't want to set unrealistic expectations. The fact of the matter is this is top of mind. We have a very experienced coatings leadership team, deep experienced in this area. Many of our leaders have been around through multiple cycles. And I think that's what really allows me sleep well at night is the strong leadership of the Company. And I think that would be the focus area.","Frank Mitsch","So for my next six. So look, I'm not going to ask the M&A question, but you did say look I've got 220 billion of spend on M&A and share buyback over the next 15 months. But your company owned stores doing extremely well here in the U.S. certainly relative to your other channel. So I'm just curious what your plans are for growth in terms of opening up new stores? Or how should we think about that? And is that also a focus area for the M&A part of your capital allocation?","Michael McGarry","Well, it's certainly as you know the dealers, anytime they want to sale, they don't have a succession plan in place. So we were always the first choice and we're happy to do that. And we stay close to the big dealers. So we'll continue to look at that. We're not adverse spending in that area. We are adding stores in the U.S. as well. That's top of mind but we're also looking at not just in the U.S. I mean if you look in Canada, we're adding stores at a faster rate than anybody else in Canada. Of course, in Mexico, we added 53 stores alone in the third quarter in Mexico.","We add stores in Europe as well. So it's not just the U.S. play for us. As far as the acquisition pipeline, the question you didn't ask that you wanted asked. Pipeline remains solid. We do continue to look at a lot of stuff. We continue to remain disciplined. So when we have something, we'll let you know. But we are actively engaged with a number of parties talking to them about what the next steps might be.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from J. P. Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.","JeffZekauskas","Over the last three years, you've averaged about $330 million annually in acquisition spending. And do you have a very large target in deploying your cash. So if you spend again at a $330 million acquisition level in order to hit your $3.5 billion number. Next year, you would have to buyback something like $1.7 billion in shares. Are you willing to do that and that historically you never seem to buyback more than $1 billion annually in shares.","VinceMorales","Again, as you know acquisitions, are episodic both in number and in size. As Michael just mentioned, we do have a fairly active pipeline that we're vetting, along with potential sellers. We certainly would hope that that's our primary use of cash for the next 15 months and beyond that. But I would tell you, we don't have certainly as you never do around acquisitions. What we are committing to is $2.8 billion of deployment effectively from this month until the end of '18. And we don't know how that's going to follow acquisition of our share repurchase. But the $2.8 billion will be spent. And so if we have to deploy all that in share repos as opposed acquisition because the targets are not willing or not at the right price, we will do so. But I think as Michael mentioned, our preference would earnings accretive acquisitions.","Jeff Zekauskas","And then for my follow-up, when you look at raw material costs inflation across the globe, which are the areas that has the most inflation and which are the areas that have least or is it mostly almost there?","Vince Morales","It\u2019s a great question Jeff, because there are big differences in inflation by region. Michael touched on a little earlier for different reasons. The reasons have moved in different direction. Our highest inflation region is actually Europe, really predicated on all the force majeure activity that has taken place this year. And then we\u2019re seeing inflation in Asia, primarily China. Again, because of supply curtailments that are being in force there. And then the U.S., Canada and then Mexico would be a third in terms of pace of inflation.","And just to remind everybody what Michael said earlier. We\u2019re expecting low-single-digit inflation coming into the year. We\u2019re now solidly at mid-single-digit inflation, so inflation certainly been higher this year than our preliminary expectations.","Operator","Our next question comes from PJ Juvekar from Citi. Please go ahead with your question.","PJ Juvekar","Vince, your working capital was up by $300 million. Not a huge amount but was still up. What are the different pieces in that? Is it raw materials related or is it due to slower growth that led to higher working capital?","Vince Morales","PJ, we\u2019re a seasonal business. So I think you\u2019re right. Our working capital versus the end of the year was up as is typically this time a year. If you look on a year-over-year basis, our working capital as a percent of sales is actually down about 50 basis points. We\u2019ve been targeting 100 basis points of decline, which we think we\u2019ll achieve by the end of the year. And we\u2019ll work through as we get through this lower season, work through some of the inventory as we typically do to achieve that goal. So I would look at our working capital versus same quarter prior year.","PJ Juvekar","And Michael, you had lower selling prices in industrial coatings. Despite what you describe as really decent volume growth. One of your competitors gave pricing concessions to automotive OEM customers. I was wondering if you\u2019re seeing an impact from such competitive actions?","Michael McGarry","Well, everybody makes their own independent decisions. And I would tell you that we already have gained price increases in some parts of our industrial segment, and we expect to get further increases in Q1. And so from my standpoint, we have a lot of areas that are growing above the market, and we\u2019re quite pleased with the pace of that. And I think that the price will come in that area. So I\u2019m not worried about it. So I guess we\u2019ll just continue to push the team to get the price up, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re working on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Vincent Andrews","You mentioned some new raw material efficiency programs. Just wondering, are you specifically talking about TiO2 or the balance of asset? And what if anything are you working on that\u2019s new and interesting?","Michael McGarry","No, we really target the whole thing I mean even things like anti-bacterial things. Our team was briefing us on, if you think about all the various things that go into paint, it\u2019s very aspect of it has a material cost impact. Now, TiO2 is certainly at the top of the list, resins are at top of the list, some of the other pigments that are in there are all key. We are driving simplification in some of our raw materials, which allows us to bundle a larger spin and that helps us as well. So I would say we\u2019re focused on several different levels, not just TiO2.","Vincent Andrews","And then you also mentioned that you\u2019re pairing that growth CapEx for this year. Are there particular projects that you\u2019re focused on not doing? Or least just going to get pushed into \u201918? Or is this stuff that just think does not make sense anymore just given the overall environment?","VinceMorales","Well, I think Vincent, as you follow us over the years, I think you\u2019ll find that we try to be aggressive on all fronts and try to make sure what we\u2019re doing, whether it would growth related expenses or growth related cap spending matches what\u2019s happening in the external environment. And as Michael started the call out, we see a low growth environment. So we are not pushing on some growth projects that could be delayed or deferred to a later time. And again I think it\u2019s just our typically management stuff.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from VRP. Please go ahead with your question.","Kevin McCarthy","Good afternoon. As you put together your business plans for 2018, what uplift if any do you anticipate from end use markets like autos and construction in the wake of the natural disasters? And put differently, if we think about the nickel drag in EPS for 4Q, how do you think that might trend into the first quarter of \u201818?","Michael McGarry","Well, first of all, I don\u2019t think there will be any drag in the first quarter \u201918, Kevin. So I think we can put that behind us. I would not anticipate it much in the fourth quarter this year, but the damage in Mexico and Puerto Rico, I mean, we went two weeks about a single store being opened in Puerto Rico. And even now we only have 50% of them open. So I think when you look at having to rebuild stores completely in Mexico, that\u2019s going to have an impact, but not into the first quarter.","So I would say as far as looking at 2018, as I said in my very first question from Duffy, I think automotive is -- we\u2019re going to be down a little bit in the U. S., up a little bit in Europe and up a little bit in Asia, primarily driven by China. So overall, I would say the market is going to be up 1% to 2%. Industrial production, I see moderate improvement in that area. And I think housing around the world is going to be solid, but not any barn burn. And the biggest barn burn has historically been the U. S. So, housing prices are up a lot in the U. S. The amount of new permits are, I would say should be higher could be higher, but it hasn\u2019t shown that. So we\u2019re projecting 2% to 3% growth in the total architectural market in the U.S., higher in the do-it-for-me market than do-it-yourself market.","Kevin McCarthy","And then a second question, if I may for Vince, you\u2019ve flexed your capital expenditures down slightly this year. Would you expect to be able to maintain the pace of 2.5% of sales next year in '18?","Vince Morales","Kevin, same as I answered the last question with, it depends on our growth outlook. If we see more robust growth environment, we'll step up GAAP spending, if we don't we're going to toe the line. We hope to start the year a little more optimistic outlook and see what happens with as the year develops. But for us, we\u2019re fortunate because we're a capitalized industry, so 2% to 2.5% sales is -- and relative to other industry is very favorable from a shareholder perspective. But again, we're not going to spend if we don't see the growth trajectory established.","Operator","Our next question comes from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead with your question.","Don Carson","Two questions, Michael, so it seems overall you're expecting '18 to look like '17. So is that a 1% to 2% volume growth for the Company overall, and how much can you leverage that with new internal initiatives?","Michael McGarry","I would say two plus. So I don't see the one to two, because I take some of the things that we've seen this year won't repeat. So I think that would be on the area on the two plus side. And we are always driving productivity, so we're not going to walk away from productivity initiatives. I think that's at the top of the list, and we're going to continue to deploy our capital and then we're going to continue to look for ways to improve efficiencies in the plants as well. So I think we've had a historical preference to grow EPS 10%, and I don't think we're walking away from that.","Don Carson","And then a follow-up on architectural pricing. What kind of price increase you've been able to get at your company stores? Have you matched the two price increases of your competitor over the last 12 months? And are you able to get any price in the big box channels?","Michael McGarry","Well, I think the answer to the first question is we have announced two price increases. We are getting two price increases -- typically I always say that we get 50% to 75% of any increase we announced. The last one -- depending upon product, you can't just draw a line around it. It\u2019s anywhere from 3% to 6% depending upon the product in the market. And the big box is, the answer is yes we do get it, it never as faster or as easy as we like. But they do recognize raw material inflation, they do understand that we have to be profitable and we also are very sensitive of the fact that they have a business they also need to run. So we collaborate very well in that regard.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Byrne from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.","Stephen Byrne","Michael, you were just mentioning here a minute ago about this 2% to 3% outlook for U.S. architectural business. How would you assess that in terms of where we are in the remodeling cycle in the U.S. with respect to the average household use of paint? Are we at that prior peak? Or if not, why not and nd what would it take to get there?","Michael McGarry","We're certainly not at the prior peak. As far as what it takes to get there, as you know, the least peak if you remember there was what 2 million housing starts. So we're a long way away from that. But we do have a lot more modeling going on. There is a lot of value in the houses. So there is still more upward potential in that regard. But you don't see the feeding trends on loans that you saw the last time. So I think we're in a more sustainable place now. So I think that's a positive.","VinceMorales","If you look over a long period of time and you take out the peaks and value surrounding the last financial crisis, which was again in part driven by homes. This is 2% to 3% or 4% growth market, and that's the value of the market from an equity investment perspective is a stability. And so I think we've gone back to, what I would call more stable growth rate over a longer period of time.","Stephen Byrne","And then with respect to this new brand that you're introducing in Home Depot, can that channel handle a new brand? And is it entering at a new price point or quality point?","Michael McGarry","So the PPG timeless thing is a premium stain, and it has started out very well. And I think the Home Depot associates are pleased with that. The PPG timeless paint has also in at a premium point, which is we're excited about it's the first time we've had, what I would call the premium product in the Home Depot stores. It is also started out well. I think it can certainly supported -- I think we have very sophisticated customers who make good decisions. And I think in this regard, we'll have to wait and see how it pans out, but we're pleased with it. We're going to put advertising money support behind the brand at Home Deposit, as well as externally. And so, we're obviously happy with that.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Roberts from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","John Roberts","Mike, on your earlier response to the question on environmentally regulation driven closures in China, your answer was directed towards hydrocarbons and solvents. Does that mean you really not seeing anything more on the TiO2 side? We had a number of closures that I think suppliers there. But TiO2 prices I think in China actually went down during the quarter.","Michael McGarry","TiO2 prices went up in the quarter in China, and they did have some of the suppliers get shutdown for a mission and some were shutdown, because they were too close to where the party is doing certain activities. Like today in Beijing starting actually about a week and half ago, they shutdown all the body shops in Beijing, and they're told to be shutdown all the way through the end of October. So it's not just the hydrocarbons, but that is a much bigger portion of it. But I would say anybody who is making dangerous goods is under pressure that they're not in a chemical zone first and foremost, or if you have a bad historical record performance. Those are the two places that they're going to first to enact regulatory enforcement.","Vince Morales","John, this is Vince. Again, I think just back to what we said earlier. For the company like PPG that has compliant coatings products, we think if this trend continues longer term, it's favorable for us. We know we have some local competition there that does not currently have compliant water based product. So the continual move toward more high technology coatings I think favors the multinationals.","John Roberts","And then on the second question, the initial dilution on Crown. Is that due to temporary step-up in the inventory valuations, or are they just lower margin business because they\u2019re more service oriented then you got to take cost out to get the margins back to your corporate average?","Michael McGarry","John, it\u2019s definitely more the latter. We typically bring in these small acquisitions at margins below ours within -- we\u2019re able to extract synergies and get them at or closer to our margins. And the Crown acquisition first quarter will be in this quarter or fourth quarter. So again, it\u2019s coming in at a lower level and we\u2019ll started working on synergies. And we already have started working on synergy capture.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn from Longbow Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Couple of follow-ups, if I may. First of all, on the protective marine business, you put up a flat volume quarter-over-quarter that\u2019s in the first quarter here, which I think is the first time in five quarters, which you haven\u2019t had a pretty big downturn in volumes there. How should we think about this business going forward? Is this an aberration or should we truly reach the bottom and we can look forward to maybe more benign, if not, necessarily positive comps as we get out into 2018?","Michael McGarry","So Dmitry, I think it\u2019s actually been seven quarters, if I remember right. And that\u2019s memory I can have John follow-up and give you the exact number. But the first answer is with the decline in marine, your protective business gets larger and the protective business is not as volatile as the marine side. So that\u2019s the first thing. So the mix is now set that protective is really significant. Second, marine is at a bottom. If you look the first time in two years, there has been a net increase in ship orders that were placed in the third quarter. So that\u2019s a positive. And I think that we\u2019re going to start to see continued growth in ship orders. Don\u2019t forget we paint typically 18 months after the orders are placed.","So I think we\u2019re at the bottom and it\u2019s always hard to tell calling the bottom. So I won\u2019t be 100% sure on this. But when I look at the order book, I see that -- I also see the China has picked up share. So Korea and Japan have both lost share in this enterprise downturn. And for us that\u2019s good for us from a mix standpoint because we obviously are not winning as much in Japan as we win in China. So that\u2019s a positive trend for us as well. So overall we\u2019re projecting slight improvement quarter-over-quarter in the fourth quarter as well. So I would say that for the short-term we\u2019re in our own business seeing an upturn, and I think the market will also start to mirror that shortly.","Dmitry Silversteyn ","And then just to get a little bit more granular on the North American paint market. I understand that you guys talk about your own store values and you don\u2019t really discuss much what\u2019s happening in the DIY and independent dealer channel. But if you look at -- I\u2019m assuming you have those numbers internally. So if you look at the pace of declines year-over-year. Is it changing? Can we talk about maybe inventory reduction that\u2019s replaced in DIY over the last couple of years, maybe have played out any dynamics changing in terms of demand destruction in the independent dealer channel? Or really we have not seen much change from let\u2019s say the last four to six quarters that at least the DIY business has been suffering?","VinceMorales","If you look at those two channels, independent dealer channel has a perennial modest share loss channel for multiple years the channel requires very little maintenance. It\u2019s a very good channel for PPG and the other parties involved. It\u2019s a modestly shrinking channel and it will be here for quite some time, but it will continue to shrink. And that has not changed in terms of its trajectory. The big box channel, as Michael alluded to earlier, we think the DIY market is being primarily affected by low unemployment.","We, PPG this year, we personally have not seen much inventory destocking or restocking. That does happen from year-to-year to different products. So it\u2019s certainly plausible in the space. If you remember Dmitry, we have some destocking last year. So, it just depends what products are selling versus which products are not. But the fact of the matter is it\u2019s down low to mid single-digit percentages. And that has not changed again from the beginning of the year.","Dmitry Silversteyn","So basically, we can continue to see similar trends we saw over the past several quarters. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Sison from KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.","Michael Sison","In terms of the capital deployment, you have over 2 billion in cash today than I would imagine you would generate a good amount of free cash flow again in \u201818. Is there a potential to do even a lot more than the 2.8 as we head into \u201818?","Vincent Morales","As you follow us over the years, we\u2019d like to put a cash deployment target out there at a minimum. We\u2019d like to meet that target. We raised the target in July to minimum 3.5. And if there\u2019s something that\u2019s earnings accretive above that, we would certainly have the balance sheet firepower to do that and would be -- you should expect us act upon that.","Michael Sison","And then when you think about -- I know it\u2019s little bit early to talk specifics on \u201918, but volumes sound like they could be little bit better. You\u2019ll recoup some margin from higher raw materials, you got capital deployments. And you certainly noted 10% is the annual goal. But given all that, whether EPS growth be -- I don\u2019t know what the right script to be, but stronger than 10%?","Vince Morales","Well again, I think when you look across the industrial basket of the companies, 10% EPS growth in a low growth environment like we\u2019re trying about is admirable. And it depends on a lot of factors. We do think there will be slight inflation heading into next year. We\u2019re still going to be working on getting our pricing up. The one you didn\u2019t mention is currency right now would be a slight tailwind. So that would be a benefit to us as well. But I do think all the levers that you talked about are ones we see as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Harrison from Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Mike Harrison","Michael, going back to the architectural EMEA commentary and you talked about that fragmented market with all the private label that\u2019s out there. Does that suggest that there are additional consolidation opportunities where you could take out some of that private business potentially, or there a situation where you would need to work with those customers if you wanted to figure out a way to reduce the amount of shelf space that some of those private labels have?","Michael McGarry","Well, there's always consolidation opportunities both ways, first the customer if they want to consolidate shelf space, they know where we live. So that's the easy one. We're always going in and doing aggressive product line reviews. But probably more realistic opportunity is the fact that some of these private owned paint companies are not getting recovery on the raw materials. And even though these are good cash flow positive businesses, even in this environment, it may be an appropriate time for them to look at whether or not this is time to monetize, or whether they family situations that maybe appropriate for them to look at selling. So we try to stay close to all the large families in Europe, so that they know if they're in a position that they are ready to sell that first person to call is PPG. So we stay close to that.","Mike Harrison","And then wanted to just ask on the industrial segment, overall, that margin looks like it was -- as far as I can tell the lowest since 2013 despite some volume growth there. So I was wondering if you can just walk us through how much of that year-on-year margin pressure is coming from [indiscernible] versus raw. Is there some mix component factored in there? Obviously, the natural disasters had some impact on the logistics costs. What other factors are in there? Again, maybe a year-over-year basis makes the most sense. Just trying to understand what that margin could look like next quarter and into next year?","Vince Morales","I think the answer is very simple. We get, as Michael mentioned, we got a very large amount of sophisticated customers, take us further in terms of time to price with those customers. We're still seeing very high inflation rates on raw materials. So that's the gap because we got to continue to push pricing in order to recover the margins. All the other things you mentioned, I think are certainly a piece of the puzzle. But the bigger piece for us to get price to offset raws.","Operator","Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Laurence Alexander","Two questions, maybe very quick ones. First, most of the leverage we've talked about have been either end markets or consolidation. Is there anything on the technology or R&D side that you can do over the next couple of years that if you're still in a slow growth environment at the end of the decade, your growth algorithm relative to that environment changes? And secondly, I guess this summer there was some noise around the European Union debating labeling risks on TiO2 as an ingredient, and that possibly affecting packaging. Has there been any update on that? And if there has been movement, what opportunities would that create for you?","Michael McGarry","Well, if you start with the TiO2 question, there was an original push by France to label that product as a probable carcinogen, if I get my facts right. And that's been downgraded to possible. We're in complete disagreement with the science. They're looking at one old report. We have billion of man hours of safely handling TiO2 in our plants. Of course the TiO2 suppliers have the same thing. But given the fact that it's embedded in a liquid metrics, there is no concern in the paint product. We've been done testing standing cars and things like that. So there is no push to impact paint.","If there were -- if we were to eventually quote unquote lose this argument with the authorities in Europe, it would lead to us, having to put more safeguarding and dispensing the TiO2 into the paint. That is not -- we already protect our employees, our employees feel very comfortable handling TiO2. But we'll do whatever is necessary to continue that. So we don't feel like that's in any way a threat to the business. But the fact of the matter is we think the science flawed. So when you try to stick a TiO2 powder into a rat, I'm not sure that replicates what happens to a human, but so be it.","In regards to technology though, we are strongly focused on R&D. We spend nearly $500 million a year on this. We're spending more than any other coatings company. We've led the -- if you look at the BPA non-intent and you look at a water borne for refinish the compact process for automotive, what we've done as far as some of the advantage products that pass the fire protection in our PMC business, we have a number of success stories in that regard. And we would expect to continue to drive innovation, which should allow us to grow faster than market, which has been our historical stance. So I don't see a lot of difference going forward. I'm excited about our R&D pipeline. I have a quarterly meeting with these guys, and they really good at what they do.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question. ","Arun Viswanathan","I've got two questions, one on margins and one on M&A. So first on the margins, industrial was down couple of 100 basis points year-on-year, performance also down. Is there a specific target that you have on recovery of those margins? And if you do, maybe you can just help us understand how much of that you will get through price or cost reductions?","Vince Morales","We're working all levers to recover the margins. We\u2019ve got through self help activities, obviously, that Michael talked about in the opening comments. We're pushing price with all of our different segments of customers. Our target, as Michael said, is to get margins back to flat in the first half of next year, hopefully earlier in that first half as opposed to later. And I think we're on path now to do that. We're as Michael again mentioned earlier, six or maybe seven months behind where we would like to have been, if you look at past situations. But we're comfortable we'll work back to margin parody.","Arun Viswanathan","Do you actually need raws to come down for that to happen, or is it price should get you most of the way there?","Vince Morales","No, I think with our pricing actions predominantly as well as some productivity, those will be sufficient to recover the raws inflation.","Arun Viswanathan","And just real quickly if may on M&A, Crown was in the coating services area, you've talked about doing adjacencies before adhesives and so on. Is that still an area of focus, or are you more focused on coatings producers? Thanks.","Michael McGarry","No, I would tell you that we are very comfortable in the adhesives and ceilings area.","I think it was early last year when we did the acquisition of LJF in France on the sealant side. That\u2019s been a huge win for us. We bought 60% of it. Our partner, Total, is very happy that we bought it. There are lot of more profitable at owning 40% than they were at 100%. So they have been pleased with what we brought them. So we\u2019re very comfortable in that space. The adhesives are certainly in area. We have the specialty coatings and material business that would be another area that we would stick-in. And obviously -- coatings is our bread and butter. So those are the focus areas.","Our aerospace business is a good business in a number of areas. So I think you\u2019re going to expect us to stay in the businesses that we\u2019re most focus on now in the near, what I call, the near adjacencies. So if it touches paint or touches the adhesive or touches the sealant that would be what the areas we\u2019ll be focusing on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Sheehan from SunTrust. Please go ahead with your question.","James Sheehan","On the subject of AkzoNobel, there\u2019s been some deterioration in their results management changes. Activists are still clamoring for changes. Is this the situation you might revisit in the future when you\u2019re able to?","Michael McGarry","Jim, I think we were very clear. We withdrew our offer June 1. We have moved on. Our shareholders expect us to continue to create value today, and we\u2019re not paid to wait around. So we\u2019re going to continue to do that. So we\u2019re happy with our acquisition pipeline, and our goal is to improve our business every single day. And you saw that and these results we closed the gap on the margin deterioration. You\u2019re going to expect this to close that gap again, the next quarter as well. And so I\u2019m pleased.","I guess, the last time and I would say is I want to thank all our employees. We had all these hurricanes and earthquakes and our employees did a phenomenal job of supporting each other and supporting the company. And I just want to thank them in that regard. So maybe that answers your question, Jim.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen that will conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session.

","Now let me introduce PPG Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.","Michael McGarry","Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results. For the fourth quarter, our net sales were approximately $3.6 billion, and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.15. Our adjusted EPS were impacted by continuing raw material and logistics cost inflation, materially lower automotive builds in China and Europe, and significant foreign exchange translation headwinds. While our net sales and adjusted EPS results did not meet our growth expectations, we continued our momentum and operating margin recovery. Although we continue to experience additional inflation during the quarter, we made further progress in selling price realization and continued our legacy of strong cost management. ","For the fourth quarter, our sales in local currencies increased about 2%, supporting the higher local currency sales or selling price increases of nearly 2.5%, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of sequential improvement. Our sales volumes were down about 1% and were flat, excluding the previously communicated customer assortment changes in our U.S. architectural coatings DIY business. Foreign currency translation was slightly unfavorable to sales as the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen during the quarter against several major currencies. Sales were unfavorably impacted by approximately USD 110 million, and pretax income was impacted by about $12 million. ","Moving to some business trends in the fourth quarter. In the Performance Coatings segment, Aerospace continued to deliver outstanding results with second consecutive quarter of volume percentage growth in the low teens. We also had good sales growth contribution from protective and marine coatings. Automotive refinish sales were lower, as expected, due to continuing customer inventory destocking in the U.S. We believe the destocking has run its course, and we expect better sales trends in the first quarter of 2019. ","Overall, architectural coatings sales volumes in the Americas and Asia Pacific business decreased due to lower DIY sales of about $40 million, stemming from the customer assortment change. Thanks to our company-owned sales growth in the U.S. and Canada, it continued, albeit at a lower level than the third quarter, impacted by more difficult comparisons to the prior fourth quarter when there was a spike in demand due to rebuild activity after the hurricanes of last year. We finished the year with about 900 company-owned stores, consistent with prior year. We added stores in certain targeted growth areas and closed underperforming stores. We also moved certain geographies to a delivery model. ","PPG-Comex also delivered another solid quarter, capping off another great year for this business. For the year, PPG-Comex added nearly 200 new stores in 2018, bringing their total to over 4,600. ","In our Industrial Coatings reporting segment, sales volumes were negatively impacted by very weak industrial production activity in China. In the quarter, automotive builds were down 16% in China for the industry with lower builds in each successive month during the quarter. Automotive demand was also soft in Europe. Overall, our automotive sales volumes were lower by mid-single-digit, which is consistent with global -- lower global industry demand. The industrial weakness in China also impacted our general industrial business this quarter, including softness in coil, appliance and extrusion subsegments. Globally, our general industrial sales volumes were up a low single-digit percentage as sales volume growth was achieved in other major regions. ","Our packaging coatings sales volumes grew a low single-digit percentage, driven by higher volumes in the U.S. and Canada and Latin America. As we said after the third quarter, we expect growth to moderate with more modest level of technology conversions in the industry and a reflection of the growth we delivered in prior years. ","From an earnings perspective, our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $1.15, which is $0.04 lower than the prior year. In the quarter, raw material costs increased about 4% year-over-year and have flattened on a sequential basis. This is the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year raw material inflation with a cumulative total of more than 10%. ","Prices increased about 2.5% on a year-over-year basis with solid contributions from both of our reporting segments. We have secured further price increases for the first quarter and we'll continue to prioritize working with our customers on further selling price initiatives during 2019, as we are still trailing the raw material cost inflation we have incurred to date. In addition to successfully selling price increase initiatives, we continue to make progress through aggressive cost management. We were able to achieve savings from our business restructuring actions of more than $20 million in the fourth quarter 2018, and reduced our selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales by 130 basis points. ","We are pleased to report that we're able to increase price in both automotive OEM as well as China. These are significant milestones on our way to margin recovery, but both OEM and China are well below prior margins, and more price increases are required to offset raw material inflation. ","Now I'd like to quickly comment on our full year results from continuing operations. On a full year basis, our sales from continuing operations were approximately $15.4 billion or more than 4% higher than prior year. This growth was realized despite weakening automotive OEM market conditions and the partial year unfavorable impact from customer assortment change in our U.S. architectural DIY business. Our sales growth was also aided by higher selling prices of about 2%. ","For the full year 2018, adjusted earnings per diluted share was $5.92, higher than prior year despite significant raw material and logistics cost inflation incurred throughout the year. In addition, earnings per share benefited from our ongoing past deployment actions. This included the impact of our repurchase of nearly $400 million of PPG stock in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year 2018 share repurchase total to more than $1.7 billion or over nearly 16 million shares. In the quarter, average diluted shares outstanding were 6% lower than the fourth quarter of 2017. ","We continue to drive operational execution. Some of our more significant actions included continued successful integration from prior and current year acquisitions. We announced 6 new acquisitions and now have completed or announced 21 acquisitions since the beginning of 2015; continuing the commercialization of new products and technologies, allowing us to deliver above-market growth in several of our businesses; delivering on our previously announced restructuring program, including achievement of our cost savings commitments, which totaled about $80 million for the full year; reducing selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales by 90 basis points. ","In addition to these operational items, we strengthened our relationship with key customers all over the world. As an example, we are very proud with the opportunity we've been given at The Home Depot and expect that this will deliver further benefit as we move into 2019. We also continued our strong cash generation with about $1.5 billion generated from continuing operations for the year. ","In addition, consistent with our capital allocation commitments, we returned cash to our shareholders with nearly $2.2 billion in share repurchases and dividends. Regarding dividends, we are proud that 2018 marked the 119th consecutive year of annual dividend payouts and the 47th consecutive year of annual payout increases after a 7% per share increase in September 2018. ","As we start 2019, while we are confident that the global economy will grow in 2019, there's a heightened level of uncertainty over the level of growth. In addition, we see short-term pressures such as the sluggish industrial activity in China and slowing demand in Europe that will negatively impact the first half of 2019. We have provided further details to our 2019 financial objectives, which Vince will cover in a few minutes. ","Let me briefly cover our expectations at a regional level. We anticipate positive economic growth rates to continue in the U.S. and Canada, albeit at a lower level than experienced in 2018. Higher interest rates will likely drive slower growth in the U.S. housing market and also impact auto sales as we expect U.S. automotive builds to modestly decline in 2019. ","In Latin America, we anticipate economic expansion in Mexico. And in South America, we're expecting continued improvement in addition to our 2018 growth. Growth rates in Asia are expected to be moderate with softening industrial production growth in China in the first half of 2019. Regional automotive build growth is expected to be flat to slightly up for the year, reflecting higher projected builds in the second half of 2019. Economic growth in Europe is expected to be modest and varied by subregion and country. Favorable end-use market trends are expected to continue. We expect very modest growth in automotive OEM coatings as industry build growth rates are expected to remain slightly positive. ","With a more challenging economic landscape forecast for 2019, we will aggressively manage all elements of our business within our control to ensure that we remain competitive. We'll continue to execute our restructuring actions focused on reducing our overall cost structure and pursue additional growth-related initiatives. We expect raw material inflation to persist at current levels at least through the first 2 quarters. We will continue to work with our customers for additional selling price increases in 2019. ","Finally, we ended the year with about $1 billion of cash and short-term investments. We continue to believe that there are many coatings acquisitions opportunities, and our acquisition pipeline remains active across geographies and end-use markets. We will continue to pursue accretive acquisitions. ","As I noted in the press release earlier today, PPG remains well-positioned strategically and financially to deliver increased value to our shareholders as well as to our customers worldwide, given the company's outstanding team, differentiated industry experience, broad footprint and product innovation engine. We are looking forward to delivering on the targets we announced in 2019. ","Before I ask Vince to comment on 2019 financial assumptions, I wanted to provide an update on the remediation measures we have taken to address the accounting matters that were the subject of the Board Audit Committee investigation in 2018. As I have previously mentioned, I have been personally involved in monitoring the remediation activities and can now report that as of the end of 2018, all of the remedial measures that we have previously disclosed have been implemented. This has been a top priority for me and my leadership team, and I want to thank everybody that was involved in supporting our efforts. The company continues to fully cooperate with the SEC's ongoing investigation relating to these accounting matters and is also fully cooperating into an investigation of the same accounting matters commenced by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania. As I have stated before, we take these matters very seriously and remain fully committed to actions that are consistent with our ethics and values and fully meet the expectations of both internal and external stakeholders. Since these are open investigations, we will have no further comments. ","Now I'll turn it over to Vince who will cover some 2019 financial assumptions.","Vincent Morales","Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Earlier today, we published certain 2019 financial targets. Additionally, and similar to prior years, we've included in today's presentation materials various detailed financial assumptions for the first quarter and full year 2019. They're located on Slides 10 and 11. I will discuss a few of these financial assumptions, both for the quarter and the year. ","Now with regard to the full year 2019 assumptions, we did provide annual sales guidance and annual EPS guidance. With respect to the sales guidance, we anticipate sales growth in local currencies of about -- of 3% to 5%. This includes the acquisitions we recently announced. It also includes the unfavorable impact from the customer assortment changes in our U.S. architectural coatings business that will be realized throughout the first half of the year. ","From an EPS perspective, we expect EPS growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, of 7% to 10%. As we noted in our financial target press release, the earnings portion of our long-term management incentive compensation will be predicated on us hitting a minimum of 10% EPS growth as our earnings-related metric for the variable incentive comp. That ensures very strong alignment with shareholder value creation. ","What is very important to note is that we do expect certain headwinds to carry over from 2018, and they will be impactful to the first half of 2019. Due to these carryover headwinds, we expect year-over-year EPS to be down in the first and second quarters, and EPS growth in the third and fourth quarters. We expect full year 2019 segment margins to be higher than the prior year for the full year. Naturally, we are working to offset these headwinds with increased selling pricing, aggressive discretionary cost management. However, we will not be able to fully offset these headwinds in the first half of 2019. In particular, for the first half of '19, we have carryover impact of first half 2018 raw material inflation. We experienced inflation for all of 2017. That continued well into 2018 before moderating in the latter part of 2018. On a year-over-year basis, we'll experience inflation in the first half of '19, until we anniversary the prior year commodity cost increases. ","As discussed earlier by Michael, there has been a contraction in the global automotive OEM industry production rates, most prominently in China and Europe. We expect global auto production to be down a low single-digit percentage in the first half of 2019, before growth returns in the second half of 2019. In addition, and more broadly, we also experienced low to negative growth in other parts of the Chinese economy in the latter part of the year. We expect that to continue as we enter into 2019. Overall economic activity in Europe in the first half of 2018 was solid, and we hope that will continue through the remainder of the year. Unfortunately, the European economic indicators turned down in the second half of 2018, and we currently do not expect any improvement in the near term. Therefore, on a year-over-year basis, we expect overall economic demand to be lower in Europe in the first half of '19 in comparison to 2018. We are not assuming any large, unfavorable economic impacts from Brexit in our current guidance. This is obviously a fluid situation. ","Specific to PPG, we will anniversary the unfavorable customer assortment change in our U.S. architectural business at mid-year. As a result of this, our first half sales will be down by a net of about $110 million, split roughly equally between the first and second quarters. We are continuing to restructure the business, including recent closure of 4 production facilities. We are targeting to be neutral on an EBIT dollar basis in that business beginning in the third quarter. Additionally, we expect our corporate cost to increase based on the expectation that we will achieve our 2019 financial targets, resulting in increased year-over-year management incentive compensation versus 2018, where incentive compensation was reduced. We're also anticipating higher interest costs, reflective of our increase in leverage stemming from the cash we deployed in 2018, along with the increase in interest rates throughout 2018. Finally, we expect our ongoing tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%, up from just below 22% for the full year 2018. ","Last, although this is not included in our full year guidance, is significant unfavorable currency translation based on current exchange rates. We currently anticipate a $400 million to $500 million unfavorable translation impact to sales and a relating 5 -- $50 million to $70 million impact on earnings. Given that the U.S. dollar weakened in the first half of 2018 and strengthened in the second half of 2018, the currency translation impact is primarily a first half 2019 headwind to our sales and EPS. ","We also provided EPS guidance today for the first quarter of 2019. This guidance is $1.18 to $1.23, and this does include the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Embedded in this guidance is an expected foreign currency impact for the quarter of $0.07 to $0.08 per share to aid in your reconciliation back to our full year guidance. As in the past, we will provide the full impact of foreign currency translation to both our sales and EPS and earnings each quarter. ","As I mentioned, a summary of these financial assumptions is included in our presentation materials. This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And now, operator, would you please open the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi","I guess, first off, on Europe and the higher sales volumes in 4Q in context of a macroeconomic slowdown in the region. Were there any end markets that surprised you to the upside or it came in basically where you thought at the beginning of the quarter?","Michael McGarry","No. I think it was pretty consistent, Ghansham. I think that we tried to signal in the past that we were still down on volumes because we've been aggressive in raising price. We see our competitors now getting out there and raising price, and so some of that volume is flowing back. As you saw, we had a positive volume in architectural in Europe. We expect to have a positive volume in architectural in first quarter as well. So I think things were fairly consistent in that manner.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay. And then, I guess, my next question is on the 3% to 5% sales growth ex FX. Can you sort of break that out price versus volumes? And how should we layer in the $70 million in cost savings first half versus second half's? And also, the outlook for the back half of next year -- back half of 2019, specific to raw materials, can you share that as well?","Vincent Morales","Yes. I'll start, and Michael may chime in here as well. This is Vince. If you look at the sales guidance, again, we're expecting pricing somewhere in the same level as we received this year. We had 2% pricing in 2018. We're targeting something in that -- in a comparable range in order to recover our raw material inflation over the past couple of years. We do expect some volume growth that's tempered by what I just mentioned earlier, which is the assortment change. So net volume growth will be probably in the 1% to 1.5% range, depending on how certain end markets break. And then, we have some acquisition sales that are included in our financial metrics pages that we put in the presentation. From a perspective of restructuring savings, that's going to be pro rata throughout the year. So that's what I would assume.","Michael McGarry","And Ghansham, the only thing I would add is, right now, we're expecting Whitford to close in Q1, and Hemmelrath to close in Q2.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Roberts of UBS.","John Roberts","Is your portfolio review narrowly focused on Trian proposal to split architectural from industrial? Are you likely to find some non-core and underperforming areas separate from the Trian proposal?","Michael McGarry","Well, first of all, John, what I would say is that we always look at our portfolio. This has been, as you know, an ongoing thing since 1998. We're always looking for ways that we can improve our mix of businesses. We just wanted to be transparent that this work was underway. And I would tell you that there's always certain countries we look at, and we always say, \"Is this a good use of shareholder money?\" And we're not signaling one way or the other, but the intent is to take a complete look at everything that we have within PPG and make sure that we're aligned to the most shareholder value creation.","John Roberts","And then, secondly, in auto OEM in China, do you have eco-tanks that are idled? I think the inventory in those tanks is yours, I think. And so does the customer close down the tank, you take back your paint and you're going to reuse that somewhere else? Or how does that work when volumes drop this much?","Michael McGarry","No. We don't have any idled tanks. There's maybe one guy that's been shut down for an extended period of time, but they own that paint. But one plant out of hundreds in China is not even rounding there. So these guys are just running at a slower rate. They've taken a little bit more downtime. So far, in Q1, we've seen continuation of about a minus 15% build rate across the industry, both ourselves as well as the entire industry. So we expect that to get better after Chinese -- after the Chinese New Year. And so there have been some indications that there's going to be some incentives. We don't know exactly what they are yet. Obviously, they lowered the reserve rate. That frees up some capital that the banks can use. But right now, we do anticipate a better back half of Q1 than the first, let's call it, 45 days that we have strong visibility into.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter","Michael, just on pricing versus raw. Is Q3 now we will see the first positive margin comparison year-over-year rather than maybe Q2?","Michael McGarry","Well, I guess, it depends how you define it, Dave. In Q4 2018, we actually had price exceeding raws. But remember, we have to catch up all the raw material inflation from 2018. So the gap will grow bigger in Q1 2019 because inflation is still going up, moderating at a lower level. And of course, Q2, we are forecasting even less inflation but still inflation. And we are going to continue to get price. So I would say that our goal is to capture all the raw material inflation since they began late in the fourth quarter 2016. And obviously, we're trying to create shareholder value for everybody by returning to our pre-inflationary margins.","David Begleiter","Got it. And just on capital deployment. What's your target for buybacks and acquisitions in 2019?","Vincent Morales","Yes, David. We didn't give a target. If you look historically, we've given cash deployment target of the past couple of years. Part of the reason for us giving the target the past couple of years is we did lever down at the end of 2016. We tried to do an acquisition that didn't work, so we wanted to give confidence that we were going to deploy the excess cash on our balance sheet. As we sit here today, and we have a solid investment-grade balance sheet, we think that's at a premium in today's economic climate. We're going to have -- we're going to sit tight and analyze what's going on economically and we're not going to give a cash deployment target in the near term. Our preference remains acquisitions. We do have a very active pipeline I'm sure we'll talk through in the call today. That's evidenced by the 3 acquisitions we announced here in the last 90 days or so, and we still have acquisitions in the pipeline.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort","Michael, can you talk about where we stand on the penetration of BPA-free or non-BPA in the packaging markets? How much is there still in front of you to convert? Or are we going to hit a lull here?","Michael McGarry","I think, Bob, in my opening comments, I tried to give some flavor to that. The amount of new conversions are slowing. We've converted, let's call it, 70% to 80% of the food guys. And then, we probably converted like 50% of the beverage guys. So there's still more out there, but the folks that are left are being, I would say, they're being cautious in the route that they're taking. They're also challenging everybody on their other alternative besides just the products that we're offering. And so we're going to say probably the low single digits is where we would be as opposed to the mid to high single digits where we've been previously.","Robert Koort","And then, if I could follow up. In both marine and aerospace, you've had some really strong growth. Those tend to be very long lead time businesses. How far in the future do you see that? I mean, I mentioned that you'd see some maybe deceleration arrow, but how long is the confidence band in that growth rate sustaining?","Michael McGarry","Well, I would say, on aerospace, it's very high confidence level. Probably the one metric we don't talk a lot about is only 1% of the people in China have ever flown on a plane. And the amount of people -- and the amount of planes that are going to go into China, the number of new airports they're in the process of building is significant. The fuel economy of the planes are significantly better than what's flying. And so we anticipate this continuing to be strong. Of course, the military is getting stronger. So I think those are all positive signs. So with my current time horizon, I see this being a good market for quite extended period of time. TMC, we tried to convey previously that we thought 2018 was the bottom of the cycle. We do paint 18 to 24 months after we start to get orders. We took more orders through, I think it was July or August, than we took all of '17. And we're off to a pretty good start. So I think we're in the beginning of a slow recovery in the shipbuilding business. The shipyards in Korea are still hurting financially. So they're still getting support locally. But the Chinese shipyards are doing better. So I anticipate that this should be the beginning of a multiyear recovery.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Yi of RBC Capital Markets.","Alexander Yi","This is Alex Yi on for Arun. So it seems like based on your Q1 guidance, it appears to imply sequential deteriorations. I was just wondering, in the second half, based on your 2019 full year guidance, it goes back up sharply. Could you maybe just give some insight on to what's driving that?","Vincent Morales","Yes, Alex. This is Vince. As I said in, I think, in the opening -- my opening remarks, we do have a variety of headwinds in the first half and in Q1 that we anniversary mid-year. Those include the assortment change. We do expect automotive globally to get better in the back half of the year, in the first half of the year. We have currency translation impacts and several other headwinds in the first half that we have talked about throughout all of '18. And again, most of those anniversary as we approach the middle of the year. Plus, we're continuing to get pricing in place, and we have growing benefit from restructuring. So those would be the big causation factors that give us confidence that the back half will be better than the first half.","Alexander Yi","Okay. And just a follow-up would be it seems like on the strategic review, it seems like it's going to address split between the architectural and industrial coatings. Maybe is there any other further announcement that we could see on any divestitures beyond that? Any other leverage you guys expect?","Vincent Morales","No. Michael addressed it just a few questions ago. Again, we're evaluating what we put out in the press release. We've targeted a commitment to complete that evaluation by the second quarter. We always look at our portfolio business-by-business, product-by-product, region-by-region. But that evaluation strategically is the one we announced in the press release today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer of Barclays.","Patrick Fischer","Question just around your goal for your 10% EPS annually. If you looked at a typical year, between organic and inorganic, what type of top line number do you get to -- or do you need to consistently drive that 10% EPS growth, do you think?","Michael McGarry","Well, Duffy, I would tell you, there's multiple factors that will drive that 10% EPS growth. First, we have the volume growth, and Vince talked about that earlier, probably 1% to 2% range. You got price. Obviously, that's going to be a positive. You got raw materials that are moderating right now. You've got -- the share count is down. You got costs, are going to be lower. And then, you have the positive impact from acquisitions. And each one of those things are going to help us build to the 10% number that's in there.","Vincent Morales","And Duffy, if you look over a longer period of time for the company, and again, this is averaging so it doesn't match in any particular year, we're typically 2\/3 organic, 1\/3 inorganic in terms of our ability to grow. We've done acquisitions, as Michael mentioned, over 20 in the last couple of years. We've done over 50 in the last decade-plus. So that would be the inorganic piece. Organically, whether it's price, whether it's volume growth, depending on what's going on with raw materials, that would be the 2\/3.","Patrick Fischer","Okay. And then, with the deals or acquisitions that have been announced so far, assuming they feather in kind of on the timeline you project, how much is that already adding to the top line in '19?","Vincent Morales","Okay. If you look in our presentation materials, Duffy, we put in there that the announced acquisitions would add somewhere between $225 million and $275 million to the calendar year. That's assuming they close, and we expect that's obviously our expectation and got to go through the required regulatory process, which we don't control. But that would give you the top line marker.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey Zekauskas of JPMorgan.","Jeffrey Zekauskas","You're contemplating split of your company into an industrial and a consumer side. How will you conduct that review? Will you hire an outside consultant? Will you work with various bankers? Can you talk about the mechanism of your decision-making process?","Michael McGarry","Yes. So Jeff, we're using both inside and outside resources. And it's important for us to look also historically. So if you go back and look at the synergies that we've created, as we've done these acquisitions plus the sales growth that we've created, the best practices, so we're taking a look at all of that. We'll also be looking externally at, obviously, other examples outside of PPG. And we'll see how those performed. And obviously, we have a super experienced Board of Directors. They have their own experiences that they'll be feathering questions to us. So I think it'll be a pretty exhaustive review.","Jeffrey Zekauskas","One of the categories that wasn't mentioned in your financial goals, there wasn't a comment on operating cash flow as a percent of sales in that. Over the past 5 years, I think PPG's operating cash flow as a percentage of sales is a little bit lower than some of your competitors. Is that an area that you think needs addressing? Or isn't it?","Vincent Morales","Yes, Jeff. This is Vince. Yes. We definitely have been targeting improvement in our working capital metrics. Unfortunately, in 2018, in the back half -- in the back part of the year, the metrics worsened a little bit. We attributed a little bit of that to we ended on a 3- or 4-day weekend. So our receivables are higher than we had hoped. We did continue our normal payment process. So we did make payments through our normal schedule. So our payables were lower on a comparative basis. But we definitely have stretched targets in 2019 for working capital, and that's definitely a focal point for both Michael and I and the senior team here as they get working capital back moving in the right direction.","Operator","Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar of Citi.","P.J. Juvekar","A question about your new store opening strategy. You mentioned that you're closing some stores, you're opening some new stores in some areas. So how many stores do you plan to open in 2019 on a net basis? And do you want to accelerate that growth in '19 and '20?","Michael McGarry","Yes. So I think, as we've talked about in the past, P.J., we do run a global architectural business. So we have probably, in the U.S., somewhere in that 10 to 25 store range. In Mexico, it will be over 200. In Europe, it'll be in the 10 to 15 range. So in Australia, we're still -- we don't have a firm number, but it's at least 3 to 5. So I think those are the kind of numbers you can be expecting.","P.J. Juvekar","Okay. And then, I want to go back to the split that you talked about, splitting PPG into architectural and industrial segments. This is the first time we're hearing about it from you. So what are the dissynergies of splitting? And do you expect the business to create different multiples, substantially different multiples if they're split?","Vincent Morales","P.J., this is Vince. We're not going to speculate on trading multiples. That's the job of the equity markets. We're going to analyze and evaluate what we said, again, in the press release. We're going to determine what the synergies or dissynergies are of that. Again, our commitment is to complete that. We're not going to do that evaluation over the phone today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Hocevar of Northcoast Research.","Kevin Hocevar","I think you mentioned raw material inflation of low single digits in the first quarter and then mitigating a little bit in the second quarter and then maybe turning favorable in the back half. What's -- if we think about it for the full year, what's the expectation for raw materials for the full year as best as you can tell it now where current rates are at?","Michael McGarry","Yes. Just one correction, Kevin. We didn't say turning favorable in the second half. Our current expectation right now is low single-digit inflation for the year. Again, more of that in the beginning of the year. Obviously, this is a dynamic situation with -- especially with the price of oil, et cetera. But again, our expectation is low single digit -- very low single-digit inflation averaged for the full year but front-loaded.","Kevin Hocevar","Okay. Got you. And then, I know freight and logistics have been a headwind this year. I think, last quarter, you're guiding to mid-teens type inflation this quarter. So what was the overall inflation from freight this year? And what's your expectations for that in 2019?","John Bruno","Hey, Kevin. This is John. So we averaged that over -- well over 10%. There was a little bit of a benefit in Q4. Some crude oil prices started impacting certain elements of that area. But we're still having lack of transportation availability and other issues that are keeping the prices higher. So we still expect inflation in that area as we go into 2019.","Operator","Our next question comes from Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial Group.","Emily Wagner","This is Emily Wagner on for Don. Just staying with the raw material inflation in terms of how you expect gross margin recovery to roll out in 2019. I know it's back-half loaded, but could we see 100 to 200 basis points? And what's kind of the magnitude of contributions there from price and cost savings?","Vincent Morales","Well, again, we gave macro. We expect the margins to be up in 2019 for the full year. We're not going to provide it by quarter. There's too many moving pieces and parts in each quarter. But again, it'll be back-half loaded.","Emily Wagner","Okay. And then, within auto OEM, if there were to be a tax incentive for the Chinese, how long would that take to increase auto production? And how long would that take to benefit the coatings producers?","Michael McGarry","Well, we deliver in real-time. So it's a just-in-time delivery. And the Chinese market, they're probably up about 5 to 7 days of inventory. But if they were to put incentives out there, what we saw in 2016 when they did this, we saw pretty immediate improvement in operating rates and pretty immediate improvement in sales rate. So I would tell you, we'll just have to wait and see what the actual incentives are and when they're effective. But historically, that has translated very quickly into improvement in sales.","Vincent Morales","If I could, Emily, I just want to emphasize what Michael said. There isn't a significant inventory overhang in China. Inventories are up a few days, but inventory is relatively well in check. So it wouldn't take a long time for this to have a meaningful impact on production.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Parkinson of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Harris Fein","This is Harris Fein on for Chris. I was just wondering what expectations you have that are embedded into your guidance on U.S. housing? And is there anything that you're seeing either from the data that's out there or just qualitatively from being on the ground that gives you confidence that resi repaint activity can keep growing, even in an environment where we have lower housing turnover?","Michael McGarry","Yes. So we have 1.3 million builds in -- for the new one, we have about the same, 5 million and change for overall units turning over. So we don't have a big difference. Res repaint for us, I would say, we're undersized in that market. We're much more commercial and maintenance type painter in that area. So that probably will not have a significant impact on us. We're still anticipating that architectural will have a good year. There's a significant amount of backlog with our painters, and they feel very comfortable that their order book looks good.","Harris Fein","And just kind of keeping with this topic. Due to the weather that we had during October and November, did you see a lot of commercial projects get pushed out? And do you see kind of any sort of recouping any lost business kind of as we enter into the paint season in the spring and summer?","Michael McGarry","Well, we don't allow our sales team to use weather as an excuse. So we're not going to use it here. Our customers are trying to paint every single day, and it's up to us to try to make sure they're equipped to be productive. All I would tell you is that we're anticipating to be back to that mid-single-digit kind of numbers in Q1. It's way too early to tell because January is a month that's seasonally exceptionally slow. And March is, by far, the most important number in that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch of Fermium Research.","Frank Mitsch","Maybe if I ask that question a little bit differently. What -- as I look at -- if I look at the fourth quarter by month, October, November, December, can you talk about the pace of business that you saw, Michael, in each of those months? And how is January starting out?","Michael McGarry","I would tell you that there wasn't that much of a meaningful difference. You have to -- for us, I would say, it'd be more guesswork than splitting hairs on trying to figure out that impact, because you got different days, you got different regions, you got different impact of weather. So I would just tell you that we're going to -- we're pretty confident go into next year that architectural buyings in our stores is going to continue. The do-it-for-me trend is a positive, and that trend is going to continue.","Frank Mitsch","Got you. And I guess, a broader question. Europe was a bit of a surprise, positive surprise, in the quarter other than, I guess, auto OEM. And -- but you mentioned that indicators had turned down a while ago. And so you've got some concerns there. In terms of economic activity, PPG has always been one of the best ones in terms of forecasting what's going on economically. How would you guys gauge the percent chance that we enter into a recession here?","Michael McGarry","I'm not forecasting that, Frank, right now. We are forecasting a slowdown in Europe, but not a recession. The big unknown, of course, is Brexit. That could be a significant factor. But we do see significant differences by country, and that's the bigger thing. Even Germany slowed down in the fourth quarter. And that's not necessarily a good sign, but we'll wait and see how it continues.","Frank Mitsch","And if I look at Asia, do you have an expectation that China comes back post-Chinese New Year, or more of the same is how you guys are looking at that region?","Michael McGarry","Well, if you'd tell me what would happen with the tariffs, then I would have an answer for you. I think, right now, China wants to -- we see a lot of positives in certain of our businesses. Marine is a positive there. Refinish is a positive there. Aerospace is a positive there. So we see a number of good indicators, but clearly, consumer confidence is down. Appliance is down. Coil is down. OEM obviously is down. So I think it'll come back. I mean, it is too big of a market not to come back. And we know that they have plenty money over there. And so it's just a matter of getting that consumer confidence back. So we have a very positive long-term outlook on China.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews","Question for you on if we have raw materials has peaked and they've come down, and you've got negative auto builds and a decelerating macroeconomy, what gives you the confidence that you're still going to be able to achieve the pricing that you need to get?","Michael McGarry","Well, first of all, the pricing is catch-up, right? So we don't price just in the real-time environment of today. We have to look at how it's been the last 9 quarters. Now it's 10 quarters of inflation. So our customers understand that. They see it in their own numbers. They see it in their own freight and logistics numbers. So the question isn't a matter of if. It's a matter of how much.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. And then, if I could just ask you on the incentives. Why did the board choose EPS as the metric as opposed to net income or EBITDA or something that isn't influenced by share count?","Michael McGarry","We've always used EPS as one of our metrics. Has been for quite some period of time. And so we didn't make a change. What we wanted to do was reinforce that the executive incentives will be paid out on exceeding the upper end of the range at 10%.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners.","Kevin McCarthy","Michael, I was wondering if you'd flesh out the auto OEM pricing in perhaps a bit more detail. You obviously had the press release back in October. Are you seeing better realizations in that market on a sequential basis? And has pricing turned positive at this juncture?","Michael McGarry","Yes. Kevin, I think I've tried to make that point clear on my opening remarks. We had positive price in OEM in all regions, and that was the first. So now we have all 8 business segments reporting positive price. We even had positive price in China, which was, if you remember, our 2 biggest challenges were: A, automotive; and B, China. So we had both positive. So we're going to get price in automotive. We're going to get more price in Q1, and then we'll get more price in Q2. So these guys are large, sophisticated buyers, and it's not easy. But they do understand the challenges that we have. And obviously, they very much want to have access to our technology, and in exchange for that, they're willing to pay a fair price.","Kevin McCarthy","That's helpful. And then, the second question, if I may, on raw materials. The cost of propylene has come down rather sharply since November, at least in the U.S. market, down $0.10 in November, and $0.08 on top of that in December. My question is, is that sort of volatility likely or not likely to precipitate a shift in resin systems away from acrylics, for example, into vinyl sourced styrenics?","Michael McGarry","Well, we're always looking at optimizing our resin portfolio. And we don't typically change them on a quarterly basis, what's happening with propylene and ethylene. I think, from a long-term perspective, we're still bullish that the PDH expansions will drive more consistent pricing in propylene and that there'll be more capacity out there. They've struggled getting these plants to consistently run, but there are more of them coming on. So I think, right now, you probably should not assume that we're going to be shifting systems -- resin systems.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Byrne of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ian Bennett","This is Ian on for Steve. The strategic review, when did that kind of kickoff? And what are you hoping to learn that you don't know already?","Michael McGarry","Well, like I said earlier, we do strategic reviews of all our businesses on a continuous basis. So there was really no kickoff, if you will. What we wanted to do was let people know that we take all the feedback we get from investors seriously and that we're going to evaluate. We don't always -- we don't always have the best ideas internally, that there could be external ideas that we need to consider. But we're not going to predict what the outcome is going to be. I think we want to take a very serious look at all our businesses and all our regions and then decide what's the best path forward.","Ian Bennett","Okay. And I would echo the comments earlier about the 2019 guidance as being very helpful. And just curious about, I think, historically, you didn't offer more detail than full year 2019 guidance and what drove that change.","Michael McGarry","So Ian, we have a very choppy environment right now, right? We have currency moving all over the place. You got China. You got automotive. You got tariffs. You got raw materials. So I think those were all things that we wanted to be a little bit more transparent on. And we knew that the first half of the year and the second half of the year were going to be different, and we wanted to provide that kind of clarity so that you could put that into your models.","Operator","Our next question is from James Sheehan of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","James Sheehan","You guys targeted $2.4 billion of capital deployment in 2018, and it looks like you fell short of that by about $300 million. Is there another deal on the pipeline that will make up that shortfall relatively quickly? Or can you just provide more color on capital deployment plans?","John Bruno","Yes, Jim. This is John. We met our target. We talked about in the fourth quarter was that we were going to include any deals we announced in that $2.4 billion. So including Whitford and Hemmelrath, we're, in fact, a little bit over that target.","James Sheehan","Got it. And regarding synergies that you've got between industrial and architectural coatings, would you say that those all have been fully captured over the last 2 to 3 years? Or has something held you back?","Michael McGarry","No. We continue to capture more synergies. I mean, I'll take Comex as a perfect example, right? We closed on Comex 4 years ago. And protective sales in Mexico were up significantly. We built a new architectural business in Central America. We've grown our industrial. We've grown our architectural sales into the automotive plants down in Mexico. Our Mexican business is up significantly since the Comex acquisition, and that's just one illustration of the synergies between the industrial and automotive -- I mean, industrial and architectural businesses.","James Sheehan","Could you give us some color on the synergies you expect from the SEM acquisition?","Michael McGarry","Sure. There'd be two major ones. Of course, raw materials is one. That's an easy one. The second one would be sales synergies. So SEM, of course, has a small sales force. They're pretty much a U.S. and a little bit of a Canadian business. Very, very little international business to speak of. Also, there'll be some reverse synergies. They have the capability of packaging aerosol. So that will be something that we'll be looking at, whether that makes sense for us to move that in-house versus us currently outsourcing it. So this should be a good acquisition for us. They're a very profitable company, and they're excited to be part of the PPG team.","Operator","Your next question comes from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies.","Daniel Rizzo","This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. Is the expectation that buybacks should accelerate if end market trends were to diminish, that is -- should we treat the EPS range more as a commitment or as a benchmark?","Vincent Morales","No. We haven't talked about cash deployment. And again, our focus right now is to maintain our balance sheet today in the economic times we're in. We do have an active pipeline, as I mentioned earlier. That would be a priority for us. The EPS range we put out there is our best guess of what we know today. We put a stake in the ground with respect to our incentive comp metrics on the top end of that range. So I'd say, certainly, that's a commitment from the management team. But again, it's based on our best guess of the economy today, and there's a bunch of moving pieces, as we talked throughout the call.","Daniel Rizzo","All right. And then, have you seen -- with order patterns, have you seen volatility increase over the past few months? I mean, I know things are obviously changing a lot. I was wondering if volatility from month-to-month has gone up in 2018.","Vincent Morales","Yes. I'd say, the only place where we've seen what I would call dramatic shifts in orders is really in the automotive market, particularly in China, but a little bit in Europe. We've seen extended downtime. Again, that's not a PPG-specific issue. That's an industry issue. Everywhere else, things get a little choppy in the winter. Things get a little choppy around year-end as there's inventory management by our customers. So there's nothing uncommon other than in automotive.","Operator","Our next question comes from John McNulty of BMO Capital Markets.","Colton Bina","This is Colton Bina on for John. On auto refinish, with it being flat for the quarter, what were some of the positive impacts you saw there offsetting the weakness in the U.S. from destocking?","Michael McGarry","Well, refinish is a global market. I mean, Europe was slightly positive. China was slightly positive. India was positive. Mexico was flat. I would say, overall, it was -- the quarter came in about where we're expecting it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Harrison of Seaport Global Securities.","Michael Harrison","I was wondering, it sounds from your commentary like you expect to continue to be pretty aggressive on the pricing front. But just wondering, as we're seeing some softening in demand in certain markets, just wondering if you're maybe rethinking your approach on pricing at all. And maybe can you talk a little bit about how aggressive you think you'll be able to be on pricing when you look at maybe three buckets, architectural, industrial and then auto OEM getting into 2019?","Michael McGarry","So we are not backing off on our price. We still have significant margin recovery that we need to capture because of 2017, and the start of it in the fourth quarter 2016. So the sales teams are focused on that. Automotive is the furthest behind, so that will continue to have significant amount of pressure. We've had good increases in our industrial businesses, and so we would expect that to continue. And then, from an architectural standpoint, we're pleased to see that all the players in the marketplace are finally serious about getting price globally, and that is helping getting more traction. So I don't anticipate any by letting a foot off the accelerator at this point, given the fact that we still have significant raw material inflation capture.","Michael Harrison","All right. And then, the Europe architectural business, it sounded to me like what you were saying is that you had been losing volume because you've been very aggressive on price. Now you've seen some competitors pushing price and that volume is starting to come back. Is that the main variable that explains what's been happening to improve your business there? Or what else may be at play in Europe?","Michael McGarry","That's not the only variable, right? I mean, we have certain key markets that are performing very well. Our Romanian business had a record year. Our Czech, Slovak businesses were good. The Benelux was solid. Surprisingly, retail -- we were a little surprised, retail in France was better than we expected. So we'll wait and see if that's a short-term anomaly or what, but that was a positive. So our big challenge still is trade France. That is still the biggest business we'd like to see click back into a positive number. We are gaining share in the U.K. and Ireland, but it's really choppy with Brexit right now. So we're not going to be drawing any conclusions at this point in time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn of Buckingham Research.","Wahid Amin","This is Wahid Amin on for Dmitry. Just a quick question on your outlook for U.S. and Canada same-store sales. Can you break that up a little bit? And on that note, do you see a much slower pace in the DIY market with the whole shift in DIFM? And do you hold a bullish outlook in that towards the latter half of 2019?","Michael McGarry","Yes. So the trend line of do-it-for-me is going to continue over DIY. So that trend line is not going to change. The same-store sales is going to be a combination of volume and price. It's going to be both. So I would anticipate that, that will continue to be a good story for PPG in 2019.","Wahid Amin","All right. And if I can ask one more. You've talked about $225 million to $275 million in added acquisition toward sales. Would you mind breaking that a little bit? Is that more towards the latter half of 2019? Do you see that more materializing towards the first or second quarter? Just any color on that.","Vincent Morales","Yes. This is Vince. That's the target for the full year based on when we expect the pending acquisitions to close. Again, we expect Whitford, as Michael mentioned, to close sometime between middle to late first quarter. We expect Hemmelrath to close in the second quarter. We don't have as much visibility on timing. Those two acquisitions, plus the Whitford acquisition, which we closed in the fourth quarter...","Michael McGarry","SEM.","Vincent Morales","I'm sorry. SEM, I apologize, that we closed in the fourth quarter. So that will grow throughout the year based on when those acquisitions close.","Operator","Our next question comes from Daniel Chung of Redburn.","Tony Jones","It's Tony Jones from Redburn. I just had two quick ones left. So one was on OpEx, R&D and SG&A costs. They were down pretty significantly in Q4. Is that sustainable in the next few quarters? Or likely to trend back up?","Vincent Morales","No. If you look at SG&A costs, they were down on an absolute basis, but they were comparable to the prior quarters on a percentage of sales basis. Since we buy, make, sell local, we do have a lot of currency translation effects that run through all the P&L lines. But again, on a percentage of sales basis, we were pretty consistent throughout the year. We were down about 100 basis points in most quarters year-over-year on SG&A. And again, the anomalies by quarter are more driven by currency translation.","Tony Jones","And just one final one. Just coming back to the strategic review. Will the study also examine the potential for like a second step? So maybe synergies or other value creation from a merger with a competitor post-breakup?","Vincent Morales","Again, our focus is what we put on in the press release. We're going to study the portfolio we have today. We're not going to another derivative.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to John Bruno for any closing remarks.","John Bruno","Thank you, Andrea, and thanks, everybody, for your time and interest in PPG.

My name is Rocco, and I will be your conference specialist today. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Bruno, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John Bruno","Thank you, Rocco, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our Fourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our comments relate to the financial information released Thursday, January 18, 2018. I will remind everyone that we have posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the Investors center of our website, ppg.com. The slides are also available on the website site for this call and provide additional support to the opening comments Michael will make shortly. Following Michael's perspective on the company's results for the quarter and for the full year, a brief -- and a brief financial update from Vince, we will move to a Q&A session.","Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the company's current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risk, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements.","This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filing with the SEC.","Now let me introduce PPG Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.","Michael McGarry","Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results. For the fourth quarter, our net sales were $3.7 billion, and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.19. This represents an EPS growth rate of about 3% for the quarter, and we achieved an EPS growth rate of about 4% for the year. While these figures fall short of our EPS growth rate goals, both numbers were noticeably impacted by persistent and elevated raw material inflation.","For the quarter, our reported net sales were up nearly 8%, while our sales in local currencies increased by more than 4%. Supporting the higher local currency sales were increased volumes of 3%. This quarter produced our highest quarterly growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2014. Our strong volume growth in the fourth quarter was balanced, with at least 2% sales volume growth contribution from each region and each operating segment.","Foreign currency translation shifted from a headwind in the first half of 2017 to a tailwind in the second half of the year as certain foreign currencies strengthened against the dollar, with fourth quarter net sales favorably impacted by approximately $115 million and pretax income impacted by about $12 million. For the full year, the impact was favorable by $54 million on sales, however, unfavorable by about $7 million on pretax earnings.","Looking at some business trends in the fourth quarter from an end market perspective. Our highest volume growth rate was achieved in our Industrial Coatings segment, with each business unit exceeding or matching respective industry growth rates. Sales volumes in packaging coatings were up high-single digit percentage as the adoption to our INNOVEL interior can coatings products around the world accelerated.","We also continue to grow sales volumes in general industrial and specialty coatings and materials, delivering our eighth consecutive quarter of above-market growth rate, with positive year-over-year contributions from each region. Automotive OEM coatings grew sales volumes by low single-digits percentage, in line with the global industry automotive builds.","In Performance Coatings, automotive refinish grew organic sales by mid-single-digit percentage, supported by above-market performance in the U.S. and Europe. Aerospace coatings finished the year strong, with solid mid-single-digit sales volume growth producing above-market performance in the U.S. and emerging regions. Architectural EMEA sales volumes were flat and in line with market rebounding from a disappointing third quarter. We saw a strong above-market growth in Northern Europe and continued softer sales volumes in France, which aligned with the market demand.","Sales volumes in architectural coatings Americas and Asia Pacific posted mid-single-digit organic sales growth, as the U.S. and Canada company-owned stores continue to achieve solid mid-single-digit sales growth. Our independent dealer network and national retail accounts were relatively flat compared to last year, which is an improvement from recent quarters' unfavorable trend in these channels.","As an update to our last quarter, our PPG Timeless product in the Home Depot has been added to more locations, and we continue to work with the Home Depot to expand this further. Our investments in the U.S. and Canada architectural business are starting to pay dividends, and we will target to spend another $20 million on additional growth-related activities during the full year.","Sales growth in Latin America was also flat, as our Mexican PPG-Comex business was impacted modestly by lower sales in the beginning the quarter related to post-earthquake market slowdown in Mexico. We also delivered above-market growth in our Australian architectural coatings business and overall growth in our Central America and China architectural business. Albeit a smaller business, I'm happy to report that our Central America business continued to grow by mid-teen percentage. We have grown this business from scratch into a regional leader in the past several years.","Protective and marine coatings sales volume were up slightly compared to last year, with solid protective coatings sales driven by Asia, offset by moderating weakness in our aggregate marine coatings sales volumes. This business has done an excellent job in aggressively managing costs during the year to neutralize the earnings impact of the expected market-based activity level declines in marine coatings.","From a regional perspective, sales volume growth was supported by emerging regions. Asia demand growth was broad-based across many of our businesses and grew sales volumes against a very difficult comparison period. I'll remind you that our Asian business grew sales volumes by nearly 10% in the fourth quarter 2016.","Overall volumes in Latin America were up mid-single-digits percentage, driven by strong volumes in Industrial Coatings segment, led by our outperformance in automotive OEM coatings. Volume growth also improved in Europe after a flat comparison to prior year in the third quarter 2017.","Growth in this region was broad-based and in line with improving regional manufacturing and industrial production, which are typically leading indicators for broader economic recovery. Sales volumes were up a low single-digit percentage in the U.S. and Canada, with balanced growth from both the Performance and Industrial Coatings segments. The general industrial, packaging and aerospace coatings businesses led the growth in this region, offset by lower automotive OEM coatings volume, including the decline in regional industry automotive builds.","Supplementing the company's volume growth in the quarter were acquisition-related gains from our Crown Group acquisition that was completed in early October. The Crown Group serves various customers, including many heavy-duty equipment customers. We are pleased to own the business as the heavy-duty equipment market is in the early stages of recovery.","From an earnings perspective, our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.19 improved by 3% versus the prior quarter. Our earnings were impacted by residual factors from natural disasters that happened in the third quarter. Specifically, we experienced higher costs for various key raw materials that are in short supply. Additionally, our sales in Puerto Rico and PPG-Comex architectural business were impacted, especially during the month of October. These lingering effects from the natural disasters had a $0.05 impact on our fourth quarter EPS and a $0.10 impact on our full year 2017 EPS. Excluding the natural disasters, our adjusted earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter increased by 7%.","Also important is that we experienced continued and elevated raw material inflation in the fourth quarter at about a mid-single-digit percentage increase from the prior year. Raw material costs tend to moderate seasonally -- in the seasonally low fourth quarter. However, this year, they continued to increase. The main inflation driver is the continued enforcement in environmental regulations in China, which is resulting in ongoing supplier production curtailments. We do not expect this to abate in the first quarter of 2018.","Selling prices were modestly up versus the prior year third quarter, with additional pricing secured for the first quarter of 2018. We're continuing to work with our customers on further selling price initiatives, focused on further offsetting this persistent inflation. We now expect the current level of raw material inflation to last well into the first half of 2018.","We are working with our suppliers to mitigate the increases and expanded our research, resources and efforts on raw material efficiency, as we have said, after the third quarter. These efforts are beginning to yield modest raw material efficiency benefits, with more expected as we progress through the first half of 2018.","In addition to selling price initiatives, we are partially mitigating raw material inflation through aggressive cost management. We are able to achieve savings from our business restructuring actions of $50 million in 2017, achieving the upper end of our targeted range. We also did a variety of other self-help actions, as is our heritage at PPG.","In addition, earnings per share benefited from our ongoing cash deployment actions. This includes the impact of a repurchase of $400 million of PPG stock in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year 2017 repurchase total to more than $800 million or over 7 million shares. In the quarter, average diluted shares outstanding were 3% lower versus the fourth quarter of 2016.","Now I'd like to quickly comment on our full year results from continuing operations. These results do not include the divested U.S. fiberglass business results, which was sold in third quarter of 2017. On a full year basis, our sales from continuing operations were approximately $14.8 billion, more than 3% higher than prior year. Our full year sales volumes grew by more than 1%, with second half volumes growth of nearly 2%.","Our adjusted earnings per diluted share was $5.87, up nearly 4% versus prior year. We were able to grow our full year earnings despite significant disruptions to the coatings industry supply chain during the year. These disruptions include a very high number of supplier force majeures in Europe, several severe natural disasters and unexpected production curtailments in China.","We accomplished this with another strong year of operational execution. Our -- one more significant actions included commercialization of new products and technologies, allowing us to deliver above-market growth in several of our businesses; continued successful integration and earnings accretion from prior and current year acquisitions; delivering on previously announced restructuring program, including achievement of our savings commitments; our hallmark of improved productivity and aggressive cost management, as exemplified by our 80 basis point reduction in our selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales; and finally, another reduction to our operating working capital as a percentage of sales. This year, it reduced by 50 basis points, bringing the total reduction to the past 3 years to 260 basis points.","In addition to these operational items, we allocated more resources and investments toward growth-related opportunities and expect that this will continue to yield dividends in our organic growth rate going forward. Over the course of the year, we continue to execute on our strategic objective to strengthen the company.","We further optimized our business portfolio with the acquisition of The Crown Group, a leading provider of coating services; DEUTEK, a Romanian architectural coatings leader; and Futian, an automotive refinish company based in Southern China. We also completed a multiyear portfolio transformation with the sale of our U.S. fiberglass business, our last remaining noncore business.","We are now a 100% core paints, coatings, coating services and specialty materials focused company. We will continue to build on our strong customer relationships and develop leading-edge technology to support our customers. Our portfolio allows us to deliver strong and consistent operating cash flow, requires less capital intensity, and we expect to be more resilient to overall shifts in the economic activity. We also continued our strong cash generation with about $1.5 billion generated from continuing operations for the year. As I mentioned earlier, one of the key enablers of this cash performance was our continuing effort to be more efficient with our working capital.","In addition, consistent with our capital allocation philosophy, we continued our legacy of returning cash to shareholders with nearly $1.2 billion in share repurchases and dividends. Regarding dividends, we are proud that 2017 marked the 118th consecutive year of dividend payouts and the 65th consecutive year of annual payout increases after a 13% increase in July 2006 -- I'm sorry, 46th consecutive year.","As we look forward to 2018, our expectation is for more continued positive momentum and overall global economic growth, including gradually higher growth rates in developed regions, a continuing higher growth rate in Asia Pacific and improving growth in Latin America. We anticipate economic growth rates to improve in the U.S. and Canada, including modest acceleration in industrial production and GDP rates versus 2017.","We believe the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation may bring further growth in the U.S. However, there are many still -- many uncertainties, including how our end markets will be impacted. Specific to our business, we do not expect -- or we do expect, excuse me, we do expect construction markets to expand in the U.S. and Europe. We also expect better growth in housing starts over 2017. And lastly, we believe that regional automotive industry builds will be relatively flat year-over-year.","In Latin America, we anticipate economic expansion in Mexico, and in South America, we expect continuing improvement to growth rate following a modest uptick in 2017. Growth rates in Asia are expected to remain generally consistent with 2017, with continued industrial production in China as well as gains in Southeast Asia and India. Automotive build growth is expected to be flat to slightly down in the region, with the greatest wildcard in China where the small engine subsidy has expired. Economic growth in Europe is expected to continue but remain varied by subregion and country.","Favorable end-use market trends are expected to continue, particularly in automotive OEM coatings as industry build rates are expected to remain positive. Even with a more optimistic view for 2018 economic growth, we will aggressively manage all elements of our business within our control to ensure that we remain competitive regardless of economic conditions. We'll continue to execute on our restructuring program, focus on reducing our overall cost structure, and we will continue to support the momentum of our recent growth-related initiatives.","As mentioned earlier, we expect raw material inflation to persist at current levels at least for the first 2 quarters. We will continue to work with our customers to address the inflationary environment and expect to realize additional selling price increases in 2018.","Finally, we remain in a position of strength as we ended the year with over $1.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, which provides us with a significant financial flexibility going forward. We are committed to deploy a minimum of $2.4 billion of cash in 2018 on acquisitions and share repurchases as part of our previously communicated target to deploy a minimum of $3.5 billion in 2017 and 2018 combined.","We continue to believe the coatings space remains a consolidating industry, and our acquisition pipeline remains active across geographies and end use markets. We plan to continue to repurchase shares in the first quarter.","I will conclude by saying that 2017 was a solid year for PPG. We delivered adjusted EPS growth despite a plethora of supply disruptions in our industry, but we fell short of our EPS growth targets. However, we completed various strategic actions to continue to make the company stronger and more resilient in the future. We look forward to another successful year in 2018.","And now I will turn over to Vince, who will cover some 2018 financial assumptions.","Vincent Morales","Thank you, Michael, and also, good afternoon, everybody. I'm just going to cover a few items that will assist folks in modeling PPG's 2018 financial results. Included in the presentation that was distributed for the meeting today, is a summary of some of the financial items I'm going to cover. First is the impact from acquisitions that we completed in 2017, the carryover impact as well as the full year impact from the ProCoatings acquisition that we finalized earlier this month. We expect these acquisitions to have a sales -- approximate sales of about $125 million in 2018 until they reach their anniversary date. The margin on these sales is typically lower than the segment margin until we're able to work through the synergy capture that is included in our estimates.","Next, we will continue to experience the impact of favorable foreign currency as measured against the U.S. dollar. As a result, the full year estimate that we are anticipating based on current exchange rates is a sales impact of about $250 million to $300 million favorable as well as about 10% of that or $25 million to $30 million on the bottom line of pretax earnings. For the first quarter, we expect the impact to be comparable to what we experienced in the fourth quarter. Again, these figures represent our current assumptions and are based on current exchange rates. They'll obviously likely change throughout the year.","As Michael referenced in his comments, we are still completing our 2016 restructuring program. We have a total full year run rate target for that program of about $125 million. We achieved about $50 million in 2017, and we anticipate another $45 million or $50 million incrementally in 2018.","We expect the company's pension and post-retirement benefits will be comparable to 2017 for the calendar year 2018. And again, as Michael mentioned, we expect the company's 2018 tax rate on ongoing earnings from continuing operations to be in the range of about 23% to 24%. Again, the comparable rate for 2017 was 24.4%. The decrease relates primarily to the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation. As noted in the press release, this is our best estimate based on what we know at the present time. That's obviously subject to updates as we receive any information with respect to updates on the legislation.","As a reminder, there's a new accounting standard in place for 2018 regarding revenue recognition. And we have evaluated the new standard and do not expect any material change to our sales or net income. However, there'll be some geographic changes on certain cost elements and sales elements, and we're estimating that'll likely lower our gross profit percentage in 2018 versus 2017 by about 50 to 100 basis points. And there'll be a corresponding decrease in our selling, general and administrative expenses of a similar amount.","Finally, Michael mentioned we are committed to meeting our previously announced cash deployment target. And again, that means we will deploy $2.4 billion of cash on either acquisitions and\/or share repurchases in 2018.","Once again, a summary of these financial estimates is included in the presentation materials. This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And now, Rocco, would you please open the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Today's first question comes from John Roberts of UBS.","John Roberts","You mentioned the new environmental regs in China affecting raw materials. Is that a broad-based issue? Or are there specific raw materials that are particularly causing you some issues?","Michael McGarry","No, it's fairly broad based, but the one that has the most amount of impact on is epoxy. As you know, we use epoxy in many of our different businesses, whether it's packaging, OEM, industrial. And those -- that will probably continue, I would say, for -- because it's winter over there, they're trying to especially get their air better. Big coal burning time for them. We don't have any insight to whether that's going to continue or not. But obviously, at these levels, there are a lot of people making a lot of money. So we wouldn't be surprised if there's some additional capacity added elsewhere. But right now, we anticipate that raw materials should start to moderate, but we're not perfect prognosticators on that, by the middle of the year.","Vincent Morales","And John, if I could add. This is Vince. We've seen this all year long in China. Again, more rigid enforcement of existing rules, and it's affected not only the epoxies that Michael mentioned, it's affected other baskets of raw materials as well. So I'd call it more of a rolling -- kind of a rolling outage or production curtailment.","John Roberts","And then if raw materials just leveled off where they are today, how much additional price have you still -- do you still have to announce to your customers versus how much is just that you have to realize on price increases you've already discussed with your customers?","Michael McGarry","Well, every business in PPG, without exception, has announced price increases. And some of them, in 2017, announced 2 and another 1 in 2018. So we'll have to look at this as we go through the year. It wouldn't surprise me that there could be additional announcements. But we don't want to get ahead of inflation at this point, and we want to work constructively with our customers. But right now, as you know, we are net negative if you take raws minus pricing.","Operator","And today's next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi","On the 3% volume growth during the fourth quarter, how much do you think you benefited, if at all, from a rebound in growth following the impact in 3Q from both the hurricanes and also the earthquake in Mexico?","Michael McGarry","Well, I would tell you, in Mexico, October was soft. We had a little bit better November and a very good December. So for the quarter, we were actually flat. That's the first flat quarter we've ever had in Comex since we've owned it. From a sales perspective, we were up because we were able to get the price to offset the raws down there. In the U.S., I would say, it was more of a mixed bag because, as you know, it depends upon the size of the house, how quickly they can get paint on the wall once they start repairs. And so it was not a -- I would say that, probably, we didn't benefit that much yet. We still expect to see some benefits. But we have nice mid-single digits in our company-owned stores, and it was in all the regions. We didn't have any region that was weak from that perspective.","Vincent Morales","Ghansham, this is Vince. If you compare Q3 to Q4 volume growth, the biggest accelerant was Europe. So if you ask what the difference is, it's a recovery we're seeing in Europe. Michael alluded to it in the call -- on the prepared remarks, excuse me, with respect to the industrial activity we're seeing there.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay, that's helpful. And then just for my second question, for the industrial segment specific to the fourth quarter, was there any material mix impact during the quarter? I'm just trying to reconcile the 280 basis point decline in 4Q operating margins for the segment versus 230 basis points in 3Q and whether there was any incremental impact other than just raw material costs net of pricing.","Vincent Morales","Well, if you look at that segment, Ghansham, there are seasonality pieces to that segment, including automotive. Within the automotive industry, there's seasonality by -- it's different seasonality by region. So it's hard to really compare Q3 and Q4. I understand what you're trying to do, but we didn't see anything that's material that would have changed the mix other than the regional -- the typical regional seasonal differences between the quarters.","Operator","And our next question comes from Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo.","Frank Mitsch","I want to broaden out the question that John asked on raw materials. You mentioned that coming out of China, epoxy was the one that was concerning you. As you think about your raw materials overall, how would you rank the ones that are most problematic so we can track that? And also, Michael, I think you mentioned that you're embarking on some raw material efficiencies. Can you provide some examples there?","Michael McGarry","Okay. So the one after raw materials and epoxy, you have propylene is, obviously, a major driver for us. And propylene is up significantly U.S. year-over-year. It's up in Europe year-over-year and Asia. And then you have crude. This time last year, I think crude was about $55. Now it's $69 for Brent and it's $64 for WTI. So I think that's going to flow through into solvents. So you have to watch that. So those would be the key ones. As far as efficiency improvements, we always are trying to optimize our formulas, Frank. So if you think about some of the additives, some of the solvents that are in there, to the extent that we can shift more of our customers from solvent-based to water-based, that would be a positive. From the ability to change the formulation mix to, I would say, away from propylene and more toward ethylene, that's a positive for us. So that's how we're thinking about that.","Frank Mitsch","Okay, terrific. And you mentioned, on the share buyback, you did $400 million in Q4, which was the highest level of the year. As I think about the $2.4 billion that you have to spend over the 4 quarters of 2018, that would imply, absent acquisitions, $600 million a quarter. So how are you feeling about your ability to execute mid- to large-scale acquisitions in 2018?","Michael McGarry","Well, Frank, we've already announced two small ones so far this year. I would tell you that we're going to continue to have acquisition opportunities. I had a person in the other day that made a verbal commitment, so we'll have to work our way through it. It's a family. So it doesn't always happen at the rate I would like. But the pipeline looks good. We're going to continue to work at it. We have good visibility into these things. So when we start talking, we know whether it's going to be a 2Q close or a 3Q, so we'll be able to moderate our buybacks to make sure that we're at or above the $3.5 billion that we've committed.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners.","Kevin McCarthy","Michael, how would you characterize your volume expectations for the company in the first half of 2018? I believe you have a fewer -- 1 less shipping day in the first quarter and perhaps, some puts and takes as you touched upon with regard to natural disasters. As you roll all that up, is there any reason to believe that your trajectory would be materially better or worse than the 3% in the fourth quarter?","Michael McGarry","Well, I think Easter affects different businesses different ways. So that's why we wanted to put that out there, on the 1 less shipping day for Q1. We do know that the build rate for automotive in the first quarter is not significant. It's relatively flat, so you can factor that in. But we are gaining share in a number of our other businesses. So when you think about packaging, that's a business we're gaining share in. When you think about industrial, we've had 4 years in a row where we grew share in our Industrial Coatings business. Then you think about our specialty coatings and materials, we're excited with our OLED product. That has been doing very well. And aerospace and refinish have just been very, very solid businesses. And as you know, Boeing and Airbus's backlogs are still there. I know they pushed hard to get a lot of planes out in the fourth quarter. But we still are optimistic that they're going to continue to build more planes in '18 than they built in '17. So I'm reasonably confident that it's not going to be a straight line, but we're going to have a good year.","Kevin McCarthy","If you reflect back on prior cycles for raw material inflation and selling price increases, has PPG experienced any prebuying activity across the customer base whereby your customers attempt to increase purchases ahead of announced increases? Is that meaningful or not meaningful? And does the answer vary by product line perhaps?","Michael McGarry","Well, it could vary by product line. But if you think a lot of our customers, I mean, the aerospace guys, the refinish guys, automotive, I mean, a lot of these things are just-in-time kind of delivery, so they're not into that. The only place that you could envision that is our dealer segment and our -- where you have an independent businessman who says, Okay, I'm going to get ahead of the curve. I'm going to buy a little bit more. But they would have to then be buying paint in the fourth quarter, a quarter early before the paint season. So that would be one area that you could see some of that.","Vincent Morales","Kevin, this is Vince. It's very, very scarce that, that happens, and it's not really meaningful to the company overall.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, our next question comes from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Evans","It's Chris Evans on for Bob. You mentioned pricing across every product line at PPG. I was wondering if you could give us a sense for the scale on average you're targeting in '18. And then are competitors aligning with your efforts in behaving rationally to offset the raws pressures?","Vincent Morales","Yes, Chris, this is Vince. Again, every business and every region has a different target, depending on what's happening within those regions and we'll work with our customers on what those targets are independently. We're not going to broad brush that comment. It's not appropriate for us or our customers. I think the comment Michael made earlier is what we -- what you should probably think about it, is we're expecting minimal abatement of raw materials in the first half. We're behind the curve in terms of recovery, and our objective is to fully recover as we progress through 2018.","Christopher Evans","Great. And then you mentioned a little bit on some growth spending and I think, performance in the first quarter. And you had a program in the fourth quarter as well around $10 million. Did you spend that full $10 million? And do you expect -- seems like there's been a number of these programs recently. Is this going to be more sustainable or something that you'll lap as you anniversary these programs?","Michael McGarry","No, we spent the money that we said we were going to spend. The $20 million I referenced was for the full year. And so we would expect to continue to do that. I think when you look at what we're trying to accomplish with growing, getting our organic growth rate up, these are investments in our business that we're going to continue to do, and we just want to let you know when we're doing them.","Vincent Morales","And if you look, I think we're yielding results on them. So we'll continue to measure that versus the results we're yielding.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan.","Jeffrey Zekauskas","If you look at your adjusted net income and your D&A, it's about $2 billion for 2017, and your cash flow is about $1.5 billion. Can you talk about the factors that led you to not generate as much cash as you have in some years in the past?","Vincent Morales","I just want to understand the question, Jeff. So we had 2...","Jeffrey Zekauskas","So in other words, if your adjusted earnings are roughly $6 and you have 250 million shares, that's about $1.5 billion. Your D&A is about $450 million. So you add that up and you get a little bit under $2 billion. And your cash from operations was about $1.5 billion. And so what I was wondering is, was there something unusual that depressed your cash flow such that the number wasn't closer to that $2 billion number?","Vincent Morales","Well, let me try to answer your question, Jeff. So I think if you look at our numbers right off of our statement, we had just over $2 billion of income. To your point, we had another $460 million roughly of depreciation. That'd be about $2.5 billion of not exactly EBITDA but close to that term. We did include, in our appendix, I think, what we paid in cash taxes. That was just under $600 million. So that would take us down to about $1.9 billion in terms of potential cash. If you look at our operating working capital, which is on one of our schedules, even though our percentage was down, the absolute dollars were up about $70 million, because of the growth we had in sales. And then as we alluded to in a prior earnings call, we did have a gain on the sale of the fiberglass business. So we had to pay tax on that gain, and that's several hundred million dollars. And then there's always some minor things we would call like pension contributions, et cetera. So I think if you aggregate all that up, you'd get down to somewhere in the $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion range you were talking about.","Jeffrey Zekauskas","Okay. Secondly, can you talk about business conditions in Brazil? And from your point of view, was the acceleration in growth in aerospace in the fourth quarter a onetime item? Or was it more indicative of the trend going forward?","Michael McGarry","I think, aerospace, that's an easy one, it's more indicative of what -- low to mid-single digits in aerospace. The market grew, we think, 3%. We outgrew the market. We would expect to see a similar type performance in 2018. As far as Brazil, we think Brazil was on the early path of a recovery. We're fortunate that we have strong businesses in Brazil, whether it's our automotive business, our industrial, our packaging, our refinish, all folks that have done very well down there. And so we kind of outgrew a little bit faster than Brazil. I think for 2018, we should then start to match more the growth rate down there. So I think overall, I think our Latin American team did an outstanding job in 2017.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.","Jooyoung Son","This is Grace Son on for Vincent. You mentioned the impact Chinese environmental regulation's having on raw material inflation. But on the flip side, do you get a sense that the environmental enforcement is negatively affecting the operations of your Chinese competitors? And if so, have you been able to take some of that market share?","Michael McGarry","Well, from a coatings standpoint, most of the folks that we compete with are global coatings companies. And as global coatings companies, they are, I would say, very responsible operators. And not only that, but generally, because we're #1 in all the segments there, except for architectural, I would say that a lot of those folks generally have capacity. So if they're asked to shut down for 2 days because of a Beijing event or if they're asked to shut down for 3 days in Shanghai, they're able to make that up on other days. So we have not seen any indication of that, that they have been negatively impacted, but that would be a good question for you to ask them.","Vincent Morales","And Grace, if I could just intervene. I think one of the -- long term, we're supportive of good environmental enforcement. We have a whole plethora of products that we think are advantaged versus smaller players in the marketplace. And we think, for the multinational coatings companies, once we get through this transitory inflationary trend, this is a good signal for future demand and again, for those that have the products that can support this environmental enforcement.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Christopher Parkinson of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Christopher Parkinson","Out of the M&A pipeline you're currently evaluating, especially the larger targets, as it pertains to what you assess as the most probable, do any key themes exist? For instance, are there any -- are there more affordable opportunities in a specific region, a specific focus on complementary technologies or even broadening your end market exposure? Just any assessment on how we should view that would be very helpful.","Michael McGarry","Yes. I think, Christopher, the markets where we have been most successful are North America and Europe. Those are the more mature regions. The folks in Asia, there's many things for sale there, but the multiples are not value creating to our shareholders. So eventually, one day, that'll be in our bailiwick. So you can expect that most of these will be in the North American, European space. And then the other one, the way to think about this, is the markets that are the least consolidated are protective and marine, industrial and architectural. And so those would be the areas that would have a more of a target-rich environment, if you will.","Christopher Parkinson","That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, can you just break down any key trends you're currently seeing in the European end markets? And any potential to see some improvement in incremental margins? So anything of note on a country-by-country basis post the key elections in '17?","Michael McGarry","Well, I think you've seen in historical past that because we have additional capacity in Europe, we don't have to add any overhead or any people to produce additional volume in Europe. So we had the highest incremental margins in Europe, which tend to be 30% to 40%. So we're always very happy to see growth in Europe. What we're seeing right now is the growth in the Northern European countries continues to be pretty good. France is the one area that still has not turned the corner. We see some recovery in Southern Europe. The one watch-out is the U.K., Brexit. We see retail, especially in the U.K., as being weak, and so we're paying close attention to that.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Dmitry Silversteyn of Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Just a couple of questions, if I may. You've talked about the EMEA -- the European decorative paints business having a flat quarter, which is certainly better than the losses you've had the last couple of quarters in terms of volumes. Can you talk about sort of what's going on there with your pricing initiatives? I mean, are they as prevalent as they are in the U.S. and as successful? Or is there an obstacle to getting pricing up because of the more fragmented market?","Michael McGarry","I would actually say that the architectural European team has been one of our leaders as far as getting price up. We've been successful in the U.K., the Benelux, France, Italy, Denmark. So we've had good success in, what I would call, Western Europe. It's a little bit more of a challenge in Eastern Europe, where it's more fragmented. We have folks that are still focused more on volume than margin recovery. But I think, as people look at their year-end results, people are going to see the squeeze. The problem in coatings, of course, is a huge percentage of your cost of manufacturing is raw materials. So you cannot ignore this. So they might ignore it 1 or 2 quarters, but it's staring them in the face. And I think we'll see more folks get serious about closing their -- recovering their margins. So I'm actually happy with our architectural European team.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay, that's helpful. And then just looking at the gross margins. The delta in year-over-year margins seems to be -- seems to have expanded here versus what you saw in the first 3 quarters of the year, here in the fourth quarter. Is that just a function of kind of that's where most of your raw material hit is happening post-Harvey particularly and kind of not getting that seasonal decline? Or is it a mix issue, either geographically or business-wise, that's giving you a little bit more of a negative delta between gross margins on year-over-year basis?","Vincent Morales","No, Dmitry. It's the former. Typically, we do see some raw material price compression in Q4. As Michael said in the prepared remarks, we actually saw the opposite this quarter. That's why that delta opened up a little bit. We don't -- again, we think that's transitory. We do expect inflation in Q1, but we had inflation in Q1 of last year as well.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Right, right. Okay. And when you were talking about getting more pricing in the first quarter of the year as far as making new price announcements, that is also across the board, both industrial and consumer and Performance Coatings groups?","Michael McGarry","Every business.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Every business, all right. The magnitude, kind of similar low to mid-single digits that you've done before?","Michael McGarry","We're not going to talk about the magnitude. I don't think our customers want us talking about that. But every business is out trying to get price right now.","Operator","And our next question today comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter","Michael, what are your expectations for the upcoming U.S. spring paint season? And do you expect any impact, either now or later, from the recent hurricanes?","Michael McGarry","Well, I would think the hurricanes will have -- it will have a positive impact. I don't think it's going to be something that you'll necessarily be able to pick out. I mean, certainly, in the Houston stores, the Florida stores, are seeing some positive momentum. So I'm pleased to see that. But I think when you look at the overall market for architectural in the U.S., we're still predicting that to be in that 2% to 3% range, probably the high end is 4%. And more of that to the company-owned stores and less of it, of course, the dealers are the most challenged segment, and then the retailers are in the middle. So I would say that's not too different. We're not expecting a different trend line. You still have the do-it-for-me going on. That's still a significant thing. And you still have -- labor for the painters is challenged, they're -- not always have enough painters out there in the marketplace. So that is also holding back a little bit the growth rate. But overall, I would expect to see similar trends.","David Begleiter","And Michael, amongst these large big-box retailers, in particularly one, is there some potential gain, a price point given some recent consolidation amongst their suppliers?","Michael McGarry","Well, I think the way we always think about this, David, is you win some and you lose some in the big-boxes. A lot of times, they want to keep you on your toes. And as you see, we won the Timeless paint and Timeless stain. That filled a gap that they had in their offering at the Home Depot. They've been extremely pleased with that. And the number of stores we're going into in '18 will be higher than '17. But you can lose some as well. As far as any particular retailer, it would probably not be appropriate for us to comment on their plans. We obviously are always talking to all our large retailers about how we can improve their business.","Vincent Morales","David, we think the puts and takes in a given year typically offset each other, and that's what we expect in 2018 as well.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, our next question comes from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies.","Daniel Rizzo","This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. In the past, I think it's been pointed out that sometimes auto OEMs do a little rebalancing amongst their suppliers. Is that something that's occurring now or it's something that's a concern in 2018?","Michael McGarry","Well, there was a rebalancing, but it was more on a regional basis in 2016. I think we talked about that late '15, early '16, where we preferentially wanted more share in Asia because we viewed that as a growing market and preferentially gave up share in the U.S. That has worked out very well for us. We're not aware of anything that's going to be a material change though, in 2018. Typically, when they do these things, they are apt to let them run for a few years before they make any other changes.","Daniel Rizzo","Okay. And then you mentioned a couple of times the $20 million in growth activities for architectural in the U.S is that promotional activities or rebates? Can you just give a little bit of color what that really means?","Vincent Morales","There's a variety of different programs we have going on, again, targeted at growing our overall volumes, which we've seen improve for the last 6 or 7 quarters. It's both in the home center channel as well as our store channel. So it's across the board. Again, as I mentioned earlier, we're measuring the efficiency of that spending. If we see more value in doing more, we will. If we don't feel it's returning what we'd hoped to yield off if it, we'll back off of that.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Steve Byrne of Bank of America.","Steve Byrne","You have this matrix in your slide deck that shows end market volumes by geography, and it looks decidedly greener, maybe even darker greener. And I assume that from your mark -- remarks, Michael, that you might say that trend is likely to continue. But the other thing interesting about it, it also seems like your own performance showed an improvement in the quarter, less below-market results on your own business and maybe a little more above market. Would you expect these 2 trends to be coincident?","Michael McGarry","Well, the way I think about that, Steve, and I think we've talked about this the last two earnings calls, is that we have been leading the price up. And when you lead price up, you sometimes get penalized. But we always thought we would get our share back because at the end of the day, when our competitors also go in and ask for a price, then they get penalized. And so we'll end up getting share back. So I think what you're seeing here is some of this flowing back to PPG as other people are out there also trying to recover their margins. So that's the way I would think about that. I do see us continuing to innovate very well. So if you look at the businesses that are performing above market, think about refinish, we have the best water-based products out there.","And as that product grows around the world -- think about China, what's going on right now. They're going to ask for more water-based products. We are in a great position to supply that need. When you think about our INNOVEL coatings for packaging, and people want to take Bisphenol-A out of the epoxy coatings, we're in a position to deliver that. When you think about innovation in the aerospace business, whether it's the cool coatings, whether it's lightweight sealants or whether it's higher-performing transparencies, we're delivering that. So I think the volume growth is being supplemented by technology, and we're happy to see that come through.","Steve Byrne","And would you say that the stronger that end market, the more likely it might draw higher technology or a mix shift towards maybe more your sweet spot?","Michael McGarry","Well, I think I would answer it this way. The more sophisticated the market, the more likely they value the technology. So if you're in a value segment, they're not going to pay for high-priced technology. If you're in a high-performing segment, they're going to pay for technology.","Steve Byrne","Okay. And just one last one on your pipeline. Would you say -- you characterized it as being pretty steady, pretty forward. Would you characterize anything in there as being more than a bolt-on and potentially transformational?","Michael McGarry","I would say that most of the things we're looking at are bolt-ons.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Don Carson of Susquehanna.","Donald Carson","Yes. Two questions on pricing in March. And you've seen weakness in your Industrial Coatings segment for some time. Is that across the board? Or is that principally in auto OEM? And given your price initiatives and some of the comparisons in year-ago, when would you expect to see improved pricing in that segment on a year-over-year basis?","Vincent Morales","Hey Don, Vince. We're not going to get into individual businesses. These are all big customers, as you know. We work with them individually, either globally or by region. We have seen further price improvement\/price traction versus prior quarters. We expect that to continue well into 2018. Most of these folks have some price delay in their minds, at least, if not in contracts. So again, I think you'll see an uptick in 2018 as -- in this particular segment as the year progresses.","Donald Carson","Okay. And as you look at gross margins and sort of adjust for this change in accounting if you're going to have an impact on that, when would you expect to see year-over-year improvement in gross margins? Is it not till the second half when raw material inflation moderates? Or given your pricing actions, do you think there's a chance for that by the time you get to the second quarter?","Vincent Morales","Don, we're comfortable we're going to continue to get price certainly in the first half of the year, if not throughout the whole year. The wild card is, as I know you're acutely aware, is what happens to raw materials when you get to April-May time period. That could be an inflection point up or down in 2017. Unfortunately, that was an inflection point upwards. So our visibility is only 60 days or so. But the answer to your question, I think, will be unfolding as we get into early to mid-second quarter.","Operator","And our next question comes from Patrick Lambert of Raymond James.","Patrick Lambert","A very simple one. I think I'd like to have your view on the outlook for both market, protective and marine in particular, in 2018, what you're seeing in terms of order books at your customers and the picture you could see evolving into 2018.","Michael McGarry","Sure, Patrick. I think the most meaningful thing is that new build deliveries in the fourth quarter are up 2%. That's the first positive new build deliveries in quite some period of time. China has been growing share at the expense of Korea. So that's another good data point for you to be aware of. But what I always remind people is that we don't put paint on a ship until 18 months after we take orders. So the fact that we're taking higher orders now won't show up in the order book for quite some period of time. The good news is our marine -- protective and marine business collectively was a net positive. So the growth in protective exceeded the growth -- or the decline in marine, and earnings were up year-over-year in that segment due to very tight cost control. So I think that's a positive.","Patrick Lambert","So marine in Q4 was still negative for you?","Michael McGarry","Yes, and we expect it to be negative in Q1 as well. So if you're looking for an inflection point, it'll be sometime in the back half of 2018. But we expect protective to be growing at a faster rate than it's declining, and that'll be a positive.","Patrick Lambert","Do you see oil and gas protective going up next year?","Michael McGarry","I think you'll see some orders placed, but it's probably a little bit early for that to be out there. You're probably a couple quarters ahead of the curve.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Jim Sheehan of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","James Sheehan","Can I get your thoughts on titanium dioxide prices? Do you expect the pricing of that raw material to settle down in 2018? And when you talk about efficiencies in your raw materials, how does that pertain to TiO2, if at all?","Michael McGarry","So we took out about 1% of our TiO2 in 2017. We expect to take out 1% to 2% in 2018. We're trying to make our formulas more efficient and still provide as good or better quality on the final corrosion protection for our customers as well as other properties. So TiO2 pricing itself, I would say, is starting to moderate. I think you know that one of the, well, in fact, the largest supplier is trying to take a different approach to the pricing, where they go to market in that regard. We'll have to wait and see how the other folks react. But we certainly have been watching this closely, and I would think there is some small increases expected in the first half of 2018.","James Sheehan","Great. And then on the 3% volume increase for the quarter, could you just describe that volume growth relative to your comments on leading on price? If you have lost some share due to leading on price, are we in a regain share mode today? Or are we still kind of behind the curve on that and maybe your normalized growth rate could be a little bit better?","Vincent Morales","Jim, this is Vince. Michael, you may not have heard the question earlier, but Michael answered a similar question earlier. We thought we were picking up some of -- regaining some of the business from early in 2017, and we were proactive on pricing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Narayan of RBC.","Gautam Narayan","It's a follow-up actually on a question asked earlier on M&A. You guys had said that you're more interested in bolt-ons than a transformational acquisition. Just curious if -- is that a change in view post obviously what happened last year? Or was that opportunity something unique and specific that maybe you don't see in the horizon currently?","Vincent Morales","No, I think what we're trying to address is what's in the target zone, what's available to us. We've financial capacity to do a large deal. If one would present itself, that would be something we would certainly look at. But when we're looking at what we have today in the pipeline, Michael was trying to address that question of what's in the pipeline today.","Gautam Narayan","Okay. And then a couple of folks asked about the increased spending on, I think it was the Timeless product at Home Depot in the 4Q. I guess, the question I have on that is, the margins in the Performance Coating segment were actually higher, it looks like, year-over-year, even with the raw materials pricing headwinds. Just curious why those margins held up as well as they did in the quarter even with that increased spending.","Vincent Morales","Yes. This is Vince again. If you look, we said this many times, if we have volume, we typically have very good incremental margins on that volume. We did -- secondarily, we did secure additional pricing versus Q3 in that particular segment, and Q4. Those are 2 elements that allowed us to get above margin parity year-over-year.","Operator","And today's next question comes from Kevin Hocevar of Northcoast Research.","Kevin Hocevar","Curious, we've had a couple of -- a string here of a couple of years of pretty unseasonably warm winters, and this year seems to be, at least so far, a little bit more normal. So wondering -- and realizing we're not in the business here of forecasting weather. But assuming a more normalized winter this year, is there any businesses that you've had that have benefited from kind of warmer winters the last couple of years that could be impacted by a normal winter? What comes to mind is exterior paint. But just kind of curious if anything would be negatively impacted if we do ultimately have just kind of more of a normal winter than what we've had the last couple of years.","Michael McGarry","I don't think, Kevin, there's anything that's going to flip bad from the fact that we have a cold weather. Obviously, the -- you can see the company-owned store sales dropped in the last couple of days when Houston was 15 degrees and snow. But conversely, Houston had ice and snow on the road. That means there are a lot of refinish opportunities for us. So this is the first year that refinish might come out of the winter with a substantial backlog. So I would say it's more likely to be a positive than a negative, but it's very, very difficult to put a number on it.","Kevin Hocevar","Sure, that's interesting. And then on the -- your U.S. architectural DIY market, it looked like that was, for the first time in a while, looked like on the heat map, it was -- looked like neutral to volumes, which I think has been getting progressively better throughout the year. So wondering if you have any update there on that kind of DIY dealer channel. Are things improving there? Or is there any benefit from channel fill for the Timeless product lines? Or wondered if you could just comment on what you're seeing in that market.","Vincent Morales","Well, I think, Kevin, as you pointed out, this is the first time, in 2017, we think the market is running about flat. You'll have to wait and see what other folks, when they announce, what they come out with, so this is our assumption. But there is the concern I would -- not the concern, but the caution I would throw out there is Q4 is typically a very seasonally light quarter. So I wouldn't use that as a proxy. That -- as Michael alluded to earlier, the do-it-for-me market is certainly stronger. And so I wouldn't read anything particular or draw any trend lines from Q4. We hope it remains flat to up next year in 2018, but we'll have to get to the end of the paint season to make that a reality.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.","John Bruno","Thank you, Rocco. This is John Bruno again. I'd like to thank everyone for their time and interest in PPG. If you have any questions, please contact me. This concludes our fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings call.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Today's conference has now concluded and we thank you all for attending today's presentation.

My name is Shaquana, and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Vince Morales. Please proceed, sir.","Vincent J. Morales","Thank you. This is Vince Morales. Good afternoon. Welcome to PPG Second Quarter 2013 Financial Teleconference. Joining me from PPG today on the call is Chuck Bunch, PPG's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dave Navikas, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Sklarsky, Executive Vice President, Finance.","Our comments relate to the financial information released today, Thursday, July 28, 2013. I will remind everybody that approximately 1 hour ago, we posted detailed commentary and relating presentation slides on the Investor Center at ppg.com. These slides are also available on the webcast site for this call, and they provide additional support to the opening comments that Chuck will make momentarily. Following Chuck's perspective on the company's results for the quarter, we will move directly to Q&A.","Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements.","Our presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial metrics. The company has provided in the appendix in the presentation materials, which are also available on our website, reconciliation of these non-financial -- non-GAAP financial metrics to the most comparable GAAP financial metrics. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC.","Now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch.","Charles E. Bunch","Thank you, Vince, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG. For the past several years under a variety of different economic circumstances, we have delivered consistent earnings growth. We are pleased to continue this trend as the second quarter financial results included all-time records for both sales and adjusted earnings per share.","Our adjusted earnings per share of $2.45 from continuing operations exceeds our prior record set last year. Of equal importance this quarter, we more than fully replaced the earnings per share reduction stemming from separating our former Commodity Chemicals business. This record performance was achieved despite continued divergence in the level of economic activity in the major regions of the world.","During the quarter, we benefited from generally modest but consistent growth in most North American end-use markets. Solid growth also continued for all our Asian businesses, except the marine coatings market. Yet again, demand in Europe was lower year-over-year, although we are experiencing a fairly consistent pace of business in the region and a few of our businesses did achieve volume growth in that region this past quarter.","The major factors in our improved financial results were continued sales and earnings growth in several of our businesses, including automotive OEM, aerospace and automotive refinish; proactive and aggressive cost actions in all of our businesses, including stringent discretionary cost management and continued benefit from our 2012 restructuring program; and higher sales and earnings benefits from cash deployed on recent coatings acquisitions.","As a result of these and other factors, we delivered coatings segment earnings growth of 25% versus last year's record level. Additionally, each major region achieved higher earnings with North America more than 20% higher, emerging regions growth of about 15% and higher European earnings of 8% despite the continued economic challenges in that region.","At the outset of the quarter, we completed the acquisition of AkzoNobel's North American architectural coatings business. Results for the acquired business were incorporated into our Performance Coatings segment, along with PPG's companion legacy architectural business.","We were pleased with the business performance in this initial quarter, as it is pacing slightly ahead of our target. The business had sales of approximately $475 million and delivered an earnings return on sales of mid-single-digit percentages. We realized $60 million of lower annual cost when the transaction closed, benefiting this quarter by about $15 million. In addition, we achieved some other initial acquisition-related synergies. We still have a great deal of work to do but remain confident that we will deliver our 3-year synergy target of $200 million annually.","To that end, our Board of Directors just approved a $102 million restructuring program focused primarily on the synergy capture for the acquisition. The program also includes targeted actions for certain businesses, which continue to face challenging market conditions such as protective and marine coatings and certain European businesses, including architectural coatings and fiberglass. This restructuring program reflects the continued focus on operating and cost excellence, which is what you have come to expect from PPG. We anticipate the majority of the restructuring actions will be completed by the end of 2014.","One final comment on the second quarter is that it is typically our largest quarter from a seasonal perspective, and we generally experience normal season trends in most businesses and regions.","Looking ahead to the third quarter, we remain optimistic about our earnings growth momentum, driven by many of the same factors that we experienced in the first half of the year. This includes benefits from our recent acquisitions and proactive cost management. We anticipate normal seasonal trends in our businesses and regions and expect several businesses such as automotive OEM and aerospace to remain growth drivers.","Our balance sheet remains very strong with about $1.8 billion of cash and short-term investments at quarter end. We continue to analyze prudent cash deployment opportunities focused on growing our earnings and rewarding our shareholders. Overall, we continue to face mixed economic conditions, and we were pleased to have delivered record results for our shareholders.","Thank you for your attention. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy representing Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Question for you on the growth you're experiencing in Coatings. I think you referenced to 25% growth on a year-over-year basis. Just trying to parse how much was organic versus Akzo. I think you threw out a sales number of $475 million times mid-single digit. Would it be fair to say Akzo contributed $25 million or so in the quarter?","Vincent J. Morales","Yes, Kevin, I think -- this is Vince. I think that's a fair number.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Very good. And then on the new restructuring initiative of $102 million, is that exclusively part of your $200 million synergy goal looking out to 2015? Or are there other areas of the company where you're taking additional cost actions at this point?","David B. Navikas","Kevin, this is Dave Navikas. Of the charge that we took, about 60% of it relates to the Akzo North American integration, and the remainder relates to other actions in some of our other businesses where there are still weak demand conditions.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And then a final question I had was on Europe. I guess you're running minus 4% there according to one of your slides versus minus 7% or minus 8% in the prior couple of quarters. Chuck, I think you mentioned in your prepared comments that you were seeing certain businesses that were actually growing, and I was wondering if you could elaborate on that, and maybe talk about where you might be seeing growth in the region.","Charles E. Bunch","Well, growth, I would say, in the region is very challenged right now, Kevin. If you look at several of our businesses like aerospace and packaging, we still have growth in those businesses. However, if you look at the automotive markets or the architectural markets, those are businesses where, from an overall market standpoint, we're still seeing negative growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter.","Ramanan Sivalingam - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Ram Sivalingam sitting in for David. Just a quick question on ROS given that we're past the height of the paint production season. How are you thinking about TiO2 pricing in the back half of the year? And also, any update you can give on your use and [ph] reductions of TiO2 would be helpful.","Charles E. Bunch","TiO2 pricing for the second half, we're in discussions now, so it would be too early. We're -- to comment, we're looking overall at stable raw material pricing in the second half of the year. We continue to have success in terms of improving our productivity in our formulations for TiO2 usage. We hit our targets last year in the 4% to 5% range. And this year, we're on track for hitting those targets, which we defined this year as closer to 2% to 3%.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Robert Koort representing Goldman Sachs.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Chuck, the decremental margins in glass were pretty ugly, and sales looked like they changed by $4 million and profits by $15 million. Is there something in the near term that can reverse that? Or should we expect that same kind of pain from the fixed cost leverage? Or what exactly do you think is causing that?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, we had -- it was a disappointing quarter for actually both business units in glass for slightly different reasons. In our flat glass business, we had a poor quarter from a, let's call it, manufacturing and supply chain performance. We also saw some volume declines as we looked at some of our end-use markets like solar that were lower, and we didn't get enough of a pickup on the commercial construction side, which is our biggest market for that business. We also saw some year-over-year licensing revenue that was lower. So I would expect that the third quarter, we're going to improve our operating performance. And so I expect the flat glass business to still be challenged but not to the same level that they were in the second quarter. On the fiberglass side, we had lower volumes, especially in Europe, and we had lower equity earnings out of our PFG joint venture in Asia, which is targeted at the electronics market. So I don't expect a significant improvement on the fiberglass side. We had pretty good results here in North America. But I would say that we are looking to improve slightly over what you saw in the second quarter, but certainly, I think we're going to face some of the same challenges here in the third quarter.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And if I might follow up on the U.S. architectural side, your same-store sales looked pretty strong in your stores but through the big box, less exciting. I know Sherwin, this morning, had a similar comment about its non-store business. So was there something that's not quite as exciting in the DIY markets? Was this a function of just a couple of lost business lines? Or what do you attribute to the less robust non-stores business in the U.S. architectural?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, in the 2 other channels, I would say you mentioned that we did lose price points at one of our major North American home center accounts. This was on the, let's call it, the legacy PPG side, so that accounted for some of the lower comps. We also have seen some weakness in what we would call the independent dealer channel, which is an important channel for both the PPG legacy business, plus the newly acquired business. And the dealers we found were a little cautious. We had, what I would call, a second quarter -- is a -- weather and some other factors were not helping us as much as they were last year. We still think there's good growth there, but right now the dealers were quite cautious in the second quarter as well. So that's why the numbers weren't as robust for us as we would have hoped outside of the store channel.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson representing Susquehanna.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Yes, Chuck, question, a couple of questions on restructuring and cash redeployment. First on Transitions, I know earlier this year, you indicated you were in some discussions with Essilor about future ownership structure of that business. Can you update us on that or give us a timeline and maybe indicate what the attractiveness of being in that business going forward is as opposed to be more of a coatings play? And then just if you could comment on the coatings acquisition pipeline, are you at a point where if you don't do any additional deals this year, you might up your share repurchase targets of $500 million to $750 million?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, Don, we are still in discussions with Essilor relating to the future of Transitions Optical, so at this point, we do not have any additional comments on that subject. As far as the redeployment of cash, we are working the acquisition pipeline actively. We were able to complete not only the Akzo North American architectural acquisition in April, but we completed in May, the Deft acquisition, smaller, bolt-on, but quite successful. We were really pleased that this was going to be a positive for our aerospace business. And we're actively working the acquisition pipeline. We have several, we think, good potential opportunities, but obviously, we're going to keep working them and hope to bring them in. And we're pleased with our integration activities here with the Akzo business. We do think that it is -- although a challenge, we are responding very well, lots of work but lots of progress. So we're optimistic with the results of these latest acquisitions, including Spraylat, which we announced at the end of last year. So we're more confident that we can continue to make acquisitions and successfully integrate them and achieve the targets that we set. And if we, however, are not able to consummate these deals, if you look at that the range of share buybacks between $500 million and $750 million, we would be looking to move that up into the upper end of the range if we can't bring in any new targets. And obviously, as we approached year end, if we don't feel as confident about the acquisition opportunities, we would certainly look at that overall target that we've set for ourselves in share buybacks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar representing Citi.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You had talked about a potential rebranding strategy in architectural paint, particularly for the Glidden brand in different channels. Any update on that? And then secondly, you talked about load share. Was there any share loss at Home Depot for the Akzo business?","Charles E. Bunch","We are not in a position right now to announce any change in the branding strategy for the Akzo North American business. It's been little over 3 months. It all hands on deck trying to get through the integration and ensure that all the customers are being supplied and serviced in a way consistent or better than they were prior to the acquisition. So we're working on that, but we're not in a position to announce anything right now. And I think your second question, P.J., was it Home Depot? There was no shelf space or share loss at Home Depot on the acquired business.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And secondly, on automotive OEM, you are growing 2 to 3x the market. How long can that continue? I know a competitor that exited their business, sort of lost some share towards the end. So can you just talk about the competitive dynamic in that market?","Charles E. Bunch","Our competitive dynamics, it's always been a very competitive market. It's not a market however, that you see a lot of share gains or losses in the short term. These are usually longer-term decisions that the automotive manufacturers make typically around model years or when they are starting new production. I think we've been well positioned in the past few years with several new technologies that we've introduced that have been well received by our automotive customers. We have been also well placed with many of the plants that have continued in service as the industry is restructured. And we're very well positioned in the markets where we've seen either the largest recovery or the most growth. So if you look at the North American market, we are very well positioned. We're #1 in this market, and we are also #1 in the Chinese market. So if you look at, overall, where are you seeing the best performance from the automotive industry, we're well placed in the areas where it's really growing. We have good technologies. We had a consistent strategy, so we continued to do well. But I don't see these things as either short term in nature. These are longer-term trends. And if we continue to do the things that we've been doing and the markets continue to hold up well, then I think this is a level of performance that we expect to continue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch representing Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I'm looking at -- very pleased to hear about the progress on the Akzo deal doing a bit better than anticipated. And you had raised your cost-reduction targets the last call from $160 million to $200 million. And looking at the math, you originally targeted 10% margin on that business, but with that upgrade, it's looking more like 12% or 13%. What are the chances that we might see you bring that all the way up a couple more points? And how confident are you and that $200 million -- in that $200 million number? And might we see some changes going on there in terms of synergy?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, Frank, we feel very good about the $200 million synergy number. We're ahead of our targets for realization of that, and I think we have a path forward. At this point, we're not raising the synergy targets for the acquisition, but there's a lot of hard work ahead of us. So we know that we haven't been -- we've just begun the capture all of those opportunities, but we feel increasingly confident. And -- but at this point, we still feel that $200 million is a good target.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right, great. And in terms of getting the margins up even higher than that 13% or so?","Charles E. Bunch","In the Performance Coatings segment or...","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","The Akzo business.","Charles E. Bunch","Oh, the Akzo business, well, I think that we're going to see how this thing plays out, and I'm sure we're going to share more information with the investors as the year goes on. This is -- we're 3 months into this, feel good, but there's a lot of heavy lifting. So at this point, we're not going to change any of the projections or targets that we have yet.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Fair enough. Now obviously, year to date, Mr. Navikas has a little bit been slow on this, on the share repurchase side given where you want to get to by the end of the year. And obviously, you are examining some other opportunities out there in terms of bolt-ons and so on. To that end, were you surprised to see the Mexican reject the Comex deal? And is that a business that might be interesting for you? And do you think you might have better luck going in after Comex?","Charles E. Bunch","We've been in a PPG board meeting this morning, so although I've heard those comments, I haven't seen any of the press releases, so I'm not really in a position to comment on what's transpired with that potential acquisition, and I wouldn't have any comment on our potential interest with that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi representing Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Can you give us a rough estimate of the weather impact on your European architectural business? I think it was down 8% for the quarter. And do you think that some of that was delayed into the third quarter because of the weather? Or is it just sort of lost opportunity for the industry?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, I don't think the weather -- the weather hasn't been good the first half of the year. It wasn't good in the first quarter. It wasn't especially good in the second quarter either. We hope things are going to get better. Some of the weather impact in the second quarter was -- we have leading positions in many of the country markets in Eastern Europe, and they were heavily impacted by the flooding. And so I think there were some volume declines resulting in that. But I would say to blame most of this volume decline on Eastern European flooding would be a stretch or maybe a couple of percentage points, yes, but the rest of it was overall market weakness in many of the key market areas. And we're not seeing a recovery in any of the markets except the U.K. The U.K. trade market, I think, has been slightly improved, and I think the U.K. economic recovery is maybe just a step ahead of what we've seen so far in Europe. So I would say weather is sometimes a short-term factor, but we have, 2 quarters now, fairly weak activity in Europe. We think we've stabilized, and the comparables should get better. So -- but you've seen our performance. I mean, the thing that's most encouraging with our performance and our results is even despite the weak volume in the European architectural market, our teams are delivering. They're working really hard to execute on the restructuring plans and to drive our cost and productivity. So we feel pretty good about the overall earnings and the cash performance despite the weaker top line.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then on the marine build market, can you share your perspective on whether this market is closer to bottom maybe from talking to your customers? That would be helpful.","Charles E. Bunch","Well, the marine market, I think has surprised all of us with the level of weakness. When we looked at the marine new-build market in the second quarter, it was down a little over 30% in Asia, which is, as you know, the predominant region for marine newbuilds. So it has been probably a decline that even by historical standards was much sharper than anything that we'd experienced. Now as we look at our performance during this time, I think the comparables are going to start getting a little better, even though we're still going to see negative growth numbers. So I think the third quarter, we're going to still see some declines, maybe not as sharp as what I've just described here in the second quarter. And we are winning our share of new business that we hope we would see in -- by the middle of next year as they would start to rebuild from this very low level. So I would say that I'm more optimistic going forward that I think the second quarter will be our lowest point in terms of year-over-year comparables, especially for our sales. We'll start to see some improvement in this rate of decline over the next couple of quarters, not nearly as dramatic as what we've seen here especially by the time we get to the fourth quarter. And we may begin, then, to see some improvement as we move through 2014.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McNulty representing Credit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","With regard to cash flow, your cash flows were up pretty significantly year-over-year despite maybe not having the cash machine, which was your commodity platform. So can you walk us through some of the changes? You highlighted working capital in the prepared remarks. Can you kind of walk us through kind of what's happened there and then also, if you think that's sustainable going forward?","David B. Navikas","John, this is Dave Navikas. If we look at the working capital results, particularly in our coatings businesses, we certainly saw the result of some concerted effort really over the last several quarters that board approved here for us in Q2, good inventory performance from a reduction perspective in all of the businesses. The improvement that we saw in working capital, both inventory and receivables, was spread through all of the businesses. So I think it's a positive that this was an across-the-board kind of improvement, good performance from a receivable collection perspective so percent current in good shape. So we're pleased to see the results here in the second quarter, and certainly, our expectations will be to keep the focus on this area and hopefully be able to retain the improvements that we see here.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just with regard to M&A and the opportunities that you see out there, you're in the middle of putting Akzo into your current portfolio. How much more bandwidth do you have in terms of the size and scale of potential acquisitions out there? And then maybe just one quick follow-up, if you comment as to whether or not you have architectural exposure down in Mexico?","Charles E. Bunch","Bandwidth in terms of size of capabilities, financial -- let's just look at the capabilities of the organization. Obviously, this is a big deal for us with Akzo North America here for our North American architectural business. I think we're stepping up. I'm quite pleased. We've made a couple of acquisitions, including SigmaKalon 5 years ago that were even bigger in terms of size or scale. So I think we've proven that we can take on some of the largest businesses out there. So there are few -- there were fewer large top 10 kind of companies that would still be considered for sale in play. So I would say that the opportunities are still out there for the small and mid-sized companies. We certainly have the financial resources to -- and the borrowing capacity to step up from there. So I feel quite confident that we'll be able to, both in terms of the integration and the financial capacity, we certainly have capabilities to do whatever we would like to do in the coatings space. And then Mexico I think, John, the other part of your question, we have a very good business in Mexico in our automotive and industrial businesses, smaller positions on the other coatings side but a very what I would call, a small position in architectural coatings in Mexico.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander representing Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Two quick questions. First, do you expect your automotive sales to grow sequentially in Q3? And in Europe, how far out do you feel you'd be to look to feel comfortable that you should get back to flat to slightly positive year-over-year comparisons?","Charles E. Bunch","Sequential sales for automotive OEMs are -- in the third quarter, are usually down. So if you look -- they have in Western Europe or in Europe, they have August shutdowns, which I think we'll see again this year given the weakness of the market. Here, there is a usually a July shutdown. And I think we're seeing more traditional seasonal or third quarter pattern here in North America for the auto build. Last year, we didn't have as much of an effect because they were still recovering from the effects of the Japanese tsunami and the strength of the market that began to really recover in -- early in last year. So I think we're going to have more seasonal patterns in the third quarter both here and in Europe, and that would indicate that it would be typically lower than the second quarter sales. And the second part of that was?","David B. Navikas","What's your second question, Laurence, I'm sorry?","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Sorry, just on Europe, how far out do you need to look to see positive comparisons? I mean, do you have any confidence on that?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, I would -- yes, if you look at -- we've been probably a little surprised by the weakness of the European economy and some of the key markets. So we've been very encouraged by our performance, of course, and we've been delivering on the bottom line and in cash flow. If you look in the year-over-year comparisons, I'd say to turn positive, certainly not for the balance of this year. I think we're still going to see 2 quarters coming up here in the second half that'll continue to be negative from a European auto build standpoint. I'm not talking about our performance because we still feel good about that, but if you look at the overall market, certainly, in the next 2 quarters, I think it's going to be down. Now when you look this year, the first quarter was abnormally weak. So could you start to see more stability when we go into 2014? I certainly hope so. And that's my feeling. Although when we'll see positive upturn from that, the market is still fairly pessimistic when you talk to a lot of the participants. But what happened here in North America, as this -- the crisis rolled through the automotive industry, there was no optimism at all. In fact, many of the so-called experts were saying we'd never get to 9 million or 10 million builds again, and the whole market had forever moved away. But now you see us moving past 15 million builds, sales getting into the 16 million range here in North America. So my hope is that even if we don't have a sharper recovery in Europe, at some point, we will stabilize and see some growth. And that could start happening next year, but in the near term, I'm not looking for that recovery.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts representing UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","The latest deep dive that you did with investors was on packaging coatings, and it had an okay quarter. It was low single digit kind of everywhere. But it sounded like from that deep dive, that's a business that should be accelerating over the next year, maybe not longer than 2 years and that it has the potential to get to be a high single, low double-digit grower for a period at least through the BPA conversion?","Charles E. Bunch","Right. And we're still pleased with our packaging business unit. The best opportunities in terms of overall demand and consumption is in Asia. So the business is still quite strong in Asia. And I think that's where you're going to see those types of demand or growth numbers. Obviously, the other opportunity that they talked about was these development, as you mentioned, of the BPA non-intent, and we're actively working on our formulations, qualifications. We're seeing the market gradually turn. And we're seeing a number of food companies, not only in the baby food, but recently Coca-Cola in France, as an example, is introducing the BPA non-intent coatings in those markets. And that should give us an opportunity for further growth. So based on increasing consumption in the developing world led by Asia, but also Eastern Europe and Central Europe, and the technology advances associated with BPA non-intent, as an example, give us optimism that we will continue to see good growth in the packaging coatings business.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ivan Marcuse representing KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Real quick on the European architectural business. The improvement in EBITDA, how much of that was -- was that all cost savings or did you have some benefit from price cost raw materials?","Vincent J. Morales","Ivan, almost every single penny and more was cost savings. Volumes were down, as we articulated, and we overcame that with what I would call, discretionary cost management, as well as the 2002 restructuring program savings that we're still implementing.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Is the restructuring in Europe -- is this is almost done, and are all the cost savings through there, or will that continue for another couple of quarters?","Vincent J. Morales","If you look at our 2002 program, Ivan -- I'm so sorry, 2012 program, the 2012 program targeted $140 million of savings. We were about $30 million away from that, so we'll see some savings in the back half of the year, still. But they're starting to diminish as we anniversary some of the actions because we still have some savings in the back half of the year related to that original program that we initiated last year.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, last question. You mentioned that the dealer network in the U.S. was -- or the independent dealer for architectural was fairly cautious. The weather, I guess, has improved at least the past couple of weeks. So would you expect, then, to have -- that segment to be a lot stronger in the third quarter? Or is there a reason that they would remain cautious, especially with housing being as strong as it is?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, we feel that the independent dealer channel will improve here in the third quarter from what we've been seeing. We've been, I guess, a little surprised that it hasn't been stronger. Some markets though, kind of, the independent dealers, don't participate in as much. So if you look at the store growth, the comp store growth that we talked about, you have some different markets that company-owned stores service, including a new homebuilders and the like. And the independent dealers, typically, don't go after some of those markets where we've probably seen the strongest growth as new home construction, up over 20%, as an example. So I think the dealers are being somewhat cautious here. And I think that the third quarter, assuming that they've been cautious on their buying patterns, we'd see a little -- a better performance in the third quarter because, overall, we still see the market as good. Yes, you can say some segments are a little better than others. Commercial is not -- it's improving, but at lower growth rates. So we still think that this is going to be a good year for us in architectural. And I think the dealers will participate in that improvement, and I just don't think we've seen it is as much. And of course, this is true two-step distribution in the case of the dealers. So many times, they buy during window periods and then, either hold less or more inventories where, in the store network, you're almost direct-to-customer. So I would -- although we don't track it directly, I think the dealers are sitting on fairly conservative inventories. So if we have continued improvement, we should see for next quarter some improved comps.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nils Wallin, representing CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","A couple here on the marine industry, just curious, one, if your business in the marine segment is still generating positive cash flow? And then, also, given how much weakness we've seen over the last couple of quarters, what you're seeing in terms of competitors whether you expect any type of shakeout from -- because of the weak market?","Charles E. Bunch","So the first question is the marine results for protective -- well, we have a broader business unit, it's Protective and Marine Coatings. So we -- in that business unit, we're also supplying power plants, industrial complexes, infrastructure and the like. But if you just look at the marine business, it's still profitable, both on an EBIT or EBITDA and has positive cash flow. So at this point, I would not say that -- we are certainly not looking to get out of the marine coatings business. This is a sharper cycle, but we plan to ride it through. And I'm not aware, at this point, of any of the global marine players that is planning on exiting the market. The market is much more consolidated today than it has been in the past. There are 4 or 5 major global players. And at this point, I think that we are just planning to ride it out. But we have profitable sales and cash flow right now. But it is, certainly, off of the levels that we were seeing in 2011 or in the early 2000 -- first half of 2012.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Understood. Do you think that in this process of returning to more normal that it normalizes at a lower level? Or can it get back to the previous peak?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, I would say that, yes, there was probably, like in some global industries, there was probably a little bit of a marine new build bubble. And so I think if you look at what was happening, if we go back to 2000 -- let's say, from second half of 2010 to the first half -- through the first half of 2012, that 2-year period was probably, in retrospect or hindsight, maybe a little bit of a bubble. There was a view that all these ships were going to service this growing global trade and that the market was going to be able to absorb all these new fuel-efficient ships. And I think that some of that will play out in the longer-term, but I think as we saw here in the U.S. housing market bubble and the subsequent bust, sometimes when -- you're going to have to endure this period, and the strongest players survive. And we feel that there's nothing in the market, longer-term, that's discouraged us. These are the types of, let's say, more challenging, technologically, for our customers and our chemistry problems and issues to solve for our customers. So this is a market that we belong in. I mean, we paint cars, boats, planes. And the tougher, the better for us. So we feel that this is a market we're going to bring a lot of value to over the years and okay, we're going to have to ride out this lower end of the cycle. But long-term, we feel good about the business.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","So just, if I may, just follow-on. I mean, do you think you can do in marine or replicate in marine what you've done so far and create results in auto OEM in terms of bringing that technology to that market on the downturn?","Charles E. Bunch","Yes, well, we are continuing, because the problems are the same. In fact, if you look at -- one of the biggest issues in the marine coatings industry or the marine industry is fuel efficiency. This is a cost and an environmental issue for the large ship builders or any of the owners, and both the ship owners and the shipping company. So they're looking for solutions all the time. Better products, better technology, and this is an area that we thrive in, in our businesses. So we think that we can bring a lot of solutions over time. When you have a downturn of -- this steep, you're going to have to, I think, take corrective action. The reason we've been able to stay as profitable and positive from a cash flow standpoint is -- and as we've talked about in our European businesses, we've been taking cost out, getting more productive, focusing on the right customers and the right business. The Korean business has held up better than the Chinese markets because these are more specific, higher purpose. These are also drilling ships that are going after oil and other natural resources. So the market hasn't been quite as tough as your more commodity-oriented just oceangoing container vessels. So I think these are areas where longer-term technology will prevail. We've got a lot of things that are going to help, not only improve the painting life, but get at this key driver around the fuel efficiency for these oceangoing vessels. So yes, we feel good about what we're bringing into market, and we're going to ride it out and things will be better. And I hope that in subsequent calls, we're going to be talking about, yes, this thing has started to turn. But this quarter wasn't our best, certainly, in terms of market performance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Nocella, representing RBC Capital Markets.","Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Chuck, just as the raw material environment stabilize here, how are you seeing the pricing dynamics playing out across your coatings businesses?","Charles E. Bunch","In terms of -- we are looking for stability in terms of raw material pricing environment, as well as our pricing initiatives. So right now we see this as a stable period on both sides of the value chain.","Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, within auto refinish, you mentioned solid growth outside of Europe. This has been somewhat of a slower growth business recently, so do you think we're seeing an inflection point here?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, the toughest market in auto refinish has been Europe. We've seen good growth in Asia-Pacific and in particular, China, that's the fastest growing auto park in the world. We're well positioned there. We're the leading player in automotive refinish in China. So we see good growth there. And then, the rest of the world, outside of Europe, we feel that we have a very strong position with the new water-based technologies for automotive refinish. That's positioned us well. And so where there is growth in the market, we're -- we feel we're doing well. In Europe, despite this leading water-based technology, things are weaker there. As I also mentioned in one of our other markets, automotive refinish, typically, is a two-step distribution process. And we saw this during the last, let's call it, economic crisis 3 or 4 years ago in Europe, even though automotive refinish is a very stable market, sometimes, our customers, these two-step distributors, will take inventories down in the near term and try to run tighter and get through these periods. So sometimes, we can have a little stronger -- a little more of a cyclical effect there than you would see in the overall market. So Europe, yes, has been weaker. We think it will come back as the overall market, it is still going to be there. And outside of Europe, we feel pretty good about what's going on.","Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","All right. And are you gaining share on refinish, like OEM, or is it a little bit more competitive?","Charles E. Bunch","It's harder to track. I would say, we feel good about the position that we're in. Certainly, I wouldn't say that there has been any major share shifts, but usually, it takes a while for any data to get out there. It's not tracked as well or as easily as the OEM side.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Hocevar, representing Northcoast Research.","Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research","Most of my questions have been answered at this point, but I was wondering if you could comment on the silica demand. It seems like that improved a bit during the quarter, and I've noticed that there's been a nice uptick in tire shipment data that's come back out the last couple of months. So I'm just wondering if you're seeing a commensurate increase in the tire production side of things and if that's what's driving demand for silica?","Charles E. Bunch","For precipitated silica, the tire market is the biggest end-use market, and we think we're well-positioned in the broader precipitated silica industry to serve the needs of the, let's say, let's call it the green tire movement that we see in the tire companies, where they're trying to improve mileage. Precipitated silica gives improved rolling resistance, so we can actually improve the mileage of the cars. And with CAFE standards in this country or what's happening around the world, we're seeing an uptick in demand for our products. And I think over and above the growth that we've seen in tires. So we feel good about that market and well-positioned, and yes, we had a good quarter in the second quarter.","Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research","Okay. And then, a final question just on the synergy targets for Akzo, just to follow-up on that. I believe, in the past, you stated that $30 million to $40 million in incremental savings, over and above the $60 million of savings realized upon closing, are expected to be realized in the first 12 months. Now you say $102 million by the end of 2014. Does that $30 million to $40 million increase at all over the first 12 months of owning Akzo?","Vincent J. Morales","No, Kevin. If you look of the restructuring charge that we just announced, the $102 million, that's the charge, that's not the savings, first of all. The majority of that, as Dave mentioned, is earmarked to the Akzo business we acquired and our legacy business and are embedded in that synergy number. There is a piece of that, that's not -- that would be what I would call new restructuring savings. The $30 million to $40 million hasn't moved. From April of this year until April of next year, we're still targeting $30 million to $40 million of cost synergies. And again, that's on top of the day one synergies.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas, representing JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you tell us what organic pro forma change in revenues was for the acquired AkzoNobel business?","Vincent J. Morales","Jeff, it was right around flat.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's right around flat?","Vincent J. Morales","Correct.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All right. In general, do you see the do-it-yourself market in the United States really slowing down and the do-it-for-me market really accelerating in the current environment?","Charles E. Bunch","I would say we haven't -- this trend, we haven't seen any changes. It's -- and I would say, if you look at the market, although we did well in our stores channel relative to our national account position, I wouldn't say that there's any -- you wouldn't see, I think, in this shorter term any change. And the one comment I would make on just your question around Akzo North America business, the Canadian market was a little weaker in -- this second quarter, our first quarter of ownership for the business. They are, I think, they've been challenged by the same weather conditions. It's been pretty cold up there, short season. And their housing cycle is maybe a little different than ours. They're not -- they don't have the same kind of growth from this very low level. They maintained pretty stable position in terms of overall housing starts and overall construction market during the crisis. So right now, I would say, the market up there is more stable. And they had a rougher second quarter, I think, in terms of the weather than even we had down here.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then lastly, was there much sequential change in coatings raw materials in the quarter?","Vincent J. Morales","No, Jeff. If you look, the raw material pricing has been fairly consistent. As we came into Q2, we felt it would be it and remained that way. And then, it will remain that way heading into Q3, as Chuck mentioned earlier.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Are there any more charges to come with Akzo after the one you're taking?","David B. Navikas","No, Jeff. There are not.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Young, representing Chemspeak.","William Young","My question relates to, any changes in your long-term procurement strategy for raw materials? And along those lines, where do you stand on your licensing agreement with Billions?","Charles E. Bunch","Long-term procurement strategy for us, we've been trying -- we've had centralized global purchasing of raw materials for many years. And we continue to operate that with the same type of organization and strategy. As we've seen all of this growth for our coatings businesses in Asia and in Europe over the last few years, we think it's going to be a continuation of the same. And the opportunity and the agreement with Billions will give us, we think, as they continue their commitment to continue to grow their position in the global TiO2 industry, we think we have a good opportunity with them and with a number of our other suppliers to continue to grow with them, participate. We've talked -- we had an announcement recently about our Argex commercial development agreement. This is a startup company in Canada, as an example. So we continue to expand as we globalize and expanded our coatings business, expand our relationships with both the traditional and conventional sources of supply, but also new and emerging sources of supply or suppliers in Asia or other startup businesses around the world. So we're pretty confident that our strategy remains the same but we're going to take advantage of some of the new opportunities that we see developing, especially in the emerging regions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer, representing Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Two quick questions. One, on the optical business in Asia and China in particular. I've seen a few things written that looked like they're a little bit cryptic but would give you the sense that maybe you don't have the perfect positioning as far as price points go there with the Transitions business because there's a lower quality, lower price that seems to be taking some share. Can you comment how you think you're set up for the Asia and the China market with Transitions?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, in Asia, in general, the Transitions product lines are traditionally premium products that service high-valued customers that look for the features and benefits that you get from Transitions lens. And we do very well in Asian markets, like Australia, New Zealand, like the key city states, the Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Singapore. But a big part of the market in these emerging regions is the, let's call it, the mid-tier of that pure consumer pyramid from kind of low to low-tier to high-value add. And so we are trying to differentiate our offerings in Transitions so that we would not just try to service the very high end of that pyramid. And I think that we've seen progress that we've made with some of our product introductions in the region, where we're trying to capture more of that growth in the mid-tier price points.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then, just lastly, on Axalta, have you seen any difference in their behavior as they would face customers in the change of ownership?","Charles E. Bunch","We haven't really seen that. It's been just a few months in the marketplace. And so both from an OEM standpoint or refinish, I wouldn't comment on anything that we've seen from them over the last few months. I think it's too early to make any commentary on what we're seeing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn, representing Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Couple of questions, if I may. When you were talking about mid-single digit profitability for the Akzo business, was that on the EBITDA line or the EBIT line?","Vincent J. Morales","It was EBIT.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. So all right, I got it. So that includes the $15 million incremental that you got from not picking up the liabilities?","Vincent J. Morales","Includes the $60 million day one synergies or about $15 million a quarter, plus some additional synergies, yes.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Got it. Second question, your gross margin, if you look at sort of over year-over-year on the company overall, obviously, because you don't break it down by segments. It was up about 1 point and your operating margin was down by about 1 point. So the incremental SG&A expense, as it relates to offsetting the gross margin, sort of what were the key drivers in terms of either business units or divisions that accounted for that?","Vincent J. Morales","Dmitry, the main driver, by far, was the Akzo business, which is a distribution-oriented business, including the stores and other selling costs associated with the distribution business. And if you look at our traditional distribution businesses of that nature, they carry a heavier SG&A component.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","So it sounds like Akzo was a contributor to the gross margin, but a detractor from the operating margin?","Vincent J. Morales","Yes, it has a much lower, obviously, has a much lower, at this point, EBIT return on sales. So it's definitely a detractor to the corporation at this point.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","But I think it's interesting, if I may observe this, that the gross margin profitability does not seem to be all that onerous compared to your other coating businesses or other people's coatings businesses. Is it fair to say that the margin issues that Akzo has been facing forever is related to SG&A, and that's something that you guys can get your hands around fairly quickly?","Vincent J. Morales","No, again, I think if you look at, traditionally, an architectural business, it has a heavy distribution component. It typically has a lot more SG&A, which is, again, all the cost of the stores.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","But a high...","Vincent J. Morales","But a high gross margin. It has store cost, promotional costs, all the stuff that goes into selling to frontline consumers.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Got it. And then, final question on the automotive aftermarket, we've had several quarters going back to the end of 2012 when this segment and this industry was identified as a problem when it came to growth and something that impacted your Performance Coatings business. This quarter, you obviously talked about this being a contributor to the growth that you've seen in the quarter. The carpark didn't get younger, and certainly, not in North America over the last year to sort of justify increased repairs. Is it the weather being slicker out there and more collisions I mean, sort of, what -- did something change in the industry or some sense on these trends in -- and we just have to be conscious of?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, let's be clear. The automotive refinish business has never been a problem for PPG. And I would say that the growth that we're seeing this year, probably on the flip side of -- some of this weather discussion on architectural -- actually, bad weather, especially in the wintertime or the spring actually helps this business. So you may have some increment of business that comes from all the snow and inclement weather we had in North America. And oftentimes, what you see as the economy isn't improving as it is now, is that people -- during the recession, many people were getting the cash-outs from the insurance companies but not having their cars repaired. And so they were just putting that in their pocket and then, waiting until they felt more confident in the economy or their jobs. And I think that's what you're seeing here is that, yes, the economy, overall, is doing better. People are more confident. And regardless of what we've seen even with all these new car builds, hasn't really affected, overall, the average age of the carpark. I think what you're seeing is some positive weather, more usage with the water-based technology and the opportunities that, that's giving us. And I think there's more of a propensity to repair cars that have been in collisions because the economy, overall, is better.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Dan, representing Morgan Stanley.","Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just wanted to clarify all the sort of comments you've talked about, the trends for your U.S. architectural business. And it was down a bit year-over-year on a revenue basis, excluding Akzo, it sounded like this quarter. Your expectation is for lower, sequentially, next quarter. Would you -- does that also translate into down on a year-over-year basis next quarter? Or are you -- because I don't recall that it was a particularly tough comp this quarter, so could you just clarify that?","Vincent J. Morales","Charlie, if you look at our volume performance in Q2, we were down very modestly year-over-year. And up in stores and down in national accounts and dealers, as Chuck mentioned. The dealer, we hope, has some recovery next quarter. Stores has been a very consistent performer for us and we expect that to continue. And the dislocation in the national accounts has come from the product, the 2 price points we discussed earlier that we lost in the national accounts, and that's not going to change in Q3.","Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So putting all that together, you're still expecting revenue growth on an organic basis in the third quarter?","Vincent J. Morales","I think we're -- it's a fine line of whether we're positive or negative, but we're not -- it's just if we could predict the future, we would tell you that but it's not -- we were not very negative in Q2 and we would hope to be positive in Q3 EBIT [ph] .","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard O'Reilly, representing Revere Associates.","Richard O'Reilly","Two quick questions. One is, I want to follow-up with the marine. Typically or historically, what part of your marine coatings is new build versus maintenance, refinish?","Charles E. Bunch","25% of the marine and coatings -- the Marine and Protective Coatings business is new builds. And if you just isolate it on marine itself, it's about half and half between OEM, new builds and aftermarket.","Richard O'Reilly","Okay, fine. Is there a mothballing of existing ships? And if so, would they come out first before the new builds pick up and therefore, some ships would have to be recoated quickly or early on?","Charles E. Bunch","That's an interesting question because there is -- there are ships that are just parked. If you go to Singapore, you have dozens of ships in the harbor that are -- don't have anything to ship right now. So they're just sitting there. But you've seen it in the commercial airline industry. If you look at the success we've seen from Boeing and Airbus, there's a lot of mothballed planes, but they keep building new ones because they're more fuel-efficient, they have higher technology. So you're still going to see some of this. So I think some of these ships that are parked around the world, waiting for cargo to go somewhere, they may never come back in service. But there will be some demand for ships that are either more fuel-efficient, easier from a maintenance standpoint or they're serving specific needs.","Richard O'Reilly","Second question on the prepared comments for the Industrial Coatings product line. There was a statement that said overall results by general industrial end-use markets remain mixed, and I assume it means -- you don't mean geographic, you mean custom or application end markets. Can you elaborate a little more on what's negative or what's positive?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, within the, let's call it, the general industrial or what -- we have an industrial strategic business unit and an Industrial Coatings segment.","Richard O'Reilly","I mean, the product line. Yes.","Charles E. Bunch","And within that Industrial Coatings business unit, we have different end-use markets. So if you look -- probably the strongest component is automotive parts for PPG. That business is in Industrial Coatings. That's not serving -- supplying coatings to General Motors or Mercedes and the like. That's for all the parts, either under the hood, in the chassis or some of the parts that get assembled later. That's the strongest end-use market right now in that general industrial business. The coil and extrusion coatings, that hasn't been very strong because that's been tied again as steel industry and some of the commercial construction, not as strong. Electronics, if you look within electronics, personal computers that take a lot of coatings. That's been down. Coatings on smartphones up, but surface area, that hasn't been as good. Appliance Coatings, good here in North America because we have a nice construction and housing recovery. Poor in Europe because overall construction markets are weak. So it's really a broad market business unit, lots of different end-use plays. So that gives you an idea of kind of some of the puts and takes within the business by end-use market and by region.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Stafford, representing Morningstar.","Jeffrey Stafford - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","With lower TiO2 prices, this is maybe less of a concern, but could you update us on your progress and targets to reduce TiO2 consumption in Coatings?","Charles E. Bunch","I think we commented on that earlier, but last year, we said our target was 4% to 6% productivity or within our formulations of usage, not taking TiO2 out of the formulas, but using it more effectively. We said that we were in the range of 4% to 5% last year in terms of improving that productivity use of TiO2. This year, lesser target. We've gotten some of those savings last year, and we've said it's going to be probably closer to 3% in the range of improved usage given the same type of end-use applications in the formula. And a lot of this is also using other high-value added chemical molecules in our formulations and actually improving the overall performance of the coating, even if we use less TiO2 and substitute it with some of the newer developed molecules we've seen from some of our suppliers. And they're really doing good work here and we're incorporating a lot of these new technologies in our formulations. So we really feel good about the performance of our suppliers in helping us achieve these targets.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Morales for closing remarks.","Vincent J.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Vince Morales. Please proceed.","Vince Morales - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Jackie, and good afternoon, everyone. Once again, this is Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG Industries and welcome you to this teleconference to review PPG\u2019s second quarter 2014 financial results.","Joining me on the call today is Chuck Bunch, PPG\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael McGarry, PPG\u2019s Chief Operating Officer; and Frank Sklarsky, PPG\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, July 17, 2014. I will remind everyone that we posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on our Investor Center at our website ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the opening remarks Chuck will make momentarily. Following Chuck\u2019s perspective on the company\u2019s results for the quarter, we will move to the Q&A session.","Both the prepared commentary, discussion and Q&A on this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the company\u2019s current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG\u2019s operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements.","Today\u2019s presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the presentation appendix, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG\u2019s filings with the SEC.","And now, let me introduce PPG\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch.","Chuck Bunch - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Vince and welcome everyone. Today, we reported record second quarter 2014 financial results from continuing operations, including all-time quarterly adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.83 and record quarterly sales of $4.1 billion. The benefits of our new business portfolio are measurable as our adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 24% this quarter with an average quarterly increase the past six quarters of more than 30%.","We achieved these record results due to our global reach as most major regional economies continue to expand. Our sales growth was 5%, including volume growth of 3%, which was consistent across each major region. In the U.S. and Canada, we continued to see moderate demand increases in most of the end use markets we supply. The overall pace of growth was modest early in the quarter, but accelerated in June. Certain PPG businesses continue to easily outpace the regional economic growth rate such as our automotive OEM business, which grew high single-digit percentages.","Our earnings in this region grew 12%, reflecting our increased sales coupled with additional synergies from our prior year architectural coatings acquisition. In Europe, the demand recovery continued and broadened in terms of its PPG impact as more of our businesses achieved volume improvements. The year-over-year pace of sales improvement was slightly lower than the first quarter of 2014 but that was due to the strengthening of the prior year comparison period.","We delivered 28% earnings improvement in Europe. We continue to realize excellent earnings contributions from the gradual regional economic improvement illustrating our earnings leverage driven by our previous aggressive cost reduction actions. Europe represents about one-third of our total sales and we expect this earnings leverage to continue. In Asia and Latin America combined earnings grew 14%. In Asia we achieved higher volumes driven by increased automotive OEM and general industrial demand in China and India. Overall Latin American volumes declined slightly with continuing growth in Mexico offset by weakness in South America primarily Brazil.","In addition to our continued strong operating performance, our strategic actions and ongoing cash deployment were also notable factors in our earnings growth. As I mentioned earlier we achieved additional acquisition related cost synergies from last year\u2019s North American architectural coatings acquisition. And on a run rate basis we have delivered about 75% of the targeted $200 million synergy target in just 15 months. These include administrative procurement related and operational cost savings plus the earnings benefit from closing about 100 redundant or underperforming company-owned stores in the second half of 2013. We expect the synergy capture to be nearly complete by year end on a run rate basis which keeps us ahead of the schedule.","We have also completed several bolt-on acquisitions this year including Canal Supplies, Painter\u2019s Supply, Masterwork and Homax. In aggregate these acquisitions are expected to add about $75 million in annual sales. But most noteworthy on June 30, we announced an agreement to acquire Comex, a leading Latin American architectural and industrial coatings company and one of the highest quality coatings businesses in the world. Let me give you a brief update on the activities that have occurred in just a few weeks following the signing of the acquisition agreement.","We held a pre-filing meeting and then submitted a formal filing with the Mexican Competition Commission requesting approval of the transaction. As is customary in transactions of this nature the commission issued a hold order indicating that the transaction needs to remain open pending completion of their review. We continued to anticipate that the commission will complete its work in order for the acquisition to close in four to six months. We are very excited about the value this transaction will bring to PPG and we are looking forward to working with Comex\u2019s customers and employees. With regard to other cash deployment actions we repurchased $100 million or about 500,000 shares of PBG stock in the quarter. We halted share repurchases in the middle of the quarter due to the Comex acquisition negotiations which concluded by quarter end.","We ended the quarter with $2.9 billion of cash and short-term investments and we remain highly focused on additional cash deployment for earnings accretive opportunities. We are still targeting earnings accretive cash deployment of $3 billion to $4 billion in 2014 and 2015 combined. Our acquisition pipeline remains active and we expect to complete additional share repurchases in the second half of 2014.","Looking ahead, we anticipate moderate global expansion and we remain well positioned geographically and with lower structural costs to deliver excellent earnings performance from the increased global demand. In addition, we still have a variety of PPG specific earnings levers remaining. These include additional use of our strong balance sheet and cash position and further demand recovery in some of our largest regions such as Europe and end use markets such as U.S. commercial construction, where demand levels remain well below pre-recession levels.","In summary, we have again delivered record financial performance driven by benefits from our strategic initiatives, cash deployment, new PPG technologies and continued aggressive management of our businesses. And we remain optimistic regarding continued growth for PPG. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And this concludes our prepared remarks.","Now, operator, would you please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Thank you, Chuck. Chuck, you mentioned June picking up in the quarter, can you discuss what you think drove that pickup? Was it just normal seasonal activity? And what that has led to in July trends in terms of business volume?","Chuck Bunch","Well, as you know the first quarter, especially here in North America was weak due to the harsh winter. We came into April I think still without the momentum that we had seen last year in some of our major businesses and construction-related businesses in particular. You had later Easter, you had fewer selling days earlier in the month, and I think as we saw the weather improve over all of the geographies here in North America. And I think in Europe, we had what I would call regular weather patterns, so that we felt that by the second half of the second quarter, so the last month in particular, we saw lot of momentum building especially in the construction markets, but you saw it also in the automotive sales and we had a number of new programs that were started in the back half of the second quarter. So, I would say that there were some seasonal or weather-related events, but also I think some of PPG\u2019s programs were ticking in as the quarter progressed.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Chuck, on the same bent, how would you characterize this U.S. spring and ongoing summer paint season versus prior years or even expectations?","Chuck Bunch","Well, let me \u2013 I am going to ask Michael McGarry, our newly named Chief Operating Officer to respond. Michael has had responsibility for our architectural businesses globally. Michael?","Michael McGarry","Yes. David, I would say that this year is better than last year and then it\u2019s continuing to trend up. We had good performance in our stores that have been opened for more than one year. And we saw continued \u2013 actually in Canada, we had a nice recovery in Canada as well despite the fact that Canada by and large is a very challenging market. So, I\u2019d say overall, it\u2019s trending upward.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Thank you very much.","Chuck Bunch","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","Thanks. Chuck, your OEM auto growth continues to significantly outpace the market. I am just wondering what\u2019s driving that, is that new products, I mean, you mentioned one of the things helping business overall is just your customers adopting your new technologies? And sort of along those lines, do you have any sort of innovation or freshness index in terms of percentage of sales coming from new products, both current and where you would like it to go?","Chuck Bunch","Yes. As we have discussed before, our automotive OEM business has a lot of momentum. Two of the key drivers have been on the technology side both our new generation-seven electrodeposition coatings and we are getting an adoption rate that is accelerating on a global basis. And as the industry has continued to globalize, we are seeing adoption rates faster at our customers from new technology. The other new technology for OEM automotive coatings is the new B1:B2 PPG compact process. We are also getting very good success rates as this technology moves into brand new of automotive assembly plants. I think what we have seen over the last few years we were introducing the technology, but it really paid off best in brand new assembly plants where you could design the coatings systems, the ovens, the electrodeposition coatings around this new technology. So we have seen an acceleration of the adoption of those two technologies B1:B2 Compact Process or the top coat systems. So I would say that has caused some of the acceleration in our volume growth for PPG. We are also very well positioned with some of the companies that have been growing fastest on a global basis. So if you look at our new products and we are trying to have over 30% new products on a five year rolling basis and we are certainly ahead of that phase in the automotive OEM business.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","Okay. And then just as a follow-up on the portfolio side you seem to have a major announcement every quarter, I guess the remaining business that doesn\u2019t fit is the glass business and I am just wondering what the future of that business in the PPG portfolio is, is it something you want to get the returns up before you divest it or is it something you would consider keeping?","Chuck Bunch","At this point we have considered those businesses less core for PPG, but still strategically important. We think that we have more to do in those businesses. We have continued to invest in them. We think there are good opportunities with the market recoveries and some of the regional growth to improve the performance. And as you have noted we have been quite busy with our portfolio actions in last year and this year commodity chemicals, the transitions optical business, these big acquisitions. So we are aware of our performance in that business and the opportunities to improve and at this point we have no further news to report.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","Thank you.","Vince Morales","Thanks Don.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays","The refinish business you had talked about the rough winter should lead to pickup in summer, one, are we seeing that uptick in refinish and two what\u2019s happened with market share in refinish as there has been a little bit of turnover in one of your big competitors, changing and stuff like that, where do we stand with market share in refinish?","Chuck Bunch","Well, I would say Duffy that first of all we are seeing volume improvement in refinish here in North America as we come out of the winter. And we have also seen a modest pickup in Europe in our refinish business and the business in Asia-Pacific also continues to grow. So I think we are pleased to see continued growth, top line growth on the refinish side. Here in the North America or even globally with some of the \u2013 we have seen the competitors remain fairly similar in terms of the players competing in the market. We do not have however with this business let\u2019s say is up to \u2013 as up-to-date volume and share information. It usually takes us a little longer in this segment because the publicly available data is not always correct. I would say that we have seen somewhat of a stable share situation from our perspective. There is movement within the market between the large multi-shop operators and some of the smaller ones. So we are seeing some consolidation there in terms of the Bodyshop network. So there are continuing consolidation trends globally in the downstream portion of the refinish or automotive collision markets. But I would say it\u2019s too early to really say that there have been any significant share shifts regionally or globally.","Frank Sklarsky","I think Duffy the only thing I would add to what Chuck said, this is Frank, is that in Asia-Pacific, China specifically, China is going to produce something like 23 million units this year. And as they produce more the car park in China will continue to grow pretty substantial and we will continue to benefit from that. So were \u2013 the Asia or the China growth is probably a little bit higher than the overall global growth for us and we already have a significant position, market position in China. So we will benefit from that sector trend going forward with that car park growth.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays","Great. And then second question probably for Frank, when we anniversary the shutdown of those 100 stores on the combination between new and the acquired business, should we think about a financial impact when we anniversary that? Do we get a pick up or kind of a reduction in cost at that point or will that be pretty smooth and unnoticeable?","Frank Sklarsky","It\u2019s not going to be a huge financial impact. Those were done pretty much in the more so in the second half of 2013 and so we will lap that by the end of this year. The impact you will see is that overall year-over-year compares on sales will improve, because those stores would have been lower performing than the legacy stores, but no major financial impact.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays","Great, thanks fellows.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","John McNulty - Credit Suisse","Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. So, for the first one as far as the marine business goes, it\u2019s been struggling for a while, it does seem like it\u2019s leveling off, at least on a sequential basis, but based on kind of your knowledge of the order books that are out there, I guess when should we be expecting the final turn in that business where we actually start to see good positive year-over-year growth?","Chuck Bunch","John, I would say that here in the second quarter, we had still modestly negative volumes in protective and marine. The marine business, notably in China and Korea, has been continuing to weaken, but at improving trends, let\u2019s call it. And if you look at new order bookings for us, we are now we think we have turned a corner in terms of volume growth in the business trending with this order book improvement. So, I would say by the end of this year and certainly the first quarter of next year, you are going to see these new bookings showing up on our sales top line for the business.","John McNulty - Credit Suisse","Great, thanks. And then as a follow up in the performance business, certainly the margins continue to push higher, which is impressive at these levels. I guess my question is with the launch that you have had around some of the new re-branding that you are doing, both in the stores and in the architectural business and even outside the stores of the big boxes. Can you walk us through how to think about what the incremental costs were there that might have been one-time that may have even held back the margins a little bit despite what looked like pretty good ones?","Michael McGarry","Yes. John, this is Michael. I would say that from the cost side, we probably not want to get into that, but the way to think about it going forward is that we continue to get our cost structure lower, the stores are gone. We have consolidated sales into the higher performing stores. Chuck talked earlier about the run rate of the synergies were going north of where we were and we are going to be probably 90% of the $200 million number we gave you by the end of the year. So, I would tell you that everything is moving in the right direction.","John McNulty - Credit Suisse","Great, thanks very much for the color.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.","Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities","Yes. Congratulations Michael on the promotion. Just to follow up on that, did you \u2013 can you update us on where the margins are on the Akzo North American business? I think you guys had indicated those they were mid single-digits in Q1, where do we stand now and how does that trajectory look for the balance of the year?","Michael McGarry","Yes. We were low double-digits in the second quarter. And obviously, our goal is to continue to move that north, Frank. So, we feel pretty good about it. When we took it over, it was basically a breakeven business at best, so a significant improvement. The team has done an outstanding job of moving that north.","Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities","It sounds like that\u2019s ahead of expectations even your expectations, if it\u2019s\u2026","Michael McGarry","I don\u2019t know, you have to ask Chuck about that.","Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities","And you mentioned earlier in terms of share buyback that you stopped halfway through the quarter, after doing $100 million, because you knew you had the Comex negotiations going on, but that you are going to restart that here as we progress. Is the way for us to think about that is our run-rate kind of quarterly double that number absent another large transaction that might be on the horizon, how should we think about the pace of the buybacks for the balance of the year?","Frank Sklarsky","Yes. I mean, I think this is Frank, while we don\u2019t get too specific on when exactly we will be in the market, Q1 we did 200, as you know we did 100 in Q2. I think it\u2019s safe to assume that we have always said it will be part of our capital allocation strategy for the back half including share repurchase. So, we will be back in the market in the second half for some amount. Again, it\u2019s always going to depend on the economic conditions, always going to depend on acquisition activity. We still do look at the pipeline of acquisitions and that is our preferred route to grow the top line organically, inorganically, but we will be definitely doing some share repurchases in the back half.","Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities","Alright, great. And then lastly you mentioned that the maintenance costs were heavy in the first half of 2014, care to quantify that and what sort of a tailwind will that be for the balance of this year?","Vince Morales","Hey, Frank, this is Vince. You are talking I think about our glass segment, we have some planned maintenance and repair work coming in to the year as we communicated in the fourth quarter. In total, for the first half, it was about $17 million of year-over-year delta in terms of costs. For the back half of the year, we expect the year-over-year delta to be negligible.","Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities","Terrific. Thanks so much.","Chuck Bunch","Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good afternoon. Could you comment on your expectations for titanium dioxide, acrylic, and other raw material costs in the back half of the year versus the first half of 2014?","Chuck Bunch","Kevin, I would say that we are \u2013 we look at the trends as very flat right now. So, for TiO2 we didn\u2019t see much movement between the first and second quarter and we are really not anticipating for TiO2 any movements up. For some of our emulsions, we are seeing also similar trends of little to know inflation. There is some noise around vinyl acetate monomer, but at this point, I would say that they are not strong. So, as we have commented earlier, low single-digit kind of inflationary pressure on raw materials and that would include natural gas that is up from last year although stable right now. We have a few other inflationary costs out there such as transportation, but right now, we see trends in the second half for raw materials and other costs, low single-digits.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. And then the second question has to do with your store count, you mentioned the rationalization last year, I think back in May, you indicated a medium-term plan to add 180 to 220 stores through 2016. So, early days versus that timeframe, but I think you have made a number of bolt-on acquisitions that seem to be bringing stores with them. So perhaps you could update us on where you might be this year in terms of organic and acquired stores?","Michael McGarry","Yes, Kevin, this is Michael. So, we picked up 10 stores in the Connecticut area, 13 stores here in the Pittsburg area. We are on a run rate to add probably in the range of 22 stores in the U.S. and about 17 stores in Canada. And so when you look at the number we gave you we are certainly thinking that, that\u2019s the minimum that we are looking at over that period of time.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, just to follow up, Mike, you think you maybe able to exceed the 45 goal that you had for this year given 39 are in the books?","Michael McGarry","I think that\u2019s going to be probably where we finish.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you very much.","Chuck Bunch","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed.","Ghansham Panjabi - Baird","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. First off, can you just sort of update us with your thoughts on commercial construction in the U.S.? Your competitor that reported this morning was quite bullish on the trend line there, do you share that same enthusiasm?","Chuck Bunch","We have been seeing an improving trend as we went through the second quarter. We didn\u2019t see as much in the first quarter. And as we look at a couple of our businesses the touch commercial construction, including the flat glass business that really reported in the second quarter the best volumes that they have seen for their business since 2007 and there are a commercial construction business, although they also saw some improvement on the residential side. I would say overall in our other businesses that touch commercial construction here, we are seeing good improvement but it was \u2013 it came later in the second quarter. But we are seeing very positive trend, so we are optimistic that these will continue in the second half of the year.","Ghansham Panjabi - Baird","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then on architectural EMEA, how did the volumes come in relative to your initial expectations for the quarter. And have you also seen any improvement in Eastern Europe?","Michael McGarry","This is Michael again. Yes, I would tell you that we had very nice improvements. The areas that were up were the UK, Benelux. You had all of the Eastern Europe was up significantly. This is a nice trend for us and overall we are \u2013 we would say the only area that is still under pressure I would call it flattish is France.","Ghansham Panjabi - Baird","Okay, thanks so much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","Thanks very much and congrats, Michael.","Michael McGarry","Thank you, Bob.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","I wanted to ask maybe some granular data around the U.S. architectural market, I think you mentioned your big box revenues were up mid-single, your stores were up better than that, and your dealer network \u2013 or independent network, worse than that is should I read something about the variation in pricing power across those channels, or any shift in DIY versus contractor trends, what would you describe the difference between the channels to?","Michael McGarry","I think the difference, Bob really goes to the way they go to market. So the DIY guys show up in the home centers and I would tell you that we had good home center numbers. We also had some new products that we rolled out with Ralph Lauren with the Glidden Professional. So that was the positive. The dealers obviously are working hard in their own segment, so they are a little more challenged in the contract end market. So I don\u2019t think there were any surprises in there.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","And you had cited an outlook of modest U.S. growth, your big competitor in Cleveland certainly seemed a little bit more enthusiastic, so might you give me a definition of modest?","Michael McGarry","I would say 5% plus is the areas that we are looking at.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","Got it and the last one, Chuck, hallmark of the paint industry is its stability and I noticed on the monthly volume trends you gave, April was up 3, May was flat, June was up 7, that doesn\u2019t really speak to stability, is that atypical, or is it just normally we see a quarterly number and we don\u2019t know that there\u2019s quite as much month-to-month volatility in year-on-year trends?","Chuck Bunch","Well, we track these things on a daily and weekly basis too. I would say that typically you don\u2019t see that much variability around these normally seasonal trends. But I would say this year especially here in North America, the season just started coming a little later than usual. And although we said that the first quarter was notably weaker because of the weather, we still saw that continuing. We have a bigger share now up in Canada, which had some of these same seasonal trends. So we were encouraged because we came into the year saying, hey the overall construction indexes are going to get better, we have seen the growth improving over the last couple of years. We didn\u2019t get it in the first four months. May was, we thought, going to be a little better than it turned out to be. We didn\u2019t have as many ship days. But I think as we have worked through some of the inventory by the time they started to reorder in June we saw some good uptick. So normally less variability but we think this is the start of the good seasonal trend now for the rest of the season.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","Great, thanks for the help.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed.","John Roberts - UBS","Thanks for taking my call.","Chuck Bunch","Hi John.","John Roberts - UBS","I\u2019m looking at Slide 7 and I really like the format of that presentation of the adjusted earnings per share trend. The last four, the right-most four orange boxes are all roughly similar in size. And you have mentioned you are going to start to anniversary the easy comps on Akzo, and if comps get a little bit more challenging on auto OEM. So should we think of \u2013 I know you don\u2019t give specific guidance, but we should maybe think about the orange boxes maybe back in the first half of 2013 is kind of where we will start seeing comps level off to?","Vince Morales","John, this is Vince. As you know our portfolio is a bunch of different businesses and I certainly agree with your comments that we will start to anniversary some of the acquisition synergies. But if you remember last year, first half Europe was very week. We still have a lot of recovery growth left in Europe in our opinion. We still \u2013 we are battling all of last year as we pointed out earlier, tough marine market and a sluggish commercial construction market and we still have those tailwinds coming. And so there is still I think \u2013 and we still have cash deployment as another avenue as we get later in this year certainly as four to six months from now when we close Comex. So I still think there is a lot of opportunities to continue this trend up to some degree.","John Roberts - UBS","Good answer. And then on Slide 11, the acquisition, you said the acquisitions add $75 million in sales, but only $24 million has been spent on acquisitions, do we have still some cash outflow to go with those additional smaller ones you did recently?","Vince Morales","Yes. There is the Homax one closed just after the beginning of the third quarter. So there will be more money that will have gone out at that time at which, for the sales which are included in that $75 million.","John Roberts - UBS","Okay. Thank you.","Vince Morales","Thanks, John.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Sure. Thanks very much. I am just looking at the Slide 5 here with the sequential volume trends, do you think the sequential growth rate decelerating in Europe from 4% to 3%, is that just the function of the comps being easier in the prior quarter or were you not \u2013 were you surprised that you didn\u2019t see sort of a pickup?","Chuck Bunch","The weakest quarter last year for Europe was the first quarter, so it wasn\u2019t easier comp. So we didn\u2019t see any deceleration. It\u2019s still modest growth recovery, but we are not concerned that the trend is going in wrong way.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then just how is it looking going in to 3Q so far?","Vince Morales","In Europe, Vincent?","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Yes.","Vince Morales","We said in our prepared remarks and we see that trend, it\u2019s very early obviously in the quarter, but we actually have volume growth in almost every business in Q2. And that wasn\u2019t the case in 1Q. So again, we think the general recovery again still modest in early innings, but we do think it\u2019s broadening.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Alright. Okay. Thanks very much.","Vince Morales","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed.","Dan Juster - Citi","Hi, this is Dan Juster on for P.J. this afternoon.","Vince Morales","Hi, Dan.","Dan Juster - Citi","So on packaging coatings, it seems like your European volumes have been declining for three or four consecutive quarters now even as you just mentioned that sort of other volume in the region is starting to improve, so can you just walk us through some of the factors that are impacting that particular business. And I think comps get better in the second half, so should we expect to see some sort of the stabilization later this year?","Chuck Bunch","The packaging coatings business, there are several factors at work especially in the European market. It has been slower season in Europe. You also have technology transition going to these BPA free coatings. So there has been some whole holding back of volumes waiting for some of these technology changes. But as I mentioned in my previous quarterly remarks, we have seen heightened competitive activity especially positioning before some of these technology changes. So you are I think also seeing the impact of that in Europe on the overall marketplace.","Dan Juster - Citi","Thank you. And then quickly on back to the U.S. architectural market, you talked about some new products that were launched Ralph Lauren, Olympic ELITE any channel fill benefit in the quarter that you can point to?","Frank Sklarsky","Not significant.","Vince Morales","This is Vince. We had only a partial quarter of those products. The products are being set throughout the quarter, so we didn\u2019t have a full benefit in the quarter.","Dan Juster - Citi","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please proceed.","Nils Wallin - CLSA","Yes. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. On Europe, the profit improvement is 28% or so, it seems pretty remarkable given volumes I think in that geography were only up 3%, so would you walk us through what were the other contributors to profit growth i.e. price, currency and then if you are still tracking those 35% to 40% incremental margins in that region?","Frank Sklarsky","Yes. And that last comment of yours really nails it because as we had said previously we expected based on the cost reduction actions, all the rationalization that was taking place that we would have expected 30% to 40% incremental to the bottom line form the additional volume and we are seeing accretion at the high end of that range. And its volume on the fact that we don\u2019t have much incremental fixed costs on either administrative side nor the capacity side, because we are still obviously significantly below peak volume. So there is additional \u2013 plenty of additional capacity utilization that we can take up as the volumes accrete. Modest \u2013 very modest pricing environment, a little bit of help from currency on the euro on a year-over-year basis as you know, so that helped a little bit. But volume in the basically mid-single digits range. And some of the business and as Vince said are becoming more broad based is what really drove that utilization. So we are seeing that 40% range of the accretion.","Nils Wallin - CLSA","Got it. Then on, I know you have mentioned number of times, back when you announced the Comex deal and obviously in this quarterly comments the quality of the assets, are there assets out there geographically that you can that might be of a comparable quality that you could be interested in?","Vince Morales","Nils, this is Vince. We don\u2019t particularly talk about any specific targets. We do think coatings pace is as our portfolio changes have occurred over the last decade indicate, remains a very, very good space. There are small, medium, and in some cases large competitors out there, potential targets for us. So yes, I think we expect to continue to consolidate space over the next couple of years. And one of the benefits of the coatings industry is the amount of free cash flow we have. And again, we would use that again for quite some time to grow inorganically.","Nils Wallin - CLSA","Okay. Thanks. And then just one more if I may. It seems like recently you have done a number of independent distributors in the U.S. versus company-owned stores, is there a preference for independent distributors as you look to expand in the U.S., North America architectural and what might that be?","Michael McGarry","Nil, this is Michael. I would tell you that the independent distribution we bought really boiled down the fact that they had no succession plans. And they came to us and asked us to facilitate their long-term plans and we took advantage of that. Obviously, we favour our own stores if they were a chance, but we love the dealer market as well, so we participate in both of them.","Nils Wallin - CLSA","Thanks so much.","Vince Morales","Thanks, Nils.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","Good afternoon, guys. A lot of the questions have been answered, but I just want to follow-up on the share repurchases, I think that \u2013 was it two weeks ago when you had the conference call on the Comex announcement, you talked about suspending share repurchases until the deal closes, but now you are talking about being back in the market in the second half of this year, so did you get a different ruling or a premium from your counsel or was it just a sort of internal change of direction?","Frank Sklarsky","No, we \u2013 I think we have been pretty consistent in our commentary that it was obviously appropriate for us to suspend the share repurchases when we were in discussions with earnest with Comex during the second quarter, so that\u2019s why we did the $100 million. And consistent with all of our counsel and the guidance we gave a couple of weeks ago, we are free to be back in the market as long as we are not in position of any material non-public information. And so that\u2019s why we are say as we did at that time that we could be back in the market in the second half.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","Okay, alright. Thank you for that clarification. You have been touching base as a follow-up on your international businesses outside of North America and EMEA, in Asian architectural business and industrial business, you talked about seeing a little bit of pickup in the industrial side, can you talk about the environment in the architectural side of the business both in terms of China and Australia and other parts of Asia. And then on Latin America, this morning your Cleveland based competitor was pretty pessimistic about at least 2014 results in that region, given the economics and the foreign exchange issues, sort of what are you seeing and kind of how do you view that market for the balance of this year and into next year?","Michael McGarry","Dmitry, this is Michael. If you look at China our market was up low-double digits, earnings were up as well. Australia, we were up mid-single digits and earnings were up. In Brazil it was not a good market, but our earnings were up as well, as we took advantage of the cost, the ability to get cost out. So in all the architectural segments around the world we had improved performance.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","Okay. So you had double-digit growth in China in architectural paints?","Michael McGarry","Yes. That\u2019s correct.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","Okay, great. And that was quite a reversal from I think you had a little bit of a loss in volumes even as late as the first quarter, so is something that\u2019s changed there in the market or in how you go to market sort of\u2026?","Michael McGarry","In China, we have had continuous upward trend. And in Australia we have also been growing there as well.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","Okay. So the overall Asian paints business being down last quarter in volumes, I assume that was areas outside of China that were weak or how do I?","Vince Morales","Dmitry this is Vince, that was marine impact.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","Okay. I thought that maybe we were talking about just performance coatings and architectural coatings last time as well, but maybe I am wrong. Alright, thank you.","Chuck Bunch","The marine is in performance coatings segment.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of James Sheehan with SunTrust. Please proceed.","James Sheehan - SunTrust","Yes. Thank you for taking my question. In performance coatings, you referenced some cost inflation and you have got some price increases out there to offset that, when do you anticipate being fully caught up on the cost inflation that you referenced?","Vince Morales","Yes. James this is Vince. We enacted pricing in the first quarter in anticipation of what we were seeing in transportation markets somewhat on the weak retail wage side. We are complete in terms of cost versus price at this point. And so we don\u2019t expect much more inflation more than we have today in those two buckets. And we have modest targeted pricing but not material for the segment overall in the back half of the year.","James Sheehan - SunTrust","Alright. Thanks a lot, Vince.","Vince Morales","Thanks James.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Hope you are doing well. Yes, thanks. I guess the first question was just on aerospace it\u2019s been a pretty decent market for you guys for a little while, what\u2019s your outlook going forward and do you think you can keep up mid to high-single digit growth rates there?","Chuck Bunch","We are still quite optimistic about the aerospace market. If you look at the commercial mainframe OEM builds from Boeing and Airbus, they are quite strong with good backlogs. We are seeing modest pickup in business aviation and the aftermarket especially with the airline profitability is also improving. So we continue to see similar trends. Military has been somewhat muted, but overall we are not seeing a trend, a change in the trends that we have experienced and we are quite optimistic that the market is going to continue to be \u2013 to perform well.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks. And then another question kind of higher level, I mean historically your earnings and your top line growth was very tied to global IP, but with all the portfolio moves, it seems like that\u2019s come down a little bit, so if we do see a material pickup in global IP over the next couple of years, would you think to see a similar benefit from it as you did in the past or you think they would be less so?","Vince Morales","No, I think we still have \u2013 we have obviously over the past couple of years expanded or exploded to the U.S. commercial construction market, residential construction market. But we still have a close link to global IP, so I think the relationship you mentioned still exist.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks.","Vince Morales","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Eugene Fedotoff with KeyBanc. Please proceed.","Eugene Fedotoff - KeyBanc","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just have a follow up on packaging coatings can you talk about volume trends that you are seeing outside of Europe and whether you saw a pick-up in demand before or during World Cup?","Chuck Bunch","The volume trends here in North America were slightly positive, but modest. The Asia continues to be a growth market for packaging coatings and that continued. We didn\u2019t see a noticeable change in the industry for the World Cup. And you had a lot of other trends going on in South America at the time from volumes, currencies and the like. So, we did not see a specific change in demand for the industry due to the World Cup.","Eugene Fedotoff - KeyBanc","Thanks for that color. And also you mentioned the recovery in general industrial coatings can you talk a little bit more in details about the specific markets, end markets that are leading that recovery?","Chuck Bunch","Well, for our industrial coatings business, the strongest market globally has been automotive parts. We have seen good growth in the global automotive industry as we have indicated, but our business has continued to perform well there. Coil and extrusion markets, again they are tied more to construction. We have seen some growth there as well. Heavy duty equipment in the developed regions was a positive story, although in the developing regions in Asia, a little less so. Consumer electronics, what I would call, mixed return to growth overall, but I would say not at some of the growth trends that we have seen earlier. So, those would be a few of the markets that we have seen improving. Appliance was also better in all the regions geographically.","Eugene Fedotoff - KeyBanc","Great, thanks. And just a last question on Comex, do you think \u2013 and I am sorry if I missed that, do you think there is a potential upside to the 3%, 4% synergies that you initially identified? ","Frank Sklarsky","We just announced the deal a couple of weeks ago, Eugene. So, when I think we are still going with our original financial projections.","Eugene Fedotoff - KeyBanc","Thanks a lot.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Robert Walker with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Robert Walker - Jefferies","Alright, thank you. On auto OEM, how much of your above market growth can you attribute to new capacity wins versus customer retrofits or other items, just wondering kind of how vulnerable the growth rates could be if auto capacity growth slowed?","Chuck Bunch","Could you repeat the question again?","Robert Walker - Jefferies","Alright, yes. The above market growth you are seeing in auto OEM, how much of that is attributed to winning higher share of new auto facilities versus kind of de-captivating existing facilities for other customers having a customer retrofitted of a plant?","Chuck Bunch","Well, I would say that the \u2013 thinking of one of the biggest trends here recently in the global industry has been the amount of new assembly plants. So, typically, those are the best opportunities to win new business is when a plant has, is just commissioning and I would say that we feel that we are winning our share \u2013 more than our share as these new plants get commissioned, because it\u2019s an opportunity to introduce new technologies. You see less share shift on let\u2019s say the facilities that have been in existence for a while if they are performing well. So, I would say that there will still be new automotive assembly plants starting up over the next couple of years. You have seen a number of them in China, Mexico. You have seen a number of new assembly plants announced. So, I would say the trend is still encouraging there. And I don\u2019t think that all these plants and some of them that were winning business have yet ramped up to full capacity. So, I think there is an opportunity for more growth from some of these new facilities, but those will be the two countries that we see the most growth in, in terms of new construction.","Robert Walker - Jefferies","Alright, thank you. And then a question for Frank, in terms of free cash flow generation, do you expect a similar pattern to previous years and kind of overall, what kind of free cash flow to net income ratio should we expect this year?","Frank Sklarsky","Well, without getting into too much specific on the percentage, we do expect a similar pattern to prior years, where things do pickup in the back half. We are spending a little bit more in CapEx this year, but all that CapEx is very, very accretive in terms of capacity expansion that we expect to get a very quick return on making good progress on working capital as we go through the year. So, similar pattern and it\u2019s always going to be kind of a high double-digit conversion ratio of cash flow to net income. So, it\u2019s safe to assume that.","Robert Walker - Jefferies","So, do you mean 90% plus or?","Frank Sklarsky","It\u2019s going to depend on the quarter and on the month, but overall, it will be in the certainly more than 80% conversion ratio for the year.","Robert Walker - Jefferies","Okay, thank you.","Chuck Bunch","Thanks, Rob.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Richard O\u2019Reilly with Revere and Associates. Please proceed.","Richard O\u2019Reilly - Revere and Associates","Okay, thank you. Good afternoon guys. I also wanted to ask about the Comex synergy target and I guess why only a 3% to 4%, not that there is upside to that, but it just seems like a low number, low percentage. Can you explain is it because you don\u2019t have a footprint there, there is no corporate savings?","Chuck Bunch","Rich, if you go back to the June 30 call we held, this is an asset that from a geographic perspective is tremendously complementary to us, but we have no meaningful architectural presence in Mexico. That limits in a certain degree some of the operational synergies we would get out of the transaction. So, this is more of a plug and play type transaction as opposed to our prior acquisition last year, where we had tremendous overlap both administratively and operationally. So, I think \u2013 and this is a high-quality asset, because it\u2019s well run as well. So, I think those two factors are the predominant reasons why you are seeing the synergy target we put out there, which is still a nice synergy target by the way.","Richard O\u2019Reilly - Revere and Associates","And second question, a quick question, a math question, what the business unit you call now specialty coatings and materials, the (indiscernible) and optical materials, are those volumes within that aggregate coatings volume of 3%, are they within that slide there or does that slide exclude that?","Frank Sklarsky","It would include the overall coatings volume improvement would include specialty coatings and materials, you could say the specialty coatings and materials probably has a growth rate above that smaller business, smaller component in the total, but it is in the number.","Richard O\u2019Reilly - Revere and Associates","Okay, fine. Okay. So, it\u2019s basically the two coating segments excluding the glass segment?","Chuck Bunch","That\u2019s correct, Rich.","Frank Sklarsky","Yes, specialty coatings and materials is in the industrial coating segment.","Richard O\u2019Reilly - Revere and Associates","And it\u2019s now in the industrial, okay, good. Thanks a lot for that.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. And with that, I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Vince Morales.

My name is Denise and I will be your conference specialist today. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Scott Minder, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Scott Minder","Good afternoon. This is Scott Minder, Direct of Investor Relations. We appreciate your interest in PPG and welcome you to our first quarter 2017 financial results teleconference. Joining me in the call from PPG are Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments related to the financial information released on Thursday April 20, 2017.","I will remind everyone that we have posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the Investor Center of our website ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the opening comments Michael will make momentarily. Following Michael\u2019s perspective on the Company\u2019s quarterly results, we will move to Q&A session. In this session, we request that you focus your question of PPG\u2019s first quarter results. We do not intend to provide any additional or new information regarding our proposals to combine with AkzoNobel at this time, other than what Michael will say in his opening comments.","Both the prepared commentary and the discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the Company\u2019s current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG\u2019s operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The Company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements.","This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The Company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG\u2019s filings with the SEC.","Now, let me introduce PPG\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.","Michael McGarry","Thank you, Scott and welcome. First and foremost, I still submit, it is impossible to know what is best for you stakeholders until you fully evaluate all the options. We believe AkzoNobel\u2019s new, strategic plan will be more risky and creates more uncertainty for Akzo\u2019s, stakeholders including employees and pensioners. Facts are that Akzo\u2019s newly revised strategy would create two smaller unproven companies and a detailed additional restructuring. The contemplating restructuring overall and specifically the restructuring actions associated with the headquarter related stranded costs are very surprisingly inconsistent with Akzo\u2019s previously stated comments of safeguarding job security especially in the Netherlands.","Separately, Akzo is also critical to PPG\u2019s proposal, given the combination that companies would involve an antitrust review process. However, included under Akzo\u2019s dual-track process is a clear option articulated to sell their specialty chemicals business, which would be subject to a detailed antitrust regulatory process, including associated regulatory review timing. In addition, decreases in free cash flow from demerged companies is often underestimating, putting future and accelerated growth plans at risks.","Next, Akzo management was recently critical and raised credit ratings as a concern with PPG proposal. However, Akzo detailed yesterday, they are anticipating resulting downgrade in credit ratings with their standalone strategy. In conjunction, a downgraded credit rating may also have ramifications on pension funding requirements and we noted a great deal of discussing yesterday by Akzo about potential impact of their standalone strategy on pensions and funding obligations.","We find it interesting that the revised \u20ac100 million 2017 EBIT target comes so soon after Akzo\u2019s 2017 target setting meeting on February 15th and also that nearly half of the \u20ac100 million figure occurred in the first quarter which is typically a seasonally slower quarter. It is confusing as Akzo expressed concern over R&D spending in their response to the PPG proposal. Akzo say they want to invest \u20ac1 billion in coating R&D through 2020. However, this cumulative \u20ac1 billion sounds lower than their annual R&D spending in 2016 of \u20ac363 million. Are they are still willing to commit to their overall combined R&D spending from last year? And more generally we believe equity markets react swiftly and typically appropriately to any additional news, and the market reaction reflects it in the stock prices.","And lastly, at PPG, we continue to believe past performance is the best predictor of future performance. As Scott mentioned earlier, we do not intend to provide any additional information regarding our proposal to acquire AkzoNobel, in the question and answer portion of this call.","Turning our attention to PPG. Today, we reported record first quarter 2017 financial results. We achieved net sales of $3.6 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $1.35. We delivered solid financial results to start 2017 including a more than 6% year-over-year increase in adjusting earnings per diluted share and a 3% improvement in local currency sales or an increase of 1% as reported. Our sales growth was driven in large part by higher aggregate coatings volumes at 2%, which is our strongest performance since the fourth quarter of 2016 and the modest benefit from recent portfolio optimization actions where acquisition-related sales exceeded the actions of sales from divested businesses.","We achieved these improved results despite the ongoing, unfavorable impacts in currency translation and moderate but uneven global demand. Our EPS growth rate improved versus the prior two quarters, primarily due to the benefits of ongoing cash deployment including share repurchases of a $165 million in the first quarter.","For the quarter, our average diluted shares outstanding declined by nearly 4% versus the prior year. Earnings leverage on our sales growth and continued operational cost discipline resulted in lower manufacturing overhead costs including the initial benefits from our 2016 business restructuring program. Several factors served as offset to these earnings improvements including increased raw material costs, which we partially offset with our initial pricing actions across several business regions and businesses. Unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately $15 million and higher transitory global transportation on logistics cost to meet elevated customer demand in Asia.","To address our regional production capacity issue, we\u2019re nearing completion of expansion one of our facilities in China. This expansion is expected to be fully operational late in the second quarter and will serve to greatly reduce ultimately -- and ultimately eliminate these additional costs beginning in the third quarter.","In addition to our operational improvement efforts, we actively work to strengthen our balance sheet, increasing our cash and short-term investments by more than $350 million and ending the quarter with approximately $1.4 billion on hand. This enhanced cash position provides us with increased financial flexibility to fund acquisitions of all sizes. In support of our cash balance improvements, we continued our working capital discipline, achieving a 100 basis-point year over year improvement in operating working capital as a percentage of sales. Additionally, our focus on delivering shareholder value is highlighted again in the first quarter with the acquisition of Futian Xinshi, a China-based automotive refinish coatings company and the previously mentioned share repurchases. Despite these improved quarterly results, we aspire to a higher EPS growth rate and remain committed to further improving our financial results and deploying our strong balance sheet.","Now, I\u2019d like to discuss some of our first quarter business trends. Our aggregate coatings sales volume growth was led by a continued strong performance in our technology focused industrial coatings segment where each business unit grew by mid single digit percentage versus the prior year and easily exceeding their respective industry growth comparisons. Sales volumes in automotive OEM coatings have once again began to outpace global industry growth rates, led by above market increases in the growing regions of Europe, Asia, Latin America, partially offset by below market experience in US and Canada where overall industry production volumes declined.","General industrial coating sales volumes increased ahead of industrial production growth rates for the fifth consecutive quarter. Improvements were broad based across sub segments and regions, particularly in Asia Pacific. Additionally, our sales volume growth rate improved sequentially in the US and Canada.","Sales volumes increased in packaging coatings building on strong growth in the prior year as customers continue their adoption of PPG\u2019s interior can coatings products. We continue to see technology-based growth opportunities for this business.","Looking ahead, global automotive industry growth is expected to continue in the second quarter and for the full year with clear differences by region.","We believe that industry sales have plateaued in the US and Canada with lower year over year industry production in the second quarter and for the full year with a continuing shift in industry production between the US and Mexico. We anticipate continued full year industry production growth in Europe despite a decline in the second quarter. In Asia, we expect industry production to continue to expand in the region for both the second quarter and full year, building on the region\u2019s robust 2016 growth rate. In China, we are closely monitoring expanding dealer inventories and the potential for slowing industry production, as a result. Finally, we see a gradual recovery of the automotive industry production levels in Brazil after likely bottoming in that country.","We anticipate a continuation of current industry demand trends in industrial and packaging coatings with PPG outperformance expected to continue in the second quarter, primarily due to strong customer adoption of our new coatings technology and value-added services.","Turning to performance coatings, year-over-year sales volumes were in line with prior year, including modest positive year-over-year impact from the Easter holiday shift between quarters in some of our businesses and regions. Shift in the holiday between the first and second quarter, primarily impacted our B2C businesses while it typically doesn\u2019t impact our B2B businesses.","Based on this year\u2019s calendar, the holiday-related shift aided volumes in some of our B2C businesses are negatively impacting other businesses. We anticipate the net improvement of this timing shift to be about 1% of incremental volume in the first quarter for performance coatings segment and negligible impact on our other reporting segments.","Look at particularly business unit performance in aggregate, ongoing and significant demand weakness in marine coatings offset growth in other business units. Automotive refinish coatings\u2019 organic sales growth continue with improved customer demand in each region, led by above market gains in U.S. and Canada where we experienced record March sales results.","Aerospace volumes were consistent with the prior year as low industry build growth rates continued despite significant customer backlogs. Additionally, we were negatively impacted by customer\u2019s inventory management actions, primarily in the transparencies sub-segment, which offset the modest demand increases.","In architectural coatings U.S. and Canada, we achieved a solid mid-single-digit sales volume increase in our company-owned stores, which marked our best performance to-date since the store revitalization efforts, post the AkzoNobel North American Decorative Coatings acquisitions. This growth was more than offset by lower demand in the independent dealer network and mix volume results within our national retail accounts or DIY channel, including the comparisons to prior year and new product inventory pipeline builds at multiple customers.","Sales volumes improved in Latin America, Asia-Pacific and architectural coatings Europe, Middle East, and Africa, where we saw improvements in several Western European countries including UK, Ireland, Benelux countries and building on growth in the prior year. Sales volumes continued to decline in protective and marine coatings due to ongoing significant weakness in marine ship building activity focused on Asia-Pacific. These declines more than offset our broad based regional growth in protective coatings.","Looking ahead, we anticipate higher segment sales sequentially in the second quarter, as we truly kick off the heart of the architectural paint season in many parts of the world. We expect the continuation of the current industry trends in aerospace and automotive refinish coatings and modest growth to remain in architectural EMEA with continued expansion in Western Europe and a slight improvement in Eastern Europe demand levels, particularly in Poland. We anticipate significant ongoing weakness in the marine sub-segment to offset growth in protective coatings, but are encouraged by the recent ship order activity in Korea. Although, this is a favorable, longer term industry sign and related increasing coatings demand will be delayed as vessels are typically paid at 12 to 18 months after orders are received.","Underlying demand trends n architectural U.S. and Canada are expected to remain as we enter the peak portion of the annual paint season. We expect solid same store sales growth to continue, building on our first quarter 2017 and second half 2016 momentum, and lower demand levels to persist within the independent dealer network. In our national retail outlets or DIY channel, we\u2019re optimistic about the sales prospects for our new products launch in 2016 and for our newest premium product PPG Timeless stain, currently launched at the Home Depot. This is the first product to prominently carry the PPG name in a major U.S. home center and is a continuation of our efforts to increase customer awareness of our corporate brand name.","In our PPG Comex business, we anticipate a continuation of local currency sales growth of at least two times Mexican GDP levels. In our glass segment, volumes declined by 2%, primarily due to lower North American fiber glass customer demand in the wind energy sub segment, partially offset by an improvement in oil and gas related end user market demand. We expect these trends to continue in the second quarter.","Looking at a demand from a regional prospective, sales volumes continue to expand in emerging regions of Asia Pacific and Latin America, exceeding growth rates in the developed regions. Demand growth in Asia was led by PPG outperformance in the industrials coatings segment and tempered by significant declines in the marine shipbuilding activity. Volumes expanded in Latin America across most of our businesses, led by significant increases of automotive industry production in Mexico. Volume growth accelerated modestly in Europe and was broad based across the majority of our coatings business units, reflecting the moderate economic recovery in the region. Sales volumes were flat in Europe and Canada, indicative of the uneven end-use market demand environment, which included declines in automotive industry production, which were offset by demand improvements in other end-use market segments. We have included additional segment and regional details in our presentation materials.","Overall, we delivered solid business results in the first quarter, despite uneven global market demand and ongoing foreign currency headwinds. We continue to focus on improving our organic growth rate by delivering innovative new products that satisfy our customers\u2019 needs and by further developing our consumer brands around the world. As is the hallmark of PPG, we remain disciplined in our operations and diligent of our cost and are on pace to achieve $40 million to $50 million in 2017 savings from our current restructuring program.","We implemented price increases in first quarter and announced additional price actions effective in the second quarter to address our increasing raw material costs. We will continue to look for ways to beneficially deploy our cash to enhance shareholder value and remain committed to deploy at least $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion on acquisitions and share repurchases in 2017 and 2018 combined. We currently have active pipeline of bolt-on acquisitions and remain -- willing to engage with AkzoNobel to discuss the combination of our companies.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, thank you for your interest in PPG and now, Denise, would you please open the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Robert Koort of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Robert Koort","Thank you. Michael, I was wondering if you could talk about something you touched on at the end there about the efforts to invigorate the organic growth. Obviously, you had a little pickup in the first quarter. Can you talk maybe about through the quarter trends? And what do you attribute the commentary about there, feeling to be a better economic tone in the U.S. but not really showing up any business activity yet?","Michael McGarry","As you know, Bob, all the surveys on economic optimism have -- continue to go up since the election. We have not seen the order book reflect anywhere near the spike that the optimism shows. We do see solid demand though, just not increasing at that rate. We saw March was a good month, and that\u2019s always encouraging for March to be a good month as that uses the start of the paint season. And I would tell you that overall, our organic growth efforts are taking hold. As you know, we started on this about two years ago. And industrial businesses, that\u2019s automotive, industrial packaging all really understand this and doing a really, really fine job. The refinish is also doing a good job, I think being held back a little bit in aerospace, not because we don\u2019t know how to do it but because a couple of our customers haven\u2019t figured out how to build planes, even though they have a huge backlog.","So, I would say the most encouraging one though was our same store sales and our architecture business in the U.S. and Canada. They performed very well. And the fact that we revitalize the store network, those dividends are starting to play out. So overall, we know how to do it, the teams are getting better at it. And I think it\u2019s starting to take hold. It\u2019s being masked though by the significant weakness in the marine segment which is taking fair amount off the top line. But on the protective side, all good. So, thanks.","Robert Koort","And you mentioned that the stores can sustain that good growth after the investment effort. Is there something wrong with the DIY channel because it seems like that market is not as robust or is there something seasonal or temporary going on there? And I appreciate your time, thanks.","Michael McGarry","I guess, the way I would describe that is there is more money in the pockets of the consumers and there does seem to be more of a trend to do-it-for-me, if you will as opposed to do-it-yourself. And we have talked to our customers about the need to get more aggressive in the what I would call, the good category that people have come in the stores, wanting to buy the good level paint and sometimes walk out when they are trying too hard to up-sell them. So, we think that this is an opportunity for them to refocus on some of the people that haven\u2019t bought paint in that category. So, for us, we think the continuation of same store sales look good; our April start is solid as well. So that\u2019s why we\u2019ve put in the commentary that we are looking forward to a good second quarter.","Operator","The next question will be from Duffy Fischer of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Mike Leithead","Hey, guys. It\u2019s actually Mike Leithead for Duffy this afternoon. I guess first, can you just walk through the changes you are seeing in your raw material basket? I know TiO2 catches most of the headlines but we have also seen some inflation on the organic side. So, just trying to get a sense of where we are today versus maybe your expectations heading into this year?","Michael McGarry","Sure. So clearly, TiO2 has upward pressure, more that there is a combination of supply-demand, but more because of some of the outages that they have in Europe. I would also say, propylene is up significantly more. This tends to be first quarter, second quarter event every year. We certainly hope that propylene by dehydrogenation trend to help that. But this year that hasn\u2019t been the case, so propylene is up. Certainly emulsions are up, epoxies are up in Asia. So, there is a few more. And then, when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, this time last year, oil was in the 30s; now in the low-50s. So solvents on a year-over-year basis is up. Now, sequentially, going forward, it\u2019s not going to be up. And that\u2019s why we think the second quarter is probably the peak for raw materials. But that\u2019s kind of the flavor we see.","Mike Leithead","Great. And then, in Mexico, it looks like Comex growth remains pretty strong there, even if FX clouds it a bit in your reported results. Can you just update us on kind of how the PPG initiatives are progressing down there? I guess cost synergies, and I think you had a longer term revenue target; you\u2019re also looking at there, how those programs are going?","Michael McGarry","Yes. So, overall, the PPG Comex team continues to perform at exceptionally high level. We continue to far exceed our target, which is two times GDP. The team has opened up 45 new stores in the first quarter of this year. Last year, we opened up about 212, if I remember right. So, we\u2019re ahead of our pace, what we anticipated in Q1. Our store relocations have also been ahead of pace. We had price increases in Mexico that have been successful as well. The revenue increases that you talked about the synergies, our protective and marine team has done a good job down there in Mexico. We brought new industrial products that they\u2019re selling down there; that\u2019s been a benefit. And when you look at Central America; that has been a significant win. Originally we said $40 million to $50 million in new sales synergies in the years three through five. We have that $60 million to $70 million. We\u2019re ahead of that pace right now. Sales actually in Central America last year were up nearly 40%; in the first quarter, they were up more than 20%. So, we were on top of a huge comp we were up against. So, we feel very good about our Comex team.","Vince Morales","Mike, one last comment. We have captured fully the cost synergies amounts when we did the transaction.","Operator","The next question will be from Steve Byrne of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. ","Steve Byrne","Yes. Thank you. This chart you put together that shows your outlook for -- on the first quarter, demand by market and region suggests you saw the U.S. architectural market actually contract in the first quarter slightly year-over-year. Why would that have been, what would you see is driving contraction in that market?","Michael McGarry","Well, the growth comes from the same-store sales; the contraction comes from the independent dealer network along with the big box retail DIY channel. So, that\u2019s it. But, we are projecting 2% to 3% growth for the full year or architectural in the U.S. and Canada.","Steve Byrne","But was something that holding back the overall market in the first quarter?","Vince Morales","Steve, the colors on the chart reflect -- I think you\u2019re looking at the yellow on the chart, reflecting are below market.","Steve Byrne","Yes. But isn\u2019t that also suggesting\u2026.","Vince Morales","Those are our independent dealer channels, Michael mentioned.","Steve Byrne","So, you\u2019re below market but aren\u2019t you also saying that the overall market slowed year-over-year in the quarter?","Vince Morales","We think the market is growing at 2% to 3% a year. We do think the market expanded and I don\u2019t have a slide in front of me. I apologize. We do think the market expanded in the first quarter.","Steve Byrne","Well, then switching gears here, while you\u2019re pursuing this Akzo bid, should we assume other M&A should be either modest or tabled in interim for example, were you not interested in that Valspar wood coatings business?","Michael McGarry","What I would tell you is we\u2019re not slowing down our M&A efforts, the pipeline remains actively engaged. And as far as the specific one, I will not comment on that. But, what you should generally think about is that we\u2019d look at most everything in our space.","Operator","The next question will come from Christopher Parkinson of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christopher Parkinson","You mentioned you expect to have consistent industry demand trends in the U.S. and Canadian architectural business in 2Q outlook. But, can you just parse out some additional trends based on the specific channels? I think you already said you\u2019re expecting company-owned stores to continue to outperform. But more importantly, just any key puts and takes in terms of differentials, and gross spend by channel? I think you had some of that in 2016. And then also just any broad thoughts on expectations for new product lines in stains or even Glidden Diamond because I think you launched that kind of a little bit into the season last year.","Vince Morales","Chris, this is Vince, I\u2019ll try to answer all your questions. Again, our view is that market continues to remain -- U.S. architectural market continues to remain solid. It\u2019s led as Michael mentioned by professional -- the professional channel where we\u2019re up mid single digits. I think that was our fifth or sixth quarter in a row where we expanded our growth rate in that channel. And Michael commented briefly on the investments we\u2019ve made in past years, leading up to our growth rate. And we do expect that channel continue to outperform.","As I just mentioned, the independent dealer channel is a modestly shrinking channel and that trend is not expected to change. The home center channel is expected to grow slightly below the overall industry. We do have some noise in Q1 and Q2 year-over-year because we do have product launches last year in both Q1 and Q2. We mentioned -- you mentioned the Glidden Diamond, which we split between Q1 and Q2 last year as a product launch. We also had our a Paramount product Menards. Again, we split that between Q1 and Q2. And we have the PPG stain Timers launch, which is a smaller category that that\u2019s going into the Home Depot right now. But we do expect that channel as it did last year to slightly underperform the overall industry. So hopefully, I answered your questions fully.","Christopher Parkinson","One by one, great. And just a quick a follow-up on the industrials side. You indicate you\u2019ve seen some solid trends in APAC, LatAm; it seems like the U.S. is okay in that regard but EMEA is still sluggish. On the latter, can you just comment on any key trends you are seeing, whether it\u2019s by country or just by vertical? And whether or not you are seeing any detrimental in some of those markets in the business? And then, as it improves, let\u2019s say later on the year or even past key elections in the region, if you expect any improvement in op leverage there? Thank you.","Michael McGarry","This is Michael and what I would tell you is that the same countries continue to have the same strength. So, UK, Ireland continues to do well, the Benelux continues to do well, Germany continues to do well, France remains sluggish; obviously they have an election coming up, so there is a not a lot of spending going on at that level right now. The recovery in southern Europe continues but I would say has moderated. The disappointment has been more in Eastern Europe that has probably been the bigger challenge in that regard. And of course, the Middle East which we report as part of Europe Middle East and Africa that has been challenged. And then Africa is significantly challenged. A number of those countries are oil based economies. And as you know, the oil based economies have been challenged. So, when you look at overall Europe, I would say western Europe doing pretty well, eastern Europe a little bit less and then the other ones are the ones that are holding back. I might add, the other one positive would be Russia. In the first quarter, Russian car sales were 4%; that\u2019s the last time -- I can\u2019t remember last time they were up. They were 50% down since their peak. So, that\u2019s one positive side.","Vince Morales","And in Asia, we are seeing good, fairly good solid growth across the region. I think there was some valid concern coming into the year in China on the car incentives that was being partially repealed. But we did see good automotive sales, again a little bit tick up in inventory in Q1, but we didn\u2019t see a significant decline that tells us there is good solid underpinnings of growth there; India is good, southeast Asia is good as well.","Operator","The next question will be from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jeff Zekauskas","I saw that you bought $165 million worth of shares in the first quarter. Was that share repurchase completed before you thought hard about buying Akzo or were you already aware that you were intending to purchase Akzo? And have you purchased any shares this quarter?","Vince Morales","So, Jeff, this is Vince again. So, Jeff, we did as you know and as we reported in January, purchased roughly $650 million of stock in the fourth quarter. We did that under a program, which we occasionally do. That program ran through our first quarter earnings call. And so, we won\u2019t comment on what we\u2019ve done subsequent to the end of the first quarter but that program did run through our first quarter earnings call.","Jeff Zekauskas","And then, secondly, I think your cost of goods sold was up 2.6% and your volumes were roughly up too. So, it seems that you had a very low rate of cost of goods sold inflation. Is that because you had a way of managing your inventories or was it that your raw material costs were up at a higher rate but you offset that with lowering overhead costs? Can you talk about why your cost of goods sold was so low in the context of rising raw material costs?","Vince Morales","Jeff, it\u2019s Vince again, Jeff. It was the latter. We did see an increase in raw material costs, as Michael touched upon earlier. We did have in response to that very good cost management of our manufacturing costs. And that was supplemented by higher volumes, which allowed us to capitalize on those higher volumes and the throughput at our facilities.","Operator","The next question will come from Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. ","Mehul Dalia","Hi. Good afternoon. It\u2019s actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. How are you doing?","Michael McGarry ","Hi, Mehul.","Mehul Dalia","Hi. Going back to the question on inflation. Given your activity on the pricing side, do you think, you\u2019ll be able to be at least price cost neutral or even positive for the full year 2017 just based on current raw material backdrop as we see it right now?","Michael McGarry","Well, our guidance earlier in the year was that we would be negative price minus raw materials for Q1, Q2 and positive Q3, Q4. In order to make that happen, we\u2019re going to have to work harder and collaboratively with our customers to achieve our previously announced price increases. But at this point in time, we\u2019re still positive that we\u2019re going to have a net positive. So we haven\u2019t given up on that, but we don\u2019t plan on it.","Mehul Dalia","Okay, great. And then, in terms of the capital deployment of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion for 2017 and 2018, and in the context of your pending AkzoNobel offer, how should we think about layering in the proceeds towards share buybacks et cetera from the timeline standpoint for the remainder of the year?","Michael McGarry","Well, again, regard to the year, we typically don\u2019t provide publicly any cadence or pace for share buybacks. We have conviction around the 2.5 billion to 3.5 billion over the two-year period that we typically wouldn\u2019t pace that out for public consumption.","Operator","The next question will come from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Michael, just on margins and performance coatings, they were actually up Q1 year-over-year, but given the peak of raws in Q2, should we expect margins and performance to be down year-over-year in Q2?","Michael McGarry","I think they\u2019ll will be down marginally. But obviously, we\u2019re working collaboratively with our customers on price increases. It\u2019s always difficult to forecast when you can start to hit those price increases in your pocket. But we have with relationships with our customers and we\u2019ll continue to work with them in a very straight forward matter.","Vince Morales","And just David, if I could add. Again, as Michael said eelier, I just want to remind everybody. We do expect Q2 to be the most difficult comparable from a raw material perspective.","David Begleiter","Very good. And Michael, just on marine. When did the business bottom? And can you actually size what the impact has been from peak to trough?","Michael McGarry","Well, the bottom is probably either this quarter or next quarter is my guess. We saw a slight uptick in ship orders for the first time in a long time in Q1. So, I always say that one data point doesn\u2019t make a trend. So, it\u2019s too early to call that. But last quarter, the fourth quarter, Korean ship orders were off 75%, and China ship orders are off 60%. So that\u2019s not indicative of the world market because obviously they do more of it than anybody else. But, the downturn in some of the other countries would have been less, but it\u2019s still a very significant peak to trough number. ","Vince Morales","And David, in terms of context for size for 2016, we said it shaved about half of a turn off of our growth rate, somewhere in the neighborhood of half a term.","Operator","The next question will come from Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. ","Frank Mitsch","Hey, good afternoon and good luck to the home team at the Paint C.A.N tonight. Michael, you were talking about the Easter impact and I think you said that there was a benefit of about 1% volumes in performance coatings. So, we do expect that that\u2019s a pull forward from a Q2 into Q1 and so therefore whatever volumes we see, so we\u2019re going to see a decrement in Q2 is that what you\u2019re signaling there?","Michael McGarry","Yes. So, what we had is extra ship days in Q1 and we have less ship days in Q2. And it\u2019s not a straight forth calculation because PPG Comex, actually their two biggest selling parts of the year, Christmas and Easter, so for PPG Comex it\u2019s obviously a benefit in the second quarter and negative in the first quarter. So, it\u2019s not a straight forward calculation. What we\u2019re trying to tell you is it\u2019s somewhere in that 1% to 2% range.","Frank Mitsch","You talked before about the $100 million productivity program. And I was wondering if you could provide some color around that, where you stand there and what\u2019s the expectations for the balance of the year?","Michael McGarry","My friend Vince will help you.","Vince Morales","Thanks, Michael. So, Frank, we gave -- as you know, we announced the restructuring last year. We\u2019re targeting $40 million to $50 million of savings in 2017 from those restructuring actions. We captured a little less than 25, let\u2019s call 20% of that in the first quarter. We expect that to gradually grow throughout the year and will be hopefully at the middle to upper end of that $40 million to $50 million target.","Frank Mitsch","And that\u2019s also a partly baked into the expectation to the back half for the year to hopefully to see acceleration in EPS growth relative to what you performed in Q1, correct? ","Vince Morales","That would be correct.","Operator","The next question will come from John Roberts of UBS. Please go ahead.","John Roberts","Mike, I\u2019ll remind you, this is Wall Street, so if you give us one data point, we will draw a line and if you give us two, we will draw curve.","Michael McGarry","Okay, John. Thanks for the adjudication.","John Roberts","You talked about more visibility for the PPG brand, are you talking about using the PPG brand to expand some shelf space and gain share, are you talking more about a super umbrella brand on top of your other brands?","Michael McGarry","Well, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s right for me to lay out our brand strategy as it\u2019s evolving but let me try to get to part of what you\u2019re talking about. We\u2019re going to have more shelf space at the Home Depot, okay. So, that\u2019s a positive. We are -- if you\u2019re in any of our retail partner stores, you will see the PPG logo on our products. And of course, we\u2019re growing the PPG paints brand in our own store. And as you know, as Mr. Mitch just said, it\u2019s not the Paint C.A.N but it\u2019s PPG paints arena and we\u2019re thrilled to be with the NHL. And now we\u2019re the NHL partner, official paint. So, these are all our efforts to do that. What I would tell is that long-term we will have to put and we will put more branding into the PPG name to support our retail customers. So, this will be gradual and over time but it is something that we are working on and we talk continuously to our retail partners how important this is to us.","Vince Morales","Investment today -- John, I am sorry to interrupt you. These investments today we have seen hopefully gain and traction along with our PPG paint store\u2019s growth.","John Roberts","Do you use the PPG brand in European architectural at all yet?","Michael McGarry","No, we do not use it anywhere. The only place outside the U.S. that we are using it as a PPG brand is actually New Zealand. And that\u2019s because the way we bought business in Australia and New Zealand. And actually, it\u2019s doing quite well down there. So, maybe it\u2019s sort of learning to us.","Operator","The next question will come from Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Kevin McCarthy","Yes. Good afternoon. You had a number different price increase announcements in various product lines and geographies in recent months. If we look at the second quarter, how would you characterize the potential for sequential improvement in price in each of your coating segments and compared to the first quarter? Perhaps you can give us a sense of what you have achieved and what\u2019s on account still there?","Michael McGarry","I think Kevin, naturally, we always get better traction and quicker traction in our performance coatings segment. And it\u2019s harder but we do get it eventually in our industrial coatings segment. As you know our industrial coatings segment has a number of very large, very sophisticated customers that makes it more difficult to get it but they do understand, in all cases at about 70% of our cost of raw materials, so it\u2019s impossible for us to sit here and absorb that kind of cost. So, we will get it, but what I would say is we get it typically quicker in the performance coatings area. And we will see -- sequentially, we will see both go up but we will see better on the performance coatings side.","Kevin McCarthy","And then, as a follow-up on industrial, Michael. You had good sales growth and I thought the commentary sounded constructive, yet your margins were down 70 basis points year-over-year, I suspect the issues what you just alluded to, I think you had minus 1 on prices, I understand that. Perhaps you could just elaborate more on whether and when you might be able to get above the water line there and get it to zero or plus one.","Michael McGarry","Kevin, I always give the guidance that it takes six to nine months for the company, so you probably should assume nine to 12 months in that segment, because it\u2019s a little harder to get it. But we will get it. And I just think it takes a little bit longer. But it is being offset significantly by manufacturing performance and good cost control across Company. So, when you look at it that has helped us a lot.","Operator","The next question will be from Michael Sison of Keybank. Please go ahead.","Michael Sison","In terms of performance coatings, when you think about the positives you\u2019ve seen thus far and some of the negatives, when do you think some of the growth can outweigh some of the negatives in marine and generate some volume growth this year?","Michael McGarry","Well, if you assume that marine touches bottom and starts not having any further negatives, that puts you one or two quarters out on marine. I would tell you that the rest of this segment is in pretty good shape. Aerospace will -- might be flat to slightly up, but we refinish is continuing to do well but distracted driving has helped. The miles driven has helped. Employment being up helps. All that leads to congestion of growth. So, the rest of the segment is a pretty good shape.","Michael Sison","Great. And then, for industrial coatings, you\u2019ve had couple of quarters now of solid volume growth. And industrial production generally has been kind of sluggish and it sounds like we\u2019re kind of seeing things pick up a little bit. Could you expect that volume growth maybe even get better in the next couple of quarters?","Michael McGarry","I\u2019m not putting a big bull\u2019s eye on that. Again, we can see a lot of optimism, but we haven\u2019t seen the order book do that. Our outperformance in that segment has really been driven by technology and also because growth due to performance of the teams. So I guess, I\u2019ll temper your optimism for now and let\u2019s hope that you\u2019re right.","Vince Morales","And then globally, Mike, we do -- we have as Michael mentioned in this prepared remarks some very hard comes coming up. We had mid-single-digit growth in a lot of these businesses. Now, we\u2019re starting to lap some of that. So, again for our numbers in particular, the comps are a little bit harder, but we still feel good about where we sit technology-wise.","Operator","The next question will be from Dmitry Silversteyn of Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my call. A lot of my questions have been answered, but I just like follow-up on Mike\u2019s last question on general industrial. Can you talk a little bit more, provide a little bit more detail either by product types like oil coatings or powder coatings or regions or end markets where sort of one of the good guys, one of the bad guys. Where you see growth in market share gains and where things are still so sluggish that even with the technology driven market share gains, you\u2019re still a little bit under water year-over-year?","Michael McGarry","So, Dmitry, the segments, the sub-segments that are doing well, automotive parts doing well, electronic materials doing well, transportation general finishes, appliances. The encouraging one for us is heavy duty equipment, it\u2019s up. Now that\u2019s a combination of share gain plus that\u2019s coming off the floor. So, I think that\u2019s all good. The segments that are kind of not doing as well, the extrusion market, the wood market, the coil market, those are the some of the segments that are not as robust. But globally, we had a really outstanding performance across all the world, I mean whether it\u2019s Asia, Latin America, Europe, our industrial coatings segment team has been doing a outstanding job. And I want to complement them on that.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay. Mike, thank you. And then the second question, just sort of in the context of a strong contract to market. You guys saw very strong growth in your stores and your competitor, we had a conference call earlier this morning also mentioned very strong growth. Why is that not being reflective in the dealer channel? I mean, is the share losses for them so great that they just can\u2019t offset even a mid-single-digit improvement in what looks a do it for me market in the first quarter?","Michael McGarry","Well, I think our friends in Cleveland and us provide more value, more locations, more service. And so, when there is a opportunity for another incremental sale, the two of us are probably getting more than our fair share in that segment, because of what we both offer to the marketplace.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay. So, it sounds like it\u2019s as much execution as it is the market that\u2019s driving these stronger sales for company owned stores you, equipment company?","Michael McGarry","Correct.","Operator","Our next question will come from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Laurence Alexander","Do you have, with the strength that you\u2019re seeing in orders demand, the number of your markets that are now running in expansionary mode in Europe coming in above the market trends? Do you think if raw materials roll over, you will be able to retain more of that rather than pass it through to the customers?","Michael McGarry","Well, we always work collaboratively with our customers, so we don\u2019t try to over recover; we try to be exactly what the market\u2019s going on. But what I would tell you is that we have expectations for productivity, we\u2019ve expectations for manufacturing efficiency, we have expectations on our sustainability initiatives where we\u2019re less energy consumed, less wage, so there is opportunities to continue to improve the margins. But on the raw material side, typically we ask for what we\u2019re having to absorb.","Vince Morales","And Laurence, if I could add, we\u2019re working on reformulation as we typically do, in an inflationary environment. So, not only are we working with our customers on price and we\u2019re trying to engineer some of this health as well, so we don\u2019t have to go as forcefully to our customers. So, we\u2019re working on the technology side as well.","Laurence Alexander","And can you give a bit more granularity around the strength in automotive refinish volumes in U.S., Canada and Latin America? And particularly, any sense as to whether that -- how sustainable that should be?","Michael McGarry","So, the market in the U.S. is the strongest globally; Latin America would be next followed by Europe and Asia Pacific. We do think these are sustainable trends. The expanding car parks is the reality and expanding miles driven is the reality, so some of the other thing I talked about earlier. So, I think that\u2019s going to continue to and plus in that segment, you will also commercial transport. So, the fact that economy is trending up, you\u2019re going to have more big trucks built, so that\u2019s a positive for us as well.","Operator","The next question will come from PJ Juvekar of Citi. Please go ahead.","PJ Juvekar","In 2011, when TiO2 prices spiked last, I think PPG was most aggressive in sort of sourcing TiO2 from China and also reformulating your paint. Given that you\u2019ve already done that, what can you do know as TiO2 prices begin to go up again?","Michael McGarry","Well PJ, I would tell you that that is a never-ending quest for us now. So, we\u2019re constantly looking at how do you reformulate that how do you use other extenders, how do you work with your customer on formulations that reduce the need for TiO2. So, we are certainly not going to have -- we took out about 10% since 2011, so it\u2019s harder but it\u2019s not impossible.","Vince Morales","We don\u2019t think that we are on the same -- anywhere near the same trajectory in the TiO2 market. We are seeing inflation there. That inflation, as you mentioned, was 100% inflation. Again, we are seeing inflation, we need to get priced but it\u2019s not of that same level.","Michael McGarry","And I would tell you -- I would add PJ that the TiO2 companies I think regret what happened because that took so much demand in the marketplace and my guess is they won\u2019t make that mistake again.","PJ Juvekar","And Michael, when you took the job, organic growth was your priority but the reality is that the economies are not growing. And I would say, your organic growth has been between 1% to 2%. Is that what\u2019s really driving PPG towards big M&A?","Michael McGarry","No, I would not say that\u2019s the case at all. What I would say is acquisitions have historically always made a better return than buying back shares. And so, as you know, this coatings franchise continues to throw off a lot of consistent cash flow. And we consistently integrate companies very well and we can capture those synergies very well. We have a proven track record of more than 50 acquisitions in the last 10 years. We have a play book that is well understood within the Company. And for us this just makes a perfect sense. So we are going to continue down this path.","Operator","The next question will be from James Sheehan of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.","James Sheehan","Thank you. Question on your comments on national retail accounts. You described that qualitatively as mix, but it does sound like that maybe a little bit better than your competitor did. And I am just wondering are your brand initiatives gaining traction there or are you seeing some type of inventory adjustments that would cause you to be outperforming peers in that category?","Michael McGarry","Well, I can\u2019t comment on what my friend said because I had our annual shareholder meetings at the exact same time as they were making their comments. But what I would tell you is our commentary is pretty specific and we would just stay with that.","Vince Morales","Jim, we don\u2019t feel there is a performance gap us versus market. Again, we recognize last year as an industry, this was a slower growing channel and this is -- first quarter was a continuation of that, albeit again at the very beginning of the paint season. We certainly hope and our working with our national customers to help and put that channel up as much as possible, hopefully at or above market. We just haven\u2019t seen that at this point.","Michael McGarry","And maybe I\u2019ll add to that Jim is what I said earlier was the average median income of the person walking into the big boxes let\u2019s call it $45,000. They can\u2019t all be sold premium paint. And every time you let somebody walk out of those big boxes without a can of paint, when you could have sold them to $20 or $25 can a paint that\u2019s a loss. And I think that\u2019s where we are trying to encourage all our retail partners is don\u2019t let people walk out. Any by walks in, walks up for that chip rack, make sure they walk out with somebody\u2019s can of paint.","James Sheehan","And then, on the aerospace sub segments, you talked about the airplane makers not get interact together. Can you talk a little bit about how you see trends shaping up there? That\u2019s obviously not going to persist forever. Do you see any kind of modest acceleration happening in the next couple of quarters in aerospace?","Michael McGarry ","No. We don\u2019t see any change. If you look at it, Boeing\u2019s orders or deliveries, excuse me, were actually down 7 quarter-over-quarter; Airbus\u2019s were up 11, so a net change of 4. Backlog for both of them are in excess of seven or eight years. So, we haven\u2019t seen that acceleration. I would tell you that the business jet market though is getting -- we got it to get near the bottom. It was the lowest -- 2016 was the lowest since 2004. So, I would say that there is probably likely recovery coming in that market. So that\u2019s probably, and plus, we know military is definitely coming back. So, you got military, probably going to get better, you got general aviation, you got a lot of miles being flown by the major carriers. So that\u2019s a positive. So there\u2019s actually more positive trends than negative. It\u2019s just hasn\u2019t manifested itself in new planes being built.","Operator","The next question will come from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Matt Gingrich","Hey, guys. This is Matt Gingrich on for Vincent. I was wondering, if it is possible to quantify the headwind in industrial from the higher transportation and logistics costs?","Vince Morales","Just as a reminder, last year was north of -- well north of 5 -- last year for fourth quarter was well north of 5 million this year and just south to 5 million. And as Michael said in his opening comments, we expect that to dissipate in Q2, so it will be very low-single-digits in Q2.","Matt Gingrich","And then, on the margin profile, the acquisition in industrial, there is a common in your slide deck that you\u2019re saying that they underperformed the segment average. I was wondering if you expect that going forward or this is more of a one-time dynamic?","Michael McGarry","No. Virtually every company we acquire has margins lower than the PPG margins. And virtually every company we buy within a year or two or three, we get up to PPG margins. We have a strong track record in doing that. So, this is no different. So, we bought coatings -- the MetoKote. We\u2019re bringing their margins up. They had a very nice first quarter, but still below the Company average. We bought Univer. The 50% of Univer, we didn\u2019t know in Italy for architectural coatings we\u2019re bringing that up. We bought the remaining in DEUTEK architectural company, significant improvement; they have a great management team; we\u2019re very thrilled to have them join us. In fact, they have a long runway with those folks. They\u2019re talented people. And so, this is no different than we\u2019ve seen anywhere else. Acquire, improve, get the Company average or exceed.","Vince Morales","So those acquisitions, if I can add, again, the management team at MetoKote remains in place. As Michael mentioned, management team at DEUTEK remains in place. So, we\u2019re very pleased to have these people as part of our organization.","Matt Gingrich","Great. So gradual improvement, but still lagging segment average to the balance of the year likely?","Vince Morales","Certainly for the balance for this year. Yes.","Operator","The next question will come from Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.","Don Carson","Yes, thanks. A question on your heat map on slide five. You\u2019ve got very divergent trends in automotive and refinish, you\u2019re growing above and expanding market in OEM, you\u2019re growing below at declining markets. I\u2019m just talking about sustainability of those trends and specifically what\u2019s happening in automotive OEM. And then the refinish growth, is that sort of distribution driven that you\u2019re getting share at MSOs instead of taking share from second tier producers or is it more product driven?","Michael McGarry","Well, in refinish, we\u2019re definitely gaining share. There is two of it that are consistently gaining share in that market. As far as the dichotomy between growth rate, there are two different markets really. So, let\u2019s start with automotive. In the automotive market, we say globally demand builds would be up 1% to 2%, closer to 2%, but it varies by areas. So, U.S. sales we said plateaued but builds are going to be down marginally. And then in Europe, Western Europe builds are growing that\u2019s continuing, but in I would say in the other parts of Eastern Europe, probably not as robust. Latin America is getting better and China, people always are nervous about China. We remain constructive on China. January sales were down, February was up, March was up. We think people are going to get used to this tax not being -- tax abatement not being, it\u2019s still the most important thing for people to -- you want to status symbol to own a car in China, so we think demand will continue to grow. India is going to grow more than 7%.","So overall, it\u2019s going to be a solid market, not as good as last year, last year grew more than 3% but overall still a good market.","Vince Morales","And Don if you summarize what\u2019s happening our position versus the market generally and the highest growth markets, we\u2019re outperforming the industry and the markets that are shrinking, those are ones where we are not performing; we\u2019re performing at or below industry. So again, we positioned ourselves well in the growing markets.","Operator","The next question will be from Mike Harrison of Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.","Mike Harrison","Just to continue on the auto OEM question, you\u2019ve discussed the reasons in past that are driving your below market growth in North America. I\u2019m talking about some of the reallocation of resources to drive growth in other regions, in other faster growing regions. Can you talk so about when you would expect to see U.S. and Canada get to at market growth, and is there any point in the near future where you could see allocating resources to gain new wins with auto OEM customers and North America?","Michael McGarry","Sure, Mike. This is Michael. The way I would think about that is we should start to lap some of these loss of market share in the U.S. late in the third quarter early in the fourth quarter. And then, so first quarter of next year, we should start outperforming industry in the U.S. and Canada. And given the fact that we already outperformed the other three regions and globally, we outperformed, this will put us back on a very, very solid track on the automotive market globally.","Mike Harrison","And then, I wanted to also ask just on the MetoKote business, you referenced that as a business that was below average margin but starting to improve. Can you just talk about how that integration process is going? I know that that coating services business is a little bit of a step out for your guys. How is that business model working for you and for your customers?","Michael McGarry","It\u2019s a very small business when you look at it versus all the PPG. There is sales in the first quarter up 11% year-over-year. So, I would say it\u2019s performing well, margins were up year over year. I would tell you that they have had two significant wins, they had a nice win with somebody in the electric vehicle market. That was a very good win, and they also had some nice equipment sales. And the beauty about the equipment sales is that they were able to bring our industrial coatings team along with them and provide a total services solution to this customer. And we have another large customer in the industrial space that wants to get out of the painting parts business and they asked us if we would combine our traditional paint business with the coating services. So, I think there\u2019s more opportunities to integrate this and become a seamless part of our product offering to our customers.","Operator","The next question will come from Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Arun Viswanathan","Great, thanks guys. So, I just had a question on general industrial. Are you guys seeing trends, you talked about heavy duty improving in some of the other markets. Are you guys seeing a noticeable uptick incrementally sequentially from Q4 to Q1, do you expect that to continue through the year and maybe just parse it out by region.","Vince Morales","So, Arun, as Michael mentioned this sector is coming really off the floor. So, we were seeing a gradual recovery. We would hope at some point if the -- we talk about lot of infrastructure, politically if there\u2019s a benefit there that will come slowly. By region, we didn\u2019t see the same significant drop in Asia that we did see in the US and European region, couple of years ago. So that has been a little more steady. And again, in Europe we\u2019re mirroring the US but not in the same volatile pattern of a couple of years ago.","Arun Viswanathan","Great, thanks. And just on the M&A front. You talked about still pursuing other potential targets in your pipeline. Could you characterize how those -- how large those are and if there\u2019s any benefits to doing small bolt-ons versus continuing to pursue a large acquisition like Akzo? Thanks.","Michael McGarry","I\u2019ll take that. We remain interested in consolidating the space we have. We\u2019ve had and continue to have active discussions. The pipeline I think as people realize the past 18 months remains active and we\u2019re certainly interested and continuing dialogue with all the parties. And as we did last year with Medico DEUTEK, as Michael mentioned, et cetera, have room in our portfolio when these enhance shareholder value.","Arun Viswanathan","And just one more if I may. Would you be able to characterize like how much of your portfolio you think is market dependent improving? In the past you said that Europe recovery would be very beneficial to you guys, is that still the case. Any other comments around what you guys are looking for to really start to see your organic volume growth improve? Thanks.","Michael McGarry","I would say the European performance, any time we have new sales or higher sales in Europe, we drop 30% to 40% of that incrementally to the bottom line. That\u2019s our best place, If we\u2019re going to choose the a place that grows that would be it. The US would be next and then Asia, because we aren\u2019t sold out in Asia. That\u2019s the place that we continue to add capacity. So preferentially, we\u2019re very strong in Europe but we\u2019re not ashamed to take growth anywhere and the teams are expected to grow everywhere in and around the world.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen that concludes our question-and-answer session.

My name is Jenada and I will be your operator for today. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Vince Morales. Please proceed.","Vince Morales","Thank you, Jenada, and good afternoon everybody. Again, this is Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations for PPG industries. We appreciate your interest and welcome you to teleconference to review our third quarter 2014 financial results.","Joining me on the call today from PPG is Chuck Bunch, PPG Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Michael McGarry, Chief Operating Officer and Frank Sklarsky, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, October 16, 2014. I will remind everyone that we posted commentary and accompanying presentation slides on our Investor Center at ppg.com. These slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the opening remarks Chuck will make shortly. Following Chuck's perspective on the company's results for the quarter we will move directly to a Q&A session.","Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements.","This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which again are available on the website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information please refer to our filings with the SEC. Now let me introduce PPG Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch.","Chuck Bunch","Thank you, Vince, and welcome everyone. Today, we reported third quarter 2014 financial results including record third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $2.82 and record third quarter sales from continuing operations of $3.94 billion.","Our sales improved 4%, a rate of growth similar to the second quarter. Our higher sales were primarily due to higher volumes which grew 3% in the quarter in comparison to strengthening prior-year results. We achieved higher volumes in all major regions. However, the regional results remain uneven. Year-over-year volume growth was highest in North America and Asia, both about 4% as volume gains accelerated in both regions versus previous quarters. European volumes advanced slightly less than 1%.","We continue to benefit from customer adoption of our leading technologies, our higher sales were driven by volume growth in aerospace, automotive OEM coatings and automotive refinish where the growth rate this quarter matched or exceeded the prior quarter's results.","Our adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.82 improved 22% versus the prior year. We once again achieved record earnings in each major region. Our European earnings were up 17% and North America and emerging regions advanced 10%. The earnings increase was a result of the improvement in sales along with an improved business mix.","In addition, we\u2019ve maintained our ongoing cost discipline in all of our businesses. Earnings per share growth also benefited from cash used for acquisitions including savings stemming from achievement of additional acquisition-related synergies.","Cash deployed on share repurchases was also a contributing factor. We repurchased $150 million or about 740,000 shares in the quarter and $450 million or about 2.4 million shares year-to-date.","In the quarter, our average diluted shares outstanding were more than 3.5% lower versus the previous year's third quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the pace of demand varied by region. In North America, we benefited from continued moderate economic expansion. Industrial activity remained solid, including higher regional automotive OEM coatings, aerospace and overall general industrial demand. Volumes in our businesses serving these markets were up mid to high single-digit percentages.","Architectural Coatings sales were up low single-digits supported by higher U.S. sales in our company-owned stores and national DIY retailers and were partly offset by modestly lower demand in Canada. Also supporting the sales increase were signs of an initial modest recovery in non-residential or commercial construction which also was a factor in our improved flat glass sales during the quarter.","In addition to the higher sales the 10% regional earnings improvement included benefits from additional acquisition related cost synergies from last year's North American Architectural Coatings acquisition. I have been pleased with our progress on this acquisition and we now expect to complete nearly all of the significant synergy actions by year-end more than one year ahead of schedule.","In Europe, our results were mixed geographically within the region as well as by end use market. Our sales grew about 2% including slight volume growth of less than 1% in comparison with improving prior year sales. Currency translation was not a factor in the quarter as the three-month average euro exchange rate essentially matched the previous year. The euro weakened versus the dollar late in the quarter and based on current rates we expect euro currency translation to have a larger impact in the fourth quarter.","In the region PPG continued to benefit from growth in the industrial and automotive markets coupled with improving aerospace demand. Our Architectural Coatings volumes in the region were down slightly declining 1%. We had solid architectural demand growth in the UK and Eastern Europe which was offset by modestly lower results in other countries including France where volumes were down low single-digit percentages and were consistent with results earlier in the year. Also important with respect to Europe is that demand in the region was generally consistent throughout the month of September.","With regard to emerging regions, our sales in Asia were up 5% including 4% volume growth. Growth was broad-based spanning across nearly all PPG businesses in this region and was also led by industrial and automotive markets. Additionally, our Marine new build volumes were up very modestly as this industry begins to recover from several years of activity declines.","In Latin America, which is our smallest region representing about 5% of our sales, regional volumes grew low single-digit percentages aided by higher automotive demand, but were offset by lower results in other businesses. Strategically in the quarter we completed the sale of a North American flat glass manufacturing facility and our automotive glass equity affiliate sold one of its business lines with both divestiture transactions generating onetime gains.","We also continue to work on customary actions related to our pending acquisition of Comex. Let me take a few moments to give you an update on the Comex acquisition activities that have occurred since we signed the acquisition agreement. We submitted a formal filing with the Mexican Competition Commission requesting approval of the transaction within a few days of the acquisition announcement. Over the past few months we have responded to customary formal and informal information requests from the Competition Commission.","Last week the Commission issued a time extension on their transaction review, without this extension the Competition Commission would have been required to rule on the regulatory filing within the coming days. This extension was anticipated and was included in our original projected four to six months\u2019 timeline.","We continue to anticipate that the Commission will complete their review and that we will close the transaction in the fourth quarter as we previously expected. Economic growth trends in Mexico remain very solid and we are looking forward to working with Comex's customers and employees.","Looking ahead, while we are watchful of the pace of global economic expansion, we remain confident in our ability to deliver continued solid earnings growth driven by the ongoing momentum we have established in the many key end use markets. Additionally, we are just now beginning to benefit from an initial recovery in several long cycle industries including North American commercial construction and marine new build activity in Asia which had previously detracted from our overall growth. The fourth quarter is historically our slowest quarter seasonally and we anticipate normal seasonal trends will occur in our businesses this year.","The fourth quarter is also traditionally our strongest cash generation period and we continue to maintain a high degree of financial flexibility as we ended the third quarter with $3 billion of cash and short-term investments. Including the pending Comex acquisition we will likely spend at or above the top end of our previously communicated range of $3 billion to $4 billion of cash in years 2014 and 2015 combined on acquisitions and share repurchases.","Our acquisition pipeline remains active and share repurchases are expected to remain an integral part of our cash deployment including additional repurchases in the fourth quarter.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And now operator would you please open a line for questions?","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) ","Your first question comes from the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","John McNulty - Credit Suisse","Chuck, maybe you can give us an update \u2013 we\u2019ve seen oil prices come off pretty dramatically. I know you have got a lot of derivative exposure to that. Can you give us an update or a reminder as to what that exposure is? And then also, I know there are some outages around some of the derivatives that you use out there, but typically how quickly -- when we see a big oil price move, how quickly do we see it actually impact your cost overall? Thanks.","Chuck Bunch","I would say overall historically on our organic raw material purchases, when you see it at -- let's call it these wellhead prices you\u2019re going to typically wait at least a quarter or two to see that begin to appear in some of the downstream products. So it would not be immediate benefit other than in -- we hope to see it a little more quickly in our transportation and distribution costs which have been one of the sources of this low single-digit inflation rate that we\u2019ve been experiencing over the course of the last year or so.","John McNulty - Credit Suisse","And then maybe as a follow-up, I think you had indicated in the U.S. your stores business for PPG legacy businesses had upper single-digit volumes. Can you give us an update as to what the Akzo stores that you actually maintained through the full year or roughly for the full year, what their year-over-year sales growth was as well? If you're seeing any loss of business there or any improvements there?","Michael McGarry","John, those legacy Akzo stores were minus low single-digits. We have started to put the PPG products into those stores so the momentum has turned around and we saw increased sales out of those stores each month in the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Matt Gingrich - Morgan Stanley","Hi, this is Matt Gingrich on behalf of Vincent. I was wondering if you could speak more to the inflationary cost pressures that you\u2019re seeing in your performance segment including the higher logistics cost that you noted in the release.","Chuck Bunch","Well, I would say that we\u2019re saying low single-digit inflation rates led by wages and benefits followed by distribution and transportation cost that I referred to. We've seen I would say also very modest raw material increases, but these were in some of our organic raw material chains on propylene and ethylene side balanced off by some of what I would say benign raw material environments for our other key inputs.","Matt Gingrich - Morgan Stanley","And then to follow up in regards to your North American Architectural Coatings business, I was wondering if you could talk more about how the independent channel performed over the last quarter.","Michael McGarry","So the dealer network was down very slightly and that has historically been a contracting segment for us and so it is consistent with our expectations.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Research. Please proceed.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Research","Chuck, a question, you mentioned that you've got some long cycle businesses starting to turn non-residential construction North America and then the marine business. Can you talk about what your exposure to non-residential construction is in North America, specifically in the architectural paints business? And I noticed new marine builds are finally showing a little growth. What kind of trajectory do you see in the recovery in that business?","Chuck Bunch","For Architectural Coatings on commercial construction typically is between 20% and 25% of the Architectural Coatings mix here in North America, some of that new construction, some of that repaint. So I would say that is the market that has been very quiet over the last few years even coming out of the recession and that\u2019s where we are seeing some improvement both on the Architectural Coatings side as well as what we mentioned as the flat glass business where we\u2019re starting -- where we have more exposure directly to that end use market.","On the marine new build which is about 25% historically of our protective and marine coatings business unit. I would say that the improvement is early stages low single-digit improvement, but as we've been talking over the last almost now couple of years, that had a very sharp retrenchment. So it's good to see the improvement going in the right direction even if it's somewhat modest at this point.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Research","Just as a follow-up, on Comex is there any provision to reprice that acquisition given the recent drop in equity markets?","Chuck Bunch","To reprice? Excuse me, Don what's that?","Don Carson - Susquehanna Research","Well any price adjustment that you could see on Comex given that obviously valuations have come down dramatically since you made your first offer.","Chuck Bunch","No, at this point we are not envisioning any repricing of the acquisition and their performance as we've monitored it since the time of the acquisition has continued to be quite strong.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed.","Ghansham Panjabi - Baird","Just first off on sort of the macro mosaic, Chuck, any sort of high level comments as to what you are seeing specifically occur? Maybe conversations with your customers just given the mixed data out there? And then also for 3Q specifically I know you called out volumes during that last conference call for the month of May. Was there anything unusual for 3Q?","Chuck Bunch","No. So first, if we just look at business activity kind of across the end use markets with our customers and again it's been more of a regional mix or a regional story. So the North American businesses have remained quite strong as we have been talking aerospace, automotive OEM, we are seeing construction activity that has been I think consistently growing, initially residential, now we\u2019re seeing it also more broadly on the construction side.","So I would say, so the key end-use markets here in North America continue to be strong, especially here in the U.S. What we have seen in the rest of the world is some moderation of some of the strongest growth trends. We had seen some modest improvement in Europe over the first couple of quarters. Those trends I would say have continued but probably at a slightly more modest level, although the third quarter for us was still consistent with what we had seen earlier in the year.","Asia has been, especially China, a good story for us especially in these consumer businesses that -- where we look at the end use market growth in an automotive OEM, automotive refinish packaging. These have been solid growth stories in the Chinese market. We see some improvement starting in India. South America or Latin America for us, outside of that automotive OEM and industrial space not growing as much in terms of construction activity. So we\u2019re still going through both in Latin America and in Europe some moderation on the construction side and some slightly weaker currencies in both of those markets.","Ghansham Panjabi - Baird","Okay and then just in terms of Performance Coatings, did the operating margins come in where you thought they would for the quarter? I'm just wondering why there was a drop off versus the second quarter level.","Chuck Bunch","I think the operating margins were good. Typically in the third quarter you don't see as strong of margin or sales growth because of August being a slower month in Europe and those three months versus the second quarter in the architectural business is generally not quite as strong. But I would say otherwise we felt that it was a good performance in that group of businesses.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Neal Sangani - Goldman Sachs","This is Neal Sangani on for Bob. Some of the industry data out there showed a pretty significant deceleration in Chinese auto sales in September. Did you see something similar in that market? And what might the growth look like in China for the fourth quarter versus the strong 10% you saw in the third?","Chuck Bunch","We saw some of the data that came out in the third quarter. First two months of the quarter were quite strong and from a production or build standpoint which is where our sales are tied, we continued to see good growth. We feel have the momentum with some of the strongest performers in China in terms of automotive demand and at this point we\u2019re seeing solid growth at the 5% to 7.5% kind of growth rates which were what we anticipated as we went into the year.","Neal Sangani - Goldman Sachs"," Great, and your skeptical outlook for (indiscernible) price hikes in the back half earlier this year looks to have been pretty accurate. At this point do you sense whether you might see some price inflation in 2015?","Chuck Bunch","That\u2019s probably a little early to say, but I think right now we\u2019re seeing very consistent flat pricing in some of those inorganic materials.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","On a regional basis volume looks like it was the slowest in Europe, up less than 1%, and yet your earnings increased at the fastest pace at plus 17%. Can you elaborate on why that\u2019s the case? Presumably costs are part of it. If things slowdown from here are there additional levers that you can pull on the cost side going forward?","Chuck Bunch","Well, I would say, Kevin, first on the volume side we did have a little bit stronger first quarter this year and I think we talked about it early in our calls that we had very favorable weather. We had, we think, some things that probably pulled some of that business forward for us. In the first quarter I would say the Architectural Coatings businesses in the third quarter probably a little weaker in terms of overall end use markets and we mentioned a couple of the Southern European markets including France were a little weaker. But we still are finishing up I would say the restructuring actions and the costs that we have continued to pull out of that business.","It has been a very benign market in terms of inflationary cost more so than what you have seen generally out of Europe in terms of inflation. So we think that there are still some things that we can continue to affect in Europe to continue to be more efficient, more productive. And so, I would say that even in this very low volume environment we\u2019re expecting to continue to drive more productivity and cost actions.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay and then as a follow-up Chuck, given the downdraft in the equity markets, do you see any potential to accelerate the pace of share repurchases relative to the 150 million that you bought back in the third quarter?","Chuck Bunch","We would anticipate, Kevin that we are going to be buying at a higher level here in the fourth quarter. During the second and third quarters we sat out a little bit of those periods from share buyback activities because we were waiting on to see if the transactions would develop or were out of the market. So I would say that we\u2019re going to be continuing share buyback activities in the fourth quarter at a higher level. And we're obviously aware of the lower equity values for us and the market in general. So that could provide an additional opportunity to be a little more aggressive on share buybacks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Chuck, you mentioned FX being a headwind Q4. Would you care to try to quantify the impact of the weaker euro on your operations both maybe top-line and bottom-line in Q4?","Frank Sklarsky","So if you look at the euro where we have the most significant impact. Canadian is somewhat less of an impact, but the big impact is the euro and I would say if the rates were to stay where they are now as compared to our plan which is basically in line with where we were last year at this time, you are talking about $60 million to $70 million of impact on the top line mostly from translation. The impact on the bottom line is more muted because we do have that natural hedge with our manufacturing and overhead infrastructure in the same region. So you\u2019re looking at an EBIT or PTPI impact of single digits millions of dollars on that 60 million to 70 million on the top-line.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","And Chuck, just in terms nearer term trends, especially Europe, has October seen a pickup in demand either in the industrial businesses or architectural versus September?","Chuck Bunch","I would say, as I think I described our third quarter activity as September was consistent with normal seasonal trends coming off a slightly weaker August but a slightly stronger July here in the early part of October. I would consider the trends to be normal in our European operations.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.","Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities","And I guess normal in Europe is very positive these days. Hey, Chuck, you talked before about seeing marine starting to improve. Can you give us some orders of magnitude? How far down has it come over the past few years? And what sort of a recovery are we seeing there so we can have an idea as to how long that might play out?","Chuck Bunch","Well, I would say the new build activity which was again about 25% of our protective and marine business unit which let's call it rounding a $1 billion business. And we were down over 30% in that market and as I mentioned this is just the beginning of what we think will be a modest but longer term recovery. So, we are up in the third quarter low single-digits in terms of recovery. But it is a positive sign, we feel, that the market has hit bottom and is coming back.","Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities","So the expectation is that you could get back over the next two years 20% to 25% or so to get back to where normalized would be?","Chuck Bunch","I think if you look at the longer term trends and you are talking over the next -- this has been probably a trend that's -- the decline has been probably over three years. So if you look at a longer three to four year period I think we can get back to those kinds of production levels but over that kind of timeframe.","Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities","And then you mentioned in the prepared comments about the strong M&A pipeline. Are there particular regions or product areas that you are preferentially going to outside of Mexico of course?","Chuck Bunch","Yes. Well I would say is I commented earlier, although almost all of the acquisition, the modest acquisition activity that we have had this year, almost all of that has been here in North America and that is similar again to the target market for Comex. We see good discussions going on around the world probably now more balanced in the emerging region. So again discussions both in Asia, Latin America and Europe where maybe the levels of confidence over the last few years not quite as strong and this could provide us some opportunities going forward to make some key acquisitions over the next year or so.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets","I guess first question is on aerospace. Do see the growth rates there slowing at all or is there a chance that they could take actually accelerate when you kind of get more content on the 787?","Chuck Bunch","I think if you look at production levels now both at Airbus and Boeing and the backlogs that we see, I think you\u2019re going to see a maintenance of this continued trend that we have seen in commercial aviation, some improvement we hope in on the defense or military side of this. Airline profitability had to also been improving, so we were expecting and are hoping to see more improvement on what I would call that commercial aviation aftermarket.","So in general I think the trends are positive and growing, although commercial aviation build rates I think are at a very good level now and will probably get slightly better from here, but I don't see a major step change now with the build rates that they have.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets","And then on -- packaging has been lagging a little bit relative to the other businesses for a couple quarters. What is kind of that strategy here to turn things around or is it more market driven? Thanks.","Chuck Bunch","I would say it's both market driven and positioning of our business. So we\u2019re very committed to the packaging coatings market, it\u2019s been one of our best markets. We are going to be aggressive in this business to make sure that the new technologies that are coming in with the BPA free coatings, that we have we think an excellent opportunity to grow our position in the market. And so, we are taking the view that our participation and growth in packaging coatings albeit a mature market overall other than in the emerging regions is going to improve and increase as we go forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with UBS. Please proceed.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS","Chuck, one quick question on auto OEM, you continue to outpace the industry rate and I think previously you had mentioned that technology is the key driver. If that\u2019s the case should we expect that outperformance should continue in the foreseeable future?","Chuck Bunch","We still feel that we have very good momentum in the business both -- at all layers and in all regions, but especially where we have seen a lot of new automotive assembly operations. We are still very optimistic on the Chinese automotive market. We think we are still in the middle stages of very good growth in that market and we\u2019re seeing our water-based technologies, our compact processes that eliminate one of the primer coating layers, our electro-deposition primers that are world class and new over the last two years in terms of corrosion protection and efficiency for the automotive manufacturers. We see these trends continuing, so we feel good about our position and the opportunities to continue to grow nicely in our business on the backs of these technological innovations.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS","Okay and just to follow-up. As you talk about that initial recovery in commercial construction, I mean how confident are you that this is for real? And are there any risks there for something to go wrong?","Chuck Bunch","Well, you know I think that commercial construction has been probably lagging for now I would say 5 or 6 years here in North America. And if you look at the architectural billing indexes, many of the commercial construction indicators are beginning to turn around, we have discussed kind of the order book and backlog for our flat glass business which is one of the best indicators out there and our improving activity levels in Architectural Coatings.","So at this point here in the U.S. market I think the trends are there. Can things occur that derail it? Possibly. Interest rates are at this point still quite benign here in this market. Employment levels, another important indicator, they are up here in the U.S. So I think the commercial construction market here looks solid. And in some of the other regions we haven't seen as much of a lag and we\u2019re not expecting as much of a push now in markets like Europe or China from commercial construction, although we think the markets are -- have at this point normal activity levels, but we\u2019re seeing the opportunity for improvement here in the U.S. market.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed.","George D'Angelo - Jefferies","This is George D'Angelo on for Laurence today. Could you guys provide an update on margins in the Akzo business and where you are seeing that over year-end going?","Michael McGarry","It's consistent with where we saw it in the second quarter, so it's low double-digits right now which is a significant improvement from this marginally negative number they had when we bought it.","George D'Angelo - Jefferies","And just a follow-up, I know this is a question you guys have gotten in the past but glass is a non-core business. Are you guys open to selling it? And if so when would you sell it?","Chuck Bunch","Well we haven't really put a timetable on it. As we have stated in the past on many of our non-coatings businesses, we would be open to discussions or transactions that create value for our shareholders but we do not have any discussions going at this point on those businesses.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","Just a couple of questions if I may, can you give us a little bit of detail, you talked about the Chinese market being a strong market for you in consumer products, you mentioned auto OEM and auto aftermarket. Can you talk about the architectural growth both in China specifically but also in Australia and Asia in general?","Michael McGarry","In China in the third quarter we grew low double-digits. So it was a nice performing quarter for us there. Australia we grew mid upper-single-digits. So we had new product launches in Australia, did very well there. So both of those market segments not only grew and also had improving bottom line as well.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","That is not just on the architectural side, correct?","Michael McGarry","That is on the architectural side specifically. As far as Australia for our other businesses, they also had a very good quarter. It is growing and I would put it more in the low single-digits rates for those businesses and for our Chinese business, as you know, for our other ones it predominantly serves a local market. So it is a growing market. We had success in all our businesses.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","Okay. If I remember correctly and perhaps I am misremembering, but your Chinese architectural business was not growing as strongly in the first half of the year. If that\u2019s correct and you are seeing low double-digit growth there in the third quarter, sort of what changed given that the economic conditions in China probably didn't change for the better?","Michael McGarry","No, it was growing in the earlier part of the year as well.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","It was? Okay. I must be misremembering. All right and then just a follow-up--","Michael McGarry","It is a small business, Dmitry, don't forget that.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","I understand that. On the automotive OEM, Chuck did a very good job outlining sort of the new products and the initiatives that you have driving your above market sales, but if you kind of look at the 3.5% industry sale that you referenced versus a year-ago which was about double that. How much of that incremental growth if you will above the market is driven by the initiatives that -- the PPG initiatives that Chuck described? And how much of it is you being just partnered with your customers that may be gaining share because of faster relative growth of their brand?","Chuck Bunch","Well, we have a fairly broad industry representation. We serve almost all of the global OEMs. We have done quite well in China which is one market where you see a lot of domestic manufacturers, we have done well there and we have seen in some of the markets where we have been well-positioned in markets like North America where you see the truck and SUV markets have been probably the strongest segments. So that has helped us. We also have good participation with the Japanese OEMs outside of Japan and especially here in North America and Europe.","And as you see the migration of those Japanese auto builds from a domestic production in Japan exported to the rest of the world, they have put more of their production capacity outside of Japan and that has given us a good opportunity to increase our participation in those Japanese OEMs as they globalize their manufacturing footprint.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","There have been some I guess changes in ownership in the automotive OEM coatings area and I was wondering is when you look at the evolution of that industry, do you think it will be harder for you to take share or easier or the same? Is the industry competitive climate roughly the same or is it different?","Chuck Bunch","I would say the industry competitive climate has always been -- I would say has always been there. It's been what I would call a high competitive intensity, fewer players but high competitive intensity.","We see that continuing and if I look at growth rates and participation in markets in Asia, as an example, I see a continuation of those trends. Although here again we have been able to do well in these markets despite what I would call large global competitors and I expect that activity to continue, Jeff.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","Okay, and then for my follow-up, Europe did slow from 3% to something like flat growth or flat to up growth. Is this a one-off event or when you look at your European business over the next three or four quarters do you expect it to flatten out?","You will be up against tougher comparisons because of weather all things being equal and it seems that economic growth has slowed down and will that change your approach to, I don't know removing costs or investing in the business?","Chuck Bunch","Well, if you look at a couple of the macro events in the region and so for us our European business includes Eastern Europe and Russia, it includes the Middle East and Africa. And we think that there has been some moderation obviously of growth in -- our Eastern European business has continued to be good relative to the overall market. Russia has obviously weakened some. The Middle East is a difficult market right now. And in Africa, although it's a smaller part of that overall region for us both with port congestion, Ebola and other things, there are some macro or geopolitical trends right now in Europe that are going to moderate those growth rates.","So we\u2019re going to focus more on cost reduction productivity as we have and if we see things beginning to weaken, we will become more active on cost reduction. I think as we said, Europe for us in September and here in early October has been a -- what we would call normal or consistent trends.","Certainly we weren't in a high growth rate in any of those markets with the exception of what we experienced I think in the first quarter of this year when we got a little bit of favorable weather that helped the architectural business. So we\u2019re going to hunker down if we need to and work on costs here in Europe to keep this very good earnings trend going even if the growth rates continue to be as modest as they have been this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of PJ Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed.","PJ Juvekar - Citi","Back in May during your Analyst Day you talked about rebranding in the independent dealer channels. And can you just talk about how is that rollout going and what kind of growth are you seeing in that particular channel?","Michael McGarry","We are starting that as well as the rebranding in the company owned stores. And we said in an earlier question that the independent dealer market was very modestly lower. So I think a minus 1 kind of number to think about. So it has helped, but we haven't rolled it out completely but it is in progress.","PJ Juvekar \u2013 Citi","And then in the refinish market there is a big consolidation going on with the multi-shelf operators like Service King. So can you talk to us about what is your position with those customers?","Chuck Bunch","We have a very good position with the multi-shop operators. Service King in particular now -- there is ownership changes I think in that market and with that customer with private equity. But overall PPG's position in North America with multi-shop operators is very strong. There has been consolidation but we have continued to benefit from the trends and it is a growing trend.","We think over the next few years to see more consolidation as you move across the value or supply chain in refinish, but right now we feel we are well-positioned in this market to take advantage of any acceleration of the existing trends.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Sheehan with SunTrust. Please proceed.","James Sheehan - SunTrust","Wondering if you could comment on the opportunity in interior can coatings? Could you just size the opportunity for us in 2015?","Chuck Bunch","Seize the opportunity in terms of overall market or sales?","James Sheehan - SunTrust","Overall -- yes, the sales that you might expect to generate, yes.","Chuck Bunch","Well, I would again mention that this is packaging coatings business, important market for us. It's one of our smallest business units, however and traditionally we have been less present on the inside of the can. And if you look overall at the market we\u2019re -- this is probably around on the order of magnitude of less than $5 billion overall market and we think that if you look at the opportunity for us we can probably grow our position by double-digits over the next few years, especially with the introduction of new technologies with BPA free.","James Sheehan - SunTrust","And just on the Comex process, what are the next steps for that? Are you reasonably certain that all the information has been collected and you are just waiting on an answer? Or does there need to be any more hearings? What can we look for?","Michael McGarry","So the way that works is once a week they publish an agenda, so they will publish an agenda Friday, tomorrow for next week. All the questions have been asked and answered. We're obviously waiting on them to put it formally on the agenda. They have not asked any questions in the past 7 to 10 days. So we\u2019re in a wait mode right now. We feel confident that given the fact that we have negligible presence in Mexico that they will look favorably upon this transaction.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please proceed.","Nils Wallin - CLSA","Curious about the effect of raw materials, obviously you highlighted that with oil coming down that you might see some relief on your raw material for the next quarter or two. How will that impact your ability to hold price for your products? Will you be able to hold price for a few quarters after that or will you have to give up price almost immediately too?","Chuck Bunch","Typically, there has been a lag in our industry both on the upside or the downside. But I would tell you oil at the wellhead price is not a direct raw material input for us. So I would tell you that it depends on what's happening downstream in the petrochemical change so that you can get a lower oil price, but it may take a while and then it depends on what is happening in some of our monomer or polymer costs to see when those oil wellhead prices really translate to either lower gasoline or lower propylene cost.","Nils Wallin - CLSA","Understood. Also would you help us -- give a little bit more color what you mean by active when you refer to your active pipeline? Are you seeing more people come to you? Are you seeing more properties with an attractive price? What do you mean by active?","Chuck Bunch","Well active I would describe as; one there is probably more auction activity today. So if you look at kind of the larger space and I'm talking globally now, there is probably now several more auctions or properties that are actively being marketed for sale and they are also good.","We always try to have a consistent dialogue with any coatings companies that may potentially now or in the future want to sell and I would say those discussions have been more active. But we\u2019re also seeing auction activities that would demonstrate that the pipeline for us or the activity level in the coatings space is there.","Nils Wallin - CLSA","Understood, and there is just a follow-up. Would you sense that given what you see today in this activity that a year from now there could be an acceleration in how much M&A you have done? Or is it just an indication that the market has sort of -- that has been dry sort of opening up again?","Chuck Bunch","I would say you have seen some transactions announced over the last year. We have done a number of them, probably five or six here almost all in the U.S., smaller transactions. I would say that if the pace of activity continues you are going to see over the course of the next year or two probably similar levels of activity and some larger transactions. And I would say that if you described ours as bolt-ons, I would say that you are going to see some slightly bigger transactions even if they are not kind of megadeals. So I would be surprised if we didn't see more announced transactions both on the part of PPG or potentially others in the market over the next 12 to 18.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Perrella with Bloomberg Intelligence. Please proceed.","Christopher Perrella - Bloomberg Intelligence","A follow-up to the M&A activity with your targeted I guess returning 3 billion to 4 billion through acquisitions and share repurchases, if the acquisition pipeline doesn't pan out as planned would that indicate more share repurchases to hit that $4 billion number by the end of next year?","Chuck Bunch","Yes.","Christopher Perrella - Bloomberg Intelligence","All right, and for the Glass business have you done all the rightsizing of that business? And now the only thing left is for activity volumes to pick up there or are there more levers to pull in Glass?","Chuck Bunch","I think that there are still some more levers to pull as we try to improve the overall performance of the assets and I think we indicated in the third quarter, although we had improving let's call it operating performance in the flat glass business. We still struggled on the fiberglass side with our operation, so there is certainly an opportunity there to improve the performance of that business which is about half of the overall glass business. And I think we have some opportunities more broadly to improve the performance and the asset base of those businesses over the next couple of years.","Christopher Perrella - Bloomberg Intelligence","All right and quickly on Comex. Is there a legal deadline that the Commission has to make a decision on the application?","Michael McGarry","Yes, right now they have to respond by the middle of December.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eugene Fedotoff with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Do you expect natural gas costs to turn positive in fourth quarter or should prices stay at around the same level?","Vince Morales","Eugene, this is Vince. It will still be a slight negative, but the first quarter last year saw a significant increase in natural gas costs in the first quarter of \u201814. So if prices stay where they are today it would be a tailwind in the first quarter of 2015.","Eugene Fedotoff - KeyBanc Capital Markets","And just a question on U.S. architectural business, the (indiscernible) season it seems like is extending a little bit longer versus last year and you are negotiating some store closing, also doing some rebranding.

We appreciate your continued interest and welcome you to our fourth quarter financial results teleconference.","Joining me from PPG on the call today is Chuck Bunch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael McGarry, Chief Operating Officer and Frank Sklarsky, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments and Q&A relate to the financial information released today, Thursday, January 15, 2015.","I will remind everyone that we posted detailed commentary and the accompanying presentation slides on our investor center at our website at PPG.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide some additional support to the opening comments that Chuck and Frank will make momentarily. Following Chuck's perspective on the company results, Frank will provide a brief financial update and then we will move directly to Q&A.","Both the prepared commentary and discussion during the call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance.

For any additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. And now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch.","Chuck Bunch","Thank you, Vince and good afternoon everyone. Today, we reported fourth quarter 2014 financial results that established new fourth quarter milestones for net sales of $3.7 billion and fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $2.11. Our sales improved 6%, a figure that includes an unfavorable 4% impact from currency translation. So our sales in local currencies grew by 10%. Our sales volumes grew about 4% year-over-year, a growth rate higher than our third quarter level. Although the overall pace of business remained varied by region, the growth rate of each major region also improved sequentially.","Our U.S. and Canada business delivered sales volume growth of about 5% year-over-year. Our Asia-Pacific region also grew 5%, the highest growth rate of the year. Sales volumes in Europe, the Middle East and Africa grew by about 1% after being flat in the third quarter. Our sales volume growth was broad-based across our business portfolio including our Industrial Coatings segment where each business in the segment delivered solid volume growth. Sales volumes also improved for aerospace, automotive refinish and our architectural coatings business in the U.S. and Canada. For the fourth quarter, we generally experienced normal seasonal trends in all of our businesses and regions.","Supplementing the company's volume growth in the quarter were acquisition-related sales gains of about 6% stemming primarily from the Comex acquisition which closed in early November. Comex had partial quarter sales of about $175 million with a mid-teen percentage return on sales reflective of the quality of the business.","From an earnings perspective, our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.11 improved 26% versus the prior year supported by growth of at least 10% in each of our reporting segments. The improved segment earnings were driven by higher sales volumes, continued aggressive cost management and benefits from the Comex acquisition.","Cash deployed on share repurchases was also a contributing factor to our record results. We repurchased $300 million or about 1.4 million shares in the fourth quarter which brings our full-year total to $750 million or about 3.8 million shares. In the quarter, our average diluted shares outstanding were 2.7% lower versus the previous year's fourth quarter and 3.7% lower for the full year 2014.","Now let me comment quickly on our full-year results. On a full-year basis, our sales were $15.4 billion, up 8% due to higher sales volumes and acquisitions. Our full-year sales volumes grew more than 4% in the U.S. and Canada between 3.5% and 4% in Asia and Latin America and about 2.5% in Europe, although most of the European growth occurred in the first half of the year. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share was $9.75, up 27% versus our prior year record. We have delivered at least 20% adjusted earnings per share growth for several consecutive years, clearly illustrating the benefits of our active portfolio management, earnings accretive cash deployment and persistent operational focus.","For the quarter and full year, I was pleased with our strong financial performance and overall operational execution in what was a modest growth year from a global economic perspective. Just to comment on a few other highlights for the company in 2014, our earnings improved in each major region by at least 14%. This includes an improvement of more than $100 million or 21% in Europe despite muted regional economic activity and currency headwinds late in the year. Most of our businesses continue to execute very well and in several cases, we outperformed respective global industry growth rates.","I'm also pleased to report that we have realized one year ahead of schedule a targeted run rate of acquisition synergies relating to our 2013 acquisition of Akzo Nobel's North American architectural coatings business. After nearly two years of successful business integration, we are now shifting to a growth focus for that business.","From a balance sheet management perspective, in the fourth quarter, we refinanced some of our debt obligations which will result in lower net interest beginning in 2015. Frank will talk more about this in a minute. Strategically, 2014 was another very successful and eventful year as we continue to enhance our business portfolio. This includes the first-quarter sale of our ownership interest in the Transitions Optical joint venture for $1.7 billion pre-tax or $1.5 billion after-tax. Also, the Comex acquisition completed in the fourth quarter was the second largest in our company's history. We are very pleased to now have this high-quality business as part of PPG.","Finally, we continued our heritage of returning cash to our shareholders with more than $1.1 billion returned for the year through dividends and share repurchases. I will remind everyone that we have paid a dividend for 115 consecutive years and raised our annual dividend payout for 43 consecutive years. We increased our per-share dividend 10% in April of 2014. Again, a very strong fourth quarter and full-year performance for our company.","As we enter 2015, our overall outlook is similar to what we experienced last year. We anticipate growth rates will remain mixed by region with North American and Asian economies continuing to grow at rates generally consistent with 2014. Our base case assumption is that European growth will remain subdued overall; however, we believe that European economies stand to benefit considerably if oil prices remain at current levels which may stimulate higher growth in that region.","Given our broad geographic reach and full array of coatings businesses, we expect to benefit from the continued global growth. From a PPG perspective, we remain focused on new product development, operational excellence and continued opportunities to deploy cash for earnings accretion.","As many of you know, at the beginning of 2014, we provided a cash deployment target of $3 billion to $4 billion for acquisitions and share repurchases. That target encompassed years 2014 and 2015. Our actual cash deployed relating to acquisitions and share buybacks for 2014 alone totaled about $3.2 billion. Our acquisition pipeline remains active and share repurchases remain an integral part of our capital allocation strategy. We anticipate deploying an additional $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion of cash on acquisitions and buybacks in years 2015 and 2016 combined with a focus on creating shareholder value.","Let me conclude by saying 2014 was an excellent year for PPG and our shareholders. We are looking forward to a successful 2015 and now I will turn it over to Frank to review a few 2015 financial assumptions.","Frank Sklarsky","Thank you, Chuck and good afternoon everyone. I'll now cover several items that will assist in modeling our 2015 sales and earnings. We've included in today's presentation materials a summary of these financial assumptions on slide number 13. First is the impact of the Comex acquisition. As Chuck mentioned, we closed this acquisition in early November 2014, so we benefited from partial quarterly results in the fourth quarter of 2014.","For 2015, we expect the acquisition will add approximately $1 billion in full-year sales. Incremental sales for 2015 will be $800 million to $825 million reflecting our partial year 2014 ownership. The Comex business is expected to have a mid-teens earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT percentage return on sales for the year. However, this will vary by quarter due to business seasonality. The quarterly seasonality of the business differs somewhat from PPG's European and U.S. and Canadian architectural coatings businesses. The Comex quarterly sales phasing is expected to be approximately 20% to 22% in the first quarter, 23% to 26% in the second and third quarters and 29% to 31% in the fourth quarter.","Next, as many of you are aware, a variety of foreign currencies began to weaken in the second half of 2014 as measured against the U.S. dollar. As a result, the company expects that year-over-year currency translation will unfavorably impact sales by $650 million to $750 million and earnings by about $65 million to $75 million. These figures represent our current assumptions and are based on current exchange rates as of this week. Again, these impacts are currency translation related and given the nature of our business, we typically do not incur significant transaction related currency impacts.","The next item relates to the company's pension and other post-employment benefits or OPEB expenses. We are expecting these expenses to increase by about $60 million to $65 million in 2015. This increase stems from changes to employee and retiree mortality rate tables that are commonly used by most U.S. companies. Also, the year-end discount rate that is used to determine OPEB and pension liabilities was lower at the end of December 2014 versus December 2013. Both the discount rate and the mortality tables represent important calculation variables when computing estimated annual OPEB and pension expenses. This increased expense will be recognized in our financial results ratably throughout the year.","As Chuck mentioned, we expect lower net interest expenses for 2015. We refinanced a portion of our term debt in the fourth quarter which is the key driver of this decrease. Included in the appendix of the presentation materials are details of the debt obligations we refinanced. We expect a total of $55 million of lower net interest expense year-over-year with $18 million less expense in the first quarter and $11 million, $14 million and $12 million lower in the second, third and fourth quarters respectively.","Next, we anticipate that the company's 2015 tax rate on ongoing earnings from continuing operations will be in the range of 24% to 25%. The comparable rate for 2014 was 23.9%. The increase relates primarily to higher earnings in Mexico resulting from the Comex acquisition. The Mexican tax rate is higher than PPG's global tax rate. Other factors may also impact the 2015 tax rate throughout the year, including the regional mix of earnings.","Finally as Chuck mentioned, the company anticipates cash deployment of $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion in years 2015 and 2016 combined for acquisitions and share repurchases. This is incremental to the approximate $3.2 billion that has already been deployed as part of the previous target of $3 billion to $4 billion. Once again a summary of these financial assumptions is contained in the presentation materials for today's call. This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again we appreciate your interest in PPG and now operator would you please open the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Go ahead, sir.","Ghansham Panjabi","Just in the context of all the macro data all over the world, you obviously saw an improvement in core volumes. Is that just your end-market exposure that leaves you better positioned on a relative basis or share gains? I'm curious on your perspective just because comps were tougher in 4Q.","Chuck Bunch","I would say that I think this reflects our exposure to the end-use markets on a regional basis. I would say that's probably the largest factor although we have several businesses that have outpaced the global growth rates as we look at them.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay. And just switching to North American architectural, just given Lowe's announcement with the HGTV brand, just curious on your thoughts as to what your big retail partners are sharing with you in terms of strategy? Are they pursuing a more broad-based set of brands throughout their stores or is this something just a test case and we'll wait and see what happens?","Michael McGarry","Ghansham, this is Michael. First of all, I want to say that with the line reviews we did come out modestly ahead, so that's a net positive. I think when you think about the big boxes, they are all focused on getting more traffic into the stores. Once they get that additional traffic in the stores, they're trying to convert them at a higher rate and I think that's their strategy and we're certainly looking to be part of that higher retention and growth rate.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Go ahead.","Vincent Andrews","Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Wondering if you could talk a bit about how we should be thinking about your raw materials as we move through the year just given the move in crude and in ethylene and propylene and how we should be thinking about that both in terms of the cost line potentially in terms of how it might impact the revenue line if you have to give some of it back and just sort of the cadence of it.","Chuck Bunch","Let me give you a little bit of a background. In the fourth quarter, we didn't see the raw material benefits, we've seen throughout the course of 2014 the stability overall in raw material pricing and that's where we were in the fourth quarter. What we have seen here at the end of the fourth quarter and now going into the first quarter of 2015 with these larger oil price declines, we are now currently negotiating with many of our suppliers around the world on the impact of these oil price declines on their pricing.","I would say the general trend of the discussions is modestly lower at this point. We've seen some commodities that have moved more quickly. These would be products like solvents which are more commodity-like and trade closer between spot and contract pricing. But I would say that right now we don't buy our raw materials for the most part on indexes, so these discussions are really taking place around the world on a variety of commodities. We have seen a little more weakness, if I look at it regionally, a little more weakness in the Asia-Pacific region. Their prices typically respond more quickly.","In Europe, we have seen lower economic growth, but weakness in currency that's muting some of these dollar based oil declines. So we're going to see where that takes us here over the first quarter and likewise here in North America, business conditions a little stronger and we're currently negotiating with our suppliers here and we're only two weeks into the first quarter, so it's a little too early to tell. I think we will have a lot more visibility by the end of the first quarter. And with our prices right now, we've had relatively stable pricing here at the end of 2014, a few puts and takes, but overall pricing is stable. That remains our base case as we go into 2015 and we'll evaluate that as we see the trends overall in the markets both here and around the world.","Vincent Andrews","Just maybe as a quick follow-up, could you just maybe tell us roughly in the raw material basket that's oil linked in one way or another, what percentage would you say is pure commodity versus what percentage might be a product that's priced for value rather than has some differentiation to it that's just not necessarily going to move one for one with a propylene or an ethylene price?","Chuck Bunch","Well, our raw material basket, if you look at all of the things we're doing in both the organic, inorganic area plus other packaging materials and general purchasing, I would say about 20% overall was tied to hydrocarbon pricing broadly. And I would say that, of that mix -- I haven't looked at it quite in terms of commodity versus polymeric differentiated resins, but certainly less than half of that total is tied directly to commodity pricing. So I would say we are typically buying things that are either specified or somewhat differentiated, so we're not buying a lot of ethylene. We're not buying any ethylene anymore and very little of the propylene or other monomers that you could directly attribute to these price declines.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Go ahead, sir.","Jeff Zekauskas","You talked about revenues from Comex being about $1 billion in 2015. I was wondering what Mexican exchange rate you're using? I think the peso has maybe fallen about 10% on average and so I would've thought there would have been more of a currency penalty.","Frank Sklarsky","Jeff, when we announced this deal the currency was 13.2, it peaked at about 14.7, it's trading today at 14.5. So it's up about 10%. But despite that, all the $0.65 to $0.75 of accretion that we expect on EPS we will deliver.","Vince McMahon","Jeff, this is Vince, we've seen growth in the business over that time period that eclipsed most of the currency declines.","Jeff Zekauskas","And then for my follow-up, I think in your financial statements you call out about $36 million in transition costs in the quarter, but in the footnotes it looks like there's $52 million in costs. There is a $21 million inventory step-up, $17 million in R&D, $14 million in other. So does that mean that some of these costs were included in operating earnings?","Frank Sklarsky","No, I don't know if you're looking at a pre-tax\/post-tax number, but associated with the acquisitions primarily Comex is that $29 million that you talked about, it's a pre-tax number. Two-thirds of that is the inventory step-up, the rest of it is closing costs. So that's associated with Comex.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Go ahead.","P.J. Juvekar","Chuck, when it comes to your pricing of your products, historically you said that industrial customers look for a price break quickly compared to architectural business. So I was wondering if you can talk about that dynamic of industrial versus architectural pricing.","Chuck Bunch","Well, I would say, P.J., there is no real standard in terms of when we're going to have discussions with either industrial or architectural customers. Some of it is related to either bidding or negotiating policies when we've reached agreements. So I would say at this point that it's difficult for us to say with these movements in raw material, oil pricing that things that we can say hard and fast rule when we're going to be able to reflect any advantages that we get from lower raw material prices or when we'll have discussions with our customer base across the board.","P.J. Juvekar","Okay. And then my second question is on OEM. You've been growing faster than the market for many years and now one of your competitors is also claiming to be growing and gaining share. And if the overall pie is not growing, do you think somebody else is losing share?","Chuck Bunch","No I would say that as we reported in the fourth quarter, we continue to perform well versus a global industry growth rate. We think over time we have very capable competitors in this space and I think over time our growth rate should reflect overall industry growth trends on a long term basis.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Go ahead.","Duffy Fischer","A question on cash flow, if I just do the quick math of it, you talked about between $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion paying out either from acquisitions or buyback. Your dividend is running at about $360 million, so let's say that grows a little bit. The dividend plus that say high end at $2.5 billion gets us to about $3.3 billion, but your cash flow from ops this year without Comex was $1.8 million so over two years that gets us somewhere north of $4 billion of operating cash flow. So it seems like there is a gap where you either build $1 billion in cash or I wouldn't think pay down debt with that. So can you just walk through the triangulation of the cash flow generation over the next two years in the $2.5 billion number?","Frank Sklarsky","Yes, Duffy, this is Frank. So we ended this 2014 with about $1.2 billion in cash and we expect to generate over a $1 billion in both 2015 and 2016. Remember that's an amount that's after CapEx and after dividend. So what we're saying is without any of these additional actions, when you take that $1.2 billion and end up with something north of $3 billion by the end of 2016 and we intended to deploy $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion of that on acquisitions and share repurchase. So the difference on the cash flow number that you and I are quoting is really the dividend and the CapEx.","Duffy Fischer","And then if we just walk back, a year ago seemed very optimistic on the acquisition front. Obviously, at that time, you didn't know you were going to [Technical Difficulty]. You know that fell in your lap, but we haven't seen other acquisitions that obviously were on your plate at that same time. So what happened with those and I guess why weren't we able to or is it just a timing issue to do some more work on what was obviously your target list at this time last year?","Chuck Bunch","Well, Duffy, we did announce in the fourth quarter the acquisition -- the agreement for an acquisition with REVOCOAT or AXSON, the automotive OEM material supplier that has not closed yet, but that was announced in the fourth quarter and we still have a number of discussions and negotiations going on. So we remain confident and optimistic that we'll be able to deliver more acquisition growth here in 2015 and beyond. So I feel pretty good about it and we did get the other one announced that we haven't closed obviously, but I think that was a positive step and that will be a good opportunity for us going forward in our Industrial Coatings segment.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, sir.","David Begleiter","Chuck, just on your gross margin, can you talk about the 2015 versus 2014 thoughts given, one, the addition of Comex and two, obviously the big drop you will see in raws? In the past, you've seen a pretty big uptick in the gross margin off of sharp declines in crude oil.","Chuck Bunch","Well, I would say at this point, David that we're looking to have maybe small incremental improvements in the overall gross margins with not only the acquisition of Comex, but also what we're seeing in our other businesses with some headwinds out there in terms of currency and the like. But we think it's going to be stable to slightly up in terms of margin performance. Obviously, we're going through this negotiation phase and we don't really know where raw materials and others have settled out. But I think there are some opportunities for improvement here, but right now I would say we're looking for stable to just slightly higher margin opportunities.","David Begleiter","So just on the trends in January, any destocking that you see amongst yourselves or your customers?","Chuck Bunch","This year, we have an early reporting date today so we haven't seen as much of a trend. There were some things happening in the fourth quarter with individual customers and inventory management, but I would say it's a little too early to say. I think what we did note in our recorded documents is that weather patterns looks like so far more of a normal winter here in North America, but we also benefited in the first quarter last year from very good weather in Europe. So right now, it's a little too early for us to see any significant trends overall for our business.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, Bob.","Bob Koort","Chuck, you guys noted the mid-teens operating margins in Comex and I guess I would've thought seasonally maybe it would've been a little bit lower than that. I think your guidance is for mid-teens in 2015, but you note there is seasonality. So is there something different about the Mexican paint markets from the U.S. paint markets in terms of that seasonality?","Michael McGarry","Bob, this is Michael. I think Frank covered some of this in his opening remarks, but think about 20% in Q1, 25% in Q2 and Q3 and 30% in Q4. Generally the mid-teens in the fourth quarter, it's a seasonally stronger quarter for them, so we'll start a little bit slower in the first quarter, but we'll build up and we have some good opportunities there. Their resin plant is not fully loaded, so we're looking at supplying our own Mexican operations with that. We've looked at some synergies as well. So I think right now we'll be trending toward that $30 million to $40 million synergy number that we gave you as well.","Bob Koort","And Michael, I know your beating stick has a little blood on it from marking up those TiO2 companies in the last few years. Can you give us a sense if there is any more room to rift or substitute or get some more price relief there or do you think we've come closer to the end of those trends?","Michael McGarry","I think our view of the market hasn't changed, it's still oversupplied. You have billions coming on with the new chloride plant in China. We've looked at the preproduction samples; they are getting better, more consistent, it will be up and operational late in Q1 early Q2. When you look at the industry in general, we still plan to take out TiO2, get more formulation, 1% to 2%. We think our other folks that we compete with have similar type programs. We saw Comex had a similar program. So the trends that you see I think will continue.","Bob Koort","Cost component of those substitutes which may be petrochemical-based doesn't reduce some of the likelihood of moving away from TiO2?","Michael McGarry","I don't think so.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Don Carson from Susquehanna International. Go ahead, sir.","Don Carson","Yes, two questions. First on going back to auto OEM and I think for over a year now you've been growing above industry growth rates. What exactly is it that enables you to do that? Is it your eco technology which is quite differentiated from others? And Chuck, why is it that you think you'll eventually fall back in line to just growing at industry levels? And then just a follow-on on your glass business, you seem to have an improving outlook there both from a volume and raw materials standpoint. Is now the time to monetize glass or do you think that there is further improvements to come?","Chuck Bunch","Well on the auto OEM side first, Don, I would say that I think we've been benefiting from some technology developments especially as they apply to new plants in the developing regions. So we were well-positioned there to take advantage of brand-new plants that were converting to newer technologies. So I think it was a good fit with the technologies and position that we had and we've been growing nicely with some of the most successful companies on a global basis. So we were well-positioned with some of the customers that we\u2019re growing the fastest so that we have been the beneficiary there in what has been overall a very good period for global automotive growth not only here or in China, but in general we've seen good growth trends for the industry and we think that we're positioned to do that over the next couple of years.","But as we look at the competitive arena, these companies that we're competing with either globally or on a regional basis are capable organizations so that I would say that over time we would expect that the growth trends for our company would be similar to what we're seeing in the global industry growth trends.","And the second question is the glass business; yes the flat glass business and we've been talking about this for the last several quarters. We've finally seen some improving trends there. We had obviously one disposition of one of our glass plants here in North America to Fuyao and we think that business in particular is positioned to improve results as we go through 2015.","As we have talked about in the past, these businesses are let's call them less core and we continue, as we did with this sale to Fuyao, we continue to look for opportunities to create shareholder value in these businesses. So if we see the right opportunity or the right transaction in either this flat glass business or the fiberglass business we will certainly proceed and the timing at least if these trends continue will certainly be better than some of the things that we've faced over the last couple of years and we said we were going to be patient. So we're going to wait and see. This is still early days in the recovery, but very good trends here.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America. Go ahead, Kevin.","Kevin McCarthy","Just a question for Mike, I was wondering if you could provide an update on your execution against your plans to increase store count in the U.S. and Canada as you had outlined back in May in Dallas. What have you done so far and how much do you see ahead for 2015?","Michael McGarry","Sure, Kevin, for 2014, we increased our store count by 35 through acquisition and 17 new. So that's a total of 52 plus 13 in Canada and then we also grew stores in Europe and of course with Comex they also added 174 concessionaires of which 32 of them were in the November\/December timeframe. For next year, for 2015 that is, we have a count between 25 and 50 for the full year.","Kevin McCarthy","And then I guess a broader question. On slide 5 of your deck, you illustrate trends by geography and it just strikes me that in Asia and Latin America you've had a very steady pattern of acceleration there. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color as to what's driving that either by country or product line.","Chuck Bunch","So page 5, in Asia if we start there, Kevin -- the big growth driver for us has been China and we've had a number of end-use markets that have continued to perform well for us, automotive OEM, the refinish business the protective and marine coatings had good growth in industrial and businesses or segments like automotive parts. So we have been well-positioned in Asia and in Latin America I would say the biggest trend has continued to be the Mexican automotive and industrial end-use market where we've continued to perform well and that's not including this Comex acquisition. So let's call it the core or legacy PPG business in Mexico has continued to perform well. The South American market has been a little spottier, especially with the currency weakness, but most of that growth in that region has come out of our core legacy PPG business in Mexico.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts","How much of the pension cost increase is interest expense and how much is this mortality rate change and what triggered that since I don't think you've done that before?","Frank Sklarsky","It's about half-and-half between the impact of the interest rates and the impact on mortality. The mortality tables do not get updated that often, but every several years folks that publish these things for corporate America do that and those came out in the fall. Folks like Mercer and other consultants, they go back-and-forth with this thing and negotiate what they think the most reasonable assumptions will be and then they get published to the world and so that's why it's rather infrequent on that element.","The other element, the interest, is really based every year on the December 31 rate that's associated with a basket of debt securities that matches the maturity of our liability payouts to our participants. And that rate which is about 4.8% at the end of 2013 dropped to about 4% even at the end of 2014 which nobody would've expected at the beginning of last year, but that dynamic had an impact of $30 million of the $60 million of what we're looking for in terms of a headwind for 2015.","John Roberts","But that mortality rate change then will be an industrywide adoption that Mercer has now rolled out across most companies?","Frank Sklarsky","Yes, you're going to see that amongst a number of companies because we almost all of us use the same tables.","John Roberts","Okay and then secondly, the specialty coatings and materials segment last quarter, I think it was up -- not segment -- but the specialty coatings and materials SBU within Industrial Coatings, I think it was up double-digit last quarter and now it's mid-single. Is that just a more difficult comp that's there or what caused the deceleration there?","Chuck Bunch","There was no deceleration. I would say we have a variety of -- that's called specialty coatings products and optical products that are in some cases tied into the electronics material value chain. So this can cause some lumpiness in terms of quarterly sales because of seasonal trends for equipment, electronic equipment and alike, but there was no underlying business weakness issues, that was just more of a seasonal pattern.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo.","Sabina Chatterjee","It's Sabina Chatterjee in for Frank Mitsch today. Just going back to the cash question, how should we think about the pace of the $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion program? It's also a pretty wide range, so if you could just talk us through the factors that put you perhaps at the high versus low end that would be great.","Frank Sklarsky","I think that if you look at the entirety of everything, we've always taken that balanced capital allocation strategy and we've said that acquisitions and share repurchase are really the two pieces of that and the allocation between those two will depend upon the acquisition pipeline and the pace of execution of that acquisition pipeline. So in any given quarter, you might see more of one, less of the other.","We've said consistently that share repurchase will continue to be part of our capital allocation strategy. So chances are we will be in the market on a relatively consistent basis on that element, but what might drive the number of higher versus lower would be again at any time we might be in the market with share repurchase, but also could potentially have an acquisition come over the transom and reach completion in any given quarter.","As we also said before, we really don't have a limitation in terms of our cash domicile because we have enough tax-planning strategies to have the cash where we need it when we need it to execute this magnitude of returning cash to shareholders or doing acquisitions.","Sabina Chatterjee","Okay, and then on that topic of acquisitions you mentioned a pretty active pipeline. Where are you seeing the greatest opportunities either by product or region?","Chuck Bunch","Well, as you saw, Sabina, in 2014, we were fortunate that here in North America we were able to get a couple of smaller deals done in architectural and protective and marine coatings and then the big one here in the fourth quarter at Comex. So I would say that we're still seeing discussions and opportunities in every region, maybe for different reasons, but many of these companies, the small to medium sized companies that have been the core acquisition targets, they are moved by, in some cases, either succession planning issues or concerns around market weakness and alike. So for different reasons we're seeing discussions going on around the world.","So I would say that we think as you saw after all these deals that we did in North America in 2013, 2014 and the announcement that we had in the fourth quarter around REVOCOAT, that's a European acquisition. So I think that shows you that we're engaged around the world and I would say that the patterns probably will continue this year.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead, sir.","Arun Viswanathan","I just had a couple questions. I guess first off, it appears that maybe one of the bigger risks that people are worried about here is Europe and in general industrial. So maybe you can talk a little bit about both, first off general industrial globally and then also as it relates specifically to Europe.","Chuck Bunch","For us, I feel that our general industrial business performed well in 2014. Not every end-use market was as strong, it depended on the region. Most of the businesses were strong here in North America. In Europe, you still had some growth in automotive and automotive parts for a number of our industrial businesses are still some of the strongest end-use markets. Some markets specifically here in the U.S. you see the construction market is stronger, so we've performed well there. So I would say as we looked on for the full year of 2014, our Industrial Coatings or general industrial business did well overall even if not all the markets were growing at a consistent basis over all the regions. And in Europe, we saw some weakness there overall in growth rates, especially compared to some of the other regions, but we've worked hard in Europe to become more productive focused on our costs. The automotive business in Europe hasn't been a strong growth market, but it has grown low single digit percentages and we've been able to take advantage of again our technology and service capabilities. So we feel pretty good about the business overall and going into 2015 as well.","Arun Viswanathan","And then on the performance side, just wondering about aerospace, you've been clipping at higher single digits there. Is there any -- what's the outlook given potential for deliveries on both the OEM side and then also for aftermarket? And then if you have any comments further on refinish as well that would be great. Thanks.","Michael McGarry","This is Michael. We still see very positive trends in the aerospace business. So I don't think that's going to change going forward. Our refinish business, we had I would call mixed results. The U.S. was by far the strongest and when you look at the trends that are driving that to lower gas prices, that's a positive, unemployment dropping that's a positive. Truck rate going up that's a positive, more congestion that's a positive. So I think we're going to continue to see good volume in our refinish business, but they are doing well in our light industrial and our commercial transport side. So overall, we're still very bullish on both of those businesses.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Kevin Hocevar from Northcoast Research. Go ahead, Kevin.","Kevin Hocevar","I'm wondering if you could provide us an outlook for your U.S. architectural paint business either by channel or by contractor and DIY market for 2015.","Michael McGarry","I would tell you that if you start with the macro, we're looking at housing starts being up 100,000, so that should be a positive. We're looking at the commercial market continuing to grow. The backlog is still there with our commercial painters. The dealer segment has been a declining segment, so we would expect that to decline 1% or 2% again. The big boxes should have modest growth as well, so I think overall I think you can probably draw a picture of what that overall trend line looks like.","Kevin Hocevar","Okay. And then just as my follow-up, you mentioned if lower oil prices are sustained, it could help stimulate EMEA growth. I was wondering if you're seeing any signs of that at all right now in any of your product lines, maybe those tied closer to the consumer or is that more of just potential to happen down the road?","Chuck Bunch","I think it's more a potential. I think that's going to drive overall consumer spending if this continues. The shortest term impact in our business directly, we do sell into the oil and gas business in a couple of our businesses notably fiberglass for pipe or protective and marine has a component of their business which is directly tied to the oil and gas industry. We haven't seen -- in the fourth quarter, we didn't see any declines there for the most part, but we're watching now, sometimes maintenance rates actually go up a little bit during periods of lower activity. But I would say we're watching that, let's call it limited exposure to that market and I think the longer-term benefits of these lower gasoline prices here or in Europe we think they should start showing up here as we go through this year. Certainly you're seeing it at the pump with the prices and that's going to keep more dollars in the pockets of the ultimate consumers and give them more opportunities to increase spending across many, many categories. As you know in the coatings world, we're exposed to a broad range of end-use markets. So we think that should be positive for us and the industry.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Jim Sheehan from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Go ahead, Jim.","Jim Sheehan","In your commentary on industrial coatings, you mentioned consistent year-over-year global auto OEM industry growth for cash for the first quarter. I'm just wondering is that consistent with the fourth quarter trend or the 2014 full-year trend or if maybe you could be more specific.","Chuck Bunch","Well, I think we feel that 2015 is shaping up similar to the growth rates that we saw in the fourth quarter. Those were maybe slightly lower than the full-year 2014, but we're still looking for a positive growth here in the U.S. of North American market, China as well. Europe is going to we think still grow, but at a very modest level. So I would say it's closer to the growth rates that we saw in the fourth quarter.","Jim Sheehan","And what's your outlook for global industrial production that's in your assumptions?","Frank Sklarsky","3% to 4%.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Nils Wallin from CLSA. Go ahead, sir.","Nils Wallin","Just on volumes in Europe versus earnings growth, one of the lowest volume growth regions, but obviously one of the biggest earnings growth regions. Clearly you have taken a lot of cost out of that business. Is that earnings growth entirely due to operating leverage or is there some other mix effect in there and can that continue to grow at that pace with provided volumes stay at these low levels?","Frank Sklarsky","It's definitely primarily the operating leverage and in the slide deck, you saw where we stand in terms of the volumes versus where we were pre-recessionary levels and we're still high teens below peak levels. So there is ample open capacity, capacity utilization capability in the EMEA region so that we can still accrete earnings at that 30% to 40% for every dollar to the bottom line.","And as Chuck made some comments on the general industrial business, as that improves, as we continue to do well at high single digits in the aerospace business in that region and as things improve in the packaging sector, we also expect to accrete margins at a nice level because there is ample open capacity and good fixed cost leverage throughout 2015 and probably beyond.","Nils Wallin","And then just as a follow-up, more on M&A, certainly in the last year and a half, Akzo and Comex transactions were pretty unique opportunities immediately accretive which isn't always the case. How are you thinking about the opportunities going forward? Do all of them also look to be immediately accretive and what's your appetite for maybe not having an immediately accretive transaction?","Chuck Bunch","Well, I think a lot of the deals that we've been looking at are the small to medium-sized acquisition opportunities and there depending on the levels of synergy, we can see accretive transactions and so that's not necessarily a hard and fast rule for us and it has certainly played out in these recent transactions, but it just depends on what we feel is the best opportunity. Many of them we think we should be accretive over that first year or two after the acquisition, but not always in the first quarter or so. So we will continue to look at all of them, although we like the immediately accretive ones. It makes the discussions go a lot easier with our shareholders and analysts.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Dmitry Silversteyn from Longbow. Go ahead, Dmitry.","Dmitry Silversteyn","2015 I think as of January French law mandates the absence of BPA in food packaging and cans and things like that and this was an event that you and others in the industry have looked forward to. Now that it's here, sort of what impact do you expect it to have on your European packaging business and your packaging business overall in 2015?","Michael McGarry","As far as France, we are getting inside-the-can wins, we\u2019re running commercial batches. It is going well; the customers are pleased with it. We also have BPA non-intent coatings commercially running in this space as well and those customers are happy as well. So this is going to be a trend that's going to continue probably slowly. It's not going to just jump right up. This is an area that we gave up line time in 2014 so that we could position ourselves to grow as a once in a generation change inside the can. As you know, we have very little share inside the can, so these are all positive moves for our packaging business. And I'm sure you saw that we had that positive volume in the fourth quarter as well. So I think it's looking up for us.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay. So to sort of extrapolate Chuck's comments on 2015 being more like or possibly being more like the fourth quarter of 2014, should we expect stronger growth in the packaging business throughout the year as well?","Michael McGarry","I think we'll see continuing volume growth modestly throughout the year.","Dmitry Silversteyn","And then my follow-up question, broadly on EMEA, you've delivered very positive growth in the first half of the year. It slowed down a little bit in the second half of the year, but you still came out a little bit ahead. Is it possible for you given what's going on with the economy now and while you're waiting for the potential low oil prices to kick in to perhaps better economic activity later in the year, but is it possible for you to sustain positive volume growth in Europe in 2015? Is that part of your expectation going in?","Chuck Bunch","I think it is possible for us to have positive volume growth. If you look at the GDP forecasts for Europe, they are not robust, but they are slightly positive so we can hope at this point to see positive volume growth. We're going to really also closely focus on our costs and productivity in Europe going forward. If we see the trends not improving as we've shown in the past, we will go after additional cost-reduction opportunities there or anywhere else in the world to keep this momentum going.","Frank Sklarsky","Dmitry, the only thing I'd add to that, Chuck is absolutely right. The team over there is optimistic that we can look at modest growth consistent with 1% to 2% GDP industrial production projections over there, but keep in mind we're about 15 percentage points plus down on the exchange rate versus where we were last year. Current rate is about 117 on the euro versus high 120s, low 130s last year at this time.","Dmitry Silversteyn","No, no, I absolutely understand the foreign exchange portion. I was just looking at the price volume\/mix organic growth. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Christopher Perrella from Bloomberg Intelligence. Go ahead, Christopher.","Christopher Perrella","Could you just outline your outlook for growth in the Mexican architectural paint market for 2015?","Michael McGarry","We're looking at the economy growing between 3% and 4%. We have higher expectations than that for our PPG Comex business so I think you could probably take 1.5 times that, as much as even two times that. We're really seeing that they've done well.","Christopher Perrella","All right and how much of the synergies have you already captured with the Comex acquisition?","Michael McGarry","It's very small. We said we'd get $30 million to $40 million and we fully anticipate getting all of that.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Richard O'Reilly from Revere Associates.","Richard O'Reilly","Two quick questions, both follow-ups, the first is on the raw material comments that was a good explanation you gave, Vince. On the basket of goods, the other 80% of that, how much would be tied to like diesel fuel for shipping, resins for packaging? I mean there must be great opportunity for savings there.","Chuck Bunch","Rich, our freight costs for the corporation are somewhere between 7% and 10% of our total cost bucket. A portion of that, just a portion of that is diesel-related. We do expect diesel prices to roll through the transportation bucket at some point, but it's a portion again of 7% of our total cost bucket. We also have another call it mid-single digit percentage from packaging materials. Some of those are oil-derived, some of those aren't. Again, as Chuck mentioned, as we get further and further out from the oil wellhead, some of those take much longer to work their way through the system.","Richard O'Reilly","Okay. And the second question is I think you still own a piece of the Auto Glass venture and the equity owners must have owned it now for several years. Do you know of any change in their thinking of their ownership structure?","Michael McGarry","We sold 62% of that on September 30, 2008. We did sell a small portion of that, the insurance and services business earlier this year which we did net out a gain. Right now, our partner is Kohlberg. They continue to look at everything. I would tell you it is business as usual.","Chuck Bunch","But the sale was actually in 2014.","Michael McGarry","For the insurance and services.","Richard O'Reilly","For the extra, okay, fine. So business as usual. Good, thank you for those answers.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Vince Morales for closing remarks. Thank you.","Vince Morales ","Once again, we would like to thank everybody for their interest in PPG. If there are any further questions please contact me in the Investor Relations function. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Thank you."],"17095":["PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG) Q4 2012 Earnings Call January 14, 2013 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Vincent J. Morales - Vice President of Investor Relations","Charles E.

My name is Martine, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Vincent J. Morales","Thank you, Martine, and good morning. Again, my name is Vince Morales. I'm the Vice President of Investor Relations for PPG Industries. Welcome to PPG's Fourth Quarter 2012 Financial Teleconference.","Joining me on the call today from PPG is Chuck Bunch, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Navikas, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer.","Our comments relate to the financial information released on Monday, January 14, 2013. I will remind everyone that approximately 1 hour ago, we posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the Investor Center at our website, ppg.com. Those slides are also available on the webcast site for this call, and they provide additional support to the opening comments Chuck will make momentarily. Following Chuck's perspective on the company's results for the quarter, we'll move to a Q&A session.","Both the prepared commentary and discussion during the Q&A may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements.","Today's presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures the company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which, again, are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC.","Now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch.","Charles E. Bunch","Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. Our record fourth quarter results capped off what has been an exceptional year for the company, driven by excellent operating performance and the announcement of several significant strategic transactions that accelerate the pace of our portfolio transformation.","Record fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.53 are 10% higher than last year and marked 10 consecutive quarters of adjusted earnings per share records. We achieved these results despite continued variation in regional economic performance and mixed end-use market demand levels.","A few business highlights from the quarter were the aggregate coatings segment earnings growth of 30% and Optical and Specialty Materials segment results, which were similar. Commodity Chemicals also grew earnings versus last year despite 2 unplanned outages during the quarter. Full year commodity chemical results eclipsed last year's record level.","Geographically, the United States remained our strongest region, with most businesses delivering top line growth. Emerging markets growth remained modest, but trends improved in several businesses versus the prior 2 quarters. European demand continued to be negative, but the trend there also improved slightly versus the last few quarters.","A key element of our success in the quarter and overall for the year was the company's strong operating execution. We continued to aggressively manage our businesses, and fourth quarter results also benefited from the restructuring actions, which we proactively initiated early in 2012.","For the full year, we achieved a record adjusted EPS figure of $7.94, which is up 16% from last year's record. Worth mentioning is earnings results improved in each region, including Europe. Also, our full year return on sales percentage was higher in each segment except Glass.","For the year, we delivered a record level of cash from operations, up 25% versus last year, and continued our long legacy of returning cash to shareholders by increasing our dividend for the 41st consecutive year.","In addition, the announced strategic actions reflect the continued execution on our vision to remain a global leader in coatings and Specialty Materials. Progress is well under way to finalize these actions.","We begin 2013 well positioned. Our expectations are for continued variations in economic conditions. We expect a growth bias to remain for the United States, improvement in growth prospects in Asia and European activity to remain subdued. As a result of these mixed economic conditions, we will remain diligent in managing our businesses.","Operationally, we expect an incremental $70 million to $80 million of savings from the finalization of our restructuring programs, and we will implement targeted price increases in our coatings businesses to fully offset the inflation from the past 2 years.","Finally, even before considering any impact from 2013 free cash flow, we have excellent financial flexibility, with cash and short-term investments of $2.4 billion. A primary focus for the corporation in 2013 will be to analyze prudent cash deployment opportunities focused on profitable earnings growth.","Overall, I am pleased with the financial performance we achieved in 2012, and we remain focused as we begin 2013 on profitably growing the company and creating additional shareholder value.","Thank you for your attention. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now, operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Chuck, just on today's announcement on the Optical JV and the potential sale or purchase, can you give us a little more detail on your thinking on this business? Is it core? Is it not core? If you sold it, what's the tax base if you bought it? How much will it cost you? A little more detail will be great.","Charles E. Bunch","Well, David, we're not really going to give a lot more color on our -- on the press release, we did that for our disclosure obligations. And we're not going to get into a -- providing a lot of additional details on the press release regarding Transitions.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Understood. Just one more thing, Chuck. If you look at your coatings margins. They were roughly 13.1% for the entire coatings businesses. Should they be up or down next year? And if up, by how much, do you think?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, we feel we have an opportunity to improve on our coatings margins. So we think, in general, economic conditions and volumes should improve globally. It depends, again, on the regions and markets. But we feel that, that is going to be an overall benefit. Plus we have -- as you know, we'll be calendarizing the full restructuring benefits as we go through 2013. So those 2 events, I think, or those 2 conditions give us an opportunity to improve on our coatings margins.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","You mentioned that you still want to get prices in the coming year to catch up with raw mats. How much more price do you need to kind of breakeven on raw mats overall?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, Duffy, we had some inflation as we look even at the fourth quarter. Even as the raw material basket was coming in balance, we still had a slight inflation overall in our costs. And so as we look to 2013, yes, we're seeing some -- a difference in trends overall for raw materials. We have some of our raw materials, especially on the inorganic side, that we have some modest declines. Although now, what we're seeing here as we start the year is some increases, especially in commodities here in North America, like propylene or ethylene. So I would say that we're looking for a more balanced raw material outlook as we go through -- as we open here in 2013, and we will have other inflationary costs. And we will have more than likely some targeted price increases for -- to address those or in businesses, regions, where we haven't fully recaptured the inflationary pressure that we saw over the last 2 years.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Fair enough. And then on your goal, I think you've talked several times about more than 10% that you'd  like to de-content TiO2 from your can of paint. How much of that did you get accomplished in '12? And then how much more can we get done in '13?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, when we looked -- when we made the announcements regarding our targets for improvements in using TiO2 more efficiently, we said 4% to 6% during 2012. We accomplished that at the lower end of the range, and we think we still have in 2013 an opportunity to improve our utilization, again in the lower single-digit target levels for 2013.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Chuck, you strike me as a somewhat loquacious individual. The press release on Essilor today, you're talking about the discussions there. And yet you, when you answered David's question, you talked about disclosure obligations. Now I would have thought that you would have discussions with them ongoing over the years. Has anything changed with respect to the discussions that you would have had of a strategic nature with Essilor?","Charles E. Bunch","No. I would say that, Frank, as you know, we are involved in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction with the Georgia Gulf. We are in the exchange period, and we are aware of our disclosure obligations around the transaction. And we felt that, yes, it was appropriate for us to issue the press release that we did.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. All right. So it has changed somewhat, but it's really more of the RMT than perhaps something heating up today versus what it would have been 1 year or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 years ago?","Vincent J. Morales","Yes. I think, Frank, the focus again is the fact that we're in this tender period, and we want to make sure we adhere to our disclosure obligations.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And where are we on the -- what inning are we in, in terms of the restructuring? And what should we realistically expect? I think you'd indicated you had $70 million to $80 million left on the current program, a lot of it European-based. And you've got -- in terms of Akzo, you got $60 million when that closes, I think another $30 million in year one. So I mean, you can kind of get to $0.75, $0.80 of EPS benefit from restructuring in 2013. Is that how we should be thinking about that?","David B. Navikas","Frank, this is Dave. The $70 million to $80 million coming from the 2012 program is still a good estimate of what we're anticipating, and that would more likely come in the first half of the year. Certainly, the first year synergies that we're expecting following the Akzo acquisition will come later on and be impacted by when we're able to close that transaction.","Eugene Fedotoff - Longbow Research LLC","So you're still on track for a second quarter close. Correct?","David B. Navikas","That's what we're targeting.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Chuck, just wanted a little more granularity on a couple of end markets you discussed in your release and commentary. On the Architectural side, you mentioned lower sales in emerging regions. I wonder if you can just give us a little more color if there's been any trend change and how long we might expect these negative comps to continue?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, I would say the biggest influence on our emerging region Architectural performance was actions that we took, Bob, in Chile and Argentina to scale back our operations in those 2 markets in light of the economic conditions so that, overall, I would say that the trends for emerging markets were not nearly as negative if you looked at it overall, excluding those 2 markets where we took company specific actions.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on your Industrial side, you mentioned that packaging coatings were strong in all regions. And I guess, I was looking at what Alcoa had to say about beverage can volumes, and it wasn't consistent across regions. So is there something you guys are doing differently that's giving you growth in the developed markets when it seems like most of the growth for those applications are in the emerging regions?","Charles E. Bunch","I would say that the strongest volume was in the emerging regions. But overall, we did see some volume growth in the developed regions, whether this was a restocking or emerging opportunities, plus also the BPA-free. The beginnings of those products now coming into the market may have had an influence. But certainly, we saw some volume growth in all of the markets, but strongest in the Asia-Pacific region.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Did you have any reflections on titanium dioxide prices? Are they holding flat? Are they going down a little bit? Are they going up? Just sort of how are they acting and how do you see them in 2013?","Charles E. Bunch","We have seen declines in the trends since the beginning of the second quarter of 2012, so where they hit a peak. These are different by region, so we've seen more weakness in Europe in light of, we think, overall economic conditions. And as I said in my earlier comments, we're looking at a more balanced, flat raw material basket as we go into 2013, with probably modest declining trends in TiO2 overall, offset by what appears to be, at least here in the first quarter, some pressure on the petrochemical or organic side of the raw material basket.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. In the -- in 2012, your restructuring efforts were to pull out, I think, $40 million to $50 million pretax in costs. Did you achieve that? And how would you look allocate those cost savings across your segments?","David B. Navikas","Jeff, this is Dave. We did achieve the $40 million of savings in 2012. And from a segment point of view, we had provided information in our April call that had identified by segment where we were anticipating getting those savings in 2012. And our actual performance was very much in line with that expectation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Buckingham Research.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Was the high single-digit growth in U.S. Architectural sales more price or more volume?","Charles E. Bunch","Actually, it was fairly even but I would say probably biased to the volume side in the market.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And could you help us understand what performance -- excuse me, Specialty Materials and Optical would have done without the Thailand sort of dip in benefit comp and without the channel filling this? What would be a trend line in that segment because it had sort of 2 major things going on, both the easy comps against Thailand disruptions and the channel filling?","Charles E. Bunch","Yes, John. If you look at the Optical business in the fourth quarter, we benefited year-over-year on the bottom line by about $5 million due to the absence of Thailand flooding impacts. The top line, we certainly were glad to see what I would call a full fill of the inventory build for Transition VII, but that still wasn't the major driver there. We did see some -- as you know, the last 2 quarters, we had some de-stocking in the channel. We saw a little bit of overall inventory re-stocking, as well as the benefit of the Transition VII build. I'd say taking the 2 quarters in aggregate, third and fourth quarter, we're seeing, I'd call it, solid mid-single-digit trend gains.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Chuck, if TiO2 pigment prices do continue to erode, would all of that benefit flow into your gross margin for coatings? Or might you have any contracts whereby you'd be obligated to share in that benefit with your customers?","Charles E. Bunch","For the most part, our contracts don't have material price indexes. And as I mentioned in my comments, even though we're seeing a declining trend in the TiO2 pricing, it's being offset by either other inflation or some continued inflation on the organic side. But also on the inorganic side, we're seeing some non-TiO2 pigment prices that are increasing.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, understood. And then as a follow-up, I thought I might try for a clarification on your Optical press release. There's a sentence in there that begins \"Under certain circumstances, which PPG does not yet believe have occurred, either PPG or Essilor may have the right to specify a price.\" It wasn't clear to me exactly what the trigger might be. I'm not sure if you can comment on it. But if you could perhaps address what circumstances might need to arise for either party to specify a price, that might help?","Charles E. Bunch","Kevin, we're not prepared to go into the -- all of the specific details of the joint venture agreement, so we're not going to provide any more clarity other than what you've seen in the press release.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","All right. And then final one, if I'm may, Chuck. I think you cited improving growth prospects as part of your outlook for Asia. Can you talk about what is driving that? Is it macro or company specific or both and which product lines you're feeling better about regionally within Asia?","Charles E. Bunch","For us, the -- let's call it the general industrial activity, was improving as we move through the second half and into the fourth quarter. Automotive builds have also continued to grow. We have seen some, as you know, slowdown on the electronics side, and some of the construction-related end-use markets were still slow. Although here, as we've been talking about with the leadership -- with the new leadership in place in China, we think that we're going to see now incentives for growth. And we have seen some signs of strengthening in some of these other markets, although right now it is not quite evident on the electronics side.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse.","Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is calling Abhi Rajendran calling in for John. So a quick question on M&A. So looking past the Akzo deal, could you touch on roughly how much cash you expect to have to put towards further M&A, as well as some of the main areas of focus within a business and regional basis?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, if you look at our cash at the end of the fourth quarter, so we had some close to $2.5 billion. So we will receive, at the conclusion of the Georgia Gulf transaction, around $900 million. That will be our outlay more or less later in the year with the closing of the Akzo transaction. So that would put you at relatively the same position that we have finished the quarter in, which we have previously announced that our -- what we need to run the company is under $500 million. So it would give us, we think, considerable resources to deploy for shareholder value-creating initiatives.","Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then just some of the main areas of focus that you might be looking at, both on a -- either on a business or a geographic basis?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, we would continue to look for opportunities, as we talked about, in our coatings businesses. Geographically, we've made 2 announcements. We completed the Spraylat acquisition about 2 weeks ago. That was a North American-focused company in Industrial Coatings, although they had operations in China and in Europe. Akzo is predominantly or almost all North American, including the Caribbean, Canada and the U.S. And we continue to look for opportunities in other geographic areas, so that would be one of the areas in which we would continue to look for opportunities. But we have other segments of our business or our company that we think if there are appropriate opportunities, so we would continue to look for acquisitions in those areas as well if they will create shareholder value.","Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then just a quick follow-up on the auto area. Could you touch on some of the share gains that you're continuing to see in auto OEM, just in terms of what's driving this and are they skewed towards any perching particular geographic regions, or anything else you could share?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, if you look at our automotive OEM business in 2012, 2 of the strongest growth areas globally for the industry were here in North America and in China. We are well positioned in both of those markets, and we think that we had a very good year in terms of participating in the industry growth, plus the customers that we were working with. And some of our new product introductions were very successful in each of those markets, and that was beneficial to driving the overall growth in our automotive coatings business globally.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So post Akzo acquisition announcement, have you had a chance to talk to your retail partners, Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, to see their reaction in any potential channel conflict issues?","Charles E. Bunch","Yes, we have. We, as PPG, we visit the major customers in all channels on a regular basis. We did follow up with the customers in all of the channels. And we announced our strategy in which we were going to continue to support all of our existing businesses, plus those of the acquired company. And I would say that the interaction with the customers in the channels was very positive.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then on automotive OEM, you just talked about share gains. I know a competitor was selling its business and that sold, but they probably lost share. Are the shared gains done now? Or do you expect the shared gains to continue in 2013?","Charles E. Bunch","I would say that it's difficult to determine actual share in this industry on a short-term basis. Many of the -- when you look at awards, oftentimes you're awarded business for several years, different models, different plans. And I would say at this point, I would not say that we see significant share shifts. We're trying to continue to support all our customers, and we have been fortunate to work with a number of them that have done very well in their markets, as we talked about, here in North America, in China and Asia more broadly. And probably most importantly, we just continue to work on execution, keeping our costs in line and especially focused on the weakness that we've seen in Europe overall. So we focus there not as much on shared gains, but more on execution and driving our operations.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just quickly lastly, I think earlier you said that you got strong volume growth in Architectural. Can you compare your volume growth in your own stores versus big boxes and where it's coming from? I just want to compare qualitatively.","Charles E. Bunch","I think I indicated that the performance by channel was similar for us. We had high single-digit overall sales growth, probably more on the volume side than on the pricing side. And I would say the performance overall by channel was positive in both channels.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","With regard Europe, it seems like that -- or excuse me, Architectural Europe, it seems like that business you've been able to enjoy price increases much more than some of your other coatings businesses. So I'm wondering -- and, of course, this is a mid or fairly weak macroenvironment. So I'm wondering what you're able to do there that allows you to generate a higher price increase year-over-year than in some of your other coatings segments?","Charles E. Bunch","I would say that the majority of the improvement in Europe has been driven by our cost and execution actions. And we did focus, as you know, in the overall corporate restructuring on Europe. And obviously, that segment, the Architectural EMEA segment, was the focal point for our restructuring activities in the overall Architectural business globally. So I think that's where you're seeing most of the improvement, would be on the cost side for that business.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then if -- it sounds like in your prepared remarks, you expect OEM volumes to be roughly flat year-over-year in 2013. Does that mean that you really have to see a lot more heavy lifting coming from the packaging and general industrial in order to see volume growth? Or is there something else in there to assume that you're going to see continued volume growth in general in the Industrial Coatings business in 2013?","Vincent J. Morales","Nils, this is Vince. The reference in the prepared remarks was really toward 1Q, not the full year for 2013. We do expect full year growth in global automotive, again, with European weakness as a partially offset. So again, the 1Q saw very strong results in the first quarter 2012. And the year-over-year growth will be tempered by those first quarter results last year.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Got it. Got it.","Charles E. Bunch","That was the tsunami effect. So that you had in the first quarter, a lot of inventory rebuilding because the supply chains were depleted, especially among the Japanese-based manufacturers as a result of the tsunami in 2011.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just finally, if more of a strategic question. With the Akzo transaction, as well as sure wins, it seems like, I mean, in just about every end market for coatings, you're going to be #1 or #2. Is there much more you can do in terms of M&A to -- I mean, it seems like there aren't too many more big companies out there that you can do or you can acquire. So going forward, are we going to see, if in terms of your acquisition strategy, just more bolt-ons?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, I think if you look at the coatings industry globally, it is still not a highly consolidated industry compared to many other global manufacturing industries. So we think that there will be opportunities for more consolidation on a global basis, but the regional mix of acquisitions may change. But if you look at the industry in most other regions in Asia, in Europe, Latin America, these are areas of continuing opportunity for further consolidation in coatings.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This is Rob Walker on for Laurence. I guess just to follow up a little on raw materials. So propylene contract looks to set to increase about $0.15 in January. Does your forecast for -- the comment you made on relatively flat pricing in 2013, does that imply that propylene prices will soften later in the year as they did in the last year? Or I guess, are you planning to increase prices to fully cover the proposed January increase?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, I think our comment were -- was in relation to this balance in the raw material basket between, let's call them, the inorganic raw materials and the organic or petrochemical-based raw materials with these increases that we're seeing in propylene and ethylene here as we start the year and that potential impact on raw material price escalation in those raw materials offsetting any negative trends that we may see in the rest of the basket. That's what we are saying is, right now, we're looking at something more balanced. But obviously, we're going to look at the trends in the entire basket and the different raw materials that are going in. And if we see further spikes in propylene or those get pushed through into the propylene based or raw materials that we're buying, then we're going to certainly open up discussions with our customers if we see those escalating much more than what we've seen currently.","Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So if the prices go up further than the January increase and they get passed through the derivatives, I guess, is there a price level where you would hit a point where you couldn't pass through the price in the current year and have a situation where you have to recoup it over 2 years?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, typically, as we talked about with the price increases in the past, typically, there is a period when we're trying -- we're certainly trying to push back on any price increases that we would be receiving in the short term. But then as we absorb this raw material inflation on our side, typically, as we talked in the past, it can take a quarter or 2 for us to try and get those increases reflected in our pricing with our customers. So I think that's, in general, how we've described the timing on raw material and pricing increases.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","A couple of questions. One, on U.S. Architectural, where you're going to have a much bigger exposure, obviously, post the Akzo acquisition, what do you think that overall growth was for the full year from an industry standpoint for 2012? And if you exceed that growth -- the numbers I've seen suggest about 4% industry growth. So I guess it would be the first increase in a number of years.","Charles E. Bunch","That would be around what we were saying would have been the growth in 2012, Don. So that's consistent, and it's certainly the first increase in several years. We're still nowhere near where we were before the crisis. So if you go back to 2006 or 2007, we're still much below that. We think that 2013 is going to be a good year for the U.S. construction industry. The first quarter last year was pretty good because we had some seasonally good weather. It's still a little early to kind of forecast what's going to be the outlook for the weather in the first quarter. These first couple of weeks have been more normal. But I would say, overall, for the full year, yes, we're optimistic that these trends that we saw, these first positive trends, are going to continue in 2013. The data, the housing data, the construction data, overall has been -- continued to be, for the most part, positive. You're seeing a lot of anecdotal information about -- in certain markets, the housing resale market strengthening. We've seen increases in new home construction permits and starts. So overall, I would say we're fairly optimistic. We've gotten through the fiscal cliff. Do we have some problems in a few months with a debt ceiling and other things that could derail this? Mortgage rates continue to be very positive. So we're optimistic, and we think we're going to have a good year in 2013 and in North America in Architectural.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","For 2012, did you grow above the industry rate? Did you do take share? And would do you expect to grow above the industry rate in -- on a pro forma basis in 2013?","Charles E. Bunch","I would say, in general, we were in line with industry trends in 2012. And in 2013, obviously, we'll get a bump from the acquisition activity that -- with Akzo North America. And I think we're well positioned to take advantage of the growth that we see overall for 2013.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And just a follow-up on your share repurchase intentions. You've talked about $500 million to $700 million once the Reverse Morris Trust is done. Is it your intention to get most of that done in the first half and then depending on what acquisitions are in the pipeline, increase that level of share repurchase in the second half of 2013?","David B. Navikas","I would say, Don, this is Dave, that the expectations there or that we would spread that activity, the share repurchase activity, out over the remainder of our 2013. So I would not envision it being loaded into the front half of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Goodnight with UBS.","Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Modeling questions for Dave. First, cash contributions to pension in '13, do you expect them to be about what they were in '12 or...","David B. Navikas","Yes, Gregg. In 2012, our only cash contributions were to our non-U.S. plants, and we would expect the same situation in 2013. And in terms of amount, 2013 would be in line with 2012.","Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Also, on cash, the asbestos settlement has been in abeyance for quite a while. Would you expect any cash requirements for potential settlement in 2013 at all?","David B. Navikas","It's certainly a possibility, Gregg, I would say. If it is, it would likely be in the back half of the year.","Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Last question, if I could. The -- your portfolio transformation has gone well. It seems to be near completion. The obvious element in your portfolio that doesn't seem to fit with the rest is, obviously, the Glass component. Does Glass fill some long-term strategic niche in your portfolio? Or is that an area that might require some additional looking at by the company?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, as we talked about, the businesses in that segment are businesses that aren't in our core but have been contributors over the years, but we are -- we would be open to look at opportunities to create shareholder value. We think that we have begun to see the improvement in the flat glass business. This is tied more specifically from an end-use market to the commercial construction industry here in North America. We're seeing some of the early signs of improvement. We do have what we think is a good position in that business, good brand, as well as market position. So we think that there's an opportunity for further improvement in that business. Fiberglass, as we mentioned in the release, we have had some challenges tied to some global weakness in the business. In Europe, we are tied, as well in Asia, to the electronics industry, which has been weaker. So right now, we think that we're focused on the right things in the business, which are continuing to improve our operations and if opportunities present themselves in -- as we move forward, we'll continue to look at it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","For the 2 more profitable coatings end markets, aerospace and auto refinishing, how should we think about the outlook for the full year? And also was auto refinish a bit weaker than you initially thought it would be for the fourth quarter?","Charles E. Bunch","I would say for -- if we look at those, first, the Aerospace business, we had a very strong year in 2012. And we think that the industry on a global basis looks good in 2013. So we're looking for further improvement in our aerospace business. Military will probably not be as strong in terms of the end-use markets. But what we've seen here is commercial aviation continues to be strong. There is more -- better airline profitability globally, so we think the aerospace business looks good. In the refinish business, we had some weakness in the European market in light of the overall economic conditions there. But it is tied in the longer-term trends to global industry builds and the global car parts, which are growing. The automotive industry globally is a growth industry, and we're seeing that play out. So the longer-term trends are good for automotive refinish. We think we'll have a good year here in 2013. But Europe, obviously, was part of the story in 2012, with the weakness that we saw there.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then last quarter, your auto OEM production chart for the EMEA region is estimated at that 11% decline, I think, for the fourth quarter, do have a sense as to what the estimate is for the first quarter for that region?","Charles E. Bunch","Yes, it's going to be negative but not at that level because I think now we're seeing some -- we're still seeing negative trends in Europe but not an acceleration of the declines that we've really been experiencing now for 6 quarters.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Dan with Morgan Stanley.","Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just looking at your geographic split, it seemed like North America was very strong. I was wondering if looking at your regional split, if you could see any impacts, positive or negative, from Hurricane Sandy?","Charles E. Bunch","No, I wouldn't say that any of the trends that we saw here in the fourth quarter could we attribute to that. Obviously, the 2 things that are probably going to play out here in 2013 will be the rebuilding or reconstruction activity that should help construction industry in the Northeast, as well as what happened to -- there were a lot of vehicles that were damaged or destroyed. And that should be a boost to the automotive industry, both in terms of the OEM and the refinish industry here in 2013. But I wouldn't say it's going to be the driving force, and it was really too early in the fourth quarter of 2012 to really see a trend there.","Operator","Your next question comes from James Sheehan of SunTrust.","James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Chuck, I was just wondering if you could comment on the licensing deal with the Chinese company on TiO2. How big a portion of the overall reformulation effort is that now and how big do you think it could be in the future?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, the overall licensing agreement with Billions, I would say, is quite small so that -- and it really doesn't figure into the targets that we talk about for improving TiO2 productivity or usage in our formulas. I would say that neither the licensing revenue or the impact were -- on meeting our metrics were in any way significant. They are a supplier to PPG, but the things that we're talking about there are more long term in nature. There's no immediate benefit in terms of starting up the chloride production, and I think these things are events that will take place in the future.","James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just on the situation with housing starts and some of the macro data that you referred to earlier. I was wondering if you could comment on some of the PPG store inventory levels. Are you seeing any changes there that are reflecting some of this macro data? Or just what are you seeing in the inventories now?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, we try to keep our inventories in balance with the level of demand. And so as we get into the first quarter, we typically have inventory build in our Architectural business as we prepare for the busy season. And I would say even though the volume trends were positive for us in the fourth quarter in our own stores, it was nothing that we could -- we were having to make, let's say, unusual adjustments to inventory levels to meet what we saw out there. But obviously, positive trends, something that we're watching so that we feel we'll be fully prepared as we go into the season this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Hocevar with Northcoast Research.","Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research","This is Saul in for Kevin today. A couple of specifics, if you could. Your total company had $57 million worth of sales improvement due to price. How much of that was in coatings? And what was the raw material dollar change, either up or down, in coatings in the fourth quarter?","Charles E. Bunch","Saul, if you look, I think we said in our prepared comments, that both glass and chemicals had negative pricing in the quarter. So all the coatings gains were primarily coatings -- or excuse me, all the pricing gains, primarily coatings oriented. We did see still inflation in the quarter. And for the full year, we saw inflation. So we're still trying to work through, Chuck mentioned earlier, a full offset of inflation over not only this year, but over the past 24 months.","Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research","But in the quarter, Vince, was the inflation more or less than what you got in pricing?","Vincent J. Morales","It was -- they were fairly close. As Chuck mentioned, we're trying to get more -- they're fairly balanced now, but we do see more inflation coming early in the first quarter of 2013.","Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research","Okay. And then a second question on Glass. How much of the earnings are equity income? And what was the equity income component this year versus last year, so we could separate what you earned from your operating businesses versus your equity contribution?","Charles E. Bunch","Even in a good year, Saul, the equity earnings don't account for more than 15% of Glass total earnings. They are more volatile because they're -- there's no sales impact or we don't control the costs. We were down several million dollars this year, primarily due to the fiberglass JVs, which are focused on the electronic market, which, as we mentioned earlier, remained weak. But that's the biggest JV structure we have in our glass segment.","Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research","Of the $9 million that you earned, how much was the equity income, just a couple million dollars?","Charles E. Bunch","At best. And the fourth quarter, it was seasonally light just by nature.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richie O'Reilly, Revere Associates.","Richard O'Reilly","A couple of follow-up questions, the first one in Glass. Do you still own the 40% in the auto glass business? And what's the status of that longer term?","Charles E. Bunch","We do own -- we've maintained our minority interest. It's actually 38%, and that is in our portfolio. We continue to have a good relationship with our -- the majority owners of the Kohlberg company. And right now, it's an ongoing business in our portfolio.","Richard O'Reilly","Okay. So you would need to have the other owners decide if they wanted to acquire the rest of the stake? Is that -- would it be their option?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, as we stated earlier, we're not going to go into all the details of our specific joint venture contracts. But right now, the business is operating successfully and continues in our portfolio.","Richard O'Reilly","Okay. Second, I'm going to try the Transitions announcement again, And Kevin earlier had started reading a sentence. But near the end of it, it talks about interest at one or more of the joint venture companies. Can you give us an idea what that is referring to? Is that regional or is it product line? Or I guess could you keep your overall interest in the -- your overall venture at 51% but change ownership of these sub-ventures?","Vincent J. Morales","Rich, as we mentioned earlier, I think everything we're going to say today on that is in the release.","Operator","And we have a follow-up question from the line of John Roberts with Buckingham Research.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Chuck, you mentioned U.S. automotive OEM in 2013 might benefit from the destroyed cars from the hurricane. Would most of that really be in the first quarter here? And you've already said that, I guess, it will be offset by the difficult comps against the Japanese tsunami effect.","Charles E. Bunch","I would say that we're not exactly sure when we're going to see the impact from that hurricane. The OEM business, it goes through several distribution layers. I would think that we're going to see more of that in the first half. I would think that by the middle of the year, any effects on at least in automotive from Hurricane Sandy should be evident. Now, it may take a little longer on the construction side of the equation. You may take, let's say, the full year to see all of the impact of the reconstruction activity. But I'm not sure that in the automotive side, you're going to see that all in the first quarter. But I would say most of that should be in the first half.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.","Vincent J. Morales","This is Vince Morales. I just like to thank everybody for your participation today. If there any further questions, please feel free to contact me in Investor Relations.

My name is Philip, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Vincent J. Morales","Thank you, Philip. Good afternoon, everyone. Again, Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations. Welcome to PPG's fourth quarter 2013 financial teleconference.","Joining me from PPG on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Frank Sklarsky.","Our comments today relate to the financial information we released Thursday, January 26 -- or January 16, excuse me, 2014. I will remind everybody that approximately 1 hour ago, we posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on our Investor Center at our website at www.ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the opening comments Chuck will make momentarily. Following Chuck's perspective on the company's results for the quarter and the year, we will move to a Q&A session.","Both the prepared commentary and discussion during the call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current views about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance.

For any additional information, please refer to our filings with the SEC.","Now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch.","Charles E. Bunch","Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG Industries.","Today, I'm pleased to report record 2013 fourth quarter and full year financial results. This record financial performance caps off one of the most successful years in the company's history, both financially and strategically.","Quickly reviewing our strategic initiatives, we announced or completed several considerable actions during 2013. In January, we completed the separation of our Commodity Chemicals business. We closed the North American architectural coatings acquisition in April and announced an agreement to sell PPG's ownership interest in the Transitions Optical joint venture in July. These actions were focused on creating additional value for PPG's shareholders as we shift to a more consistent and higher growth business portfolio.","Financially, we once again delivered record results. Our sales for the fourth quarter increased to $3.7 billion, up 14%. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were a record $1.81, exceeding the prior year record by 45%. This marks 14 consecutive quarters of record adjusted earnings, illustrating the benefits of the company's strong coatings portfolio, broad global footprint, prudent cash deployment and measurable results from the strategic initiatives.","Supplementing acquisition-related sales gains, our year-over-year volumes grew 2% in the fourth quarter. Volume trends in North America and emerging regions were similar with previous quarters.","As we indicated last quarter, Europe continues to stabilize, and our fourth quarter year-over-year coatings volumes in Europe were flat following nonconsecutive quarters of decline. Aggressive cost management, including additional restructuring-related cost improvements, remained a contributor to our earnings growth. Our 2012 restructuring program is substantially complete, and I am pleased to report we have achieved the targeted annual cost savings run rate of about $140 million.","Our acquisition integration continued for the acquired North American architectural coatings business, and our synergy achievement in 2013 remained slightly ahead of our targets. We still have a considerable amount of integration work remaining, and initial actions are underway from the restructuring program we approved in the third quarter of 2013, primarily focused on capturing the remaining acquisition synergies.","Finally, on fourth quarter results, aggregate segment earnings grew 19% in the quarter with improvement achieved in each reportable segment. Also, each major region delivered earnings growth of at least 14%, including Europe, where our earnings improvement accelerated throughout the year.","Quickly reviewing full year results. Sales from continuing operations were $15.1 billion, up 12% versus the prior year. Our volume trend improved throughout the year, aided by the improving European trends during the year, which I mentioned earlier. Volume performance remained generally consistent each quarter in North America and Asia.","Adjusted 2013 earnings per share from continuing operations were an all-time record of $8.28. I am pleased to note that we fully replaced the earnings from the separated Commodity Chemical business and did so within 12 months. Our continued strong operating performance and earnings growth from our cash deployment were the main contributors to our year-over-year earnings growth.","From a cash perspective, our operating working capital efficiency improved by 160 basis points and contributed to our continued legacy of strong cash generation. We achieved record cash flow from operations, from continuing operations of $1.8 billion for the year, up 15% versus the prior year.","Our cash uses remained balanced with a total of $1.5 billion deployed, with a focus on growing the company through acquisitions and capital spending. Additionally, $1.35 billion was returned to shareholders, including dividends totaling $350 million and stock repurchases of $1 billion. We maintained our strong financial flexibility, ending the year with a solid balance sheet, including cash and short-term investments of $1.75 billion.","Looking ahead to 2014, we expect modest global growth to continue. We anticipate growth to remain the broadest in the U.S. economy, spanning across several coatings end-use markets as favorable market conditions continue in automotive OEM, architectural coatings and aerospace.","Emerging regions growth is expected to remain mixed, but I expect PPG to post solid growth based on the end markets we supply. In Europe, where we have about 1\/3 of our sales, economies appear to be improving but remain fragile. We anticipate modest growth in that region in 2014.","Equally important is that we expect to realize solid earnings leverage due to the actions we have taken the past 2 years to significantly reduce our cost structure in that region. As I mentioned earlier, we are implementing our restructuring program, primarily focused on capturing additional North American architectural coatings acquisition synergies, and we expect 2014 incremental cost savings of between $75 million and $90 million.","We expect the pending sale of our ownership interest in the Transitions Optical joint venture to close by midyear, with PPG receiving about $1.5 billion in after-tax proceeds. That, along with our history of generating strong free cash flow, will supplement our existing balance sheet flexibility.","Finally, over the next 18 to 24 months, we anticipate deploying between $3 billion and $4 billion of cash in a disciplined manner on incremental earnings growth initiatives and return of cash to our shareholders.","In summary, 2013 was a very successful year for the company overall and also for our shareholders. As we head into 2014, we remain focused on creating additional value for our shareholders.","Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And this concludes our prepared remarks.","Now operator, would you please open the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs.","Angel Castillo Malpica - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is actually Angel Castillo on for Bob. I was just hoping to understand a little bit better. You mentioned the $3 billion to $4 billion in capital deployment. If I'm doing the math correctly, it seems that you really aren't assuming much or any incremental leverage. I was wondering if you could talk about that and just how should we think about that and just your acquisitions versus repurchase strategy, especially since you exceeded your repurchase guidance in 2013.","Frank S. Sklarsky","Yes, in terms of the -- this is Frank. In terms of the leverage, yes, we're looking at the $3 billion to $4 billion being able to be deployed when considering the existing cash balance at the end of this year, $1.75 billion, plus the $1.5 billion Chuck referred to as the after-tax proceeds from TRANSITIONS, along with the ongoing cash flow from operations that we'll continue to generate in both 2014 and 2015. That will be definitely adequate and ample in order to be able to deploy that $3 billion to $4 billion. The question around leverage, we do not need to take on additional leverage in order to deploy that $3 billion to $4 billion, although there's certainly capability on the balance sheet to do so, if we were to desire to do that. But it's not required for the $3 billion to $4 billion to be deployed.","Angel Castillo Malpica - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And just a follow-up question. With all the moving pieces in performance for this quarter, can you help us understand some of the larger impacts, namely just the seasonality that you saw from the Akzo business?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, as we've been highlighting in our second and third quarter reports, the architectural coatings business historically is a seasonal business, with the strongest quarters in the second and third quarters of the year. Fourth quarter, traditionally weaker. That seasonality is present in the Akzo businesses that we acquired. In fact, maybe slightly stronger because of the strong Canadian business that's part of that acquisition. So there was -- we felt that -- we felt good with the performance of the Akzo business. However, as we tried to note in the earlier comments, it is a seasonally weaker quarter with less earnings generation than what we experienced in the second and third quarters.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","On the North American architectural price increases, how should we think about the price realization impact, Frank, on a quarterly basis? And also, you mentioned that the increase was implemented through your stores. What about the other channels?","Charles E. Bunch","Right now, the price increase that we announced and we're implementing, you'll see that -- the effects of that in the store channel in -- beginning in the first quarter of the year. The other channels are -- these are still discussions that we're having with our customers, and we have no announced price increases at this point outside of the one that we've noted in the stores channel.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And what about in Europe when you're -- in the network there?","Charles E. Bunch","The pricing is relatively flat going into 2014. We have the -- some initiatives around certain products or markets. But by and large, we're going into 2014 in Europe with stable price.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just one more on Europe. Chuck, you were a bit more positive on the region during the third quarter as well. Did anything change during the fourth quarter, either positive or negative, that sticks out, either by region or product line?","Charles E. Bunch","Actually, we feel good about what's going on in Europe. If you look at one of our largest markets, automotive, on the sales side, things were picking up. And it looks like now, if you look at all the forecasts for 2014 in automotive production, they are now forecasting an increase in production for automotive, a modest one, 2% to 4%. But that is, we think, an indication of a positive trend. In architectural, even though the fourth quarter European volumes were still down, this was our best performance during 2013. And as we noted in the fourth quarter, overall, for all our businesses, volumes were flat, and that was our best performance. So I think we had discussed what we thought was a stable to improving trend in Europe. We see that. And right now, we feel good about these modest improvements that we're seeing. And although we note that much of the earnings improvement for PPG during 2013, where we did have record pretax, pre-interest earnings was a result of our productivity and cost initiatives, we do feel now that the volume is stabilizing and looking now to be positive, albeit modest. So actually, we still feel pretty good about our commentary around what's going on in Europe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer from Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A couple of quick questions. One, just the $3 billion to $4 billion in cash back to shareholders, is that inclusive of dividends?","Frank S. Sklarsky","No. In fact, the $3 billion to $4 billion is a combination of cash that could be both returned to shareholders, as well as incremental growth, inorganic growth initiatives, so could potentially be M&A activity to the extent we identify things over the next 18 to 24 months. But it excludes the cash that is already slated to go toward dividends.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Fair enough. And then on the Slide 6, where you're walking through the volume trends, I mean, it's kind of interesting. If you just eyeball down, everything was getting double derivative better throughout the year except the U.S. and Canada looked like it turned or negative in the fourth quarter, again, kind of on a double derivative in that the gain was smaller than the quarter before. Is that an inflection point? Is that -- should we read into that? Or was that an anomaly relative to everything else, do you think?","Frank S. Sklarsky","No, Duffy. If you look last year, that's on a -- we had very good growth in Q4 of '12. So that's just on a more difficult comparable period than the third quarter, as an example, was. So we started to see the inflection actually in '12 of an uptick of activity.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then just the last one. The sales growth faster than the market in auto OE is a little bit of a lagging indicator in that it's the wins that you got in the preceding year. When you look back at '13, how was your win rate on new business for auto OE globally?","Charles E. Bunch","We felt good about our performance on, let's say, new business in auto OEM. And as you know, there's a lot of new construction of manufacturing facilities around the world, both here in North America and in China, 2 of the biggest markets. But we're also seeing it in not only in Mexico, part of the North American growth, but also in South America. So we feel very good about the new technologies that we've introduced over the last couple of years. The compact process for the total coating system in automotive OEM, plus our new electrocoat generation is doing very well. So we're confident that the sales growth that we've seen and getting our share of new business from these new facilities or additional awards are in place.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Chuck, just on Performance Coatings, you know that earnings were hurt by some growth-related spending in aerospace and refinish. How much was that? And is that continuing into 2014?","Vincent J. Morales","Hey, Dave, this is Vince. The additional spending on higher sales level combined is single mid -- single-digit millions of dollars. So fairly de minimis.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Very good. And Chuck, just how is the M&A pipeline today?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, it's very active. From a discussion standpoint, we hope to realize some acquisitions here throughout 2014, having what we feel are good productive discussions. But obviously, we're maintaining our traditional discipline around valuations. But we're confident that we'll be able to announce here in the coming quarters new acquisitions for PPG.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just lastly, on the 10% auto OEM growth, Chuck, I think there was some benefit from a competitor who was recently acquired. Do you expect that -- those benefits to taper off in 2014 as that competitor gets its feet under it?","Charles E. Bunch","I think that the trends that we've seen, the competitors that we have out there are all -- seem to be performing in the marketplace. And so we feel that the momentum that we have that we think is continuing is again based on service and technology, and it's always been a competitive environment out there. But we feel confident that we're going to be able to continue to grow the business nicely here in 2014.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.","Robert Walker - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","This is Rob Walker on for Laurence. I guess, can you be a little bit more specific about the growth projects you have planned for '14?","Frank S. Sklarsky","Is there specific business, Rob, you want to talk about or just in general?","Robert Walker - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","The increase. I mean, is it mostly in North America? Any particular region or line?","Frank S. Sklarsky","Well, we do have some incremental CapEx in the year. We're not talking about hundreds of millions of dollars, tens of millions, let's call it, and that's to expansion capacity in automotive OEM and industrial in each one of the regions. And to that extent, that spending's going to be very accretive from a value-creation standpoint. So from an organic standpoint, that's what we have going on from an inorganic, as Chuck referred to, on the M&A side of things.","Charles E. Bunch","But we have a number of businesses outside of just the industrial or automotive space, and I think Frank highlighted some of the projects that we have in Russia, Brazil, Mexico, China, where we feel that 2014 is going to be a very good year for the automotive OEM and the industrial businesses. But on the Performance Coatings side, aerospace looks to have another solid year in front of it, a lot of momentum on the commercial aviation sector. We're well positioned with our products, including the growth from the new acquisition at Deft. The refinish business continues to grow, especially in emerging regions. And we look for continued improvement that we saw at the end of the year in Europe. And on the construction markets overall, for both our architectural coatings and our flat glass businesses, we think they're going to benefit from this continued growth here in North America. And as we've said, the European business on architectural should be stronger, along with the rest of the region. So we're quite excited about the prospects that we're seeing, and we think we have a lot of initiatives in place to drive profitable growth for the company.","Robert Walker - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And I guess, just on Performance Coatings, what -- how much were volumes, either up or down, excluding marine? And I guess, your expectations kind of for the next quarter? Can those be -- start to turn positive?","Vincent J. Morales","Rob, Vince again. If you look at the segment, the volume decline of 3% that we included in our prepared materials was exactly the decline related to marine. So if you took the marine negative out, it would have been flat.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar from Citibank.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Dan Jester sitting in for P.J. So on your favorable view of the North American architectural market, is that still predominantly residential recovery? Or are you starting to see some improvement in the commercial market?","Charles E. Bunch","We started to see -- 2013 was primarily about the recovery in the residential markets, and we see that continuing. We saw some signs later in the year and in the fourth quarter that the commercial market may be beginning its long-awaited recovery. The business that we have that's most directly exposed to commercial construction activity is the flat glass business, and they had a better fourth quarter when you look at the architects' indexes and the like. And so we're more comfortable that the commercial market, starting with maintenance markets but also expanding out there, we're going to see some growth here in commercial construction in 2014.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then on titanium dioxide, I think that you said previously that your goal in 2013 was to reduce your usage by 2% or 3%. I guess, did you hit those goals? And do you have any goals for 2014?","Charles E. Bunch","We did hit our productivity targets for TiO2 within that range, the lower end of that range, but we did achieve them. And we are continuing the programs that we've discussed. And again, I would expect further productivity improvements for us in 2014. But probably again, probably at that lower end of the range as we've, I think, capitalized on the best or quickest opportunities that we had. So I think there's still more to go. But we've certainly hit our targets over these last 2 years. We're still working, but I don't think that we're going to see the kinds of reductions that we saw in 2012 and '13.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","This is Frank Mitsch sitting in for Frank Mitsch. Chuck, I wanted to get a clarification on the volumes in Europe. You had mentioned that you expect them to be positive in 2014. Is that an overall comment or are you speaking specifically to architectural EMEA?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, that's an overall comment for all of our businesses. So that if you look at the fourth quarter, we were flat on volumes. But I would expect that as we go through the year in architectural, that we're going to see a return to positive trends as we go through the year here in architectural.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A return to positive trends. Okay, great. And obviously, that business was a big beneficiary of the cost-cut programs. Your margins went up over 200 bps. What -- is there any incremental savings left in 2014 that will supplement the sort of improvements you're going to have from volumes moving in the right direction?","Charles E. Bunch","Yes. We're going to see a small, what I would call, a small increment in the cost savings for architectural in Europe. And you're going to -- if you look at it, an anniversary of those benefits, so we're going to still see in the first half of the year, the completion of the rest of the cost savings and productivity initiatives. So we still have what I would call modest improvements to look forward to here in the first half.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right, great. And then lastly, we talked a little bit about price increases in the company-owned stores. What's your overall take for the raw material environment in 2014 on the coatings side relative to 2013?","Charles E. Bunch","We are still looking forward to relatively stable raw material prices inflation projections, low-single digits. Now we've seen some of the commodities moving around a little bit. We have a little bit of energy cost inflation. If you look at what's happening to natural gas and some of the transportation costs, propylene has moved up a little bit. It usually does at this time of year. Nothing that's an overall concern. But our forecast right now overall for the inflation basket, including raw materials, low-single digits.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess, I still have a couple of questions on Performance Coatings. I think your operating profits were up $2 million year-over-year, and your sales were up $290 million. And I realize that it's seasonally weak. But why weren't operating profits higher?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, in the fourth quarter, if you look at what we've indicated, we had weaker activity in marine, which had been a very profitable segment or market for our protective and marine segment. And also in architectural coatings, there is an amount. You have seasonally weaker volumes in the business. We've talked about the seasonality of the Akzo business, which is a little higher because of the presence there, Canadian presence. But you do have higher fixed costs in architectural coatings, especially with the store networks. So that as you're putting less volume through, the cost structure, both manufacturing, distribution and stores network, that will affect your profitability for the business in these seasonally low quarters.","Frank S. Sklarsky","And the other thing I would add is that even in some places where we had some volume uptick in Asia, for instance, there was a little bit of currency headwind there. So you have to take that into account, too.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I think earlier in the call, you commented that if you excluded the marine business, the volumes would have been flat in the fourth quarter and Performance Coatings. What were the other things that shrank? Why weren't Performance Coatings even a little bit stronger, excluding the contraction in marine?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, I think as we indicated in the supplemental material from this afternoon, Jeff, that we are, in the fourth quarter, still experiencing the volume declines in our legacy architectural business from the loss of the price points, the low-end price points at Lowe's. So that was the other volume indicator in the fourth quarter for Performance Coatings.","Vincent J. Morales","We had growth, Jeff, in aerospace and refinish that offset that.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, why have you increased prices in company-owned stores? There's not really a lot of raw material inflation. Are your prices lower than some of your competitors? Or what's the justification you've got?","Charles E. Bunch","No. There is still inflationary cost in the store network. Both -- from a distribution standpoint, we have higher transportation, higher labor and benefit costs. So these costs are still impacting our businesses, and so this was what we felt was the right opportunity to announce these price increases early in the year, the beginning of the season, that we would be in a position to offset these increases as we move through the year.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Chuck, you seem cautiously optimistic on the organic growth outlook. Can you talk a bit about what's kind of your macro call on global industrial production? And then what -- given all the cost cutting and productivity moves you've made over the last years, what kind of incremental operating and gross profits do you see in businesses like EMEA or industrial?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, at this point, our macro forecast on global industrial production is up 2% to 2.5%, something in that neighborhood, a little stronger here. Obviously, stronger in China today, not as much in a couple of the other emerging regions. And Europe, just kind of breaking into kind of a positive low-single digit. So overall, we think that the improvement is going to be noticeable even if it isn't considered robust.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And can you comment on incremental -- what kind of operating leverage you would get from even a modest rebound in volumes in some of your key businesses?","Vincent J. Morales","Hey, Don, this is Vince. It depends, obviously, on the market and the region. As Chuck alluded to in his opening remarks, for us, Europe provides the most upside as we've got -- as we've taken out a tremendous amount of cost and we've got good leverage there. And we'd see margins between 25% and 40% incrementally depending on the business, the time of year. And elsewhere in the world, it would be toward the lower end of that range.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then finally, on the $1.5 billion from proceeds from the TRANSITIONS sale, is the plan to do a significant share repurchase to offset the loss of the TRANSITION earnings as they go out the door? Or are you still focused on using that for acquisitions?","Frank S. Sklarsky","Well, again, that would also be wrapped up in that $3 billion to $4 billion that we could potentially deploy -- or that we will deploy over the next 18 to 24 months. And we will continue to have share repurchase and M&A, both as integral parts of the capital allocation strategy. And in some quarters, it might be more of one -- more of the other depending on the timing of the acquisition activity. I can think -- you can see that we have actually absolutely been committed to returning cash to shareholders, as evidenced by hitting $1 billion in 2013 with the significant amount we did also of $680 million in the fourth quarter. So again, that $1.5 billion is in that $3 billion to $4 billion that we intend to deploy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nils Wallin from CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","On Slide 8, shows very helpful volume trends index to 2008 and it's, I think, interesting to show how much Europe is down, as well as U.S. and Canada. Is there anything structural that would imply these volumes can't get back to the 2008 levels? And if so, what would it -- if there isn't anything structural, what would it take to get there? And how long?","Charles E. Bunch","If you comment on the situation, I'll take the example of the North American automotive industry. When the volumes really declined by almost 50% here from 2007 through 2009, there was a view that we'll never get back to those peak years in automotive in North America of 2005, '06 or '07. And here we are 3, 4 years into the recovery at production volumes for North America in automotive at near records, and we're going to see that, we think, continue in 2014. So there is a lot of pessimism sometimes at the depth of these recessionary environments, and I think it will take a while for Europe to get back to what we saw prior to the Great Recession, but I think we're going to see that begin to turn. There were a lot of structural and banking issues in Europe. But I'm confident that they're going to start to see a modest recovery, and it may take them quite a while because I think we addressed a number of those issues here in North America, probably a little more painfully in the early parts of the recession, but it did position us for a recovery. And so I am confident that over time, you will see the growth in Europe return, may take a few more years. If you look at that chart, it's taken us 4 years, and we're still not quite back overall in the economy to that level. But you were seeing it in automotive now. I think we're going to see it in the construction markets. And I think we're going to start to see that line turn a little bit, but it's going to be slow in Europe. And we're certainly not expecting a robust recovery, but we think we'll start to see those early signs of a positive economic growth even at a very low level.","Frank S. Sklarsky","And in automotive, to Chuck's example there, in Germany, in France, Italy, U.K., Spain, even in commercial vehicles, December registrations versus prior year were all up, and that's a turn for some of those countries versus several months of being down year-over-year. So that started to turn. Architectural, as I said before, should be going from negative to modestly positive during the year 2014. Refinish has already turned positive. Aerospace has been positive. So all those are positive indicators to start chipping away at that 20% you see on Slide 8. And in fact, in Germany, when you look at industrial production or GDP, those were all solidly positive with industrial production ahead of GDP because they've got some exports going in their favor as other parts of the world pick up growth. But -- so U.K., the strongest, followed by Germany. Benelux has been fairly strong; Poland, returning to growth; and Spain, turning positive. So all positive indicators.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Got it. That was helpful. Just on -- just turning to your protective coatings, the synergies you got from selling protective coatings in the stores, was that in the original synergy guidance? And if not, what's the opportunity there?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, we were aware that there would be an opportunity to sell additional protective coatings in North America with the acquisition of Akzo North America business. We also made a small acquisition in Canada during this time where we picked up -- or we returned the license to PPG for one of our Canadian distributors. So we think that the combination of these opportunities, not all just related to the Akzo acquisition, are going to produce some positive synergies. We think we're going to be able to see that capture throughout 2014 in a way that we were just getting started in some of these markets during 2013. So we think it's an additional synergy opportunity. We were aware that there'd be some of that, but we think the opportunity is there, if we can capitalize on it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A question on Performance Coatings. If we were to strip out the acquisitions, would your fourth quarter margins have been flat, up or down? Trying to get a sense for how the legacy PPG businesses would have been trending, recognizing the size of the deals and the pronounced seasonality there.","Vincent J. Morales","Yes, Kevin, this is Vince again. As you read the commentary we put out at 1:00, we had roughly $300 million of architectural acquisition-related sales in the segment, and that was roughly at a breakeven for the quarter, which is customary. Last year, that business was not owned by us. It was in the red, solidly in the red. So we've made -- our synergies have made it a breakeven business in a seasonally low quarter. And if you do the math on that, you can see that our margins on the legacy Performance Coatings segment would be up year-over-year.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And if we adjusted for Deft in a similar fashion, would that still be true, Vince?","Vincent J. Morales","Yes. That was a small contributor. It's a smaller business, much smaller business.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. Okay. Secondarily, Chuck, you've been very active on portfolio management, to say the least. You've commented on M&A a bit. I'm wondering about your view on the divestiture side and whether we should anticipate anything in terms of flat glass or fiber glass, say, looking over the next year or 2.","Charles E. Bunch","Certainly, looking over the next year, we don't have any active discussions going on for those businesses. As we've said in the past, for these or any of our other less core activities, that we would certainly consider a -- any transaction that created significant value for our shareholders. But at this point, over the next year or so, we don't have any active discussions. And we see these businesses as now benefiting from some of the recovery here in North America and some of our key markets. So we view them as stronger contributors over the next year as some of these markets recover.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And finally, if I may, just on a housekeeping issue. Would you intend to leave Optical in your financials or move it to discontinued operation for the first quarter?","Frank S. Sklarsky","Well, as we've said, we intend for the business to -- transaction to close in the first half of the year. And once the conditions for a closing have been met, at that point in time, we would move it to discontinued operations. So all we can say right now is it'll be sometime in the first half. And of course, once it moves to disc ops, it will recast for all periods presented.","Charles E. Bunch","But that would be a recast for the TRANSITIONS business.","Frank S. Sklarsky","Right, right.","Charles E. Bunch","Obviously, we have an ongoing Optical and Specialty Materials business that's also performing well. Now if you look at our quarterly performance in silicas, in our OLED business and the remaining pieces of Optical outside of TRANSITIONS, we have what we feel is a strong business portfolio outside of TRANSITIONS, which, as Frank described, would move into discontinued ops with the -- with all the conditions to closing that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ivan Marcuse from KeyBanc.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked. Just have a couple of quick ones. In the fourth quarter, what was your -- for coatings, the raw material basket, was that up or down or flat year-over-year?","Charles E. Bunch","I would say flat.","Frank S. Sklarsky","Yes. Ivan, if you dissect that a little more detailed, we are seeing, as Chuck alluded to earlier, higher propylene derivative costs year-over-year offset by some other items that are slower in terms of pricing.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. And then in the packaging business, you mentioned that was up in all regions except for Europe. Was Europe just more of a market demand thing or was there some sort of share -- market share shift?","Charles E. Bunch","That was -- I think the market conditions in Europe were slower. But there has been an increased competitive activity in the packaging coatings business, especially in the European region. But obviously, we are holding on our own and growing in the markets that have growth like Asia.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then my last question, you may have touched on this in a previous answer, I just missed it. But you mentioned that the U.K. was up, and historically, I believe that U.K. has been -- is a bit of a leading indicator for PPG for that region. Historically, how long has -- does the other countries follow, if that's true, U.K. after you see it sort of turn? If you understand my question.","Charles E. Bunch","We do, and I think, historically, what we've seen is the U.K. markets have -- if the U.S. starts to turn, we see the U.K. improvement earlier than Continental Europe. And then probably if you look at the tendencies or the trends that we're seeing, that's going to be followed by Eastern Europe. So what we saw in 2013 was a clear improvement across a number of markets in the U.K. They're not the leading automotive producer. But certainly, in automotive sales and in production, the U.K. was growing. The architectural market turned around in the U.K. We would look then for the Western Europe to follow, usually with a couple of quarters lag. And then from there, you'd usually see then Eastern Europe follow. So I would say that's one of the reasons why we feel that there will be a positive turn in Europe, albeit, I think, we use the word fragile. I would say it's going to be weak. But the markets that have been weaker and shown less signs of a turnaround have been in Eastern Europe. And we're looking here in the first half to see some improvement in Western Europe now. And hopefully, by the latter half of the year, to see some of the economies in Eastern Europe also begin to stabilize and turn around.","Frank S. Sklarsky","Yes. Ivan, I mean, in the U.K. where a lot of our business is architectural, that's one of the reasons we're seeing that business turn positive in 2014. That economy's followed by Germany, where we have more of a business in automotive, and so we've seen -- already seen that turn positive, and that trend should continue. What'll really help us from an operating leverage standpoint is when France turns. And right now, of course, it's been a little bit flattish. But when that turns, substantial part of that business is architectural and that'll really help us accelerate the growth there and in a very accretive way. We just are -- it's just an uncertainty as to when that will turn as the U.K. has. So far it hasn't had happened, but we're hopeful for sometime in 2014 for that to turn also.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Dan from Morgan Stanley.","Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, and I apologize if it did miss this earlier. Can you just clarify, of the forward guidance you gave on restructuring-related benefits, how much of that is related to the acquired AkzoNobel assets?","Vincent J. Morales","Yes, glad you asked the question, Charlie. If you look, we laid out in the press release and the prepared remarks $75 million to $90 million of incremental year-over-year cost savings. Those are programs that we've announced previously. If you recall, we closed on the acquisition in April. We put out a synergy target and also indicated we'd have some restructuring, which we announced in the third quarter. And so this $75 million to $90 million are programs that we've already announced. The lion's share of that will occur in our Performance Coatings segment with the synergy capture of Akzo. We also have some targeted synergy -- targeted cost savings, excuse me, in restructuring and in a few other businesses. And again, we laid this out in our third quarter. That included much smaller amounts in businesses like architectural, EMEA, marine and fiber glass. So of the $75 million to $90 million, the lion's share of that would be specific to that acquisition and a much smaller portion allocated to those 3 other buckets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts from UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It sounds like we'll have the TRANSITIONS business in the earnings here in the first quarter. Should we expect another really strong quarter? I mean, the $1.5 billion doesn't change, and you get to keep half of anything you can generate over the next couple of quarters. So I assume you're running that business relatively hard right now.","Vincent J. Morales","Yes. John, again, we can't tell when we're going to get the final regulatory approvals, which is what we're waiting on. But until we do that, we'll continue to classify the business as continuing. We didn't talk a lot about it, but the business had a very successful Q4. Substantial event occurred with the new release of a Gen VII product in North America about a week or so ago. There was a nice pipeline fill in Q4. And we're certainly still waiting to see how that is going to translate in Q1 at market sales, but we're certainly excited. We did see good progress last year in Europe under similar circumstances. So yes, we feel good about the business. The fourth quarter was strong, and we expect that to continue here, early part of the year.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","If you had another 14% sales growth in that segment, would you have another 25% earnings growth? Is that incremental math still in play in the first quarter?","Vincent J. Morales","Yes, all that sales growth, as Chuck alluded to, was not all TRANSITIONS. We did have good silica. We did have good optical products outside of TRANSITIONS. Typically, these businesses, coatings and specialty materials, do have a lot of leverage on the upside to a degree.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then secondly, are the same-store sales in the PPG stores benefiting at all from closure of Glidden stores? That is, are you capturing some of that closure sales volume in that same-store sales number or in your continuing stores?","Charles E. Bunch","Yes, we think there is some of that, a small piece. As we've tried to analyze it over the last few quarters, we obviously have closed stores in the combined network now. So we're looking to maintain as many of those sales in the remaining stores. So again, a very -- what we feel is a very solid number for same-store sales growth for PPG, but we think there is a little bit of benefit in there from the closed Glidden stores in the network.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Hocevar from Northcoast Research.","Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research","I was wondering what your visibility is like in the marine market, and as the year progresses, if you see that flattening out. Or do you expect kind of these negative volume comps to continue throughout all of 2014?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, when you look at our sales over the course of 2012 and 2013 and the new business that we're capturing for future sales, we experienced probably one of the larger decreases in our marine sales between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013. So one of the things that we're suffering in the fourth quarter is the comparison with what was still a stronger period of sales level in marine from business that had been previously booked and was being finished up. So I think in the first quarter of 2014 and throughout the year, we will have, let's call them, easier sales comparables with the prior year. And we are seeing new bookings growth, but I would not expect the sales level to move up significantly until the latter part of 2014. But certainly, we're seeing a stable level of sales now going into 2014. So the comparables will be better.","Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research","Okay, great. And in terms of the auto OEM business, could you -- you mentioned you expect to outperform the industry again in 2014, and I believe you've outperformed the industry 700 or 800 basis points, something like that, in 2013. Is that type of outperformance what we should expect in 2014 as well? Or is that a little bit optimistic?","Charles E. Bunch","I would say that I don't know that we look for that type of outperformance in every year. We think that we've benefited, again as we mentioned, on the technology side and being well positioned in the fastest-growing markets in places like North America or in China. So I think on a longer-term basis, you wouldn't expect that, but we still feel that we have positive momentum going into 2014.","Vincent J. Morales","And one of the other factors, too, is that as the Japanese OEMs and even some of the European OEMs localize production in other markets to add incremental capacity, we do tend to benefit from that by virtue of our technology, service levels, contact process, whatever. So new facilities, we tend to get a very good portion of that market in addition to the layers as a result of some of the technologies in existing facilities. So that also helps to contribute to having some level of over performance versus the market going forward.","Operator","All right, ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one final question, and that question is coming from the line of James Sheehan from SunTrust.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Chuck, just wondering on the price increases in the company-owned stores, for the Akzo stores in particular, are the price increases equivalent to those in the legacy PPG stores? Or are they a little bit higher or lower?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, right now, we're consolidating store operating systems. We're consolidating management and practices. So you should expect similar strategies and policies, including pricing, regardless of whether these were a legacy Akzo or PPG's store.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude the question-and-answer portion of today's call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Vince Morales. Please proceed.","Vince Morales","Thank you, Jasmine. Welcome, everybody. This is Vince Morales, PPG\u2019s Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to this teleconference to review our third quarter 2015 financial results. Joining me on the call today from PPG is Michael McGarry, President and Chief Executive Officer and Frank Sklarsky, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information we released on Thursday, October 15, 2015.","I will remind everybody that we posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on our Investor Center at ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and they provide additional support to the opening comments Michael will make momentarily. Following Michael\u2019s perspective on the company\u2019s results for the quarter, we will move to the Q&A session. Both the prepared commentary and the discussion on the Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the company\u2019s current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG\u2019s operating and financial performance. These statements may involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ.

The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which again are available in our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For any additional information, please refer to PPG\u2019s filings with the SEC.","And now, let me introduce PPG\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, Michael McGarry.","Michael McGarry","Thank you, Vince and good afternoon everyone. I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. Today, we have reported our third quarter 2015 financial results. Our results included third quarter net sales of $3.8 billion and third quarter record adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $1.61. Our adjusted earnings per share in the third quarter were up $0.20 or 14% versus the prior record quarter.","Our continued strong performance was achieved despite unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts, which were larger than originally anticipated due to further weakening of emerging region currencies during the quarter. We more than offset the currency headwind with continued benefits from our acquisitions, including consistently strong performance of Comex, ongoing and aggressive actions that further reduce our overall cost, and continued cash deployment. Overall, we performed well this quarter against a more dynamic and uneven economic backdrop.","We have continued to deliver solid compounded adjusted EPS growth as a company, including over 20% in the last 3 years. This consistent performance is a tangible measurement of our global coatings business platform, our ability to innovate and commercialize customer-driven products and technologies and our continued aggressive cost management. Additionally, we continue to benefit from disciplined earnings accretive cash deployment.","Our third quarter sales volume declined by less than 1% year-over-year, down slightly versus our second quarter performance. The lower results reflect overall moderation of global economic growth during the quarter and transitory customer inventory management. Our Industrial Coatings segment grew volumes supported by continued automotive OEM volume growth in all major regions. We delivered higher volumes in Asia despite lower industry production in China. Also, growth continued in Europe and North America, supported by growing demand in these regions. Additionally, we continue to benefit from initial industry adoption of our new can coating technologies and our packaging coatings business. We are in early stages of an industry-wide technology conversion and we have demonstrated excellent progress in securing an initial leadership position during this once in a multi-decade industry conversion.","Within the industrial segment, growth was partially offset by slight volume declines in our industrial coatings and specialty coatings and materials businesses. A result similar to prior sequential quarter as overall general industrial demand remains tepid in all major regions. Performance coating sales declined \u2013 volumes declined due to lower architectural coatings demand stemming from a weaker Canadian economy, coupled with inventory management by most of our U.S. and Canadian national retail customers approaching the tail end of a modest painting season.","Overall, architectural coatings industry demand was modest in the third quarter following a weaker than anticipated second quarter due to poor painting weather conditions. So essentially, we do not experience a large-scale snapback in the quarter. This left most of our large national retail customers and independent distributors with high inventories as we began to wind down the paint season. So, their late third quarter order patterns were reduced commensurately. Volumes in our other performance coatings businesses were up slightly.","Regionally, for the company, higher volumes were achieved in Europe, with growth trends slightly ahead of the previous quarter as we continue to see broader, but still modestly incremental improvement in the region. Year-over-year volumes grew in Asia as well. China volumes were soft early in the quarter, including customer inventory management, but stabilized with demand improvement later in the quarter. Volumes in the U.S. and Canadian markets were lower year-over-year, primarily due to architectural coatings customer inventory management.","Mexican volumes, excluding acquisition-related benefits, remain very solid while South American demand weakened in comparison to previous sequential quarter and year-over-year. As I mentioned, we incurred notable unfavorable currency translation impacts to sales and earnings stemming from weakened foreign currencies. These currencies, primarily the euro, unfavorably impacted our sales by about $310 million or about 8% and reduced our pre-tax earnings by about $45 million or $0.12 per share. Absent the foreign currency impacts, our adjusted earnings per share would have been up over 20% year-over-year.","Based on current foreign currency exchange rates, we expect the unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts to moderate somewhat in the fourth quarter as foreign currencies began to weaken in the second half of 2014 and do the seasonality of our businesses. Given these factors, we now expect currency translation to reduce our full year sales by about $1.1 billion and pre-tax earnings by about $120 million to $130 million. This range is slightly unfavorable to the forecast that we provided during our second quarter earnings conference call, with most of the change already recognized in our third quarter results. As you would expect from PPG, we have maintained our aggressive operational and cost focus as we achieve lower manufacturing and SG&A cost in comparison to last year.","Our year-over-year SG&A cost as a percentage of sales were down about 100 basis points during the third quarter. We continue to execute on our previously announced restructuring plan and anticipate full year savings from this program of $100 million to $105 million when fully implemented in 2017, with $15 million to $20 million of these savings expected in 2015. Cash deployment was also a significant factor of segment income growth in the third quarter. This included sales and earnings from our recent acquisitions, including Comex and several smaller companies.","Since the end of the second quarter, we closed on Cuming Microwave, Chemfil Canada, IVC Industrial Coatings and Le Joint Francais, our abbreviated, LJF. We will benefit from these transactions in the fourth quarter. In addition to acquisition spending, we deployed $150 million of cash in the quarter for the purchase of 1.5 million shares of PPG stock. And our repurchase pace year-to-date is ahead of last year.","We remain committed to accretive \u2013 earnings accretive cash deployment. And year-to-date we have spent $900 million in this regard. Including six business acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of over $400 million coupled with $500 million of stock repurchases. We had previously announced a cash deployment target of $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion focused on acquisitions and share repurchases for the combined calendar year 2015 and 2016. We have now narrowed the range and are targeting at least $2 billion to $2.5 billion over that time period.","Looking ahead we anticipate a resumption of PPG volume growth in the fourth quarter supported by global economic growth, the absence of customer inventory management and the benefit of including Comex in our organic figures following the acquisition anniversary in November. Lastly, we continue to have a variety of PPG specific earnings drivers that are not directly tied to the pace of the economy most of which I have already spoken about. In summary, these include the benefits of completing our restructuring actions, attainment of remaining synergies from the ongoing integration of our acquisitions, the ongoing effects of continued cash deployment and our proactive cost management.","Before we conclude our prepared remarks I want to provide some context around the few key initiatives I will be working on in my new role as CEO. These initiatives are summarized on the slide titled PPG Path Forward in the presentation material supporting today\u2019s teleconference. First and foremost we are committed to maintaining an unwavering focus on our customers. To do so we will continue to invest in customer driven innovation and technology. Technology development has been the backbone of PPG for many, many years and we have been to gain valuable share of our customers\u2019 wallet as technology in our industry has continued to shift and support the changing customer and environment demand.","Recent examples include our compact process and automotive OEM, a new array of coatings and sealant technologies that we serve \u2013 we develop to serve today\u2019s composite aerospace market, our industry leading water based refinished coatings and new coatings for the inside of food and beverage cans just to name a few. We aim to use these technology shifts to expand our innovation leadership in markets in which we participate. Also we intend to maximize the transfer of these technologies across all of PPG\u2019s business as faster.","Additionally we need to increase our customer intimacy and service capabilities so that we are able to deliver higher organic growth. This requires us to make it easier for customers to do business with PPG. This includes from the time they or we develop a potential concept involving either coatings technology or application all the way through the purchase order to our final product shipment and providing technical support to service our customers to launch the new technology in their facilities flawlessly. This is an end to end customer approach that has focused on building long lasting mutual beneficial relationships and is aimed to drive in a higher organic growth rate.","PPG has been very good operationally as the 34 year veteran of the company this is one of the disciplines that was instilled in me and continues to be in part with all associates from day one on the job and it remains with us today. No stone goes unturned and looking for way to reduce costs and we will maintain this aggressive cost managing approach. In addition we will make it even more dynamic so that we will continue rapidly adjust our cost structure to constantly match regional and end use market demand by further verbalizing our cost structuring. This will include more shared service cost centers of excellence that were centralized costs allowing us to take advantage of efficiencies and technologies and is possible due to our global scale. This will improve our cost structure in the various regions and field locations around the world.","Strategically we have made significant strides in transforming our portfolio in the past several years. We are now in a position to optimize and extract the full scale advantages of our global coatings platforms. This includes improvements in nearly every facet of our business including further distribution and supply chain advantages due to our breadth and depth of products and services we buy, make and sell. Naturally given all the effort we have put into transforming our business portfolio, we will maintain our rigor on our business portfolio to ensure continued shareholder value creation. Also we remain fiscally prudent and shareholder friendly to other trades that have long been embedded in PPG\u2019s DNA.","From a balance sheet perspective we want to remain investment grade and maintain adequate financial flexibility which has served us so well over the years. We will certainly invest organically to keep our existing businesses healthy and keep our discipline with respect to acquisition evaluation. Additionally we intend to reward our shareholders and we recommend sustainable dividend increases to our Board of Directors. We intend to be efficient with all our assets including cash and we will return excess cash to shareholders. Lastly, I am honored and excited to be CEO and I look forward over the coming weeks and months for spending more time with our shareholders and continuing this dialogue on the path forward.","Thank you for your time and once again we appreciate your interest in PPG. Now Jasmine would you please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Michael you highlighted in the release moderating global economic growth, can you talk to what regions and what end markets you are seeing that moderating growth?","Michael McGarry","Sure. We can start with automotive as you know you saw that in China. The good news is in September you saw a little bit of an improvement there and the order book for August continues to look modestly better. You would also see some heavy-duty equipment being another area that continues to be a little bit weak. From a regional perspective, we see some \u2013 a little bit of uptick in Europe. And obviously the Latin America, particularly Brazil seems to be getting weaker instead of better. So overall, I think those would be some of our initial comments, David.","David Begleiter","Very good. Michael just on raws in your gross margin nice expansion in Q3, where do we stand on the realization of some of the lower raw material costs through your COGS?","Michael McGarry","David, we have been very consistent. We have told you throughout the year that about a third of our raw materials are tied to oil. We get savings quicker on items closer to the oil well like solvents. We get those in 30 to 60 days, transportation typically 60 to 90 days. We typically work with our suppliers of both through the propylene and ethylene derivatives savings. And there is lag a little bit more in six months to nine months. We see more raw material deflation in 3Q than in 2Q. And we will continue to work with our suppliers to get further savings in 4Q and going forward.","David Begleiter","Thank you very much.","Frank Sklarsky","Thanks, David.","Michael McGarry","Thank you, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Chris Evans","This is Chris Evans on for Bob. I was hoping you could provide some additional granularity on the North American architectural volume decline, are you guys seeing any trends outside of the destocking there?","Michael McGarry","Chris, what I would tell you is that we had a wet June and people were anticipating a stronger paint season. We have been very consistent in saying that we expected the paint season to be in that low single-digit range. I think our assessment has been relatively on target. So we saw the major retail folks both in the U.S. and Canada start to destock late in the third quarter. The good news is I will tell you that we think it\u2019s transitory because as I look at our sales through the first 14 days of October, the sales are very consistent with what we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. So that leaves me to believe that this is transitory effect.","Chris Evans","Thank you, guys.","Frank Sklarsky","Thank you, Chris.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Please proceed.","Duffy Fischer","Yes, good afternoon folks. Question, just if you would take a step back on your volumes, the chart that you provided optically obviously doesn\u2019t look good. The whole industry is struggling a little bit. But when you look across your businesses, would you say you are gaining or losing market share in \u2013 so the question is, are your volumes kind of worse than the market or in line with the market, would you guess?","Michael McGarry","Well, I guess, Duffy, I would first say that it\u2019s a difficult question to answer given that there is not a lot of industry data that you can rely on. So, I would say it\u2019s conceivable that in the U.S. stores business, we might have ticked down a fraction. But certainly, I don\u2019t feel that way in Canada. And we are gaining share in other places like Mexico. We are gaining share in Europe. We are gaining share \u2013 so I would tell you that since we run a global architectural business overall, net-net, we are doing pretty well.","Frank Sklarsky","Duffy, if you go to some other markets outside of architectural, you will see auto is up versus the industry, packaging, we believe is up versus the industry, and we think our protective business is up versus the industry although the other side of that coin is marine. And marine for the industry is down and we are managing the declines with the industry.","Duffy Fischer","Okay. And then one area that it looks like you have an exciting new product, you call it compact. I think the industry will call it wet on wet. But it seems like you have gotten two big wins in that space recently. One, how big does that market become over the next 2 or 3 years and then is it conceivable that this could be like eco where you would get a strong majority of the wins going forward?","Michael McGarry","Yes, Duffy, I would tell you that this has been a recent trend. We have been outperforming the industry for quite some period of time now. So, the industry was up 1% in Q3, we were up 5% in Q3. So again, we have significantly outpaced. We have told people that it\u2019s not probable that we would outpace the industry for an extended period of time. At some point, you have to revert to the means, but our technology, we think is the best. Our technical service has certainly been outstanding. And we have been winning more than our fair share of new plants. So that\u2019s good. And then ultimately, when they start to refurbish some of these older facilities and they want to save money and reduce the footprint size, this compact process will also be another winner. So, we think this is a long-term sustainable win for us going forward. Thanks to the outstanding work of our R&D team.","Duffy Fischer","Great. Thanks, guys.","Frank Sklarsky","Thank you, Duffy.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed.","John Roberts","Good afternoon. Was Comex up high single-digits in the quarter? I know it was up high singles for the first half. So, I am just wondering whether it slowed down and still maintained high single for the nine months, but was decelerating in the quarter may be?","Frank Sklarsky","No, John, Comex has performed very well all year, very consistent at the at market sales. What we do see with Comex is the peso devalued 20% plus and so that\u2019s been taking away some of the top line. We have made up for that with growth in both at market as well as new concessionaire store openings.","John Roberts","Okay. And could you comment a little bit about the M&A pipeline and whether valuation expectations have come down with the multiples on the publicly traded paint companies?","Michael McGarry","Yes, John, the way I would answer that is its too early for the multiples to come down to the last 30 or 60 days where you saw the stock market come down. Our pipeline still continues to look very good. We are active looking at a number of properties. And I see no difference in that regard versus what we have had in the past.","John Roberts","Okay, thank you.","Michael McGarry","Thank you, John.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed.","P.J. Juvekar","Yes. Hi, Michael. I have a question on this inventory management by retailers. You saw that in third quarter, what\u2019s your confidence level that you think it\u2019s behind us? You said first couple of weeks, it is good. And then secondly on that, was it a particular retailer or was it across the board for everyone that destocking took place? Was there any impact on pricing because of that?","Frank Sklarsky","P.J., we had a little hard time hearing you. Let me try to repeat the question. You asked I think what\u2019s our confidence about Q4 no carryover into Q4 to destock, and how broad was the destocking. Is that correct, P.J.?","P.J. Juvekar","Yes, that\u2019s correct. And if there was any impact on pricing of paint because it is destocking?","Frank Sklarsky","The third part will be okay.","Michael McGarry","Alright. So, we will take the pricing one first. As you know, we have been telling you consistently that pricing, our model shows pricing flat for the year. We still see that happening. And if you are thinking about next year, we\u2019ll see pricing flat pretty much into next year as well. As far as why we think it\u2019s a transitory effect on inventory, not only have we looked at our own inventories, but we have also obviously talked to our customers. And they are also of that same opinion. So, I think that\u2019s a way to think about it besides just the fact that we are looking at our order book and it was broad. I won\u2019t say all, but I will say it was very broad.","Frank Sklarsky","And P.J., you may have missed earlier, but Michael mentioned that the first two weeks of October, our order patterns are consistent with that same time period last year.","P.J. Juvekar","Okay, thank you. And then just on Canada, you mentioned that volumes were down. Can you just give some order of magnitude? How much were volumes down in Canada? Thank you.","Frank Sklarsky","So for us, just to frame this for everybody, we purchased \u2013 when we purchased the AkzoNobel North American business in 2013, we acquired the number one position in the country of Canada. At that time, we said the business was roughly $500 million and a very concentrated paint season just from a weather perspective. And that business was down similar to what you are seeing the total segment \u2013 total architectural business be down, so high-single, low double-digit range. And that\u2019s more structural, P.J., we do see weakening in the Canadian economy.","Michael McGarry","Yes. We have had two quarters in a row of GDP down in Canada.","Frank Sklarsky","You there, P.J.?","P.J. Juvekar","Thank you.","Michael McGarry","Thanks.","Frank Sklarsky","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. In your commentary, you said that your cost-cutting program is lowering cost annually by about $20 million. So, let\u2019s call it $5 million a quarter. But your SG&A and R&D costs in the quarter were down $52 million. And so I assume that I don\u2019t know $47 million of that is currency. But your overall current \u2013 that is you had a $47 million currency benefit in SG&A. But you said that your currency net hit was $40 million. So, does that mean that the gross margin was penalized by about $87 million or $90 million in the quarter due to currencies?","Frank Sklarsky","Yes. First of all, let\u2019s take the various categories. And if you look at corporate cost, it\u2019s correct to say corporate costs went down by about $20 million. And the majority of that was stock-based compensation obviously reflecting the equity markets. And that will \u2013 it includes both the Q3 effect and the catch-up from the first half. That won\u2019t really repeat in the fourth quarter. And I would suspect that, that corporate cost line will be back up in the $50 million to $55 million range versus the low $35 million that you saw in the quarter. What you are correct in saying that there is a currency benefit to our cost structure in total that applies to both COGS and SG&A around the world. So, what we said was while currency impacted the top line by $310 million in the quarter and impacted the bottom line by about \u2013 the operating income line by about $45 million in the quarter, we expect that overall currency impact in the fourth quarter will be less than that, but at today\u2019s rates, about $250 million in the top line and about 10% of that on the operating income line. But in terms of we can\u2019t really give you detail right now on the specific currency impact on every portion of the income statement, but that\u2019s how I would frame it for Q3 and what we expect for Q4 as well as the corporate details.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. And then secondly, many companies when they report earnings provide a full balance sheet and a full funds plus statement. Are there reasons why you in the gathering of your information that it\u2019s difficult for you to put that together? And what was operating cash flow for the quarter?","Frank Sklarsky","So Jeff, as you know, we are a very early reporter. We do think that provides very quick transparency to our shareholders. We do file our Q within a week or so. And we have all those details. So I think the reason why just we would like to get the EBIT information, sales and EBIT information out as quick as possible.","Michael McGarry","And all I will add to that is the fact that if you look at where we started the quarter and we ended the quarter, we obviously picked up a couple of $100 million, over $200 million in cash balance and that\u2019s a combination of the earnings and then take off of that obviously, CapEx, our acquisition spending, but also a good performance on working capital as we continued to work on collecting past due receivables as well as some initiatives we have around bringing inventories down. So still very diligent over managing the cash flow and as a result, we have a pretty decent Q3 in that respect.","Jeff Zekauskas","So what was the operating cash flow number in the quarter?","Frank Sklarsky","You will see that when we file our Q very shortly, you will see all the details around that would rather wait until you get the whole statement before we dissect that.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Michael McGarry","Thank you, Jeff.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Frank Mitsch","Hi, good afternoon gentlemen and congrats on another record quarter.","Michael McGarry","Thanks Frank.","Frank Mitsch","But I think \u2013 I was thinking maybe I should wait until I see the Q to get super excited, but I will take your word for it. Michael, I think you mentioned that North American order patterns or maybe Vince for the first couple of weeks of October were similar to what you were seeing last year, so that gives you confidence that we are not seeing the destocking. Obviously, Asia was a big concern for folks and you said that it started out soft in Q3 but then it got better, can you talk about the pace of business so far in October in that part of the world?","Michael McGarry","Yes. So Frank, let me give you a couple of things as I go about here. And I will start with the automotive side because there seems to be a lot of concern about the automotive piece. As you know, they have reduced the tax on small engines in China and they announced that tax rate in September. And that took effect October 1. And so it was not being inconceivable that people deferred purchases of small cars because you know that the tax rate was going to drop from 10% to 5% on October 1. So we saw September sales in China were actually up about, I think 3% if I remember right. And in October, we have a pretty good view of what\u2019s happening with our customers. Our order book looked pretty much just in time delivery. And we are seeing moderately improved deliveries to our customers. Of course, we are performing better than the industry. So we are still expecting automotive sales in China to be up modestly in that 1% to 3% kind of range. If you look at our other businesses, there was some initial destocking after the Tianjin \u201cexplosion\u201d. Most of that has worked its way through the system now because what happened is people were concerned about holding inventory for things like marine coatings, refinished coatings, all that has been moderated. And we see those order books continuing to get better. So I would tell you that starting mid-September, we started to see that improvement and it\u2019s continued in early part of October.","Frank Sklarsky","Alright, that\u2019s very helpful. And I do appreciate the raising of the amount that you are going to spend on other M&A or share buyback. You raised the lower end there and I think in response to Mr. Robert\u2019s question, you said that you are not really seeing the multiples come down on the M&A front, so would that suggest that we might preferentially go towards the share buyback route. And having said that and asking the question, obviously the stock is materially below the 52-week high or even though the last yearly average, how are your thoughts about splitting between those two uses of cash?","Michael McGarry","Frank, let me clarify. I said yet. The acquisitions hadn\u2019t yet reflected that. So let\u2019s be clear on that. Secondly, we have always said that acquisitions are always preferred. They are more accretive than buying back our stock. So that\u2019s always our first preference. But we are going to protect the shareholders value. And if we don\u2019t see the acquisitions coming through, then we will take that money and buyback the stock. So we want to continue to do both and our first preference is always acquisitions.","Frank Sklarsky","Frank and I think it\u2019s safe to assume that as we go through the fourth quarter, you can expect that we will continue to deploy cash in the quarter to either one or both of those initiatives as we did $900 million through the third quarter. So we are already on pace to exceed, have to midpoint by the end of this year, so all the more reason to raise that range. But we will continue to deploy cash in the quarter.","Frank Mitsch","Thank you very much.","Michael McGarry","Thanks Frank.","Frank Sklarsky","Thank you, Frank.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Arun Viswanathan","Yes. Thanks guys. So I guess I just wanted ask you your confidence level on a couple of things. So going forward Q4 and 2016, you have a lot of organic growth initiatives, do you expect that, that would potentially drive a positive kind of volume growth picture in general industrial or auto OEM or are those kind of more dependent on market development?","Michael McGarry","Arun, I would tell you that we are expecting continued organic growth. Let me give you some reasons why we believe that. First of all, as you know we sold our one glass facility and that was in \u2013 in the end of the third quarter last year. So you will start to see that as a positive. Comex will then flip from an acquisition to organic growth in the fourth quarter. We close on that in November. We continue to see positive growth in our automotive business. Packaging continues to do well. Our refinished business with the water-based technology continues to grow and that\u2019s a slower growth given the fact that that\u2019s volume challenged market with the new technology out there. But we are continuing to grow in that regard. And the one area that I would say is still a question mark is where we are in the cycle is heavy-duty equipment, it\u2019s been down. I would expect that to at some point reach the bottom. And then that would start to turn. And we talked about packaging being very good as well. So I think overall, you are going to see a return to more organic growth.","Frank Sklarsky","And the other thing going in our favor quite honestly is the fact that inventories in the system are at very reasonable levels, whether it\u2019s the U.S. automotive business of 160 days at current sales rates. Packaging, as Michael said we will continue to pick up new business from our technology based offerings there. And then I mean in China, because of the recent production rates have been below recent sales rates, those inventories are coming back in line in the field too. So we don\u2019t really have to go through anymore rationalization of inventories if things stayed reasonably healthy in the end markets that includes U.S. architectural.","Arun Viswanathan","Okay, great. And just looking at the slides, it looks like obviously North America was challenged in Q4, a lot of destocking there. But you sounded slightly more positive on Europe, can you just help us understand a little bit more detail on what you are seeing in Europe?","Michael McGarry","Yes. So we will start first of all with the automotive business. As you know, sales have been better than builds. And that\u2019s obviously a good thing going forward. We are also seeing a pickup in a number of countries. Southern Europe is obviously coming off a very low base. But it\u2019s getting better as well. And then we saw a pickup in our architectural business in the Benelux. And of course, we have always seeing good growth in Germany as well as the UK. And although the Eastern European region has been a little choppy mostly up, that\u2019s been good. The only one that\u2019s really down of course is Russia. Russia continues to be down nearly 30% in a number of segments. So that economy is clearly challenge. And then we have been gaining share in the protective market in Europe as well. So that\u2019s been a positive force all along. And then the last thing I would say is that our \u2013 we are building a new silica plant in Europe and that facility will be starting up. And we have a very good demand for the new products, industry leading new technology coming out of that facility.","Frank Sklarsky","And Arun, the one area we haven\u2019t talked about previously in the call is South America. For us, it\u2019s about 3% of our sales. We do see challenges in South America as Michael alluded to in his prepared remarks. We don\u2019t see that returning to growth certainly in the near-term.","Arun Viswanathan","Okay. And just to clarify, you said in the past recently that around 10% or so of your businesses are the ones that are kind of in that challenged area. Is that still a fair characterization or is there any kind of sensitivity around that?","Vince Morales","Again, I would say South America, about 3% of our sales. We have framed architectural Canada for you at about $500 million. Those will be the two very sensitive. If you combine Russia, Ukraine, Africa, you may be get another 2% or 3% max.","Frank Sklarsky","And of course, the Comex business is doing extremely well and then it will be translated to organic growth. For 2016, they continue to open stores at a very healthy pace. So that will also help us out in the organic growth rate.","Michael McGarry","And I guess, Arun, this is Michael. The one thing I would add at the end is France. France is still a challenge market for us. But at some point, we do feel confident that\u2019s going to have to turn around. And so I would tell you that\u2019s probably why we are more optimistic when you put all these things together.","Arun Viswanathan","Okay, thanks.","Michael McGarry","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please proceed.","Nils Wallin","Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. Back on North American architectural, you didn\u2019t mention performance at the stores, so what did volume do in your company-owned stores?","Michael McGarry","Yes. Same-store sales were modestly negative. We have come off of a, I don\u2019t know, 7 or 8 positive comps in a row, including Q1, Q2 of this year. Most of that was Canada. We have talked about the modest paint season. And then I would remind you that our PMC, most of our PMC in North America runs through our stores. As you know, the oil business has been certainly under a lot of pressure. And so that\u2019s the way I would characterize that.","Frank Sklarsky","And PMC, just for everybody is protected on marine coatings.","Nils Wallin","So if we remove the store numbers from the other channels in North American architectural, does that mean that those other channels were actually down more than high single-digits?","Frank Sklarsky","Slightly more, because the stores were just slightly negative.","Nils Wallin","Okay, thanks. And then just on Canada, I mean, obviously, we understand GDP issues there, but housing still continues to be strong. So, what \u2013 is it some other channel that\u2019s affecting the demand for architectural paint?","Vince Morales","No, Nils. I mean, we have said for many, many years that architectural typically tracks closer to GDP than anything. And there is a house build market and a house repaint market. The repaint market is typically 5 times to 6 times larger than the house build market. So, the repaint market is not trapped I guess in new home sales. And that\u2019s the one that drives the volume at the end of the day.","Michael McGarry","We would say that paint in Canada is 80% repaint.","Nils Wallin","Understood. That\u2019s helpful. And then just finally, Michael, you did speak about leveraging your asset base. Obviously, you have got some pretty significant size in your assets across the globe and doing that through distribution and supply chain? What does that \u2013 what would that translate in terms of margin accretion over a three or five-year period?","Michael McGarry","I think that\u2019s a little early to answer that question. I think the way to think about it is we have major shared service facilities in Europe and Asia. Now with the Comex one, we will be able to add additional one in Latin America. We are starting up. We have put in a new resin facility in Brazil. We have a new facility that we expanded actually in China. So, that will drive lower cost in our automotive and industrial businesses there. And then we are also moving more of our production in Europe from West to East. So that will add additional benefits. So, I think that\u2019s the way I would get you to kind of frame your question.","Nils Wallin","Thanks very much.","Frank Sklarsky","Thank you, Nils.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed.","Ghansham Panjabi","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Michael, I know it\u2019s early, but looking out to 2016, can you just give us some of the various puts and takes related to some of the bigger businesses in your portfolio just from a fundamental standpoint maybe starting with the North American architectural and then also auto OEM?","Michael McGarry","Okay. North American architectural, I would say that we are going to probably have the same opinion we had this year, which is low single-digits growth for that business. So, we are going to continue to stay there. Automotive, it continues to be a very strong market for us. That\u2019s been a good one. Our refinish business in North America, we are gaining share with our water-based technology. That\u2019s a positive. Aerospace has been moderating growth, but continues \u2013 we continue to get new content on the planes and with the acquisitions that we have added that Cuming Microwave would be one. That would be another positive. When you move to Europe, I would tell you that again I would say that it\u2019s probably going to be modest in that low single-digits kind of range. We continue to do well in our automotive space there. Our packaging space continues to pick up business. So, that\u2019s good for us. When you look at some of the other businesses, probably the bright spot is our protective business. We have a new industry leading technology on fire protection that has really done very well. On the negative side, obviously, you have \u2013 you are still going to have the challenges in Russia. We don\u2019t see that going away moving to South America. As Vince mentioned earlier, we see that probably bottoming out. So, we don\u2019t \u2013 we are not really excited about what we see down in Brazil, but we are aggressively taking cost out in Brazil. So, it\u2019s not going to be a negative from that kind of standpoint.","And then moving over to Asia, Southeast Asia has performed okay. India has been really solid. I would say they are in that 6%. So, if you ask what has the highest growth in Asia right now? It\u2019s India. And then we still remain \u2013 because our business in China is predominantly for consumer-oriented stuff stays and what we make in China stays in China, it\u2019s not for the export market. So, we are optimistic that China will continue to resume its growth. We know the Chinese government is very interested in the economy growing. They are taking a lot of right moves to have the economy growth. And we have benefited that it\u2019s been one of our best markets and we expect that to continue to do well going forward.","Frank Sklarsky","Don\u2019t forget the\u2026","Ghansham Panjabi","Great, that\u2019s helpful. And then specific to packaging, can you just sort of parse out the strong growth that you are seeing there geographically? I mean, it seems like you have seen a fair amount of success with the BPA non-intent. Is that spreading globally? And did that start to materialize in 3Q?","Michael McGarry","Well, the BPA non-intent win started in Europe. They have continued into the U.S. As you know or you may know, California has this proposition 65 out there. They have not taken a firm position yet. But our guess is that our folks in the U.S. will be much more interested in the BPA non-intent coatings going forward. So, that trend will accelerate. And as you know, we only had 3% market share inside the can. And so since this is a once in a generation or multi-generation for some of these things opportunity, we are going to be at a higher presence inside the can than we have ever been in the past. So, that would be a positive for us overall.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay. And then just one final one for Frank if I could, just on working capital, Frank, for \u201815, just given how dynamic the raw material environment has been, how should we think about that for 2015? Thanks so much.","Frank Sklarsky","Yes. Our goal on working capital obviously is to bring that down by 100 basis points a year. We have seen a little bit of slow pay recently, but we will get that back down by the end of the year. And we do have some relatively aggressive inventory goals for the teams. We are making great progress on that. But that would be our overall goal is to keep bringing that down by about 100 basis points. And it\u2019s probably the largest opportunity in inventory by keep working on the receivables. Payables are in pretty decent shape. I was just going to add one more thing to what Michael was saying on the growth prospect for 2016. Remember, a lot of the acquisitions that we have done this year at $400 million worth of cash deployed in acquisitions, the revenue associated with that is only a small portion of what the full year impact is or will be for 2016, so in between $400 million and $500 million of revenue associated with acquisitions, excluding the base Comex business. That\u2019s over and above the base Comex business. We will hit in full stride next year. And you can make any assumptions you like in terms of the profitability of those businesses, but that\u2019s also going to be accretive to our top line along with the EBITDA that goes with that.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay, perfect. Thanks so much.","Frank Sklarsky","Thanks.","Michael McGarry","Thank you, Ghansham.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Matt Gingrich","Hi guys. This is Matt Gingrich on for Vincent. I was wondering if you could speak to the phasing of sell-through in U.S. quarter on a month-by-month basis?","Michael McGarry","On a month-by month basis I would tell you that we started to see the destocking start in August and by the middle to the end of September it was over. So that's the way I would think about that.","Matt Gingrich","Okay, great. And then in terms of how sales trended in your dedicated paint stores, what did you see there?","Michael McGarry","Actually, in the dedicated paint stores, it was pretty, I would say consistent through the quarter. Although near the end of September, our comps were marginally better than what they were earlier in the quarter. And then they have started to be in October as I mentioned, virtually identical to what we had in the 4Q of last year.","Matt Gingrich","Would that be mid single-digits?","Michael McGarry","Yes \u2013 no, it\u2019s low single-digits positive.","Matt Gingrich","Okay. Thanks guys.","Frank Sklarsky","Thank you, Matt.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna. Please proceed.","Don Carson","I guess a question going into next year, what kind of gross margin momentum you think you have from raws, because obviously in the first half of the year, you are going to have some relatively easy comps. You are still expecting some good gross margin expansion in the first half of the year?","Michael McGarry","Don, I would tell you that we are going to continue to work with our suppliers to pull through the savings. And so I would say it\u2019s going to be modest. Our goal here is to continue to pull those through. We still see weakness in the TiO2 market. We still think it\u2019s oversupplied. And then clearly, we haven\u2019t talked about Henan Billions. Yet surprisingly, we have made it 55 minutes in the call and not one question about it. So I will go ahead and since everybody is interested and tell you that the first set of samples we got from the particle size was too large. The second set of samples we got from them were too small, so now they are dialing it in. We expect to be buying commercial quantities of TiO2 from Henan Billions sometime late in the fourth quarter. So overall, I would tell you we are still feeling like there is more savings to come. Plus, as you know we will have incremental restructuring savings in predominantly Europe but also Brazil and Australia from our restructuring program. That incrementally, throughout the year, will add up to about $60 million to $75 million. Obviously, it accelerates as it goes throughout the year 2016. But that will be another positive.","Don Carson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Don. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Sheehan with SunTrust. Please proceed.","Jim Sheehan","Thank you. Could you talk about your exposure to commercial construction and what you are seeing in both your coatings and your glass businesses in that market?","Michael McGarry","Yes. Commercial construction is obviously more important to our glass business than it is to our coatings business. Commercial construction has been slightly better. What the challenge there is actually the fabricators who make fabricate glass window units are, I would call them full. They are \u2013 their backlog on fabricated units continues to be 6, 8, 10 weeks. So that\u2019s been a challenge for the market. I would tell you that our glass business, as you can see has done pretty well. We have gotten price. We already had two price increases in that business this year. So that\u2019s been a positive. And we continue to expect improvement again next year.","Jim Sheehan","And in EMEA, you had some positive volumes there. I think auto OEM was particularly strong, could you just comment on what your volume growth was in architectural coatings in Europe?","Michael McGarry","Architectural coatings were flat in Europe. And of course that varied. And also up in the UK, up in the Benelux, down in France, mostly up in Eastern Europe but not every Eastern European country was up, so net-net flat because France is our largest architectural coatings market.","Jim Sheehan","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Hocevar with North Coast Research. Please proceed.","Kevin Hocevar","Hi, good afternoon everybody. A question on the \u2013 going back to the cash deployment bumped up to the low end of the range and $2 billion to $2.5 billion and you say at least $2 billion to $2.5 billion, so implying it could go above that. I guess what would it take for you to go above that range would necessitate M&A or if the stock price was attractive enough, would you consider repurchasing above that level?","Frank Sklarsky","As Michael said, the pace of share repurchase, obviously depends upon the not only the pipeline of M&A, but also the timing of which you actually deploy and close the deals. I guess what we are saying is we are confident enough in the cash generating capability of the business and we are very comfortable upping the midpoint of that range so that we are now at $2 billion to $2.5 billion. And the fact that we have already kind of exceeded the pace of the prior range by the end of the third quarter and expect to continue to deploy cash in the fourth quarter. But as we lookout in 2016, we got a good pipeline of M&A. So the chances are we will be doing more deals next year and be supplementing it with share repurchases because we are starting of the year \u2013 we ended the third quarter with $1.4 billion of cash. Q4 is generally a good quarter for cash generation. And so we have the confidence that we will continue to deploy and we would earn value for the shareholders. And we will just continue that into next year and see where it goes. But we could do more share repurchase. Our preference is to do M&A. That will be the first priority. But you will see both of that as we go through the fourth quarter and more primarily, M&A in the 2016 timeframe.","Kevin Hocevar","Okay, great. And just also, you mentioned an expectation to resume organic growth in the fourth quarter and FX impacts to mitigate a little bit. And also you closed LJF after the end of the second quarter. So do you think that the top line decline that we saw in the third quarter is kind of it will stop there and will resume top line growth in the fourth quarter?","Michael McGarry","Yes. Kevin, I do believe that\u2019s going to happen. We closed LJF on October 1. We had four acquisitions that basically closed in the third quarter plus we will have Comex that flips into the organic side. So I think that\u2019s all positive.","Kevin Hocevar","Okay, good. Thanks guys.","Frank Sklarsky","Thank you, Kevin.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Dmitry Silverstein with Longbow Research. Please proceed.","Dmitry Silverstein","Good afternoon. Thanks for fitting me in here. A couple of questions, a lot of them have already been addressed. But I just want to understand on the China impact from the automotive, how \u2013 like how long do you typically read the sales number in China. In other words, we are seeing sales decline in the Chinese auto, I am assuming production is declining this quarter to adjust for that. So the fact that you didn\u2019t see much of a decline in the third quarter, is that just a delay and you will see some of it in the fourth or are you more real time with the sales number at the retail level?","Michael McGarry","Well, Dmitry the sales to the customer decline in June, July, August and then turned back positive in December. They were up 3%. Builds inventories were coming down in that same period. Right now, inventory is basically at the same level it was last year. So they are in very good shape from that standpoint. We think they are about a little bit over 40 days, which is typical for them. And then right now, as I mentioned earlier on the call the October sales are trending up. We basically supply in real time. We get orders, let\u2019s call them 28 days in advance of what I would call a pre-look and then they are firmed up 14 days in advance. So right now, we have a pretty good feel for how October is going to turn out. And I think overall, we would tell you that it should be marginally up.","Dmitry Silverstein","Got it. So would you describe in terms of your sales cadence in June, July, August and September was pretty much what we saw at a retail level in China. So is that just coincidence or are you \u2013 or is there is no lag between demand for your coating products for automotive and the sale of automotive to a retailer?","Frank Sklarsky","No, Dmitry. We are very closely aligned because they did take inventory down. Have they not taken inventory down I think we would see that lag effect, but the industry took inventory down, commensurate with the sales decline in real time.","Dmitry Silverstein","Got it. Okay. So that\u2019s good to know. Second question on the \u2013 excuse me, on the raw material benefit, you talked about taking six months to nine months to get some of these propylene, ethylene derivatives, which I am assuming you are mainly talking about resins here down in price, it\u2019s been about that long since oil really started to selloff and since propylene and ethylene pricing started to tumble. So are you starting to see lower prices in resins on a year-over-year basis that\u2019s going to help you with the declines in TiO2 to really drive your margins certainly into the first half of next year?","Michael McGarry","Well, as we said, we expected modest benefit with the benefit to grow throughout the year. We are seeing that in our numbers. As we said in the past, the benefit is muted in non-U.S. region simply because oil is traded in dollars around the world. So, when you go to Europe or you go to some of these emerging markets, the currency deltas have eaten into most of the raw material impact. So again, we are pulling this through our value chain. We feel we are doing a good job at it. We do have another quarter here to go and we are certainly talking to our suppliers on a daily basis.","Frank Sklarsky","So, as Vince is saying here, as you see the raw material benefits come through, the pace of that may not change significantly going from Q3 to Q4 to Q1, but it will be more evident to the bottom line, because there will not be so much offset from a currency headwind as that mitigates starting in Q4 versus what we have seen is very high levels recently.","Dmitry Silverstein","Right. So you say you are not so much looking at acceleration of benefits as the diminishment of the headwinds that will make those benefits more apparent?","Michael McGarry","The other thing we would mention though is that where you do see a bit of a headwind on raw materials because of the exchange rate is places like Brazil, really the small percentage of our revenue in Canada, because the exchange does cause some of those U.S. dollar based inputs to be a little bit higher.","Dmitry Silverstein","Okay. And then one final question on pricing, architectural market in North America you talked about pricing being essentially flat and the similar expectations for 2016, which makes sense. In terms of the coatings side of the business as opposed to the architectural side of the business both in North America and globally, which tends to be dealing with customers that are looking for some pass-through of raw material prices. What\u2019s the pricing environment like in some of the general industrial coatings and perhaps some of the automotive aftermarket and some of those areas, let\u2019s say, outside of high-value proposition like automotive OEM coatings? Are you starting to see either lower prices or more customer insistence on price pass-through or are they still happy with getting the product from you at the price they got it last year?","Michael McGarry","Dmitry, I really don\u2019t want to get into parsing each of the different businesses, because we roll out new products and we have older products. What we have been consistent in saying is that the pricing environment is flat and we expect that to continue.","Dmitry Silverstein","Not just in paints, but in coatings as well?","Michael McGarry","Correct.","Dmitry Silverstein","Thank you very much.","Frank Sklarsky","Thanks, Dmitry.","Operator","That concludes questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Vince Morales for closing remarks.","Vince Morales","I just want to once again thank everybody for their time and interest in PPG. Both Scott Minder and myself will be available to take questions after the call. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.

We appreciate your interest in PPG Industries and welcome you to this teleconference to review PPG's first quarter 2016 financial results.","Joining me on the call from PPG are Michael McGarry, President and Chief Executive Officer; Frank Sklarsky, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Vince Morales, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer.","Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, April 21, 2016. I will remind everyone that we posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the Investor Center of our website, ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the opening comments Michael will make momentarily.

McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. Today, we reported first quarter 2016 financial results. We achieved first quarter net sales of $3.7 billion and record adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.31. Overall, we continue to deliver strong financial results as evidenced by our adjusted earnings per diluted share growth in the quarter, which increased 11% versus the record established in the prior year. We achieved these results despite ongoing unfavorable foreign currency translation and continued uneven global economic and market conditions.","Several factors contributed to the record first quarter results, including earnings leverage on our organic sales volume growth, our continued heritage of cost management, and acquisition-related sales and income. Additionally, we've continued to utilize our strong balance sheet, deliver shareholder value, including first quarter 2016 share repurchases, totaling $150 million. For the quarter, our average diluted shares outstanding, declined by 2% year-over-year. Our strong quarterly results, were aided by our own operational and strategic actions, including aggressive efforts to drive higher organic growth, despite a mixed economic environment.","We continue to accelerate our work on developing and commercializing new customer-driven technologies. Basically, packaging coatings' ongoing customer adoption of our new can coating technologies, along with certain key technology adoptions in our protective coatings business.","In addition, we are continuing the rollout of our enhanced customer branding initiatives. As you would expect from PPG, we continue to maintain our discipline over costs, including finalizing the remaining actions from our previously announced business restructuring program.","Now, I will discuss some specific business trends for the first quarter. Our net sales in local currencies increased about 4%, while reported net sales were consistent with the prior year. Local currency net sales growth was driven by acquisition-related sales of about 3% and sales volume growth of 1%. These gains were offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 4% or about $140 million, in the first quarter.","Our first quarter sales volumes increased 1% consistent with the prior year's growth rate, reflecting a continuation of modest global economic trends, led by broadening European demand growth. Sales volumes grew in emerging regions by 1%. Continued growth in Asia Pacific, including China, was partially offset by persistent market weakness in South America.","Most of our business units, experienced higher sales volumes in Asia, led by increased market demand for PPG's new technologies in our packaging and automotive refinish coatings businesses, along with growth in protective coatings. Automotive, OEM sales volumes in Asia, were tempered primarily, due to a strong prior-year comparable period, where PPG experienced above market double-digit percentage volume increases. We expect second quarter emerging regions sales volumes growth rates to improve supported by increases in most businesses in Asia and modest overall improvements in Latin America.","Volumes in the U.S. and Canada region were slightly higher versus prior year and represented sequential improvements compared to the prior two quarters. Regional demand trends continue to be mixed by business in country, with ongoing demand softness in certain markets within Canada. In the region, sales volumes grew in our packaging and automotive refinish coatings business along modest growth in our architectural coatings business.","Aerospace sales volumes declined primarily due to lower commercial demand and continued customer inventory management actions. Looking ahead, we anticipate further incremental improvements in regional growth rates in the second quarter, building upon the month of March which had the strongest sales volume growth within the quarter.","Regionally, our highest first quarter sales volume growth rate was in Europe, Middle East and Africa, which delivered over 3% growth. We continue to experience a broadening improvement in Europe demand with our fifth consecutive quarter of improving growth rates. PPG's volume growth rates were positive across Western Europe with most countries improving year-over-year. Despite overall growth, this quarter, regional demand levels remain uneven.","Improved performance in our architectural coatings EMEA business added to continued strong performance in our packaging and automotive OEM coatings business in the region, primarily due to continued customer adoption of PPG's market-leading technologies and related world-class product, service and support. Architectural growth was led by gains in the UK and Benelux countries with the year-over-year growth trends.","We remain optimistic for future economic driven demand expansion in the EMEA region. Despite recent improvements, regional demand remains well below pre-recession levels and we continue to see signs of ongoing modest improvements in various economic subsector. During the past several years, we've completed significant actions to reduce our overall regional cost structure. Similar to our experience to past several quarters, we expect strong income leverage on any incremental sales volume growth.","I would like to provide a quick update on foreign currency translation. As I mentioned earlier, during the quarter, unfavorable foreign currency translation, lowered sales by approximately $140 million and pre-tax income by about $50 million. This was primarily related to the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar, but included other currencies as well such as the euro.","Based on current exchange rates, we anticipate full-year unfavorable foreign currency translation to lower net sales by $200 million to $260 million and income by $30 million to $40 million. This is a decrease from the figures that we provided during our fourth quarter 2015 earnings call in January. This change reflects the strengthening of several foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar during the first quarter.","Shifting to earnings, year-over-year adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 11% to a new first quarter record of $1.31 including unfavorable foreign currency translation. This marks the 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit percentage earnings for diluted share growth, and was achieved despite record performance in the first quarter of 2015. This trend has strong increases in quarterly earnings per diluted share, as a reflection on the success of our business portfolio transformation actions taken over the past several years, including the successful integration and synergy achievement at several major acquisitions.","For the quarter, performance coatings segment sales declined by 1% and segment income was up more than 6%. Contributing to the results were higher acquisition-related sales and income, primarily from Le Joint Fran\u00e7ais and Cuming Microwave, strong income leverage on higher sales volumes, and benefits from business restructuring, partly offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation.","Segment income included approximately $15 million of incremental growth-related spending in architectural U.S. and Canada. I am pleased to report that we are currently launching several new products within many of our domestic, national account partner store networks. These launches include new premium products at some national accounts, as well as improved product formulation and differentiated product label.","Industrial Coatings segment sales were up 2%, and segment earnings increased 9%. Earnings leverage from organic sales volume growth, acquisition-related sales and income, along with disciplined cost management were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation. Acquisition-related growth was primarily from the REVOCOAT and IVC Industrial businesses acquired in 2015. These businesses are continuing to deliver strong financial results. They provide an excellent platform for future global business growth.","Glass segment sales declined 2%, and earnings declined by 7% versus the prior year. Higher selling prices and cost management actions were offset by lower sales volumes, $8 million in repair-related expenses due to a planned facility outage and lower equity earnings. Despite the lower sales volumes, underlying flat glass demand remained solid.","Additional segments and regional details can be found in the presentation materials.","Overall, our business performed well in the first quarter as we continue to manage against a mixed global economic backdrop. We continue to focus on our efforts on improving organic growth rates through enhanced product innovation, customer branding strategies. We remain diligent over our costs and are in pace to achieve the previously announced savings from our ongoing business restructuring program.","Finally, our balance sheet remained strong and we are committed to deploying between $2 billion and $2.5 billion of cash in the years 2015 and 2016 combined on acquisitions and share repurchase. In the first quarter, we repurchased $150 million of our stock bringing the total to $900 million for the two-year period to-date. Coupled with the approximately $400 million paid for acquisitions in 2015, PPG has deployed about $1.3 billion on earnings accretive actions against this target to-date. We have a strong global pipeline of acquisition candidates from various end-user markets.","In addition to share repurchases and acquisitions, PPG remains committed to sustainable dividend increases as part of our capital allocation strategy. Today, our board of directors approved a dividend increase of $0.04 per share, bringing the quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share. This represents an 11% increase versus the prior quarterly dividend. Our last quarterly dividend increase was 7% in the second quarter of 2015.","As you can see by our actions and continued strong financial results, we remain focused on driving additional growth, aimed at creating shareholder value.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG.","And now, Andrew, would you please open the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo. Please, go ahead.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Michael, I was intrigued by your comment about March being the best volume month of the three in Q1. Can you give us an idea as to, where that was and what does that suggest for Q2 and beyond? Are we looking at PPG getting higher than a 1% of volume growth in 2016?","Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, Frank, let's start with the obvious question. We're certainly not happy with the 1% growth, but we are in the very early stages of our growth programs, so the BPA-NI for packaging coatings \u2013 sure, we'll get questions on that, but that's progressing well. The OEM compact process continues to do well, refinish, waterborne. So I'd say that's the first commentary.","The second one, which is March. March, we had a nice start to the paint season. Clearly, we're anticipating that this is going to be a better paint season than we had last year. So that was a manifestation of that. Also, you had the uneven and uncertain return from the Chinese New Year, people were worried about that. So we were \u2013 and we tried to tell you that we had a good order book coming into the Chinese New Year at our last call. We did see that coming out of Chinese New Year, so we did see good growth there. And I think the other one is the broadening of the growth rate in Europe, that was a nice win there as well.","So altogether, I would say that we were closer to 2% to 3% growth in March versus the 1% that we reported in the overall quarter.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. All right. And as I look at slide nine, in the auto forecast now, obviously we've been spoiled in expecting PPG to outpace the overall industry and in Q1, I guess partly due to a difficult comp, the company matched the overall industry other than exceeded the overall industry. But as I look at that chart, it looks like Q2 China, you are going to see a material ramp up in activity, am I reading this correctly?","Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think the way I would think about this Frank is, we've always said that, we were not always going to outperform the industry at some point, we would have some reversion (17:13). If you remember last year, first quarter of 2015, we were up 9% and Asia was up much higher than that. So when I look at our automotive performance, we had two regions that outperformed, one region that underperformed and one region was at parity. So we were essentially at the 1.7% growth rate for the industry.","So I would say, when I think back about the four years of consecutive outperformance, if our team took a one quarter pause, not happy but obviously in the grand scheme of things, we will continue to perform very well in the automotive business and I would expect that we're going to continue to see growth. In Europe, registrations were up 5%. So I would expect European builds to continue. Asia builds, India is really doing well. I'm not going to call the bottom in Brazil, because I don't where that is. But certainly, I think overall, we're pleased with the performance.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right, that's very helpful. Thank you.","Scott Minder - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Frank.","Operator","The next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi, good afternoon. It's actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. How are you doing?","Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good. How are you?","Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good. Can you talk about pricing in auto OEM market globally? Are you seeing any price concessions, given a decline in raws and the bargaining power of customers in that business? And then just more broadly, how should we think about pricing for the company as a whole in 2016?","Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, let's talk about pricing in general. At the end of the day, we have consistently been able to price in this environment. Last year, we had marginally positive price in an obviously very challenging environment. We have forecasted marginally \u2013 flat to marginally up again this year.","The automotive segment, it's not really a fair thing to look at it, on a piece-by-piece basis, because most of what we have is new product technologies, so it's hard to compare the new technology versus the old. So overall, we have very sophisticated automotive customers, they expect fair pricing. We have new technology, we expect to be paid appropriately for our new technology and I would say both parties are very happy with the price and value and performance of the new products in the marketplace.","Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. And then, for my next question, can you parse out growth in the various channels in North America piece during the quarter, so I guess company-owned stores, national account, independents in Canada? And how is kind of your performance compared to the market?","Scott Minder - Director-Investor Relations","Just we were having little difficulty hearing you, let me repeat the question. I think you asked if we could parse out the different volume growth by U.S. architectural channel, is that correct?","Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes, exactly.","Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So U.S. architectural channel. So overall, we had the low- to mid-single digits in that channel, it depends by region. So obviously the one that continues to go backwards and no surprise is that dealer, independent dealers channel, that's an area where that is a shrinking environment, you have the small owners of hardware stores and paint shops over time losing share to the big boxes and to the company-owned stores. So no change in that environment.","I don't want to comment per se on how our retail customers are doing. I think it's up to them to comment on how the retail customers are doing. What I will tell you is that we had new product launches with Diamond in the Glidden brand in Home Depot. The early signs \u2013 it's just now getting into market. The early signs are very positive. We have a super premium price point. Our Paramount in Menards also off to a good start, Glidden Complete at Walmart.","So I think when we look at it from our perspective and I certainly have to let our customers talk about it from their perspective, but we're pleased with what we're seeing. The company-owned stores varies by region and varies \u2013 whether it's U.S. and Canada, but clearly there is an opportunity for us to continue to deliver more growth going forward.","Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. And just one last one. Can you give us some more details on the weakness in aerospace, is it just small plains, large plains or both, and kind of what gives you confidence on an improvement in 2Q?","Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure. So when you think about the aerospace business, you have to \u2013 there are several things to think about. So one of them is, year ago, customers were having significant launch programs, and as they ramped up, the last thing they want to do is stop their line with lack of products and so they intended to over-inventory. Now they are more at a steady state rate and so there, it allows them to have more confidence in their build rate and their usage rate.","So that's a short-term hurdle. You do have some underlying softness though, if you take the oil and gas market, they fly a lot of helicopters, so obviously, they're flying less helicopters in this kind of environment, so you have less aftermarket sales and you have less new helicopters builds, so that would be one. And then, generally the Asian, there is a lot of churn in the water as you can sell with one of our customers in Canada. So there is some things going on up there. So I think overall, we're on a short-term one quarter, two quarter bump in the road, but I anticipate the second half of the year for aerospace to be much better.","I would point out that the acquisitions that we made, the two aerospace acquisitions we made are performing very well and their growth rate is above the growth rate of the overall business so the outlook, I would say, is solid.","Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you very much.","Scott Minder - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Christopher Parkinson of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. Thank you very much. Can you just walk through a little more detail on what you're seeing in the Mexican market in Comex. And potentially just parse out architectural and stores versus industrial, energy, government spending and just overall just what assumptions are going into your double Mexican GDP growth assumption? Thank you.","Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure. We'll start with first quarter of last year, we were up 10%-plus in Mexico and this year, we were up \u2013 our sales were up 5% in Mexico, the GDP in Mexico is 2.2%. Our growth is being driven by several factors. The first one is the new store growth rate. Last year, we added 170 stores in Mexico, we're over 4,000 stores. We're now today as we speak, over 4,100 stores, and we will add another 170 stores there.","So we've been gaining a lot of share in Mexico. The Comex team, when we bought them, had a very large concentration of their market share in what I would call, Central Mexico. They were underrepresented in Southern Mexico and underrepresented in Northern Mexico. But we have a U.S. retail partner that has stores in Mexico.","So we recently introduced a store-in-store concept down there, that's allowing them to gain share as well. So from the store side, it's about service and product availability, and that's doing very well. Certainly, government spending has softened and a lot of that is related to projects. The government is trying to reduce spending, given the price of oil.","But there are elections coming up, so I would tell you that we're going to wait and see how it plays out. But historically, in Mexico, when they have elections, the local politicians try to spruce things up to make things look a little bit better. And obviously, if they do that, we'd be very happy to participate as we have a very significant share in Mexico.","Vincent J. Morales - Vice President-Investor Relations and Treasurer","If I could add one time item, Chris this is Vince. One of the synergies we've earmarked when we did the acquisition was revenue synergy, that's what we added subsequent to the acquisition. And we are doing very well on our protective coating sales into Mexico, which was one of the synergies we targeted, so that is another adder to the growth rate.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's very helpful. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up. You obviously already had a few shipments from Billions. Can you just give us a quick update on the agreement, ramp-up outlook, et cetera going forward, and just generally how do you feel about its prospects versus let's say maybe a year ago. Thank you.","Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I would tell you that we have tripled our purchases from Billions in Q1 versus 4Q, but we're not satisfied with the build rate, if you will. We think they can deliver more. Obviously they are successful in selling other places besides PPG. But overall, the product quality continues to get better to consistency, it's better and we are using it. We recently started to bring it into other regions besides U.S. and Central America and Latin America.","So the usage broadens obviously; we started in Asia. But I would tell you, overall, we've been pleased but we've certainly challenged the Henan Billions group to continue to work harder to bring the \u2013 its production rate up to a higher level.","Vincent J. Morales - Vice President-Investor Relations and Treasurer","Their production rate has ramped significantly over the last six months. They are running very good yields and they just need to ramp-up their pace a bit more.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Hey, Mike. How do you expect the recent rise in oil prices to impact PPG? And when will begin to impact PPG?","Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","David, I would first start by saying, as you know, we always tell you that we pull raw materials six to nine months in Texas, six to nine months and pull it through. So we're still pulling through the lower prices that we saw in 3Q, 4Q. So that's, you know, if you're looking for that positive.","Second thing is, you know oil bounced. If you think about where it started Q1 and where it finished Q1, it kind of bounced down, it came back a little bit. But I'd say overall, it's too early to see where that's going. I mean there is a lot of uncertainty in the markets. Obviously, we're not oil traders, but you can read the same thing if we read as far as oil. So we're not displeased with where we are and pulling through the raw materials savings (28:28).","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And, Mike, overall, do you think your margins are near peak or can they go higher with operating leverage offsetting maybe a little bit about \u2013 a little bit of cost inflation here?","Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we're certainly not at peak. Don't forget, we still have the savings for Europe, we said for the full year. I think it was $70 million that we're going to pull through in Europe. So that's one. Two, you have significant earnings leverage. When we get volume recovery in Europe, obviously you saw the margins expansion in this quarter, that was driven by several things and leverage from Europe, restructuring savings, acquisition synergies, some modest raw material benefits. But overall, I still think, we can do better and certainly our team thinks, we can do better.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, David.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Koort of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Michael, how do you discern if the aerospace customers' inventory adjustments versus demand adjustments.","Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well one thing we do is we have a significant insight, because of our share with some of these customers, so we are able to \u2013 I don't want to call it vendor managed inventory, but we have significant insight into what they're stocking. The growth rate for the large, if you take Boeing and Airbus and obviously, they have big backlogs, but their build rate is flat to marginally down. And that is obviously, when you think about their inability to get production rates up, it's frustrating for us. I can't imagine, how frustrating it must be internally for them. But that's the two ways, we look at that, Bob.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And can you talk about variation in price across the portfolio? I assume there are puts are takes, but are there any particular areas outside of non-BPA, the BPA-NI, where there has been price improvement?","Vincent J. Morales - Vice President-Investor Relations and Treasurer","Bob, we have pluses and minuses as you noted throughout the portfolio, but there is no outliers on either side.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And last one very quickly, can we assume the same target level of acquisitions in 2016 that you completed last year? Thanks.","Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think that's a reasonable expectation. As we've always said, it's impossible to predict large ones. We have a pipeline that looks very similar to the pipeline we had last year. We had seven deals that had about $400 million in sales. I would expect to see a similar level of activity this year. And I think, you'll have \u2013 you'll see that as we go through the year.","Bob? Andrew?","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All set. Thank you.","Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thanks. The next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good afternoon.","Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. What are the net cash outflows from asbestos this year? And do you still think you'll settle your asbestos liabilities?","Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. This is Frank, Jeff. We do expect we're going to settle up in the first half of the year, before the end of the first half of the year. And consistent with what we've said in the past and what you'll see when we file our Q or when we lay that out, we've got about $0.5 billion of cash going out initially, plus the option to payout an additional amount of cash, which represents the present value of the future obligations, discounted at 5.5%, will obviously evaluate economic conditions at that time to determine whether we take advantage of that discount that could potentially be attractive for us to do so.","So the growth being something over $800 million, but then almost immediately, we will start on a quarterly basis via adjusting our estimated taxes and we'll over the ensuing few quarters achieve a benefit that will bring the net cash outflow in total for about $0.5 billion. That would assume, if you were to assume that we took advantage of the discounted annuity. So that would be the way we'd look at it. And of course we also have the donating of the PPG stock to the trust in addition to that.","Vincent J. Morales - Vice President-Investor Relations and Treasurer","And Jeff, we have that stock hedged at about $22","Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's right.","Vincent J. Morales - Vice President-Investor Relations and Treasurer","So if you do the math, it's about 2.8 million shares, so you're looking at somewhere in $50 million range. That stock is in our share count already, it will remain in our share count going forward.","Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","But that $50 million is included in the amounts that I gave you.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And for my follow-up, your gross margin last year expanded a 110 basis points and this quarter, it expanded 160 basis points, even though you had no sales growth. But last year, your currency effects were negative 7% each quarter and this quarter, maybe it was a little less than negative 4%. Is there a link between the smaller currency pressure and the widening of the gross margin or are they not linked? And if they are not linked, why did your gross margin qualitatively advance versus what you were achieving last year?","Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. This is a good observation. Despite the fact that we still \u2013 even though the currency headwind was a little bit lower than we expected, it was still a headwind in Q1 versus prior year. I think there is a combination of factors. One, we did get some benefit, additional benefit this year from restructuring that would not have taken place in the last year's first quarter, because the restructuring program was really just getting underway at that point in the first half of the year. So there is that piece of it.","We had some manufacturing productivity. We've moved more aggressively, obviously, particularly, in Europe and are rationalizing and moving against a more shared service environment from the administrative side. Acquisitions with a nice pass-through of the margins from those acquisitions was also an uplift, as those acquisitions provided us a margin, a little bit above the corporate average. So the combination of factors, plus, admittedly as we had said before, a modest amount of raw materials savings in the first half of this year, continuing what we saw in the back half of last year, all that contributed to the 110 basis points.","Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","160 basis points.","Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","160 basis points year-over-year.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. But did the change, did the smaller currency headwind benefit your gross margin?","Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I would tell you, on a relative base value, it was still a headwind. And so from an absolute standpoint, I guess, the answer would be no. And even when you go back to last year's first quarter, that the headwind wasn't materially different than it was in this year's first quarter, even though this year's first quarter was a little less than we might have expected.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jeff.","Operator","The next question comes from Duffy Fischer of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good afternoon, fellows.","Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Duffy.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","The question is just around Europe. I'm seeing some recovery there. Could you kind of tease out where you're seeing that recovery? And then in architectural in Europe, are you growing with the market or faster than the market over there?","Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, let's take it by country, Duffy, just to add a little more color to it. So starting with the UK, Ireland, it is growing faster than the company average and taking share clearly. Then, you take France, growing lower than the company average but taking share, then you take Central Europe, I would say slightly below the company average maintaining share. Okay, that's kind of the architectural landscape, if you will.","But then, when you get into our other businesses, we have a broadening recovery. So Southern Europe, Spain, Italy, for example, significantly accelerating growth quarter-over-quarter at all our businesses, and that's a benefit. We don't have architectural \u2013 we do have a little bit in Spain, but very little. We have a little bit in Italy, but grand scheme of things pretty small. So overall Spain, and Southern Italy and Southern Europe is doing very well, and that's a net positive for us.","The offset to that of course is Russia. Although I will tell you that we're outperforming in Russia, especially in our industrial business. They've done a really good job. There they're trying to get more localization and so that has benefited us.","On the Middle East, the Middle East I would say slightly better than the company average and that encompasses all our business. And I'd say, our protective business is probably one of the ones that are doing pretty well in the Middle East.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great.","Vincent J. Morales - Vice President-Investor Relations and Treasurer","Duffy, there is a slide in our presentation deck, that shows the region. It's a heat map that shows the region by country year-over-year.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, fair enough. And then just on BPA, you've been taking some nice market share there. How long should we think about that trend lasting? Is that something that's got another four quarters or five quarters, or might it have another eight quarters to ten quarters?","Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I would look at it just like I look at automotive. We had four years of automotive outperformance. This is the technology that we're leading in. There has been two plants converted in France. We have the vast majority of that business.","Now with the Proposition 65 in California, there have been six plants converted in the U.S. and I would call our share at five-plus out of those six. And so you still have the whole wave with the rest of the U.S. to come. The food guys just starting to convert probably the third quarter of last year, so you still have that coming on. So I think net-net, this is a long-term structural gain. I mean, we use to have only 3% share inside the can. You would think over time, we would approach 25% or 30% share at a minimum. I'd certainly have challenged the team to be better than that, but I would tell you this is a secular change. These guys take \u2013 they don't change for 30 years and then when they do change, it happens over time and we should expect to see this ramp up over the next several years.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks, fellows.","Scott Minder - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Wanted to revisit the M&A conversation. And I guess my thought is that there obviously was a large transaction announced between two of your larger peers and the byproduct of that is that they are no longer competing with you for any M&A assets that there might be out there. So I'm just wondering if a dialog between yourself and those on that target list of yours is accelerating or changing in any way. And has there been any impact on the discussions from the transaction multiple that was recently put up on the board?","Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think you have to evaluate these independently. The transaction multiple that was announced in the first quarter was a unique property and came with a unique price and we certainly \u2013 if anybody tried to argue for that price for PPG to pay, that will be a very short discussion. So we'll start there.","The second thing I would say is, perhaps they could be out of the market for some period of time, but you know what, they have cash that is easy to get and we're not going to assume that this is an open runway for us. We're going to look at what our competition is. We have multiple people that are competing with these properties. And so we will continue to evaluate that. But the bottom-line is we have not seen any increase in the number of people coming to us.","I would tell you that overall, our mantra remains the same, that we are very disciplined buyers, and that business teams have to make a justification, and the synergies have to be there. And that's the focus anytime we look at any acquisition.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very clear. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes, thank you. Just a question on your architectural growth in the U.S. and Canada. So you talked about low- to mid-single digit growth. Do you think you're underperforming the market there? How would you characterize the overall market growth? And what kind of a sort of snapback you see this quarter and into third quarter based on the weather?","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, Don. This is Vince. Little bit of an early read to paint these and then we don't enough data points yet to determine, by channel, how we're performing versus some of the other folks and March is a little bit of a \u2013 typically a murky month. We feel that, in the \u2013 as Michael mentioned, we've had new products in some of the major home centers and we feel those products are good new products, with good new branding. The independent dealer channel is a shrinking channel. We certainly feel we're holding around there. And as Michael mentioned at the beginning, we've got to do better in our U.S. company-owned stores. And in Canada, we think we're at parity at minimum. So \u2013 but a little too early to paint these and to call it one way or the other.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And then, just to follow-up on your channel strategy, you've talked about investing in branding. Is this designed more for your company-owned stores? And what kind of investments should we expect in your company-owned stores going forward? Are you looking to open a certain number every year, to sort of get that mix up above 50% of your overall architectural sales volume in U.S. and Canada?","Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So when you think about the $15 million investment that we made, that is \u2013 was a first quarter investment, that's a non-recurring investment. We do have enhanced brand strategies that we're rolling out, but that's incorporated where we might be replacing dollar one with \u2013 or category A with category B, so there is no real step change there.","We do open up, we expect to open up, we typically say 25 stores, 50 stores in the U.S. and Canada, but we will be opening up 200 stores in Mexico \u2013 170 stores to 200 stores. We will be opening up stores in Europe as well, so that will also be in that 20 stores to 25 stores range. And so we continued to evaluate opportunities to grow this business, but I'd say overall, I'm pleased with the performance there.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Please go ahead.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Michael, I want to go back to the refinish business. What kind of growth are you seeing there? And can you break it down between price and volume? And then, are MSOs getting bigger and bigger volume discounts?","Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","Let's start with the easy one, the MSOs, it's been relatively constant. They'd like to have bigger, but everybody, every customer we have wants a bigger discount, but it's been relatively flat.","When we think about our refinish business, it's not just the U.S., it's where \u2013 when we look at China, that is especially a good market for us, so they are shifting from solvents to water, there is a big tax in China on solid-based products. So that's a positive for us. Historically, we do have positive price in our refinish business. You would expect that this year we have a positive price as well. Interestingly enough, volume in the U.S. is actually up. That has \u2013 miles driven is up 2%. Not only do you have miles driven up, but you have distracted driving up immensely. I'd see it about everyday on my way home. So that's a positive.","The other thing is, when you look at what's happening with technology, our water-based product is outperforming in every region in the world. So even in Argentina, right now, our business is growing in Argentina. We're \u2013 one of our competitors vacated Brazil, we picked up a huge chuck of that business. One of our other competitors vacated Europe. We picked up the vast majority of that business.","So we continue to perform in that regard. So when I think about one of the shining stars in PPG, refinish is at the top of the list.","Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And P.J., just add to what Michael said. This is Frank. Remember we sold it in the past. With our strong position over in Asia, particularly in China and the move from premium to the mid-line offerings, we have an opportunity to really grow that business over the long-term, because there is production, over 20 million units, goes mostly still to that market. That car park continues to grow, whereas in the developed regions, where we also have solid positions. The car park is relatively steady, so you are depending upon miles driven, distracted driving and things like that, but China has the additional benefit of adding a lot of units to the car park and so those growth rates, over the long-term, bode well for the business overall.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you. And secondly, did the introduction of HGTV at Lowe's, have any impact on our sales at Lowe's? Thank you.","Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think, the way to think about that P.J. is, which price points do we compete in and so, I think the way we looked at it is, our total sales through our retail partner were up year-over-year 2015 versus 2014. And I'm not unhappy with the first quarter performance and our relationship is very strong and so, I would tell you, that is obviously a retail decision on how they split their brands and how they position them. But overall, we're happy with that relationship with Lowe's.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from John Roberts of UBS. Please go ahead.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Afternoon.","Scott Minder - Director-Investor Relations","Hello, John.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","With a coming consolidation in the number of suppliers into the DIY retail channel, you think we should expect some rebalancing among customers, some churn to see share go up and down more than we have in the past, for example? And if there is a divestment, let's say, out of the Sherwin-Williams Valspar business, do you think we might end up with a new competitor in this space here that you might have to worry about?","Vincent J. Morales - Vice President-Investor Relations and Treasurer","Well, John, we don't speak for our customers, as Michael said earlier, their sourcing decisions are typically theirs. I think we've got, as exhibited by the new products we're placing into the channel, and you're talking about the share, we always have good relationship with those customers, but we're not at liberty to make sourcing decisions for them.","With respect to the acquisition of Sherwin and Valspar, we're not sure what the outcome of that will be, so that's not within our jurisdiction or our decision tree, so we'll leave it to the parties to be.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from James Sheehan of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk about your expectations per TiO2 prices? Looks like they maybe going up a little bit here in the short-term, what's your outlook for the rest of the year on TiO2?","Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","James, TiO2, we've always said is a supply\/demand-driven environment. When I think about what's going on in the overall global supply\/demand environment, you have additional capacity in China, you're soon to have additional capacity in Mexico. So from that regard that's obviously more supply.","Demand, if you look at Europe, European TiO2 consumption is down about 15% from its peak. So net-net, even though Europe volumes are recovering a little bit, they're still substantially down from where they were. Then, of course, you had the material weakness in Brazil, the material weakness in all of Latin \u2013 most of Latin America, Russia. And so from a supply\/demand standpoint, I think \u2013 we still see it as a balanced market. And I know they are out there running around with price increases announced, but if you remember, they've had price increase announcements for several quarters out of the past two or three years and that's just because they announced doesn't mean that we're paying.","So, overall, \u2013 our goal as you know, we've taken out of PPG 10% of our TiO2 consumption is down, because of substitution strategy, replacement of alternative products, and also with the bringing in Henan Billions. So I know there is a lot of noise out there, but when we talk to our suppliers, we're trying to get them focused on supply and demand, and that's where we're going to steady on that topic. I know they are looking at \u2013 they're not making any new money, but they didn't write us a check, the last time when they were at the top of the cycle.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. And can you also comment on demand trends that you're seeing in various end-markets in China?","Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure. So obviously automotive was up, everybody see those numbers, so good performance there. Industrial is a mixed bag; depends upon which segment, so anything to do with commodities, is down heavy duty equipment down. Packaging, we're a little disappointed, the packaging output is relatively flat. You know with the consumer-driven economy, we would have thought that would've been up a little bit more. But we are gaining share there with our BPA non-intent product. So we could be doing better.","If you look at refinish, refinish what Frank explained earlier, the car park is growing, when they made the nice move to the premium market we gained. We're now, we're introducing some mid-tier products, so that should be a net positive. It hasn't happened yet. But there is COMAC, which expects to build an airplane at some point in time. They rolled it out the hanger, but they rolled it back in the hanger. So (52:36) saw it they didn't fly. So I don't know when that will start, but obviously we have a lot of content on that plane. So if it does get into production, we will be a net beneficiary of that.","On the protective side, we are doing very well in protective in China. Marine, not bad but, you really have to balance out with the fact that the Korean Marine is just falling off a cliff, in fact two of the three largest Korean shipbuilders did not even get a major order in Q1. So you have to balance what you see in China with the fact that Korea, which is where the big market is, is off. So I guess that would be my kind of around the segment approach there.","Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I just want to reemphasize James that, Michael talked earlier about India. We are seeing very good growth in India across all the markets, in which we participate in. It's a smaller market for us, but an important market, so it is a very good growth trend right now.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey guys, good afternoon. Yeah, I was just \u2013 maybe digging on the volume side a little bit more, the 1% volume growth that you posted across the portfolio, I know you guys weren't satisfied by that. And, maybe, can you help us understand what kind of visibility you have, maybe on a couple of the larger businesses, OEM, refinish, aero and architectural, why that would accelerate as we through the year? And are their specific projects or something else specific to you guys? Thanks.","Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, I'll take a shot at that Arun. If you look at our different businesses, we have a best visibility in both marine new-build and aerospace where we have a very long order cycle, we have fairly concrete order patterns by our customers. In the middle, you would have some industrial customers, automotive customers, where we're seeing, with confidence, will call it a month's worth of orders with fairly good confidence. And then on the other side of the equation would be architectural, including company-owned stores and independent dealers where people are walking in on a daily basis and the order pattern certainly has a cadence to it, but it's not as predictable. So there we have, let's call it a few days worth of visibility. If you aggregate all that, 50%, 60% of our business, we can see out probably several weeks if not a month or longer, and so that's what gives us our ability to forecast for you of what we think.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, thanks. And then also as a follow-up. Just curious, are we still kind of expecting that overall volume growth could approach mid-single digits for the year? And I guess, where would you see the greatest amount of volume growth?","Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, we definitely expect improvement as we go throughout the year. Again, I think in Q1 of this year, we had some very difficult comps in some large businesses. Michael mentioned almost 10% comp we had in automotive in Q1 year-over-year. That starts to wane as we go throughout the year. And again, we had \u2013 as Michael mentioned earlier, we had some easier weather comps in some of our businesses in the U.S. as we come up on Q2 and Q3. So our expectation certainly is to move the needle more positively than we did in Q1.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, and then lastly, if I may, the FX side, I know that you had said that there was still a negative impact in Q1. Would that also wane as we go through the year? And do you expect ultimately to potentially even get a benefit if we stay where we are on the euro?","Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Arun, it's a \u2013 it should. If we stay at current rates across the board, it will definitely wane as we go through the year, so Q2 impact will still be a headwind, but a bit less than Q1, I think stay where they are and will continue to dwindle down as you go through the year.","Positive and negative at some point in time, well, it depends on the mix, because for us last \u2013 the last few quarters, the biggest headwind was the euro with a little bit stronger euro than anticipated, but a little bit weaker peso for instance, because of some of the oil-based factors there as well, some weakness in the Latin America. So that mix has changed. So could one of the currencies turn positive at some point in time? Sure, but overall, if you look at the whole basket, yes, the $140 million on the top-line and $15 million you saw on the bottom-line in the first quarter, that will be a little bit less than the numbers that Michael gave for the year that $200 million and $260 million on the top-line and the $30 million to $40 million at the bottom-line dictate that at current rates things will automatically come down. We will see how that plays out (58:07) throughout the year.","Vincent J. Morales - Vice President-Investor Relations and Treasurer","And I'll remind everybody, the guidance we gave in January was close to $600 million top-line and $15 million \u2013 I'm sorry $70 million, $80 million bottom-line. So there is a significant improvement versus three months ago.","Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Right.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Right. Okay, thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Mike Harrison of Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for sneaking me in.","Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","How are you doing?","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Doing well. I was wondering if you could give us an update on exactly where you are with some of the display resets you're doing at Lowe's, how much of that is complete. And do you have any metrics that you can share with us in terms of the customer response, either at Lowe's or what you're seeing from the actual DIY customers that are going through?","Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I won't talk about specifically Lowe's. I'll talk about the industry in general, when you look at the home centers. The typical way they do the resets is they start in the southern and western states and then work their way north. So you think about that, we're probably less than one-third of the way through it. Typically, they're all done by the end of May.","So that's kind of the cadence that we would be working on. Again, we don't want to talk for our customers, but the early indications that we saw, we were very pleased with the early turnover in the stores. But again, it's a small data set in Q1, because if you think about it, most of that started to getting set mid-March. They only had two weeks in Q1 and then you'll have \u2013 probably half of a quarter \u2013 half to two-thirds of the quarter in the second quarter.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","And the $15 million worth of expense was partially related to that. That spending is complete at this point, correct?","Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","That is complete and it was a one-time spend.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Got it. And then the last question I had is just on the auto refinish business in Latin America. I know that you had been seeing some weakness there, has that started to show any signs of improving or still pretty weak?","Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think, you have to look at it by country, right? So Mexico is still doing well in Mexico. Colombia, I would say more flat-lined. Argentina is getting better, so that was the one positive. And even though Brazil is going down, we're actually going up, because one of our competitors pulled out of Brazil. So that's been a positive from a refinish side.","Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's still...","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right.","Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","...significantly negative overall in Latin America for Q1.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Nils Wallin of CLSA. Please go ahead.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Michael, with the respect to the long-term outlook in the BPA non-intent your four-year, five-year cycle, curious to know how much is sort of beverage can penetration is baked into that. And where you see the bottlers and the can producers, currently in terms of their BPA usage within the can?","Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","I would say this is inning bottom of the first, top of the second inning. So there is a lot of work to be done in this regard. You tend to have one customer on the beverage side as a leader and then most of the other guys tend to be followers.","So we're out in front with the leader in that area. And you have a couple of food guys that are more aggressive, so they've moved at a faster rate than the beverage guys have. And then, I would say that the \u2013 on the beer side, it's even on a slower ramp. So there has been a lot of pack test done, there has been a lot of a taste test done, there has been a lot of work in that area, but as far as actual production, it is way, way early in the game for those guys.","Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And then, Nils, just to piggyback on Michael was saying before too, keep in mind that in businesses where we've typically outperformed in the recent past, we were already starting with a solid market share position, and those businesses were already are kind at a mature level. This has two advantages \u2013 this sector, not only at its infancy in terms of adoption, we're also starting at a point in time, where as Michael said, very low share inside the can, so everything is incremental share across early points of adoption. That's what gives us the confidence that this is a multi-year trend and has a lot of legs to it for some time to come.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks. And then just as a follow-up. The independent network in North American architectural, obviously has been down. Do you have a sense, what, first of all, over the last couple of years, the average rate of decline has been? And do you think it's accelerating\/decelerating? And where does it, sort of bottom-out, or does it just completely disappear?","Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","First, Nils, let me say that this channel has been in a contraction mode for a quite some time. If you look over a longer period time, call it five years or seven years, the contraction has been more modest in the industry as expected. I'd definitely say the last couple of years, that's accelerated somewhat but it's lumpy, so there is not a linear path here. And right now, I think we are probably contracting somewhere between, let's call 1% to 2% per year, over the last couple of years, to the market.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","I mean, where do you expect it to actually to bottom-out? Is it percent of the total market?","Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer","It's a long, long-term play. I mean, obviously as our retail partners get bigger, as the company-owned store networks get bigger, it's more challenge as these people that own these stores, as their children do not want to be in the hardware business or don't want to be in the paint store business, they tend to sell. So, over time, this is just the demographic play that will continue to play out. But you're talking about 30 years, 40 years, 50 years, this isn't something that's going to be gone in three weeks or three years.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Understood. Thanks very much.","Scott Minder - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Good afternoon. Two related questions. First, as you look at your comments around the operating leverage to the recovery in Europe and also opportunities to improve your supply chain and productivity, is there any structural reason why your conversion of sales to free cash flow shouldn't improve on a two-year to three-year kind of base growth (01:05:39)?","Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think it's very good point, Laurence. Not only will we get the operating leverage, but we're also \u2013 have a multi-year for going out and improvement in working capital and that also will help us improve the conversion, cash flow conversion. So we still have the opportunity to improve inventory levels, we're working on a complexity, which will improve days of inventory, still have some room to improve our past due receivables that will help conversion.","The other factor is that we have said in the recent past that our capital spending is more in a peak level now and will decline over the next five years, that will also improve our cash conversion as a percent of net income and as a percent of depreciation. So all those factors considered actually bode well for our cash conversion percentage over the next three years to five years.","Vincent J. Morales - Vice President-Investor Relations and Treasurer","And Laurence, we're still down volume wise in Europe, let's call it mid-teens.","Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Right.","Vincent J. Morales - Vice President-Investor Relations and Treasurer","So there is still a lot of recovery left and I think we'll get back all that as a region, but there is still a lot of recovery left in the region.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","And then when you look at industrial coatings, the value proposition to the customer, the mix that you have in your \u2013 between the what you call, the protecting surfaces as opposed to decorating them or beautifying them. Do you have the right balance or is that balance going to shift over time and does that shift, if there is one, have any implication for either margins or sales growth?","Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think, Laurence, we do both. I think the coatings industry not only PPG, but we protect and beautify. So it's a dual purpose that the coating provides, so I don't think there is a mixed differential. On an automobile, it protects the surface and beautify the vehicle itself. So most of our coatings do both.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And the last question today, due to time constraints, will come from Ivan Marcuse of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Just a couple of quick questions. The first one was onto Laurence's question. What is your goal for working capital as a percentage of sales, it continues to improve. What do you think you could get to (01:07:53)?","Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, it's going to vary by business. The businesses some of which are largely transactional and require very, very quick response to customers are actually going to carry something in more than high-single digits. If you run the numbers based on our inventories right now, you can say we're around 80 days of inventory, if you run it off the financial statements.","We think that there was a good five to seven days \u2013 five of 10 days of inventory opportunity there. We picked up five days last year. There are still several more days hit (01:08:21) to our benchmark. We're looking at a 100 basis points a year, generally to improve working capital. Combination of payables remain a lot of progress recently, inventories, past due receivables, so. And keep in mind, that every day of inventory and payables is worth $25 million, everyday of receivables is worth $43 million. There is a lot of leverage on cash flow by improving it just a little bit.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. And then my last question is, you mentioned that March is your strongest month with 2% to 3% type of volume growth. Did Easter have a sort of impact on March, I know that from April to March or is that sort of a negligible type of a event for your business?","Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","For most of our businesses, Ivan, our B2B businesses specifically, it has a negligible or no impact. Most of our B2B businesses run 24x7. Easter did move into Q1 this year, it was in Q2 last year. It might have had a small crimp impact on some of our B2C businesses, again not, what I would call noticeable in the numbers.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Scott Minder for any closing remarks.","Scott Minder - Director-Investor Relations","Once again, I'd like to thank everyone for their time and interest in PPG.

We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our third quarter 2018 financial results conference call.","Joining me on the call from PPG are, Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, October 18, 2018. I will remind everyone that we have posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the Investors center of our website, ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the opening comments Michael will make shortly. Following Michael's perspective on the company's results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&A session.","Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the company's current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance.

For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC.","Before introducing Michael, I would like to remind everyone that on October 8, PPG issued an update on third quarter financial results and guidance on fourth quarter earnings. Today we are confirming the fourth quarter guidance we provided on October 8.","Now, let me introduce PPG Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.","Michael McGarry","Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported third quarter 2018 financial results. For the third quarter our net sales were approximately $3.8 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.45. ","As we detailed in our preannouncement, we experienced increase raw material and logistic cost inflation in the quarter, with the third quarter representing the highest level of cost inflation since the trend began two years ago. ","We did not meet our elevated expectations for year-over-year performance. However we\u2019ve made significant progress on increasing selling prices, have continued to aggressively manage our costs and have continued with capital deployment.","For the third quarter our sales in local currencies increased by more than 3%. Reporting the higher local currency sales were selling price increase of more than 2% in the third quarter, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of improvement over the prior sequential quarter. Our sales volumes were flat in aggregate, but up about 2% excluding the previously communicated customer assortment changes in our U.S. architectural coatings business. ","Foreign currency translation turn to a headwind, compared to third quarter 2017 as the U.S. dollar strengthened during the quarter against several key currencies. Sales were unfavorably impacted by about $80 million from currency translation and pretax income unfavorably impacted by about $15 million. ","Looking at some of the business trends in the quarter, in the Performance Coating segment, aerospace coatings delivered another excellent quarter with more than 10% volume growth, led by above industry performance in the U.S. and Asia-Pacific. Architectural Coatings EMEA our organic sales increased a low single-digit in the quarter driven by higher selling prices. While overall sales volumes in Architectural Coatings Americas and Asia-Pacific decreased, we did continue to achieve high single-digit percentage organic sales growth in the U.S. and Canadian company owned stores.","In addition, we continue to be pleased with the progress achieve to expand PPG\u2019s offering at the Home Depot and we are proud to be named Supplier Partner of the Year at the Home Depot for the launch of the Olympic Stain and Timeless brands. ","Volumes grew at our Mexican PPG Comex business including the benefit of opening additional 40 stores during the quarter. Protective and marine coatings volumes increased with continued strong protected coating sales in Asia. The marine business had modestly higher new build volumes, which came off of a very low base. Automotive refinish coatings organic sales decreased by low single-digit percentage year-over-year trending lower as the quarter progressed. Volumes were impacted by lower demand in the U.S. and Europe, stemming from a change in customer order patterns, as several customers had high inventory levels due to lower end use market demand. ","Collision claims have fallen by 1% this year and the amount of vehicles being totaled instead of being repairs has increased by 1%, which both factors are negatively impacting overall demand. Our automotive refinish team continues to deliver outstanding products and solution to customers and has converted a net 3,000 global body shops to PPG so far in 2018.","Our Industrial Coatings reporting segment delivered solid mid-single digit sales volume growth and progressed selling price investments during the quarter. Volumes in packaging coatings were up mid-single digit percentage as the adoption to our INNOVEL interior can coatings products continued. Selling prices in this business were also achieved. We anticipate growth to moderate as we\u2019ve progressed deeper into the new technology conversion cycle and due to PPG\u2019s strong growth in prior quarters. ","Automotive OEM coatings global sales volumes were flat compared to slightly negative global industry automotive builds. This business outperformed the market in the U.S. with recent market share gains. Sales volumes in China decreased a high single-digit percentage in line with lower industry production in China during the quarter, as lower consumer spending on autos drove sharply lower retail sales.","From a regional perspective volume growth continue to be the highest in the emerging regions. Sales growth in Asia Pacific region was driven by growth in our aerospace, auto refinish and protective coatings businesses. Sales in China grew, but at a lower rate than the second quarter and softened as the third quarter progressed. Sales in India and Southeast Asia, grew at high single-digit percentage. Earnings in Asia Pacific have been below 2017 levels, as the region has been impacted by some of the highest levels of raw material and logistic cost inflation that we have experienced.","Sales grew at mid-single-digit percentage in Latin America, supported by continuing outperformance by businesses in the Industrial Coatings segment and solid auto refinished and architectural coatings sales volumes growth. ","Sales volumes were flat in Europe. Volume growth in the Industrial Coatings segment was offset by lower sales in automotive refinish and architectural coatings EMEA. We anticipate modest volume growth in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis and lower sequentially due to normal seasonal patterns. Sales volumes were lower in the U.S. and Canada in the third quarter as strong sales in the Industrial Coatings segment were more than offset by lower volumes in both the automotive refinish and architectural coatings business.","From an earnings perspective, our third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $1.45, which was lower than the prior year. For the year-to-date through September 2018, adjusted earnings per diluted share are $4.75, which is higher than the prior year 2017 despite the cost pressures we have faced.","Our earnings were impacted by elevated raw material inflation that rose by mid to high-single-digit percentage. Logistics cost increases, which includes the effect from higher costs and availability of transportation inflated nearly 20% compared to the third quarter of 2017.","In the third quarter, we continue to make progress on our selling price initiatives. Price increased by more than 2% on a year-over-year basis as both of our reporting segments realized higher selling prices. We have secured further price increases for the fourth quarter and we'll continue to prioritize collaborating with our customers on further selling pricing initiatives.","In addition to selling price initiatives, we are making good progress implementing our restructuring programs. Our two active programs delivered about $20 million of costs savings in the third quarter. As part of our newer restructuring program, we've already completed the closure of two factories and several distribution warehouses and are in the process of closing another factory and a couple of other warehouses in the U.S. We expect additional savings of more than $20 million in the fourth quarter.","In addition, earnings per share benefitted from an ongoing cash deployment actions. Through the end of September, we have now repurchased about $1.3 billion of PPG stock in 2018. In the quarter, average diluted shares outstanding were 6% lower versus the third quarter of 2017. ","Our adjusted effective tax rate was about 21% in the third quarter, lower than the 24% rate from the third quarter of 2017. The reduction is related to recognizing favorable discrete tax items in the third quarter and the tax reform legislations that was implemented at the start of 2018. We are still anticipating a full year tax rate between 23% and 24%.","As we look ahead, we expect to see greater volatility in global industrial demand, primarily in emerging regions. We anticipate that the year-over-year rate of raw material inflation will moderate due to the spike in inflation rates in the prior year quarter. And logistics costs inflation is expected to remain elevated. The new tariffs are starting to add some modest cost to our raw materials.","We expect currency translation to have an unfavorable impact to our sales in the fourth quarter. Based on current rates, the unfavorable impact is expected to be between $50 million and $60 million in the fourth quarter. Specific to our businesses, overall net sales are expected to be lower sequentially due to normal seasonal patterns.","In the U.S., we expect the economic activity to continue at a similar pace as we have seen in the third quarter of 2018 and that automotive OEM builds will be similar to the fourth quarter of 2017. Automotive refinish sales volumes will continue to be impacted by customer inventory destocking.","In Latin America, we anticipate similar economic expansion as we have experienced in the third quarter of 2018. Growth rates in Asia are expected to be less than they were in the third quarter, with heightened volatility in China. Economic growth in Europe is expected to continue into the fourth quarter at a similar rate that we saw in the third quarter. Favorable end use market trends are expected to continue driven by growth in industrial production, partially offset by subdued architectural and automotive refinish coatings demand.","We will continue to invest in growth initiatives including targeting certain growth spending in the fourth quarter with plans to spend an additional $5 million. We ended the third quarter with about $1.2 billion of cash and short-term investments, which continues to provide us with financial flexibility. We plan to deploy a minimum of $1 billion of cash in the fourth quarter on acquisitions and share repurchases as part of our previously communicated target to deploy a minimum of $3.5 billion in 2017 and 2018 combined.","The acquisition pipeline in the industry remains active. We just announced the agreement to acquire SEM Products, an automotive refinish products manufacturer with the history of attractive margins and will continue to participate in other opportunities in our industry\u2019s consolidation. In addition, we plan to continue to repurchase shares in the fourth quarter.","Finally, we remain well positioned in all coatings end use markets and across all major geographic regions. Our excellent positioning along with our technology advanced products provide to us with ample opportunities to continue to grow and deliver shareholder value.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And now Denise, would you please open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. ","Ghansham Panjabi","Hi, everyone. Maybe just starting off on auto refinish, Michael, you called out decreased collision demand in the U.S. and Europe as one of the factors impacting this business, but from your heat map it looks like you're also below the industry for the third quarter. I guess first off why is that, was the customer mix that impacted the third quarter or was it due to the timeline of your price increases or anything else?","Michael McGarry","Now that -- if you look at the heat map, Ghansham, that's really reflects our sales out to our distributors. It does not reflect their sales out to their body shops. So in reality, if you look at the sellout versus sell in, we\u2019re still doing quite well. That\u2019s why I referenced the fact that we\u2019ve gained 3,000 net body shops. So the difference was, if you remember 2017 in the first half of 2018, we had very strong refinish sales. And many of our refinish distributors anticipate that continued market growth.","And as you\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve had very few natural disasters and we didn\u2019t get the tornadoes and the Hales and all that kind of stuff this year. We also didn\u2019t see the accident rate miles driven, it\u2019s only up 0.3%, so that\u2019s moderated as well. So I think overall, what you\u2019re looking at the heat map is the sell in and sell out is still quite good.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay, thanks for clarifying. And then just for my second question on selling prices, which were up 2.3% during the third quarter. Was that in line with where you thought you would be heading into the third quarter and if not, what sort of held that number back? Thanks so much.","Michael McGarry","No, Ghansham, I\u2019d say it was in line with expectations. We had sales price increases in all of our businesses and improvement in all our businesses, which even includes automotive although, I\u2019m sure someone is going to ask later about automotive. So I would say that still more increases are on the way.","Ghansham Panjabi","Thanks so much. ","Operator","The next question will be from John Roberts of UBS. Please go ahead.","John Roberts","Thanks. Michael, you mentioned raws were up mid-to-high single-digit percent year-over-year in the third quarter. What should we expect for the fourth quarter? So the comps get a little easier, as you mentioned. And then if raws stayed flat at their current level, or oil prices stay flat at their current level and they get pass through, what would you expect for 2019 over 2018?","Michael McGarry","Well, let\u2019s focus on your fourth quarter comment first. I think we said, low to mid-single-digits. So, kind of parse where that number might be. As far as 2019 as you know, it\u2019s very early to start to call 2019. We still don\u2019t know what China\u2019s going to do as far as environmental enforcement like they did last year. We think they\u2019re going to be a little bit more nuanced in how they handle that. ","Last year, they pretty much mirrored by the same marching orders, I think this year they\u2019re probably going to -- for those high performers they\u2019re going to give them more lead life, for the low performers they\u2019ll probably be more aggressive in enforcing the environment regulation.","So I think that\u2019s still to be determined, so I would definitely say though 2019 is going to have less inflation than 2018, but I think it\u2019s too early to give you a number.","John Roberts","And then secondly, could you range the size of the deals that you might have in your pipeline, that\u2019s there, just a number of small things that you\u2019re working on, do you have anything large that we should think about?","Vincent Morales","Hey, John, this is Vince. Again we typically wouldn\u2019t give details around that. I think we\u2019ve said continuously throughout the year and as we\u2019re saying today with our acquisitions of SEM it is a very active pipeline, some of these transactions that we talk to the potential sellers for years if not decades. So it\u2019s active smaller mid-size deals.","John Roberts","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","The next question will be from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David Begleiter ","Thank you. Michael, when would you expect your pricing to fully catch up with raw materials, would be Q1, Q2, or somewhere in between perhaps?","Michael McGarry","I would say the gap is closing. It really depends upon the rate of inflation in the first quarter. But the real thing that we\u2019re telling our customers is don\u2019t forget that we probably got off the starting blocks three or four months later than normal because of some unusual factors in the industry. And so we\u2019re going to have to continue to push increases all through 2019.","David Begleiter ","Very good. And just so we finished, would you expect this inventory adjustment to be done in Q4 or could it leak into Q1 perhaps?","Michael McGarry","Well, the hard part if I answer that question is winter. How much snow are we going to get, what types of weather events. I would say we\u2019re optimistic that the fourth quarter will begin the end of that. But it\u2019s -- I would say it\u2019s -- I am more confident on that than anything, but I would still put a little bit about pencil mark that there is some unknowns out there.","David Begleiter ","Thank you very much. ","Operator","The next question will be from Robert Koort of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","Chris Evans","Hey, good afternoon everyone, this is Chris Evans on for Bob. Earlier you sited about $20 million of restructuring savings in the quarter, can you put this into context for maybe some of the stranded costs you may have incurred as a result of North American product realignments? And also can you give a little more clarity on the cadence of the Home Depot load-in and how profitability might be impacted in 2019 net of the losses at lowest?","John Bruno","Hey, Chris this is John. I\u2019ll take a stab at your question about restructuring stranded costs. I would look at it this way, we\u2019re looking to be margin neutral on that business that for our business next year in 2019. So working to take our cost and grow in other areas of that business. So we\u2019re looking to be margin neutral in 2019.","Chris Evans","Okay. And then you recently put out an order OEM price increase announcement, does this represent any change in your behavior with customers in this end market or are you increasing the scale of the price announcements given how inflation is trending.","Michael McGarry","Well, definitely the scale is larger, but what we have remember that we\u2019re further behind price increases in automotive than any other business and we know it and our customers know it. And that\u2019s the most important thing. So we definitely are looking to get more traction on that and the same comment goes for China as well, the hardest place to get prices as we know is automotive in the next hardest is the region. So, this is an area that we\u2019re highly focused on and the good news is we saw some early signs of traction in the third quarter and we expect to get more traction in the fourth quarter.","Chris Evans","Thank you. ","Operator","The next question will be from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Kevin McCarthy","Yes, good afternoon. Michael, you made a comment that you experienced softer sales in China as the quarter progressed, can you elaborate on the product lines where you witnessed that and how would you characterize the order books for those lines here in October?","Michael McGarry","Well, the pronounced one was automotive, so China retail sales were down 5% in July, and were down 6% in August, they were down nearly 12% in September. And the early indication so far or the read in October is slightly better, but not anything to write home about. So -- and that impacts not just our automotive business, but also a little bit of our industrial business because as you know they're painting parts and they're painting bumpers and things like that.","So that is by far the one that would impact. And when you look at the rest of our China business, protective was good, marine bouncing off a very low bottom, but that was better, refinish had a good one, packaging did pretty well. And so I would tell you overall it's really can find right now to automotive. ","But thing that I worry about and I try to signal this on going into third quarter before was the consumer confidence in China, with the tariffs consumer confidence has dropped. And when consumer confidence drops, then you start to see these big ticket items slow down.","And so I won't be surprised if China tries to add some additional I wouldn't call it stimulus, but additional emphasis on how they can support the automotive industry because it is a very, very important industry to them. So we'll wait and see what happens, they haven't done anything yet, but it is a key industry for them.","Kevin McCarthy","Thanks for that. And then second question with regards to the U.S. architectural market in the DIY channel. Just wondered if you could comment on your inventory levels there and your current view of our customer takeaway trends.","Michael McGarry","Well, I would tell you our DIY is lower than obviously our stores that do it for me is continuing to outpace DIY. When we look at our customers' inventory in the DIY space, I would say they're not out of line. And the good news is they're enthusiastic about the products that we have. And so we should expect to see that continue to grow in that 2% to 3% to 4% range, but certainly below the store growth.","Kevin McCarthy","Thanks very much. ","Operator","The next question will be from Michael Sison of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","Michael Sison ","Hey, guys. For the fourth quarter, can you give us a little bit of help on where you think the profitability will end up for the total company where you make some progress year-over-year in terms of margins. And maybe a little bit of color on each segment?","Vincent Morales","Hey, Mike, this is Vince. Just we said this before, we're still targeting an aggregate to get close to margin parity in total for the company. We\u2019re working very aggressively on discretionary costs. We've accelerated some restructuring actions that we had originally planned for 2019 and 2018. So that's what we're still working toward.","We do expect to see improvement in both segments from a year-over-year basis compared to the third quarter. But we're not going to year mark what each of those are. I will remind you Mike, we did have a spike last year in raw materials, precipitated by the Chinese environmental enforcement. That spike was really pronounced in our Industrial Coatings segment. So we should see -- we were up 400 basis points in margins in Q3 in industrial coatings. We should see that gap close considerably in Q4 relative to what happened last year.","Michael Sison ","Got it. And then just from a macro standpoint, when you think about Industrial Coatings operating margins it probably end up somewhere around 13% or something in that range plus or minus a little bit. And then you guys peaked at 2018. So when you think about the delta, how much of that do you think you can get back overtime, how much of that\u2019s raw materials. And what's the potential profitability for that segment longer term?","Michael McGarry","Yes, so Michael, this is Michael. I would tell you, we're going to get all that back. This is an area that is a high focus for the company. We won't get it all back immediately, we have to be successful in our price increase as we have to be successful in managing our costs, eliminating complexity and things like that. But at the end of the day, our team is very confident that overtime we will get back to those peak levels.","Vincent Morales","And if I could just add Mike, these are tremendously value add products for our customers. They bring a lot of value to the appearance of their products, were very important instrumental in their manufacturing process and those value attributes something they value and we\u2019ll get paid for. ","Michael Sison ","Right, thank you. ","Operator","The next question will from Frank Mitch of Permian Research [ph]. Please go ahead. ","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you and good afternoon gentlemen. Michael, a lot of discussion on the impact of raw materials, you also highlighted the impact of higher logistics costs last quarter and certainly this quarter and expectation for it to plague Q4. I was wondering if you could provide an order of magnitude of what the negative delta is there and is there anything short of trying to get pricing, et cetera to offset that you can do there to improve the situation.","Michael McGarry","So Frank, I think we have been clear, it\u2019s north of 20% this is availability of trucks as well as the fuel and everything else that goes along with this. So, we do use tools to combine loads from one place to another. And so we\u2019re actively trying to manage that, at the end of the day this is not just a U.S. issue which a lot of people think, this is a global issue, the amount of truck drivers around the world is decreasing and we see the same trend whether it\u2019s in China or Europe or the U.S.","So, I don\u2019t think this is going to go away and we continue to work on I mean if you think about a lot of our businesses we ship full truck loads. So it\u2019s not like it\u2019s LTL kind of stuff now for our smaller customers it is, but for our big ones, it\u2019s not. So\u2026","Vincent Morales","This is part of our normal pricing discussions Frank with our customers. We talk about commodity inflation and we also talk about logistics inflation.","Michael McGarry","And they have the same thing, so they fully are aware of it. ","Unidentified Analyst","All right, terrific that\u2019s very helpful. And then another topic regarding PPG, this has been in the news of late, is that -- is China\u2019s involvement in the equity. Is there anything you can share with the investment community in terms of the relationship that you have there friendly, hostile what have you what sort of suggestions they maybe offering, is there anything that you could add some color too?","Michael McGarry","Well, Frank, as you can imagine, we engage with all our investors throughout the year and we always value their feedback, we find them to be helpful and -- but we also have to be respectful of those individual exchanges, right. And so right now we\u2019re not going to share any details about any of our investors and I hope you can understand that.","Unidentified Analyst","Certainly, thanks so much. ","Michael McGarry","Thanks, Frank. ","Operator","The next question will from Christopher Parkinson of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christopher Parkinson","Thank you. Of all the moving parts in 3Q such as pricing cadence, raw material inflation, the volume trends. Can you just compare and contrast what you believe the dialogue in these same topics just in terms of what you think is the most material will be two quarters out just. What if any do you think the major differences will be from your perspective going forward? Thanks.","Vincent Morales","This is Vince, I\u2019ll start and Michael will chime in here. But if you think two or three quarters out again we\u2019re getting momentum in pricing, I think that\u2019s important so we\u2019re getting it as Michael and John Bruno mentioned, across most of our regions and all of our businesses. So two quarters out we expect that to be further down the path in terms of pricing. We do think in 2019 we\u2019ll see commodities trade on supply demand and only supply demand and that\u2019s important for us.","On the other side we still are uncertain about how the macro will look especially around the tariffs. So those would be the kind of the moving parts.","Michael McGarry","Yes, Chris, I would also add that oil is the one thing that has on our watch out list, so I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be talking about TiO2 down the road, but we\u2019ll be talking about solvents and various things that are impacted by oil. ","Christopher Parkinson","That\u2019s helpful. You\u2019ve had a bunch of various costs cutting efforts over the past several years. In addition there is continuous improvement initiatives. Given where current volume trends are and where you think they will be over the next few years or so what else if anything, can you do from the cost side. Is there any change of thinking here or just how should we think about that over the next 12 to 24 months? Thank you.","Michael McGarry","Yes, I think we have a continuous improvement culture at PPG, we have very active lean Six Sigma initiatives. We measure ourselves on a performance basis versus prior. And so, we'd say, we want to get better every day versus the day before. And so, our teams are expected as part of the planning process to bring forward ideas on how they can improve sort of whether that's the velocity through the plant, whether that's reducing the complexity of the SKUs or the raw materials, or the formulas, those are all opportunities. Certainly, we're looking at our distribution logistics on how we can improve that. So I would tell you that, we still have a list of ideas that we're working through.","Christopher Parkinson","Thank you very much. ","Operator","The next question will be from John McNulty of BMO. Please go ahead. ","John McNulty","Yes, thanks for taking my question. On the raw material front, the hike that you saw year-over-year, I guess, I'm trying to understand how much of it was from the actual raw material basket that you're exposed to versus product that was maybe coming through inventory through your international businesses particularly -- because I know a lot of those use FIFO. So I guess how much of it was inventory work in itself through that might have gone up earlier in the year? It just seems like it's a high rate for the third quarter based on kind of some of the trends that we track?","Vincent Morales","Yes, John, this is Vincent. Very minimal of the latter, much more of the former, we did say oil move up, which pushed solvent higher than it has been in quite some time. We haven\u2019t anniversaried some of the other increases we mentioned epoxy resins many times on the call in the last several quarters, will anniversary, the spike and epoxy resins in Q4. We still saw inflation and other cost buckets and then that was coupled with the logistics costs inflation that's been moving up all year. So we'll anniversary some of this in succeeding quarters, which will make the year-over-year comps easier. But it's still was our highest of the inflationary cycle.","Michael McGarry","I mean, I think, john, if you look at third quarter last year oil averaged about 48, this quarter averaged about 70, xylene was up 30%, propylene dependent upon in which region you are in was up anywhere from 23% to 45%. So, I think there's enough of that detail out there that might help you understand, what's the costs over quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year impact was.","John McNulty","Got it, fair enough.","Vincent Morales","I think, [inaudible] one more than, John. And I know a lot of folks look at things sequentially and we do agree sequentially things are flattening. But again on a year-over-year basis, which is our comparative picture here, we still had very stern inflation. ","John McNulty","Got it. No, fair enough. And then I guess just as a follow-up. On the U.S. auto platform, the high-single-digit growth seems to really kind of stand out as an area of some really above market type growth. I guess, is there a way to think about it in terms of number of contracts that you\u2019ve won, or something like that? It sounds like you did display some players out there. So I guess, I\u2019m just trying to figure out how much of it may be real, if there was a little bit of pre-buyers. How to think about that? ","Michael McGarry","No, it\u2019s certainly not pre-buying. It\u2019s -- some of it\u2019s mix. So if you think about the platforms that we are targeting, we\u2019re obviously -- there\u2019s a big shift to the SUVs and things like that. So we\u2019ve seen this trend coming for some period of time. So we try to be targeted on the right platforms. So that\u2019s part of it plus we\u2019ve done pretty well in our parts businesses. So what we\u2019re painting there. So I think those are the two pieces.","John McNulty","Great, thanks very much for the color. ","Operator","The next question will be from P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Please go ahead.","P.J. Juvekar ","Yes. Hi, good morning or good afternoon, I should say. Michael, Vince hi. It seems like company own store channel is doing well for you and for others in the industry. That store volumes have grown consistently at a better rate than big boxes. So why not get more aggressive in buying store chains? I think there are still quite a few left in North America?","Michael McGarry","Yes, P.J. as we know the best recipe for that is a willing seller. We have -- we\u2019re a willing buyer, we\u2019ve tried, but we haven\u2019t always been successful. And we\u2019ll continue to look at those opportunities where it makes sense. But we do see this trend continuing to do it for me is a trend that is not a short-term trend.","P.J. Juvekar ","Thank you. And a question for Vince, Vince the cash deployment goal of $1 billion in fourth quarter on M&A and buybacks. But seems quite large, I saw your today's acquisition of SEM Products, but that seems small. So is it fair to say that the cash use is more geared towards a large buyback in 4Q?","Vincent Morales","Well again, I think as we said earlier on the call P.J. we do have several other acquisition potential targets that we hope come to us if the price is right, and hopefully we can get those done in the near-term and that would the governor of the share repo. Because of our ability to extract synergies from those acquisitions. Absent that then fly will would certainly be share repurchase. ","P.J. Juvekar ","Yes, but the share repurchase still seem quite large compared to first three quarters. Is that fair?","Vincent Morales","Yes. Again, we've made a cash commitment out there. We're working up our leverage as you know, our balance sheet leverage. And we think our equity is not a bad purchase.","P.J. Juvekar ","Great, thank you. ","Operator","The next question will be from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Vincent Andrews","Thank you good afternoon. I\u2019m just trying to reconcile, you have the refinish issue that you discussed a bit already. And then I think there also was a comment on aerospace and maybe volumes being a little bit softer in 4Q from an inventory management perspective. So what I am just trying to understand is that it's clear that you guys had a lot of price efforts out there and that's what you continue as you set into next year. So what's -- shouldn't there be -- is the incentive be the other way for the customers to buy more rather than less?","Michael McGarry","Well most of our customers and when they buy they put it on, except for refinish, if you think about a can coating line, I mean, they're buying and they're applying it. And if you think about an automotive guy, I mean, we deliver ours before they need it. Aerospace okay, maybe they do have a little bit of inventory, but by and large not a material kind of thing. So most of our customers are more just in time than you think. Refinish is the one major difference. So I think our customers are not going pre-buy if you will in this space. ","Vincent Andrews","Okay. And just as a follow-up, a lot of conversation in the investment community about rising interest rates and mortgage rates and slow in existing home sales. So it doesn't sound like you're seeing any meaningful slowdown either in the paint stores or in sort of your underlying DIY trends. How are you thinking about those dynamics kind of in the near to medium term?","Michael McGarry","Well, I think you have to look it on a regional basis. If you look in the U.S., those trends are going to continue. In Europe, they haven't ever really recovered from the 2008-2009 timeframe. I am encouraged a little bit that Europe is starting to see some construction moving in there. As you know, we usually are painting several quarters after the construction period. So a little bit more maybe some partial green shoots over there.","Mexico is doing exceptionally well. And I don't think we have a lot of concern any other place besides Europe and Canada is a little slower than the U.S. obviously, but other than that I'd say we're pretty happy.","Vincent Morales","And Vincent I'll just come back to the U.S. If you look at trends again repair and remodel continue to be strong, commercial construction mix by U.S. region but generally solid new home as everybody in those is still growing, but at a very modest cliff. That would be the one that's probably more sensitive to what you're talking about.","Vincent Andrews","Okay, thanks very much guys. ","Operator","The next question will be from Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead. ","Don Carson ","Yes, just a follow up on your company stores, you talked about high single-digit year-over-year growth. How much of that price how much was volume? And is company stores still an area where you're seeking further price initiatives you need the third company store price increase to restore margins to where they were?","Michael McGarry","So, Don, I don't want to get into this split. I will say that volume was better than price. But I would tell you we announced in October 1, price increase in our stores. And we'll have to push that through the channel. And then we'll make an independent decision at some future point in time on whether or not we need any further increases in that channel. ","Don Carson ","And what was the magnitude of that price increase?","Michael McGarry","I would say it was in the 5% to 7% range. ","Don Carson ","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","The next question will be from Duffy Fischer of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Mike Leithead","Hey, guys, it\u2019s actually Mike Leithead, on for Duffy, good afternoon. Can you just talk about what you\u2019re seeing in the protective and marine markets, obviously there was a headwind for some time, but it looks like the heat map is pretty green now for the second and third quarter in a row. So maybe just a little color on how that business is trending for you?","Michael McGarry","Yes, so the best thing to look at in that space is Clarksons. Clarksons had said that it\u2019s going to be flat in 2018 versus 2017. And then they have projected a 20% increase in new builds in 2019, now it caution people that we paint to 12 to 24 months dependent upon the size of the ship after the starting. But that\u2019s a good sign.","The other ones, if you look at the capital projects for a number of our oil guides, their capital budgets have been increased. So that\u2019s a positive you see Columbia their oil and gas business is getting better, U.S. onshore is getting better. So maintenance and repair for marine had held steady and in fact I would say it was probably up plus 10% the last quarter. ","So I would say, as we\u2019ve said in the prior two calls, that marine is bouncing off the bottom, we\u2019re going to see continued improvement in that and protective we should see more investment in that space. So this should be an area of growth going forward.","Mike Leithead","Great. And then on capital deployment, you guys have typically talked about acquisitions and repurchases in two year increments. I guess when should we start thinking about new range of potential deployment targets on M&A and buybacks for 2019 and beyond?","Vincent Morales","We would typically provide more guidance about next year on the January call. ","Mike Leithead","Got it. Okay, thanks. ","Operator","The next question will come from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. In the quarter your SG&A expense was $867 million and in the previous quarter it was $941 million and if you look at it on average by quarter for 2017 it was $895 million. Now I know that you\u2019ve cut incentive compensation, but can you give some indication of what your normal level of quarterly SG&A is, because the third quarter number seem so anomalous and low?","Michael McGarry","Well, Jeff, part of that what you\u2019re seeing there is some of the restriction actions we talked about, we talked about $20 million of savings in Q3 alone. The combination of two programs. There is always noise in there around currency. So if you\u2019re looking at it on an absolute basis currency is going to move it around quarter-to-quarter and our target right now and where we\u2019re running right now, we still have more work to do with our restructuring.","So I would hope this would be a high water mark given the same level of sales.","Jeff Zekauskas","All right. So then there is pricing, so one of your ten competitors announced earnings and I think its industrial prices were up 7% and maybe it's accretive prices were up 5%, which is very different from the levels that you guys have. And when you look at your gross margins through the years, they have degraded that is they began the year down 240 basis points and now they are down 340. ","So -- and your absolute level of price year-over-year really hasn\u2019t changed much from the second quarter to the third or even from the first quarter to the third. So what\u2019s been going wrong for you in price, why hasn\u2019t it gone up faster and why are your results different than some of your major competitors?","Michael McGarry","Okay, well first of all Jeff, what you\u2019re referring to, the quoted price and mix? So I didn\u2019t hear anybody ask them the question of would they separate out price from mix. I think that\u2019s the first thing you probably ought to get an answer to. ","The second thing is, if you compare our overall margins there as you would see that we still have a substantial higher level of margins than there. So, I would say it\u2019s easier to jump over lower hurdle than a higher hurdle. And so that would be something else that you might want to look at.","And then the other one would of course be mix. So I think those are all think about automotive business that we have and automotive business they don't have. So I think there is some questions in here that probably need a little bit more deeper understanding and analysis on.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay, great. Thank you so much. ","Michael McGarry","Thanks, Jeff. ","Operator","The next question will be from Kevin Hocevar of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. ","Kevin Hocevar ","Hey, good afternoon everybody. You talked about raw material inflation year-over-year inflation moderating here in the fourth quarter as comps ease a bit. But conversely on the pricing side, you are starting to gain a little traction here in the fourth quarter of last year, so comps get a little bit more difficult. ","So you've been able to progress year-over-year pricing sequentially higher as the years gone on. So wondering how we should expect that pricing side of the equation to trend going forward? Do you expect that to continue the year-over-year growth rates to continue to get better or will we start to see that flatten out a bit?","Vincent Morales","Yes, Kevin I think you're right, we started to get in earnest to some pricing in Q4 of last year. So we do have a harder pricing comp we do. We are targeting more pricing across our whole portfolio. So our expectation is again, we're looking at this as a price raws gap and our expectation is to close the gap. And we do expect that to occur in Q4. ","We think the comps again on raw materials are easier. And even though the pricing comps easier, we expect further pricing. We're not going to give out a specific number, but that gap will close possibly flip in here in the near future. ","Kevin Hocevar ","Okay, great. And then on aerospace looked really strong, up I think you said low-teens in the press release. So wonder if you can give some color there. Is there share gains that occurred and just any color you could give there in terms of why the business is doing so well and your expectations going forward?","Vincent Morales","Well first of all if you look at the Boeing and Airbus builds, they are up year-over-year. Airbus builds were up 20% in the third quarter. Boeings were up 5%. So you have a strong base from that. Also we've been very successful in growing new transparency programs, so that's doing pretty well. And then you have the early signs of a military improvement, so that's also doing well.","And then finally I would say because of our expertise in the aerospace business, many of our customers have assets to grow in managing their own raw materials we call it chemical management. And so they've asked us to help them there which has been share gain. So a number of these things you had the underlying strong industry trends, share gains as well as new product offerings.","Michael McGarry","And I neglected to answer a question from earlier about the year-over-year aerospace in Q4. We do expect more modest growth rates in Q4 in aerospace that's really on the backs of a very strong Q4 last year. So even though the growth will be more modest it stacked upon very good growth last year.","Kevin Hocevar ","Great, thank you very much. ","Operator","The next question will come from Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","Arun Viswanathan","Great. Good afternoon, guys. Couple of questions, so I guess first off, just wanted to go back to the refinish issue. I guess what you're hearing from your customers is this that they just pre-brought a little too much and then they are destocking or is it the result of consolidation. Do you expect this to continue for couple of quarters or how long does this kind of take?","Vincent Morales","Yes, I think Michael, covered this earlier Arun. I'll try to give it a shot here just to give you a different voice. But we had a very strong 2016 and 2017 in the industry in terms of volume growth. We expected and our customers expected that to continue into 2018. First half of the year wasn\u2019t as strong, but people bought and I hope that strong growth would materialize it hasn't. So our customers are settled with the higher inventory levels.","One of them preannounced earnings alone so maybe a month ago. And so again we're seeing throughout the industry a lower growth rate than expected. This is two step distribution. So inventory buildup in the channel. And we expect that to deplete in a reasonable amount of time.","Michael McGarry","Yes, Arun, we just -- we see this as transitory, the underlying strength of our refinish business is very good. And we continue to have net market share gain. So, I have no concerns about this business long-term.","Arun Viswanathan","Okay. And just as a follow-up on the portfolio itself, you really kind of gone into several verticals over the last 10 years or so. How do you feel about the portfolio now? I know there's a lot of cross pollination of technology from auto OEM into other areas. But, do you feel like there are any other areas of the current business that maybe you're distracted from or potentially it's a lot of verticals, to manage? Any thoughts on that?","Michael McGarry","No, I mean, I think if you look at our businesses, there are a lot of things that crossover so corrosion is one, color is one, care is one. Those kind of synergies are hypercritical to being successful and it facilitates new product growth. When you look at our acquisitions, that because we're in all the verticals, we can look at acquisitions in virtually every space. So I think there's a lot of synergistic benefits from that regard.","And because we do run on a business unit basis we have general managers that are hyper focused, laser focused on running their own individual businesses from the customer facing activities. And then we have a different group that manages of non-customer facing activities. So think about the IITs and finance and those kinds of things. So, we had the back office. So no, I think we are pleased with where we are and we're very optimistic going forward.","Arun Viswanathan","And just lastly, if I may, just on China, you referenced obviously slowdown in retail sales, some concerns around auto as well. Maybe you can just give us your thoughts on the evolution of the China market over the next couple quarters? Is there a hope that that would rebound and what would it take for that to happen? Thanks.","Michael McGarry","Yes. So I'm very optimistic about to China car market. If you look at the number of car park in China still very, very low compared to most developed countries. It's still an asset that is very important to up incoming middle class person in China own a car is status symbol that hasn't changed. Again it's a very important industry to the Chinese government. It's a huge employer of people as you know, employment is really important in China.","So we're optimistic that this temporary slowdown we seek as a consumer confidence in the tariffs is going to moderate. And then it will get back on a growth track. So next year we're probably looking in that 2% to 3% range for China and it's the world's largest market.","Arun Viswanathan","Great, thanks.","Operator","The next question will be from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please go ahead. ","Laurence Alexander","Good afternoon. Two quick ones. I guess first when you did the pre-announcement, there was a comment about how Q4 margins would be roughly comparable with the segment margins last year in aggregate. Does comparable mean close to or near or was there another meeting intended?","And then secondly, just to follow-on, on the discussions to talk us about price versus mix, to get the margins in industrial backup to 18%, the implied message I guess that you're trying to -- that you were conveying or maybe I misheard is that you plan to get there through price and innovation and value add not through bottom slicing and sacrificing parts of the volumes. Is that a fair interpretation?","Vincent Morales","I'll take the first one. And again, I think it's clear in Q3, the macro environment moved against us, and that\u2019s reason for the pre-announcement. But with respect to Q4, I think your definition and ours is the same in terms of comparable. We certainly expect to be at or around the prior quarter, fourth quarter margin for the company in aggregate.","Michael McGarry","And Laurence, I'll take the other question. You're going to get back to peak margins sort of number of factors it's going to be innovation, it's going to be pricing, it's going to be efficiency, and it's going to be share gains because. Because we bring products that customers value more than their competitive alternatives. So I think it's a little bit of everything, but mostly focus on getting pricing through innovation.","Laurence Alexander","Perfect, thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Mike Harrison of Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. ","Michael Harrison ","Hi, good afternoon. Wanted to go back to the architectural Americas and the company owned stores, obviously with good same-store sales growth going on there. Can you talk a little bit about the number of stores that you\u2019re planning to add in the U.S. and Canada this year and maybe next year and then can you also talk about store growth in Latin America as well?","Michael McGarry","Yes, so store growth is regionally dependent, so in the U.S. we\u2019re probably targeting in that 10 to 15 range, Canada would be in that 5 to 7 range, and Mexico it would be 40 plus. So, that\u2019s -- and in Europe it would try be in the 10 to 15 range, typically what we look at. So again very regionally dependent. ","Michael Harrison ","All right. And then wanted to also ask for a few details on the SEM Products acquisition that you guys announced today, maybe just a ballpark on what the sales contribution and margins and purchase price look like? And then also talk a little bit about the technology that it brings, it sounds like maybe some of those products are used for more flexible coating type applications in refinish.","Michael McGarry","Yes, so the technology is around repair of damage parts. And so it\u2019s part of the paint, it\u2019s what you do before you paint and so it\u2019s highly synergistic with the paint. It\u2019s an asset that we have thought after for a long time, we have been talking the owners, I can\u2019t tell you how long has superior financial returns. ","Just to put in perspective, the margins here are better than the Comex margins, we\u2019ll give more details on this after it closes, but I would tell you it\u2019s a wonderful asset, it will help continue to grow our business and because of the way our business goes through distribution and the way theirs goes we\u2019re going to have some additional sales synergies on top of their current base.","But I would say some of the numbers that people have out there on it are probably lower than what the reality is.","Michael Harrison ","Thank you very much. ","Operator","The next question will be from Steve Byrne of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Stephen Byrne","Yes, thanks for squeezing me in. For two of the cost items that you provided some guidance on namely raws and freight and logistics. What fraction of COGS in the third quarter did those two buckets represent?","Michael McGarry","Freight and logistics for us is mid to high single digit percentages of sales depending on the business unit and I missed the first one Steve, what was the first, raw materials?","Stephen Byrne","The other buckets are just being raw materials since\u2026","Michael McGarry","Steve that\u2019s still around 75% of cost of goods sold.","Stephen Byrne","Okay. And then just to follow on to those is the primary driver of that inflation in raws, is it in particular chemistries such epoxies and urethanes over acrylics. ","Michael McGarry","Yes, you have everything, you have a proxy, you have TiO2, you have solvents, you have reactants, you have resins, MDI, TDI motions. Those are all impacting us. ","Stephen Byrne","And then just what fraction of your distribution is outsourced, and would you have any plans of changing that mix?","Vincent Morales","No, we don\u2019t have change -- we\u2019re not intending to change our mix of in source versus out source. ","Stephen Byrne","Thank you. ","Operator","The next question will be from James Sheehan of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.","James Sheehan","Thank you. Are you encountering any difficulties getting raw materials delivered in Europe due to the force measure in the industry caused by low water levels in the Ryan River?","Michael McGarry","No, those impact more the one step before us.","James Sheehan","Great. And then on your customer assortment issue you had a 280 basis points decline in the third quarter and that\u2019s only about 180 basis points in the fourth quarter. Is that normal seasonality that you\u2019re expecting and how should that trend in the next few quarters?","Vincent Morales","Yes, Jim that\u2019s correct, the gap there in seasonality and in our next quarter call, the fourth quarter call we\u2019ll give more guidance of what to expect in the first half of the year, we\u2019ll take two more quarters to anniversary the loss. ","James Sheehan","Thank you. ","Operator","The next question will be from Dmitry Silversteyn of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. ","Dmitry Silversteyn ","Thank you for taking my call. Just wanted to follow up on the question on inventory correction in the automotive aftermarket business. What other businesses -- I know you've talked about some industrials, protective and marine automotive maybe not fall into that category. But outside of paints in North America and I'm assuming in other region. What are categories of your coatings go through a distribution channel or through a two-step distribution process where slowing market can lead to a similar pullback in inventories?","Michael McGarry","Well, very little guys through distribution a little bit in powder can go through distribution. Some protective coatings can go through distribution. But other than that not that much. If you think about, most of the people we're selling to were OEMs.","Vincent Morales","And most of our customers are hand of mouth Dmitry. And As Michael said earlier, hours or days is a large inventory level. ","Dmitry Silversteyn ","Great. Okay, thanks Vince. And then just wanted to double check. You haven't been talk talking about the optical or specialty business within your performance materials or performance coatings business. Is that gotten folded into another operation or is it just become too small for you to even address it in the call?","Michael McGarry","Well, as you know our specialty coatings materials are a collection of four smaller businesses and they're doing quite well. And they're pretty much off the radar screen for a lot of our investors. So we don't spend a lot of time talking about it, but I'm sure John will be happy to take your call on anything particular in that area.","John Bruno","And Dmitry they\u2019re in the Industrial Coatings segment. ","Dmitry Silversteyn ","They\u2019re in what, I'm sorry?","John Bruno","They\u2019re in the Industrial Coatings segment. ","Dmitry Silversteyn ","In the Industrial Coatings yes, okay. I'm sorry. And then final question your guidance of $1.03 to $1.13 on EPS, I mean, obviously includes a significantly higher tax rate than what you have been putting up in the first three quarters. And I'm assuming it also includes basically spending the $1 billion on share repurchase direct so a significant step down in share count as well.","Vincent Morales","Yes, if you look at the share repurchase again we haven't sized that and it's going to be governed by our acquisition capability. But even when you do share repurchases, I'm sure you're aware Dmitry from a calculation perspective you get a partial credit on your share count in the quarter you do it's modest partial credit. ","Dmitry Silversteyn ","Right. No, I\u2019m understand but I'm not sure I've already done them all it's not going to be the full amount, but I just wanted to understand if the range was the range because of the uncertainty of the timing of the share purchases or the range assume you are going to do basically the full $1 billion and then see where the operating conditions fall? That's all the questions I have.","Vincent Morales","Yes, thank you, Dmitry. ","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back to John Bruno for closing remarks.","John Bruno","Thank you, Denise. I'd like to thank everybody for their time and interest in PPG. If you have any further questions please contact our Investor Relations department. This now concludes our third quarter earnings call. ","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen the conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. At this time, you may disconnect your lines."],"17326":["PPG Industries, Inc.

My name is Carrie and I will be your conference specialist today. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to John Bruno, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","John Bruno","Thank you, Carrie, and good afternoon, everyone. Once again, this is John Bruno. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our third quarter 2019 financial results conference call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, October 17, 2019. I will remind everyone that we have posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the investor center of our website ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the up - sorry, the opening comments Michael will make shortly. Following Michael's perspective on the company's results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&A session.","Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the company's current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements.","This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC.","Now let me introduce PPG's, Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.","Michael McGarry","Thank you, John, and good afternoon everyone. We appreciate you joining our third quarter earnings call.","Today we reported third quarter 2019 financial results. For the quarter, our net sales were about $3.8 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.67. Earnings were a record for any third quarter. Consistent with our improvement targets, we delivered strong year-over-year adjusted earnings per growth - per share growth of 15%.","Our earnings growth was driven by continued selling price realization and strong cost management. This quarter we accelerated our momentum in margin recovery with segment margins up about 220 basis points versus last year.","As we stated in the past, our overall objective is to return to the aggregated segment margins that we maintain prior to this recent inflationary cycle and we believe this objective is achievable in 2020.","Now let me provide some additional color on our third quarter results. Our net sales in constant currency were higher than the prior year by about 2%. Sales volumes were down nearly 3% and were notably impacted by weak global industrial production that continue to affect global automotive production and most of our general industrial end use markets.","This weakness was also broad based geographically. Aggregate selling prices were 2.6% higher, marking the 10th consecutive quarter of improved selling year-over-year selling prices and our sixth consecutive quarter with selling price increases of at least 2%.","We're continuing to work with our customers to ensure that we are receiving fair value for our products and services and expect price gains of about 2% in the fourth quarter, despite a more difficult pricing comparison in the prior year fourth quarter.","Finally, our net sales were affected by significant unfavorable currency translation of about 2% or nearly $80 million. We expect unfavorable currency translation to continue at a similar rate in the fourth quarter.","Moving to some business trends in the third quarter. In our Performance Coatings reporting segment, Aerospace coatings continued to deliver very strong volume growth, outpacing industry performance in most major regions. In automotive refinish, sales were higher as strong selling price gain and acquisition sales from SEM outpaced lower sales volumes reflecting lower demand in most regions as many of our customers focus on inventory management.","Year-over-year organic sales were again higher in our architectural coatings EMEA business driven by higher selling prices. Aggregate sales volumes were slightly lower as we saw mix demand trends by country during the quarter.","In Mexico, our PPG-Comex business increased organic sales aided by higher selling prices. Sales volumes remain soft as consumer demand reflected the overall lower economic activity in Mexico's economy. The PPG-Comex business continued its growth by adding nearly 100 concessionaire stores through September of 2019.","Organic sales volumes in architectural coatings Americas and Asia Pacific modestly increased during the quarter as sales volume growth in the DIY and independent dealer channels offset lower sales volumes at our company owned stores, including a difficult comparison period last year where we delivered strong high single-digit percentage growth.","Led by strong growth in the Asia region, our protective marine coatings business continued to deliver above industry sales volume growth, a mid single-digit percentage during the quarter. We expect sales to remain at elevated levels in the fourth quarter, albeit with lower year-over-year growth due to the significant growth we have experienced in the past year.","In our Industrial Coatings reporting segment, sales volumes continue to be adversely impacted by weak industrial demand in most major regions of the world. Global automotive OEM industry builds declined, including the impact of unexpected or unintended and extended customer shutdowns in multiple regions during the quarter.","In aggregate, PPG's automotive sales volumes were lower by mid to high single-digit percentage, consistent with the reduction of global builds. As a partial sales offset, our automotive OEM business realized higher selling prices in each major region for the third consecutive quarter.","Weak global industrial production activity impacted most of our general Industrial Coatings business subsegments, including wood, general finishes and transportation end markets. Also, our packaging coatings sales volumes decreased modestly as solid beverage can demand was offset by weakness in other packaging end market segments. We expect this business to return to growth in 2020.","From an earnings perspective, as I mentioned earlier, our third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $1.67. Our earnings were negatively impacted by about $10 million on unfavorable foreign currency translation, or about $0.04 per share.","Our effective tax rate was about 23% in the third quarter, which is higher than the approximately 21% rate in the third quarter of 2018. The increase relates to realizing lower nonrecurring favorable discrete tax items in the third quarter of 2019. We're anticipating a tax rate of about 24% for the full year 2019.","Our EPS results were supported by increase in our selling prices, improved manufacturing performance, excellent progress on our cost savings programs, which delivered about $20 million in cost savings during the quarter and remain in line with our objective.","In addition, as we targeted, we benefited from achieving comparable margins in our U.S. and Canadian architectural business to the third quarter of 2017, before our customer assortment changes. The four acquisitions that we have made in the past year also contributed positively to earnings, although at overall lower than company average margins.","As we look ahead, we expect global economic activity to remain weak in the fourth quarter. We expect global general industrial demand to remain unfavorable year-over-year and roughly comparable to what we experienced in the third quarter.","Year-over-year sales comparisons will ease in the automotive OEM business, but we still forecast aggregate global automotive builds to decline in the fourth quarter compared to prior year.","Positive developments around regional and country trade disputes could provide a spark to industrials demand as inventory levels in many of our end-use markets remain low. Specific to our businesses, we believe that lower U.S. interest rates could add growth in the U.S. housing market and also favorably impact automotive OEM and U.S. architectural sales. There will be continuing impact to our sales related to customer shutdowns in the automotive OEM business in the U.S.","In Latin America, we anticipate economic activity to be similar to that experienced in the third quarter, and we'll continue to add new PPG-Comex concessionaire locations to expand our customer reach.","In Asia, demand rates are expected to remain consistent in comparison to the third quarter. In the fourth quarter sales comparisons to last year will be easier given the weakness in Asian demand that occurred late last year. We expect demand growth will return in China next year.","Economic demand in Europe, is expected to remain soft as industrial production is forecast to remain at low levels. And our Automotive OEM business comps are also easing year-over-year and we should experience a lower sales volume decrement in the fourth quarter.","We expect our architectural business to continue to grow, driven by higher selling prices and strong cost management. Brexit remains an overhang and is beginning to modestly impact our business trends. We continue to closely monitor the situation and then prepare contingency plans to the best of our ability to prepare for unknown impacts.","As we said last quarter, we continue to work with our supplier base to ensure that our input costs are reflective of current industry demand conditions, including the ongoing uncertainty and weak global industrial production. We will continue to focus on reducing our cost structure, and we target to reduce $20 million of cost in the fourth quarter related to our cost savings program, including the newest program we announced in the second quarter, which will have a full-year run rate savings of about $125 million upon completion of the program.","Earlier today we provided EPS guidance specific to the full year of 2019. The guidance of $6.17 to $6.27, which includes an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of $0.18 to $0.20 per share. This puts us at a low to mid range of our original full year 2019 adjusted earnings per share growth of 7% to 10%, excluding currency translation impacts. While we would like to be closer to the upper end of the range, our earnings performance has been very solid when considering the severity of the downturn in the global industrial activity.","We have generated strong cash flow through the first nine months of 2019, with cash generation of nearly $1.3 billion. This is an increase of about $600 million when compared to the same period last year and has been driven by strong working capital management. Our focus on cash flow generation will continue and our goal remains to reduce working capital as a percent of sales compared to 2018 levels.","We completed the Dexmet acquisition early in the third quarter and continue to be pleased with the early performance of all four recently completed acquisitions including Hemmelrath, SEM and Whitford, which collectively will add about $400 million in annualized revenue.","Acquisitions remain one of our preferred cash deployment options given the value that these have created for our shareholders over the year and currently, our pipeline continues to remain solid. In addition to acquisitions, we progressed our key capital expenditures during the third quarter, and we still expect total spending to be up to 3% of sales in 2019.","In the third quarter, we increased our dividend to $0.51 per share or roughly a 6% increase. We have paid uninterrupted annual dividend since 1899 and we are pleased to continue to prioritize our dividend increases. We ended the third quarter with more than $1.5 billion of cash and short-term investments, which continues to provide us with significant financial flexibility.","Finally, I'd like to recognize and thank our employees around the world for their continued commitment to serve our customers. Every day, our dedicated employees are focused on driving the PPG Way and delivering value to all our stakeholders and shareholders.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG, and now Carrie, would you please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi","I guess, first off, you've obviously given us a really good detail on how to think about volumes for the fourth quarter. I understand it's early, but what is your initial view as it relates to the volume outlook for 2020 at this point as it relates to your major end markets, and on your margin recovery comment by 2020, Michael, are you referring to the run rate at the end of the year or margins on an absolute basis? Thanks.","Michael McGarry","Yes. I do expect margins to continue to improve. As you can see our margins in our performance coatings segment are essentially back to peak, and we think there is still more upside there. So we're going to continue to work hard on that. We also have made as you saw a significant more than 200 basis point improvement in the industrial segment and we still have more runway to go there.","As we said, we had positive price coming in the fourth quarter, and I would expect that we would continue to push price as we move forward as we still have an environment where we have inflation and think about salaries, warehouses, freight and distribution, things like that. So.","Vince Morales","And then Ghansham on your question with respect to the 2020, again a little, a little early to answer that question. But what we can say confidently is a lot of our customers are carrying very low inventory levels. Typically, they achieve their inventory levels at the end of the year, not by the end of Q3. As they've done this year, so heading into 2020 we do think there could be some inventory upside. It's too early to make a call on the economy and the other geopolitical issues, but a couple of our key industries we know auto we feel a little bit better about auto next year specifically in Asia, the biggest market and a couple of other markets in general industrial are down this year, we're hopeful they'll have at least a modest rebound next year, not counting the inventory rebuild.","Ghansham Panjabi","And just as a follow-up to that Vince, for the industrial segment, specifically, how should we think about operating leverage for that segmented volumes start to recover. I mean obviously you're adjusting the cost footprint and I assume some of the costs will reverse as demand picks up. I just wanted to get your sense as to operating leverage during the initial phase of improvement. Thanks.","Michael McGarry","Yes, Ghansham, this is Michael. That's going to be a strong positive for us. When you think about the past quarter, earnings in that industrial segment were up despite volumes being down. And we anticipate to continue to drive costs out, and so you should expect to see a nice operating leverage should volumes come back, and right now we're certainly planning on our outlook for 2020 would include some modest recovery.","Operator","The next question will come from Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse.","Christopher Parkinson","Regarding your volume outlook, can you kindly walk us through the key end market verticals for which you believe PPG is poised to benefit from, let's say, secular themes regulatory changes under new products, new non-BPA and the move towards aluminum cans will be one I guess in packaging, [low care] [ph] products and EV battery protective in auto. Just - you know if there are few others just generally based on what's inside of your control. What are the key verticals through which we can expect you to outperform and why? Thank you.","Michael McGarry","So, Christopher you covered automotive pretty well. So, I'll pass on that one. We have and in the industrial business as part of the industrial segment that one I would point to like high edge powder as one of them. And if you think about moving into packaging itself, the sustainability of the can is number one. So you could see the shift away from plastic that's going to be a long-term secular win.","For us, housing is continuing to - we got low interest rates around the world. So I think housing is continuing to be a nice little market for us. Aerospace is clearly going to be a continued winner for us, we're going to continue to outgrow the industry there with the launches that we have had, whether it's new transparencies or new coatings.","And then talk about them, we talked about in our press release MOONWALK for refinish. This is a new technology that allows people in Europe to be able to mix refinish paints more precisely, allows the technician to spend more time painting the car as opposed to mixing paint, drives higher productivity in the paint shop. So I think net-net, we're in a pretty good shape long-term wise.","Christopher Parkinson","And just regards to your margin outlook. Can you simply outline in order which variables will be the most material to achieving and surpassing prior peak margins just between price, input cost deflation, mix, acquisition integrations and just broader volume improvement. Just any key thoughts on how The Street should be thinking about that as we head into 2020? Thank you.","Vince Morales","Yes, Chris, I'll start and Michael could certainly add to what I say. But we're still sitting on a significant amount of inflation that's multi-year inflation. We have seen very little of that unwind to this point. We alluded in our call about the economy, the weakness in industrial activity. So we're still working to get price to offset this accumulated inflation, but there is a significant amount of Inflation we would not expect with the supply demand environment where it is in our supplier base.","We always do self-help; we announced the Self-Help program in May. We still have a variety of actions do against that program. We're expecting significant savings from that program that will be primarily in next year, and then the last one is, we don't know the volume outlook, so the things within our control we're managing but, as Michael just mentioned on the prior question, if we do get any volume, especially in some of our industrial businesses, we should have a significant amount of leverage. So those were - those would be the way I prioritize them.","Michael McGarry","And Chris, I would - the one thing I would add is that with couple of the acquisitions we made, they're below company average, they're fairly decent sized ones. I'm excited because I get a monthly report on the integration as well as the performance, and we are seeing month over month improvement.","In fact, when I looked at the Hemmelrath numbers for the month of September, it was the best month they've had ever, and obviously they're benefiting from some of our abilities to integrate them but I see even more positives coming, they have relationships with the customers that are slightly different customers than we have from a standpoint of mix, and so we're able to take the best of both worlds. They are great relationships and our great technology and put the two together. And we've already won substantial number of new program wins since we bought Hemmelrath.","Operator","The next question will come from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.","Bob Koort","Michael, you guys gave some commentary about your U.S. architectural business and I guess it seems like going on a few years now there's puts and takes and maybe not complete uniform consistency by channel. Can you talk a little bit about the DIY market? It sounds like maybe that's starting to percolate a little bit. Certainly we're seeing some of these housing stocks rally dramatically? Are there some signs that maybe we're going to get lift off in DIY and then in your store base, I guess I would have thought maybe some of those contractors that were hiding from the rainy weather in the June quarter would come back out in the September quarter. So is there anything idiosyncratic to your store base either regionally or end market-wise that would have precluded you from having a little bit better volume there?","Michael McGarry","Yes. Let me first start with the DIY. So we're gaining share in the DIY segment. Our customers are doing pretty well and inside our customers we have continued to launch new products and that's been a real positive. So when you think about the PPG timeless at Home Depot, as well as the Olympic Stain at Home Depot, both those guys are growing above company average. So we're really pleased with that.","I think the one thing that doesn't really come through when you think about our company store average is, if you remember, and some of the prior calls, we kind of talked about doing a little bit of everything in that segment. So some of its delivery, some of it is the store and some of it is what we call our premier authorized dealer network or where we're trying to make it simple for the customer to say I can pick up in a dealer location or I can pick up in a PPG store location.","And obviously we have, let's call it a little bit less than 900 stores between U.S. and Canada. But if you include that plus the nearly 5,000 dealers that we have that gives our customers a lot more opportunities to pick up paint.","And so if you look at our dealers, if you noticed in our commentary in our press release, we said dealers were positive and historically, as you know, this has been a long-term secular minus one kind of trend line dealers age out and move on. But with this new strategy we are picking up additional business through the dealers.","We added 50 new dealer locations in the third quarter. We're up to about 140 locations in the third quarter, a total of 427 new locations where they can pick up paint, and we expect that to continue to accelerate as other dealers see this work. They're going to want to jump on that bandwagon as well. So I think that's a little bit of nuance that maybe doesn't come out in the overall numbers. Hello Bob?","Bob Koort","Can I ask you on the balance sheet, you've been accruing cash nicely through the year and haven\u2019t been doing any share repurchase? Would that be a reflection of the acquisition activity, or is there some other reason you want to put more of that capital back to you through repurchase?","Vince Morales","Yes, Bob, as Michael pointed out in the opening remarks, and we've had a very good cash generation year-to-date, we've got about $1.5 billion on the balance sheet. We do have some term debt coming due in Q4, so some of that cash will be applied to the term debt coming due.","But besides that, we do have a strong balance sheet and we're still looking at a variety of acquisitions, acquisition pipeline is still rich. We are not immune to doing share repo. We haven't done any-to-date basis, the acquisition pipeline. But if the acquisition pipeline lessens or we think there is a need to do share repo for different reasons, we will do so.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Sison of Wells Fargo.","Michael Sison","Question on the - just quickly on the stores. You said you're a little bit less than 900. Can you maybe walk us through what your strategy is there? Going forward, are you looking to continue to expand the stores or is kind of this dealer network really the area where you can have a combined growth for your business there, but just kind of curious where you think the store strategy and growth potential is going forward?","Michael McGarry","Yes. So Michael, what I would tell you it's our strategy hasn't changed. We're going to add stores where it makes sense in those markets that are growing. So I think the southeast and the southwest. We're not going to be adding stores in the Northeast or in the West or the upper Midwest those our focus areas for us for stores, what they are focus areas for us for this premier authorized dealer network, because we think there is plenty enough to in our stores and our dealers to adequately service our customers.","So we're going to continue to do that and I compare and contrast that to Mexico where we've added nearly 100 stores year-to-date and we're going to finish the year at nearly 200 new stores. Same thing where we've added stores in the UK, we've added stores in Australia. So we're going to take, what we call the micro-market strategy. We're going to look at each of the different markets and make the best decision for our shareholders in that regard.","Michael Sison","Right, and then just a quick follow-up. When you think about volume growth, whenever, I mean whether it comes next year or sooner than later. What do you think your leverage is going to be meaning, if you grow your sales to 1% is that a leverage of 2% EPS growth, 3% EPS growth and just kind of want to feel for the upside potential as we all hope that demand picks up at some point.","Vince Morales","Yes, Mike, this is Vince. In the past we've said pretty regularly that our leverage on a normal increase in sales is somewhere in the mid-20% range and in Europe, it's higher because of the latent opportunity we have there.","So we said, in Europe, it's in the mid 30% range. I'd actually say that if you look at the costs we've taken out globally, we're inching up to 30% on average for the globe in terms of leverage factor. Now it's always going to be based on which business etc., but on average, I think we're closer to 30% now than the 25% we were previously.","Operator","Our next question will come from Frank Mitsch of Fermium Research.","Frank Mitsch","Looking at the refinish business, following the second quarter, there was an expectation of the volumes were to improve in the third quarter given the easy year ago comp because of inventory destock that occurred and that didn't come to the - volumes were down in 3Q, and you called out inventory management as well, lower collision claim activity. Is there any reason for us to anticipate that we're going to see, a rebound in this business? Obviously, you highlighted MOONWALK so maybe from a technology perspective, but just from an overall macro perspective with new safety features in the cards, etc. How should we be thinking about automotive refinish down the line?","Michael McGarry","Frank, this is Michael. I think this is still a great business. So I don't want anybody to walk away, think anything differently. Certainly claims were down 1.2%, a little bit more in that in Europe, but we had a couple of large customers CEO changes who came in and take even a more aggressive approach on inventory, and we've continued to have net body shop wins in all regions of the world. So that is a positive.","When you look at our integration of SEM that is primarily a U.S.-based business. We've launched those products in Canada. The first set of products went to Australia in September. So we'll start to see some sales there. We're doing better in sundries. But I think overall the one message I want to leave you is our earnings in refinish will be up year-over-year, at the end of the year. So we're able to price effectively in this business. And this remains a great business for us.","Frank Mitsch","Very, very helpful. Thank you for that. And just in general, as I thought - I look at the third quarter, you hit the high end of the guidance that you put out following the second quarter. And it's clear that the macros were mostly running against you during the quarter, particularly in European activity in autos, etc. So I'm just curious what on the other side really went right for you in order to again hit the high end?","Vince Morales","Frank this is Vince, I'll let Michael again add here, but we are pacing ahead of our cost targets. So we did have additional cost benefit in Q3, but we thought it may come in Q4, we got off to a little bit earlier, that's one item that was helpful to us. Mike if you want to add.","Michael McGarry","Yes. The other one I would tell you is the automotive team. We've been challenging the automotive team to get ahead of this volume decline and they really have worked exceptionally hard to do that in the second and third quarter. And I think what we saw in the back half of the third quarter was that accelerating. So I think that would be the other one I would point to.","Frank Mitsch","Very interesting, so the automotive side and I presume you're talking about the OEM side was able to outpace kind of your initial expectations even though builds were down, you faced strikes et cetera that - that's very interesting that would be the area that you would point out to.","Michael McGarry","Yes. It's the automotive team had done a good job this year, OEM.","Operator","The next question will come from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter","Michael, the raw is up year-over-year in Q3. And what are you thinking about for Q4 on raws?","Michael McGarry","Well, of course, we think about our cost is more than raws David. So in the third quarter, they were moderating. We had a couple up, we had some down, but net-net, they were moderating. As I tried to point out in my opening comments, we still have freight and distribution. If you take about dangerous good warehouse costs, especially in Asia, they have significantly increased, and so that's, that's why we continue to invest in our business, we continue to invest in our people. So that's obviously a cost on the rising side, but net-net I would say raw materials were moderating.","David Begleiter","Perfect, and just on the impact of the GM striking Q3 and Q4. Do you have an estimate on that impact?","Michael McGarry","Well, we're not going to talk about any individual customers. What I would tell you is that we have a very diverse customer mix in automotive, and so no one particular customer is going to have a significant impact on our overall business. And our team, when it was announced immediately took aggressive cost action to ensure that the impact was minor. So I think overall, like I said to Frank's question the automotive team did a good job.","Operator","The next question will come from P.J. Juvekar of Citi.","Eric Petrie","This is Eric Petrie on for P.J. So what kind of vehicles represents a market opportunity for you. How much coatings could you sell into the EVs compared to other light vehicles?","Michael McGarry","Well, Eric, we've always said is that the EV vehicles can be anywhere from 2 to 3 times more coatings on them than a standard vehicle. Right now, I don't have the latest number in my figure, but I think it's 0.7% of our cars are electric vehicles. So it's still a very small number. And what's interesting is that everybody does that differently. So the one guy might do their batteries might need protective coatings and other guy might just need Industrial Coatings another guy might use all three, some are using powder, some are using liquids, some use third parties, some do it in-house.","Right now, unlike when you look at a traditional car, you can use kind of broad guidelines. Right now this is still in its infancy and there is still a lot of unknowns about how this is going to shake out. But clearly what we see in every case is more paint on an EV vehicle then on a traditional vehicle.","Eric Petrie","For my follow-up in packaging, can you discuss the market opportunity to continue gaining share in non-BPA coatings? And then as the industry shift from plastic bottles to cans, is this a tailwind for the business?","Michael McGarry","Certainly the plastic to can will be a tailwind. It's too early in that process to know what that curve will look like, but it is certainly a long-term positive. Our BPA-NI as we significantly outpaced the market in '16, '17 and '18, we've been slightly less than the market in '19. We expect to be back on that track of at or above market in 2020. We have some new technology that's coming out right now.","Probably, I would say food has been probably, let's call it 70% converted, beverage is less than 50%, and it varies considerably by region with Europe much farther ahead and Asia much further behind, but there is still more work to be done there.","Vince Morales","Eric just back on your first question, I mean the statistics, we've seen is on our statistics, but 1% drop in plastic bottles if it converts to aluminum cans, a 6% increase in cans. We are seeing also efforts in the industry to replace single use serving cups as well. So I think the industry, the overall packaging, aluminum packaging industry does have some positive traits forward as we head into next year.","Operator","The next question will come from Kevin McCarthy of VRP.","Kevin McCarthy","I think you've been very clear that your contribution margins are higher regionally in Europe relative to the U.S., for example. I was wondering if you'd be willing to comment on which product lines are your highest and your lowest contribution margins in a given region?","Michael McGarry","Not something we typically comment on Kevin.","Kevin McCarthy","Secondly, I had a small question on the financial side. Your Slide 9 indicates net interest expense of $27 million to $28 million. And I believe the 3Q number was $23 million. And so I'm wondering why your net interest would increase $4 million or $5 million sequentially when your leverage seems to be down roughly $450 million. Does that have to do with capital structure or deployment plans?","Vince Morales","Well, a couple of things on that Kevin. First of all, we are paying off some term debt, but the term debt is very little interest associated with it. And one of them was close to 0% interest. So even though we're paying debt off, it doesn't have an effect on lowering the interest cost. We have been carrying extra cash and earnings of money on that cash in Q3. That will go away in Q4 as we pay down that term debt. And we do have, as its traditional in our business, seasonally a much higher CapEx spending in the fourth quarter. We typically spend 30% to 40% of our capital between October 1 and the end of the year. So we have additional capital outlays. First of all we did that earlier in the year. So those would be the biggest factors.","Operator","The next question will come from John Roberts of UBS.","John Roberts","Michael, there've been some press reports that PPG has been working as part of a joint bid for Axalta. Could we assume any trust issues for both auto OEM and refinish would be really high so that your interest is primarily in the industrial non-auto?","Michael McGarry","Well, John, first of all we are always flatter in people associate ourselves in the rumor market, but as you can imagine, we're not in a position to comment about another public company. We are going to continue to drive the consolidation in the coating space. And as we mentioned earlier, our pipeline remains active, but as far as any particular company, it would be inappropriate for us to comment.","John Roberts","Then maybe based on the IHS auto builds outlook for the fourth quarter. Could you - just based on their assumptions, can you give us maybe a range for your auto OEM coatings volumes in the fourth quarter by region and what it would roll up to in aggregate?","Vince Morales","So John, we're going to benefit from some easing of comps as we look at prior year. So I would look at IHS has revision that just came out this week and we would be looking at our performance being somewhere in line with those build forecast.","John Roberts","Okay. Thank you.","Michael McGarry","John, the only other thing I would add is that from a very, very small minor green shoot area, we did see build start to pick up in the last two weeks of September in China. So we'll wait and see whether this is a trend line, some of the local Chinese guys who are behind the curve on meeting the emission standards. So maybe there are just catching up, but we'll continue to keep an eye on it.","Operator","The next question will come from Don Carson of Susquehanna.","Don Carson","Yes. First question on the sustainability of the price increases. Michael, you mentioned that it was probably price increase will moderate in the fourth quarter but you've had six quarters now of over 2%. How much longer do you think you can sustain that, and particularly as you get push back from customers in the industrial sector?","Michael McGarry","Well, first of all, John - sorry, Don. We have not had any push back yet from customers. I mean, you get to normal push back but, at the end of the day they know full well that we've had more inflation then what we've recovered they can read the financial statements just as well as you can. So they know we're behind. They also know that we are - if you look at some of our regions, we're below then the curve line if you will on volume and some of that is because we've said we're going to need to continue to get price, and we're going to take price and if they want to move volume away, that's perfectly acceptable to us.","And so right now, we know we're going to get price in the fourth quarter, pretty optimistic we'll still have a positive price number in Q1. And we're going to continue to push because at the end of the day, we should be asking for value commensurate with the value that we create for our shareholder - or our customers and so we're going to continue to ask for it.","Don Carson","Then a follow-up on U.S. architectural. How do you see the industry growing given some fairly good housing data both maintenance and new homes and now that you've got the - lot of the customer mix issues behind you, do you think PPG can grow in line with the market or greater than the overall market?","Michael McGarry","Well, for the industry, next year, we have budgeted between 2% and 3% growth. We think that's a realistic number. Our architectural team is on the optimistic side, but I think this is a point where we have to show and not kind of like to show me state. Let's see what happens. And I think our goal would be to start with continuing to meet the industry numbers and we'll see how well the team does.","Operator","The next question will come from Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets.","Arun Viswanathan","Just a question here. Higher level and looking into 2020, if I could just ask this a different way. You guys had referenced kind of 2% plus price now for a little while. Volumes have been kind of flat to down. Next year if I think about some of your end markets, aerospace faces some pretty tough comps, architectural could be up slightly and your comments here, automotive, it doesn't really appear that it's getting better, although you cited maybe slightly better than your expectations. So when I put all that together, it sounds like next year volumes could be also flat to down slightly, and then I don't know if you're necessarily going to have the price. So just kind of trying to understand how you're thinking about sales growth from here, it would appear that next year would likely be lower than this year just given the lack of pricing actions? Thanks.","Michael McGarry","Well, Arun, I think it might be a little bit early to call that. When I think about some of the innovations that we have out there, I think if you think about low temperature cure that's still an opportunity for us. For aerospace we have a number of customers who were qualifying e-coat for airlines, so that's still an opportunity for growth.","We still have more share to gain back in Europe, because we have been leading the price charge over there on that. So I'm not where you are right now, it's a little early to say that. So I'm - I will say that we should be more on the positive side.","Vince Morales","Yes, Arun, I'll just reiterate what I said earlier. We think most of our customers and many channels are carrying very low inventory levels. So with any modest economic recovery we think there's going to be a dual effect, the recovery itself plus some kind of inventory replenishment level. So it's again too early to make that call, but as we talk to our customers, they are very low in there in terms of inventory on the balance sheet.","Arun Viswanathan","And just as a follow-up, it looks like you've taken some very swift action on the cost front. Those are coming through nicely. Your price cost is heading in the right direction. I guess, I'm just curious and then you have the new product pipeline. What else could you do - from a standpoint you've completed four deals, are you also open to something a little bit more transformative, the strategic review kind of unveiled that breaking the company up isn't really advantageous. But is there anything larger or more strategic that you could pursue to shift the focus a little bit forward, I guess?","Michael McGarry","Well, Arun. I would tell you that nothing is off the table. We're always going to be looking to do what's in the best interest of our shareholders. We're going to be disciplined though. We're not going to be doing anything that doesn't create value. We still have more opportunities when I think about the EV market, that is still a wonderful opportunity for us.","And we're obviously anxious support to play out sooner rather than later we can't control that. There is still a challenge, where the EV cars cost significantly more than a traditional car, and they have to figure out a way to get those costs more in line to selling some more cars.","Operator","The next question will come from John McNulty of BMO Capital Markets.","John McNulty","Just going back to the architectural stores business that you have. Last quarter you had expected for this quarter at least in the guidance you had kind of indicated you were looking for low single-digit demand growth. And I guess given some of the pent-up demand around the wet season, we would have thought it would be even better than that. I guess relative to those expectations what change or what was off. Is it just that it went more and more quickly to the independent dealers or is there something else in the mix that we should be thinking about?","Michael McGarry","Well, John, first of all, I'm not sure that in your influence came from, we grew third quarter of '18 at high single-digits, and jump in over that comp was going to be a challenge. And given the way we structured the stores and the dealers, we thought it would be a challenge. So overall, I would tell you that we're pleased with the rollout of this premier authorized dealer network. So, Vince I don't know if there's any...","Vince Morales","No. Well, I was going to say the same thing then maybe a different way. We look at the stores in our dealer network as were kind of merging that into a singular channel. We try to - we're trying to optimize what we do on our micro-market basis as Michael mentioned earlier. So we're not overlapping as much and whether this - whether the sale goes to a dealer or to our store is inconsequential to us.","So we have to look at these combined. And if you - again, if you look at the dealer results this quarter and year-to-date, they're up nicely, and that to lower cost to serve for us. So I think we are - it's probably more semantic than anything.","John McNulty","Now, that's helpful. And then on the unexpected customer shutdowns, is this something that you typically recapture as the volumes come back on. I mean do you see the customers - your customers essentially try to run harder to catch back up or is it something where look to business it's come and gone and it's kind of something we are going to have to just get passed?","Michael McGarry","No I would suspect that if you take the case of our friends up in Detroit, you know they're going to be short of trucks. So they're going to be trying to catch up that volume. Now on the car side, they're probably not as worried about that. But net-net I think they will be trying to optimize their inventories and it may be different at one plant versus another on how hard they are going to ramp up, but some of that volume will come back, but definitely not all of it.","Vince Morales","And we've seen customers curtailments on both sides of the quarter. We saw, July shutdowns are normally traditional annual time period to do shut down, some of those were extended. We saw obviously different shutdowns in September.","If you look - but again, if you look at the inventories as a microcosm in the automotive OEM business, the inventory levels are very low in almost every region relative to historical levels. And so again, I think that's another good news story at some point, they're running below - well below the historical inventory levels.","Operator","The next question will come from Jeff Zekauskas of JP Morgan.","Jeff Zekauskas","Earlier in the call Michael, you talked about raw materials moderating. Were they down about 2% in the quarter? And can you comment on raw materials in the United States and that propylene is I don't know, $0.38 a pound. And last year at this time, it was $0.58 a pound. So maybe it's down 35%. So is there much more raw material depreciation in the United States than there is in other regions?","Vince Morales","Let me take the third question Jeff and Michael will...","Jeff Zekauskas","Sure.","Vince Morales","In total, our cost buckets were not down 2% anywhere near that. We did, as Michael mentioned, have a variety of other costs that are elevated or still elevating. We aggregate that, and when you aggregate that we had very modest moderation of raw material cost in the quarter and year-over-year, and again that's after several years of accumulation of inflation.","Michael McGarry","And Jeff, I know you sounded like one of our customers with selectively picking up propylene in North America, but you forgot to mention ethylene in North America is at $0.27 in this time last year is at $0.20. So, and I always tell people we don't buy ethylene. We don't buy propylene; we buy the derivatives of these supply and demand of the derivatives is also important. So where you might have propylene down 15% you have ethylene up 30%. So there are some puts and takes.","Jeff Zekauskas","Well, contract ethylene was $0.33, but so secondly when you contemplate your acquisition strategy, are you - do you have a bolt-on strategy or is it something larger than a bolt-on for the next year.","Michael McGarry","Well, I think as we've always mentioned, we're active in looking at the pipeline and we're going to take the best use of our shareholders' money and we're going to be disciplined in that approach. So it could be either or, but right now the opportunities are historically have been on the bolt-on.","Operator","The next question will come from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Patrick Fischer","You mentioned a number of times kind of the cumulative impact of the inflation you've seen over the last couple of years. How much price do you need from here if you hold those cost constant, do you need to get back to par?","Vince Morales","That's a great question Duffy because we still need more price. And that's what we tell our sales guys and ladies every day, that we're still not on a cumulative basis recovered. It's different obviously by region by business, but we still need - we're not going to give an exact number, but it's, it's a more than we have today and cumulatively our prices that we've given at the past couple of years were up just shy of mid-single digits and then we need to be just north of mid-single digit.","Patrick Fischer","All right, and then historically when you've built cash sometimes you put parameters around that cash flow. You will give us a timeframe where either via acquisitions or buybacks you'll consume that cash. Is that worked in your mind historically when you've done that, and if it has or hasn't how would that impact what you might do going into 2020 with the cash you've built?","Vince Morales","I'll remind you that we have about $600 million or $650 million of the cash on the balance sheet today slated for term debt pay down and we did some term debt issuance in Q3. We like the interest rates and we're going to swap that out for payment in Q4. We'll look at our - we look on a recurring basis on monthly basis at a minimum at our cash and our cash uses and potential cash use for the next couple of quarters. We'll do it again certainly through the fourth quarter. And if we want to give guidance on that we'll do so in January.","Right now, as Michael said the acquisition pipelines are active and we still like to keep some dry powder to some of the things out there, but we're not immune to give it or not immune to not giving it. It just depends on what we see going forward and what we feel shareholders want to hear from us.","Operator","The next question comes from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies.","Dan Rizzo","It's Dan Rizwan for Laurence. How are you? You mentioned before on the Brexit is kind of cropping up as a headwind. I was just wondering if a - no deal Brexit means or what a deal means or if it doesn't matter as long as it is like just remove the uncertainty?","Michael McGarry","Well, the best thing would be, the removal of the uncertainty without having boarded prices. Right now we're not able to predict that, as you're going to get, we are prepared for either way. What we do see is our architectural business has hung in there pretty good, but then if you look at our little business up in Northern Ireland, that is way more consternation and churn up there, then there might be in, say, Southern Europe - Southern England. So I'd say it varies but at this point in time, it's still a huge watch out for us.","Dan Rizzo","Okay, thanks for that. And then maybe my second question, you mentioned I think adding 50 new distributors this quarter, I was wondering if we should think about it as kind of a general run rate going forward like 50 a quarter 200 a year. I mean am I thinking about that right?","Michael McGarry","Well, it's a new program this year. So we do have some earlier sign ups. That's probably a good number, we should probably look at for Q4 call and try to give you guys some parameters. It's too early to make that call right now.","Operator","The next question will come from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews","Just trying to think through the comments earlier about the potential for customers to rebuild inventory next year and I guess where I'm trying to square on my head is that we've had, as you say, six quarters of a very solid 2% price increase is going through and yet the customer base seems to be running lower than average or normal levels of inventory despite the fact that it's very clear. You're going to - to continue to take pricing. So other than some economic fly up, what is it that's going to - or could cause customers to rebuild inventory levels versus if they've been at low levels for a long period of time and they're generating greater cash flow. For that reason why wouldn't they just stay where they are. So what are the pros and cons on that?","Michael McGarry","For the first reason why they've rebuilt and if they had confidence that their end-use demand is going to pick up. So think about the heavy duty equipment guys right, they're wondering what the heck is going on in the farming business and whether or not they're going to be selling more combines.","Right now there is a lot of churn in that segment. So they're trying to figure that out. If they had more clarity on what's the future look like, the farmers would be more willing to spend their money if they had a better idea about the crops, they'd have a better chance to spending it. So I think that would be one.","The other one is consumer confidence in China. Right now, consumer confidence in China is down TMI and China is down. And so, if they thought that the trade churn was behind them, I think people in China would get behind that and start making major purchases. Right now they have deferred on major purchases.","Vincent Andrews","Okay, thanks very much. I'll leave it there as we are toward top of the hour.","Operator","The next question will come from Stephen Byrne of Bank of America.","Stephen Byrne","Yes, thank you. You mentioned just a few moments ago about your volumes in OEM auto to be roughly in line with IHS expectations. It seems your third quarter volumes underperformed or were more challenged than the global auto build rate contracted. Is there something in there that you can attribute that to?","Michael McGarry","Part of it, Stephen, was in China. So we have a pretty good split of the local Chinese OEMs. And these guys were behind on the emission changeovers and so they were suffering from that standpoint. So they underperformed significantly, the China as well as the Asian standard. So that's probably the single biggest thing.","Stephen Byrne","And then just a quick one on your store - your architectural stores. If you have a loyal paint contractor to your own stores, if they were to shift to a dealer location or - is that particular mix of paint that they're buying in the composition and menu and all of that is that transferred to that dealer and how is your margin on that gallon of paint that's shifted from your store to a dealer?","Michael McGarry","Yes. So think about this way without getting into the specifics, we're agnostic to whether he picks up in the store, or picks up at the dealer. The key is that he can pick up at his price at the location that's most conducive for him winning the business.","Operator","The next question will come from Mike Harrison of Seaport Global Securities.","Mike Harrison","Just wondering if I can maybe build on this idea of the premium dealer channel or dealer network. Can you help us understand exactly what is changing in the model and maybe if there are any costs associated with it and what stage you're in, in this process?","Michael McGarry","Mike, I think we heard your question about trying to understand the differences in the business model. Your coming through pretty lately. But if I understood your question right, I will just give you one example that we have said in the Midwest. We had 8 or 10 stores in that city. We sold those stores to the dealer in that area. We're selling through that dealer, and we're no longer competing with them, slowed everybody's cost to serve. The paint contractor has the same opportunities they had before. So again, what we're trying to do is optimize our distribution points to the customer. That's really the focus of this strategy. I hope that was your question.","Mike Harrison","Yes, I guess, the question I was really trying to get to is what stage are we at in that process of shifting to a different strategy with the dealers or other costs associated with it?","Michael McGarry","Yes, Mike. We're in I would say a little bit more than a year. The first, early on it was a trial stage. We saw some real good positives with that. Now we've accelerated it. There is no real additional cost. There is some - we need to make sure when they pick up in our dealer stores that they are getting the PPG price.","So, there is some transfer data that has to happen, but that's electronic, and so I would not regard this is any material cost and as Vince said earlier, typically it's a lower cost to serve channel to support our dealers.","Mike Harrison","And then the other question I had was within the Industrial business, where there pockets within that business that were stronger or weaker. And just in terms of the trends across all four regions that looks like volumes were down during the quarter. Were the trends stable or were the trends worsening in industrial?","Michael McGarry","Yes. So I would say that the trends were somewhat moderately lower and they really varied by region. So, Europe was a little bit lighter. Asia Pacific, a little bit lighter, U.S. relatively the same, Latin America relatively the same. The segment that outperformed were like Extrusion, electronic materials, those kind of things who are on the upper end of the curve. The clear the ones that were work - weak were general finishes, wood and parts or transportation equipment under - the end of the hood parts that typically show up in our industrial segment.","Vince Morales","Based on our cautious outlook Mike, I'd say industrial activity modestly weakened throughout the quarter.","Operator","The next question will come from Dmitry Silversteyn of Buckingham Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Good morning. Thank you or good afternoon, I should say. Thank you for squeezing me in. Couple of questions. Kind of regional, I guess. Vince, you talked about sort of in your expectations for 2020 that you would expect China to recover a little bit from a macroeconomic perspective. Trying to understand, besides the easy comps in automotive, what gives you the confidence that the Chinese economy and the Chinese consumer is going to come back in 2020?","Vince Morales","Well, we've been talking about this all year Dmitry, the Chinese consumers still accruing buying power. Unemployment rate there is no different than it was three or four years ago. They've moved to more of a saving economy. I think they're feeling, they're apprehensive about the geopolitical environment. And our expectation, our hope is that get some more result and or some of that breaks free because they are - they moved to more of a consumption model and they've saved for, I'd say well over nine months to a year now.","And I think there'll be more comfortable spending next year. That's the biggest single item. If you look at the service economy there it's doing well. So again, I think there is still so some good trade in that economy, that would bode well for increased consumer spending.","Dmitry Silversteyn","And then to follow up on your comments on Comex about the growth there being on same-store basis, at least in the low single-digit range. It was a much faster business when you bought it. I think you grew it very nicely in the first few years of ownership. You talked about some kind of political headwind and economic headwind.","Looking - at your key leaves, when can we or when do you expect, whatever the situation there that's going on to resolve itself or is it something that's going to drag on to - through 2020. In other words, is there a particular data point or an event that you're looking for or is it just a matter of anniversarying whatever headwinds are being faced by that business?","Michael McGarry","So Dmitry, I'd say there are two factors that we're watching closely. The first one is government spending. So with the transition to the new government run by AMLA as they call him, they are cautious and they have not cranked out the government spending that we typically see. We think that will loosen up, so that should be up year-over-year. And then the other one that we're watching cautiously is major project.","So a lot of the folks that have the money who are nervous when AMLA was elected, and so they let their major projects wind down, they haven't restarted new major projects, but what's interesting is that the President has the highest approval ratings ever. And so I think - I think over time people are going to start to loosen up and start to go back to restarting major project. So those are the two factors that we're watching.","The good news is our mix continues to improve significantly. And our earnings are going to be an all-time record for Mexico and we're projecting another record year for them next year, the business feels very good about themselves. We're moving into the major paint season. As you know, the holidays, Thanksgiving through Christmas in Mexico, huge family time and this is going to be a period of time when we see our highest volumes in fourth quarter.","Operator","The next question will come from Garik Shmois of Longbow Research.","Garik Shmois","Thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to follow-up just on the dealer network and the evolution there. Will that end up changing your end market exposure in architectural particularly in the U.S., does it make you more exposed to new construction versus repaint or not really?","Michael McGarry","No, material change, Garik.","Garik Shmois","And then just lastly, just on aerospace, you talked about in the outlook for the fourth quarter moderating growth, but I think it's really just a function of the tough comp from a year ago. So I just want to be clear on that. And then just wondering if you could maybe provide an outlook into 2020. How you view aero just because the comp will be tough throughout the balance of next year?","Michael McGarry","Yes. We still expect clearly the comps that we've put in place this year in high single digits and even in Q1, Q2 and we had low double digits, it's going to be tough to jump over. But when I look at the new technology we rolled out, the new wins we've had, I'm still optimistic that they're going to have a very, very good year in aerospace.","Operator","The next question will come from Jim Sheehan of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Jim Sheehan","In packaging you talked about some customers were trialing some things you had some pack tests. Could you give some more detail on that? Were these food packages or beverage packages and how did the test turn out?","Michael McGarry","Well, that's mostly on the beverage side, as I had mentioned earlier. Jim, the food guys are much, much further along in these conversions. So on the beverage side, you know, basically we don't get pack test results for quite some period of time. It depends upon the severity of it, whether they're moving all around the world. Send them to hot spots like Saudi and cold places like Norway or how extensive the change is, so we basically have pack tests going on all the time in this business. What I would tell you is that we fared pretty well in these things and as these tests come in typically that's been pleased to new business.","Jim Sheehan","And then in the European automotive OEM, I think that you had some difficult comps with last year, due to some emissions changes which had pulled forward demand and you would think that might lead to an easier comp in the fourth quarter, but it looks like the IHS numbers are still not that optimistic. Is there something else or is the export demand trend from Europe offsetting the benefit you might get from the change in the WLTP implementations?","Vince Morales","Yes, Jim, I think you hit the nail right on the head. We do see fewer exports out of Europe to Asia. That's one of the drags year-over-year. No different in the Asian sales in the indigenous in the region. So that's a factor, and obviously the industrial activity and the lack of industrial activity in Europe's another factor.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.","Michael McGarry","Thank you, Carrie. I'd like to thank everybody on the call today for your time and interest in PPG. If you have any further questions, please contact our Investor Relations department. This concludes our third quarter earnings call.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

My name is Chris, and I will be your conference moderator for today. [Operator Instructions] And at this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Vince Morales. Sir, you may proceed.","Vincent Morales","Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. Again, this is Vince Morales, PPG's Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG Industries, and welcome you to our second quarter 2015 financial results teleconference.","Joining me on the call from PPG today is Chuck Bunch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael McGarry, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Frank Sklarsky, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to financial information released Thursday, July 16, 2015.","I will remind everyone that we posted detailed commentary and relating presentation slides on the Investor center of our website at www.ppg.com. These slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide supplemental support to the opening comments Chuck will make shortly. Following Chuck's perspective on the company's results for the quarter, we will move to a extended Q&A session.","Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements.","Today's presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix materials of the presentation, which are again available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC.","And now, let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch.","Charles Bunch","Thank you, Vince, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. Today, we reported record second quarter 2015 financial results. This included record second quarter net sales of $4.1 billion and all-time record adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $1.67.","Our adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter were up $0.25 or 18% versus the prior-year record. Year-to-date our compounded adjusted EPS is up 20% over prior year, which is on top our compounded EPS growth rate in the past three years of about 25%.","This consistent and continued performance reflects the benefits of our portfolio transformation, the tangible customer benefits from our leading products and technologies, our continued diligence on aggressive cost structure management and the measurable benefits from our ongoing cash deployment.","Overall, I am pleased with our consistently strong financial performance, as we continue to manage through inconsistent economic conditions in major global regions and in various end-use markets we supply.","In the second quarter, our aggregate company sales volumes grew 1% year-over-year, similar to the first quarter, reflecting modest global economic growth. Regionally, in comparison with last quarter, our growth rates improved in Europe and the U.S., moderated in Asia and remained unfavorable in South America.","From a segment perspective, we achieved all-time record segment income in both coating segments and our glass segment delivered the largest year-over-year earnings improvement. This record business performance was despite significant currency translation impacts, the sales and earnings stemming from weakened foreign currencies.","These currencies, principally the euro as well as others in the Americas and in emerging regions, unfavorably impacted our sales by about $320 million or more than 7%, and reduced our pre-tax earnings by $40 million or about $0.11 per share. Absent the foreign currency impacts, our adjusted EPS would have been up 25% year-over-year.","Based on current foreign currency exchange rates, we expect the unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts to moderate beginning in the third quarter, as foreign currencies begin to weaken in the second half of 2014 and due to the seasonality of our businesses. Given these factors, we now expect currency translation to reduce our full year sales by $1 billion and pre-tax earnings by $100 million.","These ranges are slightly more favorable than our prior forecast as we lower the projected unfavorable currency translation impact on sales by about $100 million and on pre-tax earnings by about $10 million, contributing to our record coating segment income in the quarter with volume growth in several of our businesses including automotive OEM, packaging and automotive refinish coatings. We grew at or above industry growth rates in these businesses driven by customer adoption of our leading technology.","In addition, we have maintained our aggressive operational and cost focus as we achieved lower manufacturing and SG&A cost year-over-year. To that end, we initiated an additional proactive restructuring plan targeting further system-wide productivity and cost reduction actions.","We anticipate full year savings from this program of $100 million to $105 million when fully implemented in 2017 with $15 million to $20 million of these savings expected in 2015. Cash deployment was also a significant driver of segment income growth in the second quarter. This includes sales and earnings from our recent acquisitions of Comex and several smaller companies. Let me comment quickly on Comex.","We remain very excited about this acquisition. The performance of the acquired business over the first eight months has been excellent. Businesses sales grew organically by a high-single digit percentage in the quarter versus the prior-year pre-acquisition quarter and we remain on track for full year high-single digit percentage organic sales growth.","During the quarter, we increased our initial Comex cost synergy targets and now expect to achieve $45 million to $50 million in annual run rate savings by the end of 2016. In addition, we announced new acquisition related revenue synergy targets, which include capitalizing on the extensive Comex Mexican distribution platform for legacy PPG Industrial and Performance Coatings products and further leveraging the Comex and PPG participation in Central America, simply stated both strategically and commercially Comex remains well ahead of our original expectation.","We also announced or closed several other acquisitions during the quarter. In addition to acquisition spending, we deployed $150 million of cash in the quarter for the repurchase of 1.3 million shares of PPG stock.","We remain committed to and on track with our previously announced earnings-accretive cash deployment targets. Year-to-date we have closed or announced business acquisition with an aggregate purchase price of about $400 million and we repurchased $350 million of PPG stock.","Looking ahead, we anticipate global economic growth to continue, but to remain uneven. We are working to continue to capitalize on the modest growth aided by our global footprint and participation across each of the major coatings product categories. Additionally, we anticipate increased financial benefits from a lower cost structure and higher earnings leverage on incremental volume growth.","In summary, we once again delivered record financial performance in the quarter. This performance was broad-based across segments and regions as customers continue to adopt our leading products and our strategy execution and cash deployment are yielding benefit. We remain focused on operational execution and aggressive on cost management. Finally, we expect disciplined earnings-accretive cash deployment to continue.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And now, operator, would you please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter","Chuck, just on the gross margin in the quarter, can you talk about the year-over-year growth maybe, I had a little bit higher assumption, I know a lot of things go into it. But talking about the benefit you see from raw materials, and should we see a bigger gross margin expansion in Q3 versus Q2?","Charles Bunch","Well, as we stated, David, volume growth has still been muted. We are still seeing positive growth across the regions and businesses, but as we've talked we have some uneven performance across both regions and businesses. So volume growth has not been as high as a full economic expansion would deliver.","The raw material cost, as we've stated, are modestly lower than the previous year. So we're talking about low-to-mid single-digit decreases, depending on regions. And combined with other cost inflation and modest volume growth, we're seeing accretion in margins across all our segments. So we're pleased with the performance, but again we're looking for a little more consistent economic performance and currency stabilization to deliver higher volume growth as we go through the year.","David Begleiter","And Chuck, just on, there has been some discussion over China auto decline rate that that market is slowing. Discuss your exposure both in China as well as via exports to the China auto OEM coatings market?","Charles Bunch","Well, China, it's the largest automotive OEM market in the world. The builds are still expected to be over 20 million this year and have growth. We've seen over -- certainly the first quarter we were talking about 7%-plus kind of growth rates for the full year, and we saw that in the first quarter. We saw those growth rates moderate a little bit here, as we went through the second quarter.","So now, as we look at some of the forecast for the full year, we're still looking for solid volume growth in builds in China, but more in the area of 3% to 5%, maybe not at that 7% level that we came into the year with. We continued, as you know, to outperform in terms of volume growth, and we're still optimistic globally on the automotive OEM market.","We've seen a very solid performance here in North America, continued strength. And we are also seeing, especially in Western Europe as part of our EMEA region, we've seen a return to growth here in the first half. And we expect that trend to continue in the second half of this year. So we remain optimistic and quite positive on the global OEM automotive market, even if we have pockets out there like Brazil or Russia, where we've seen lower builds here in 2015.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank Mitsch","Good afternoon, gentlemen, and I guess congratulations are in order. Congratulations, Michael, on the move up; and congratulations Chuck on the pending retirement, and obviously a hell of a decade run as CEO; and of course, Vince, congratulations on your recent promotion; and Frank, congratulations on these results. I think I pretty much covered everything there.","One of the things in looking through the release that I didn't see was any mention of weather impacts on your North American architectural coatings business. Did you notice any material impact due to the above-normal wet weather? And what impact may that have come Q3, Q4?","Michael McGarry","First of all, appreciated. Second, Chuck is not going anywhere. So don't be so quick about that comment.","I would tell you that overall the performance in architectural, you saw our comments about low-single digits. We do have some impact from weather, it would be highly speculative for us to try and tell you how much that was. We were pleased. Our DIY business did have a good quarter.","And I would tell you that, at this point, hopefully things from a weather standpoint will get better. But we do run a global architectural business, and I tell our team, whether you might have challenges in one area, you probably have opportunities in the other. So all-in-all, I'm pleased.","Frank Mitsch","And also staying with the North America, you mentioned packaging was a fast grower, auto OEM was among the faster growers. But auto refinish was also mentioned as getting strong growth. Can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing there? What's driving that and where do we go from here?","Charles Bunch","Well, Frank, I'll take that, and I think one of the key indicators for growth in the automotive refinish business is miles driven. And so we had I think with these lower gasoline prices here and around the world, especially in North America, you are getting higher miles driven and that is helping this business.","We also had some of this weather that, if we talk about it in the first quarter, we had severe winter; the second quarter some of this rainy weather, it will drive additional economic growth. And our business has continued to perform very well across all of the different distribution channels and collision shops. Our team, especially with the water-based technologies and those continuing conversion rates, where we feel that we have industry-leading technology, that continue to drive our growth in the business and help us maintain a leading position.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Bob Koort","Chuck, I wanted to ask a little more, and you have a chart in there that Vince and team put together, showing the volume changes sequentially you saw for the last year-and-a-half and maybe the Latin American piece in particular is really quite jarring. Do you think this is a one-off issue? Are there particular end-markets that maybe went to the stinker here? And what's the outlook as you look forward for volume in those emerging markets?","Charles Bunch","Well, we have, I would say, in this chart, if you look at the deceleration of some of the growth, I have mentioned a couple of the markets that were unfavorable. So all of South America, including Brazil, was unfavorable in terms of volume and several other emerging markets. And I gave the example of Russia, as an example, where we saw a contraction here in the first half of the year.","I would say that our volumes in China and India continue to be positive. Although, we have seen with this discussion on automotive OEM and a few of the other industrial markets, we've seen positive volumes in China, but certainly not at the level that we had last year. So I would attribute this more to the negative growth in a couple of emerging regions, but China was also lower overall, especially on the industrial and construction related side.","Bob Koort","And you had mentioned some changes in raw materials. I was wondering if you could talk about what's gone in pricing. Are there any extremes in your pricing or is generally flat, pretty accurate across the entire portfolio?","Charles Bunch","This is pricing of the raw materials we buy or the pricing on our end-use markets?","Bob Koort","Yes, I guess, I'm more curious about your big, tough, mean procurement guys on the customer side, seeing what's happened in deflation and maybe asking for their pound of flesh?","Charles Bunch","Well, as we've talked, we're trying to make sure that we're getting the benefit of any raw material declines here in our coatings raw material space. As I mentioned, cost overall have come down in raw material cost. And we continue to have these dialogs, because as we went through the second quarter, what was happening is we had oil prices coming back up, as we started the second quarter and moved through. But recently over the last few weeks to a month, we've seen now those trends reversing.","So we continue in active discussion with our raw material suppliers. We expect them to share that throughout their value or customer chain. So we're looking for benefits to continue and potentially get a little stronger, as we go into the second half of the year.","Michael McGarry","And Bob, our selling prices to our customers, as you saw in our presentation materials, we've had flat selling prices, which was our base case coming into the year. There wasn't much on the way, either side of that for any big customer group or any big business differential. So flat pricing is what we predicted, and it's pretty holistic through our portfolio.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.","Mehul Dalia","It's actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. In packaging, would you say growth momentum has accelerated for you? And do you have any customer feedback that you can share on your non-BPA offering as it relates to Europe?","Michael McGarry","Our packaging business continues to accelerate with wins both in the U.S. as well as Europe. And it's being driven by our new technologies or our BPA-free technologies. And the customers are quite pleased with the new technology as we roll it out.","Mehul Dalia","And what do you estimate the market growth was in Mexico year-to-date? And can you split your Comex sales growth between comparable stores versus maybe new stores by concessionaires year-to-date?","Charles Bunch","Sure. Let me just tackle Mexico. So the GDP in Mexico has decline moderately. It's closer to 2% range versus where they originally had it closer to 3%. Our business, as you saw in the commentary, growing high-single digits. We've opened up 80 new concessionaire locations already. For the first six months, we have a target to open up a 170 locations. So we are certainly growing quicker than the market.","We've also launched some new products that we think will also be very favorably received in the marketplace. And then in Central America, we've launched Glidden in a number of locations in Central America that has also been favorably received. So we're happy with what we see there.","Mehul Dalia","And just one last one, in the release you called out early 2Q weakness in Industrial Coatings. What do you think was behind that? And how are volumes in Industrial Coatings as a whole trending in 3Q thus far?","Charles Bunch","So the biggest challenge in Industrial is the heavy-duty equipment market. I think we called out that it's a down low-double digit, so that's a challenge. I would say the rest of the business is doing relatively well, but that's an area that we're paying close attention to.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of PJ Juvekar with Citi.","PJ Juvekar","A question on your Lowe's business. As HGTV paint was introduced by Sherwin, has that had an impact on your sales at Lowe's?","Michael McGarry","PJ, as you know, it's difficult for us to comment about a specific customer like that. We did call out that we had positive low-single digit comps in DIY segment. We have very strong relationships with all our DIY customers, and I would say there were no surprises in the second quarter.","PJ Juvekar","And then Henan Billions is producing chloride TiO2 that's based on your technology, but I guess there are some reports that people are saying that maybe that technology is not working as well as people thought, and the plant is not running at full rates. I was just wondering if you could give us some color on that.","Michael McGarry","I'm not sure where that's originating. I'll just tell what we know. The plant is mechanically complete. All phases of the plant have been operational. We have samples from the plant, and both in China as well as in the U.S. We are fully working with them. We think the plant will be producing regular commercial grades sometime late in the second half of the year, and I would tell you we're on target with everything we've projected so far.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan.","Arun Viswanathan","I wanted to I guess delve into the North American architectural business a little bit more. You cited low-single digits, but weakness in the dealer channel. So was your stores business up mid-single digits? And are you starting to see some benefits of the overhaul and restructuring over the last couple of years and potentially some share gains?","Michael McGarry","Arun, I would tell you that our stores were in the low-single digits. The dealers in the first quarter were up and in the second quarter were slightly down. So through the first six months, the dealers are actually positive. We're doing slightly better than that in Canada. And I would just say that we certainly don't want to spend a lot of time talking about the weather, but it certainly was not helpful at all.","Charles Bunch","Arun, the dealer channel is our smallest channel, so on a averaging affect it has the smallest impact on the total business.","Arun Viswanathan","And what about the share gains, any thoughts on, if that could continue, or if you could saw any of that, or how do you look at the contractor channel? I mean, are you guys getting any uplift there?","Charles Bunch","I don't think there's many meaningful shares change in that regard.","Arun Viswanathan","And then final follow-up, I guess, in Europe you had some comments that you did see some slightly better sequential improvement in architectural. Maybe you can just help us understand what's going on there, and then also in your Industrial businesses in Europe?","Michael McGarry","So starting with architectural, France is our largest market, so our retail business in France has now positive comps. However, our larger trade business has negative comps, but much less, so it's getting back almost near flat now. Strong performance in the U.K. and Ireland, and although the Benelux was flat in Q2, we did see a noticeable pickups earning in late May. So I would say that's good. Central Europe was also had solid growth. As far as the industrial businesses, we've already talked about automotive doing better than the builds. So that was the positive comp force.","Arun Viswanathan","And anything else on general industrial in Europe?","Charles Bunch","General industrial I would call that relatively flat to no significant positives or negatives that I would call out.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nils Wallin.","Nils Wallin","You noted strength in protective and marine globally, but obviously also you saw some gains too in the U.S., so it's kind of a two-part question. Since you didn't break out it between protective and marine, is it right to assume that it's mainly coming from the protective side? And then the second part, unfortunately a weather question is how is it doing so well in North America, given the weather impact that probably had some negative comps for you?","Michael McGarry","On the protective side, yes, there is more wins on the protective side than the marine side, but our China business did very well on the marine side, so a nice win there. Overall, in the U.S. and Canada, good strong wins on the protective side. Also, I would tell you we have launched a number of new, what we call advantage products, and fire protection, as well as we did the Hi-Temp Coatings acquisition earlier this year, that has also driven some growth. We've been able to leverage that globally as well. And so overall, even though the oil business is down, net-net we are up in that segment, so we're pleased with how we're performing in that regard.","Frank Sklarsky","And Nils, the only thing I would add to that is Europe also had a decent performance. There is some additional dry-dock work taking place in some of the ports in Europe, so that had some sequential and year-over-year improvement too.","Nils Wallin","And just more, I guess, a question for Frank. It sounds like this year you've already done around $750 million or so in the cash deployment. Does that mean that $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion, you're halfway there, or is this $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion you're talking about incremental to the $750 million you've already done so far?","Frank Sklarsky","We still want to maintain that guidance of $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion for 2015 and 2016 combined. I guess, what we would say is we've closed or announced $400 million in acquisition so far, there's still additional pipeline there, so I anticipate more activity over the next 18 months.","I've done $350 million of share repurchase, so as you say, kind of closed, announced or repurchased $750 million, the guidance we would give is, the overall guidance is still in place, what we would have expected that at a minimum to achieve at least that midpoint of that guidance for the two-year period, so we're very comfortable with where we are. Continued good pipeline in the M&A space and also that share of purchase will continue to be part of our capital cash allocation strategy, so we're pretty comfortable with the guidance and off to a good start on that.","Nils Wallin","And just, sorry if I may, is the pipeline levered or exposed to any particular market more than any other?","Frank Sklarsky","There are variety of opportunities across the regions and across our portfolios as you can see with some of the things we did, the closed or announced so far this year, it runs the gamut between our various businesses and its taken place in a couple of different region, so we have a pipeline that really spans the globe and spans the different segments.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeff Zekauskas","I'm sort of surprised that your gross margins aren't higher, in that your cost of goods sold is down about 1% for the year in the quarter. And you would think that with your raw materials down low-to-mid-single digits, you would be doing better than that. And if you compare your results to your Cleveland competitor, I think their gross margin expanded 250 basis points.","And even if you make some adjustments for acquisitions, and you go back a year, you still see a much larger gross margin progression. Is that the right way to look at it? Are there advantages to being in North America? And if you are more global you have some impediments? Are you satisfied with your gross margin?","Charles Bunch","I think from our perspective, we're trying to drive continuous improvement in all of our financial metrics. This year, unlike most years, we have a lot of puts and takes in our numbers. We have a very large acquisition. We have a lot of currency, differences on both sales, as well as cost of sales. You alluded to some changes in raw materials.","So we've got a lot of puts and takes, so I don't know that in comparison year-over-year gets really difficult without each of those buckets. And we're not displeased with our performance. We'd certainly like to be as profitable as possible, but we do feel that we're executing very well operationally as well commercially on the sales front.","Frank Sklarsky","And I think if you look at the, what we call, our EBIT margins, EBITDA margin as we all refer to it for the business overall, we'd like to focus on that ROS, that business operating ROS. And if you look at it that way, we're over 150 basis points better Q2 over Q2. It's really a combination of a number of factors, whether it'd be all the inputs and the cost of goods sold, some favorable, and of course, we do have some annual modest improvements in salary and in wages across the globe.","So good manufacturing, productivity improvement, G&A improvements, some benefits from the acquisitions that we've done, as well as some currency headwinds that Vince referred to. But overall, when you look at the overall ROS for the business, a nice improvement, and there are some puts and takes between COGS and SG&A, but on balance pretty pleased with the improvement.","Jeff Zekauskas","And then secondly, last year in the first half your North American business was maybe up in order of magnitude 5%, and this year it's roughly flat. What is it about North America this year that's so much weaker than North America last year in the first half?","Frank Sklarsky","I think, Jeff, you have a continued improvement of automotive OEM, but not at the same acceleration. It continues to be positive. So that is one of the businesses continued growing, but not at overall 5% level.","Charles Bunch","The other, as we talked in the release, Jeff, general industrial was much more benign this year than it was last year. And we did as we, this is a Q1 comp math, so we did have some architectural pipeline fills last year for new product wins last year that we're maintaining this year. But the pipeline fills or stocking for our customers did not recur.","Jeff Zekauskas","So do you think this is a 1% volume year for PPG or do you think that you can do -- are business conditions improving, or are they sort of steady-state?","Charles Bunch","I would say, the businesses are steady-state. There is still positive economic growth here. We have talked about some of the weakness in the overall market in architectural due to some weather events here in actually the first half, not just the rain in the second quarter, whereas most of the underlying economic indicators are still positives. So we have maintained a positive outlook for the second half of the year, and I think you'll see continued volume growth from last year in the U.S. and Canadian region.","Frank Sklarsky","Remember, Jeff, there is one other minor factor too, and it's in the Glass business, which is impacting that 1% of that effectively, sold our Mt. Zion facility, whereas you can see that the mix is greatly improving our business. So even though the volume and the topline is lower in that business, the profitability is greatly improved. So yes, that was not a huge factor, but a factor contributing to that year-over-year change in the growth rate.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts","Frank, you just mentioned the Glass business. And again, the volume was down due to the plant closing, but it didn't seem to be affected much by weather. And given that's a U.S. OEM construction business I would've thought it would be one of the most affected businesses by weather?","Frank Sklarsky","Well, again, we're running at decent utilization levels, so profitability greatly improved; one plant coming out of the system, mix is improved, and as with commercial construction still not at back to levels pre-financial crisis. So very optimistic about the way that this looks for the rest of the year and looking forward, if we can get continued improvement on the commercial side that business will continue to perform well. Not as sensitive -- ","Charles Bunch","Not as sensitive, John, to whether its paint is, you'd still put up glass in like all inclement weather.","John Roberts","Actually, could you give us a little granularity on the auto OEM paint strengths either, is it largely more new wins, or is it better sell-through of previous wins? Or any regional color that you can give us on the outperformance now?","Charles Bunch","Well, we've continued to do well in our regions here and in the greater Europe as well as Asia. I would say that either it is more overall market growth, which has continued. In Europe, especially in Western Europe, you've seen growth of what we would call some of our customer base, especially among a broader base of the European manufacturers than we have been seeing over the last few years, and we have a good exposure across all of the manufacturers in Europe.","So we're seeing some improvement in some of those European based manufacturers, the French and Italian manufacturers in particular they've had a better performance. And in China, I would say, there we continue to win more than our share of new plant startups in China especially, and so that's where we've continued to outperform the market. And that is more technology driven. The new compact processes that we've talked about over the last few years. The Chinese market both the domestic manufacturers and the global manufacturers in China are starting new plans with the most modern technologies of today. And this is where we are best positioned.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of James Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson and Humphrey.","James Sheehan","I was just wondering about the slowdown that's occurring in emerging markets. Do you expect this to impact growth in aerospace in the near and medium term?","Michael McGarry","I don't think that's going to have a material impact. Certainly, the general aviation market isn't help by the challenges in Russia or China; two markets that we're starting to emerge to buy general aviation planes. But overall, the aviation industry is doing quite well. In fact, they're returning their cost to capital. Right now, their profitability is up and people are traveling. So I would say that it's not going to be a material impact.","Charles Bunch","We also did see a decent growth in Asia-Pacific region aerospace in the second quarter. In addition to that, one of the things that's up-up, continued to drive outperform are some of the new technologies that we are deploying out to some of the major aircraft manufacturers.","Michael McGarry","And I would add for a final comment that we do another acquisition that closed July 1, Cuming Microwave. It's a business does classified defense products for radar-evading for both airplanes and as well as land vehicles. And that would be a contributor to the business in the third quarter as well.","James Sheehan","You noted some positive impact from working capital in the second quarter. Can you just comment on where you see working capital in the second half?","Charles Bunch","We continue to focus in on a couple of key areas. One, past-due receivables, we're making some good progress there, but more importantly in the area of supply chain efficiency and inventories. However, we saw several days improvement on the Performance Coatings space in the first half. And we have some additional improvements that we have targeted for the back half of the year.","So I think it's safe to assume that we'll continue progress that we've made I think in the back half of the year. And expect that to continue, to improve, because we still know there's a little bit more in terms of number of days in the cash conversion cycle that we can improve on as compared to peer group. Jim, we've had consecutive years of 100 basis point improvement in our operating working capital. And that's our target again this year. We're made some improvement, but we're not where we want to be by yearend.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews","Just one question for me, would you mind breaking out the FX impact to gross margins in the quarter?","Charles Bunch","Well, we have -- from an FX perspective we had $40 million of negative EBIT in the quarter, pre-tax EBIT. And most of that's going to be in the COGS line. There's some offset in the G&A line within the regions, but since we make most of the product where we deliver it, the vast majority of that impact, that $40 million to the bottomline is going to be in the COGS.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Don Carson.","Don Carson","Just going back to FX and sort of the interplay with ROS, so FX is about $0.25 year-to-date, if I add up the first two quarters, are you still thinking it's going to slow down in the second quarter and maybe be $0.35, $0.40? And from a ROS standpoint, you had mentioned in first quarter you didn't see much ROS benefit as you worked down high cost inventories. What benefit did you see in the second quarter? And as that accelerates in the second half, what sort of multiple would you expect that to be of the FX hit?","Charles Bunch","So Don, just sticking with the currency translation, we had our biggest impact we believe in Q2 for multiple reasons. One, it's our highest quarter seasonally, especially in architectural Europe. And secondarily, the currency rates began to weaken last year, the euro began to weaken last year, dollar currencies in Q3, so if you will, the comps currency-wise are bit easier in Q3.","Seasonality is the bigger factor there. So we do expect moderation from the second quarter level in the back half of the year, and in Q4 the euro was markedly down versus Q3 last year. So again, weakening euro and other currencies last year give us reason for moderation going into the back half of this year. Frank, I don't know if you wanted that or comment on that as well?","Frank Sklarsky","I mean, that's under the assumptions that the rate stay where they were at the end of Q2. They weakened a little bit this morning based on some of the news out of Europe. But under the assumption that they stay where they are, we expect sequentially an improvement both in Q3 and Q4.","Michael McGarry","And on your raw material question, I think Chuck mentioned earlier that we saw some benefit in Q1. That benefit expanded a little bit in Q2, and we expect a modestly improved benefit in Q3 and Q4.","Don Carson","Then just a follow-up on acquisitions. What sort of in the average EBITDA that you've been paying? And how has that changed over the last year, are you seeing more competition for these properties and thus higher purchase multiples?","Charles Bunch","Well, I would say that the purchase multiples for our deals, they do vary depending on growth rates, region, performance of the business. I would say that on average, this year we have not paid at the same level as we paid last year. As an example, we did pay as you know the announced multiple of around 11 for Comex pre-synergies.","And these are smaller deals in various regions. So I would say the multiples are around the same over the last 18 moths or so. I think it's again somewhat dependent on where we finished, I mean, the types of deals and what are the quality and the size of the businesses.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eugene Fedotoff with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Eugene Fedotoff","Your European volumes were up 2% year-over-year. And in the past you sort of commented on incremental profits or incremental margins for Europe, given that you took some cost out there in the past couple of years. I was wondering if you can provide similar color for this quarter.","Frank Sklarsky","We're still holding to the general guideline that incrementals on European volume in the 30% to 40% range. That's really because of plenty of headroom in terms of the manufacturing capacity, and not only steady, but generally reduced SG&A as we complete our restructuring program around the globe. So that 30%, 40% is still a pretty good rule of thumb.","Eugene Fedotoff","And then just a follow-up on the protective coatings in North America. I don't know what your exposure is, like if it's significant, probably not to the, I guess, oilfield market or are you seeing any decline in the served markets due to the lower oil prices in North America and globally?","Michael McGarry","Yes, certainly, the oil market is softer, but the beauty is that we've been able to capture share in that segment, and that has been a positive for us overall. We do see oil weakness in Columbia, Mexico, Russia, some other places as well, but net-net this has been a good market for us.","Eugene Fedotoff","And just a last follow-up on Comex sales growth, high-single digit in the quarter and year-to-date. So it sounds like you should be or is that the right expectation, you should be towards the higher end of your mid-to-high single-digit sales growth guidance?","Michael McGarry","I'm sorry. Could you repeat the question? I'm sorry.","Eugene Fedotoff","Sure. Given high-single digits and Comex sales so far, I believe you said you expected sales to grow mid-to-high single-digits for 2015. So is it fair to assume that it's likely going to be at the high-end of that guidance?","Michael McGarry","I would tell you that historically what we told, we will grow 1.5x and 2x GDP. We are outperforming that right now. I'm comfortable that the team will continue to perform at the upper end of that guidance.","Charles Bunch","And just as a reminder for everybody, the seasonality of the Comex business, architectural Comex business, is a little different than the seasonality of our U.S. and Canadian businesses. For us, what we said is, Comex is about 20% in Q1, 25% in Q2 Q3 and 30% in Q4 in terms of their sales phasing. And that again is different than U.S.\/Canada business and Western European business we have.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Perrella with Bloomberg.","Christopher Perrella","A question on the China business. With Asian or Asian volumes mixed, but up, were there any end-markets where you saw declining volumes in the quarter over in Asia?","Charles Bunch","Could you repeat the question?","Christopher Perrella","Were volumes down in any particular coatings end-markets in Asia in the quarter?","Charles Bunch","Coatings end-markets, heavy-duty equipment in our industrial business was down, as we alluded to. Electronics, again, in our general industrial business was flattish. Those would be two markets that were on kind of the weaker side of the spectrum.","Christopher Perrella","And what was packaging demand in Asia for you guys in the quarter? Was it up in line with the market or below market growth?","Michael McGarry","Every one of our businesses was up in mid-to-high single digits. Every one of them feed into packaging in the market.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Reitzes with Broad Arch Capital.","Robert Reitzes","Just trying to piece everything together. I want to ask a question. It sounds to me like Europe is going to be better in the third quarter, U.S. should be at least where it is or maybe a little better and Asia will be better, but at a less of a growth rate. Is that what I heard you guys say? That's the first part of my question.","Michael McGarry","I think that's a fair characterization.","Robert Reitzes","And the second part is that currency will not hurt you as much in the third and fourth quarters as it did in the past. So maybe you got a little bit of a tailwind, even though currency was still hard, but you get maybe a little bit of a tailwind from currency moderation, is that fair?","Michael McGarry","It will still be a headwind in absolute terms on a year-over-year basis, but less so than it was in Q2. So Q2 is the peak headwind, Q3 a less so, and Q4 will be less so, just based on the sequential year-over-year comparisons based on the euro. And of course, that also depends on the fact that currency stay by where they were or they are now. If it continues too weaken significantly, it will be more of a headwind. But we still think that overall Q2 will be a peak quarter and it will improve sequentially after that.","Robert Reitzes","So when you take a look at the one other business that people have been nervous about, and it sounds to me like Chuck was more optimistic, is that people have been a little bit more nervous about auto sales in China or auto builds. It sounds to me, even though you're looking for less growth, you're still looking for 3 to 5 instead of 7 in China in the back half of the year, is that also fair?","Charles Bunch","I think for the full year we're looking at mid-single digit, so certainly down from 7 right now. 3 to 5 for the year we think is good. And we've seen a few blips in Chinese market over the last few years, but we think it will still be positive for this year.","Robert Reitzes","And one last question, just putting the whole thing together. Do you think if where you are today versus where you were in the beginning of the year, is Europe where you thought it was, better or worse?","Michael McGarry","Just making sure, we understood the question, Bob. You said Europe?","Robert Reitzes","At the beginning of the year when you were looking at your forecast for Europe or what you thought the tone of business was, you had a view then. Right now is your view that business is better than what you thought in the beginning of the year, worse or about as you thought at the beginning of the year?","Charles Bunch","Well, I would say, on balance it's slightly better. It is better in automotive OEM and actually there was some improvement in automotive refinish. It's the construction markets, especially the big one we have in France have really not started to move. So I guess maybe that's meeting our expectations. But net-net I would say the automotive business is a little bit better.","And as we've seen here in the recovery in North America since the great recession, it was really led by the automotive business. So now I'm a little more positive, as they have a weaker currency, lower oil prices, a lot of quantitative easing. So we're net-net more optimistic about Europe. But the businesses we're seeing the most tangible improvement are the automotive.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of the Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn","A lot of my questions have been answered already. But I'd just like to follow-up on a couple of points, if I may. First of all, getting back to the raw material pricing and the discussion that you've offered in the answer to the previous question about [technical difficulty] coming back, and maybe asking you to share in some of the bounty that you're seeing on the raw materials side. It didn't sound like that was something we should expect in the second half of the year.","If we assume that raw materials sort of stay at these levels and oil prices stay at these levels, is it likely that pressure from customers is going to get more intense in the industrial markets in 2016? Or do you still expect to sort of operate in the benign environment, where you get to keep all the benefit you have realized to date on the raw material prices?","Charles Bunch","We'll, certainly, I can add that we don't anticipate that we will keep all of the benefits. And typically as we've discussed whether prices on the way up or on the way down, we usually wait for a quarter or two as these things settle out, and we fully realize either the impact of raw materials on up or downside. And those are usually shared through the value chain or supply chain with our customers. So we're in regular dialog now with the suppliers and with the customers. So we do not expect that we would keep all of the benefits from a raw material changes.","Michael McGarry","Again, Dmitry, our raw materials are down modestly, low-single digits, so just to be clear on that number.","Frank Sklarsky","And there are other factors that go into our pricing too, like different kinds of value-added formulations, new products for our customers as well as there are other cost inputs associated with labor and other non-labor items. So overall, as Vince said before, a flattish environment overall for pricing, that was the case in the previous couple of quarters. We expect that for the rest of this year and probably into first half of next year.","Dmitry Silversteyn","I'm going to get in the 10-Q, but just for modeling purposes, can you update us on what the CapEx spend was in the quarter or for the six months?","Charles Bunch","We had in our presentation materials, total for the year about $160 million with about $90 million in Q2.","Dmitry Silversteyn","And then, just sort of a general question. You talk about the incremental leverage that you'll be able to obtain after having the cost, particularly in Europe, but also in other geographies, as you've integrated acquisitions and took capacity out and rationalize your footprint and so on.","I guess, my question is I am not growing 22% volume, how do you actually drive margin in your business as to a higher level? I understand incremental margin, but you need volume to get it. So if you're growing at 1% to 2%, it's not going to be enough for you to drive the margin to generate earnings growth of mid-teens, let's say?","Charles Bunch","Dmitry, just to make sure, I want to make sure I spoke correctly. So our cap spending year-to-date was $160 million.","Dmitry Silversteyn","$160 million and $90 million in the quarter, I got it.","Charles Bunch","I just want to make sure of that. I apologize for interrupting you. I want to make sure that was clear. But in terms of our driving incremental margin profitability, I think we continue to look for ways to be aggressive with our cost. We continue to identify opportunity as we integrate these acquisitions, and we're typically bringing in lower than our operating margin or EBIT margin.","And we continue to look for synergistic opportunities across our portfolio of businesses in terms of sales. So those are all -- again, we do have a challenging environment in certain markets, but we typically look for other opportunities to make sure we're maximizing our profitability with things we control.","And again, along with the working capital improvement, there are also efforts underway to improve the efficiency of the supply chain. So the supply chain efficiency, there is manufacturing productivity, there is SG&A improvement associated with the restructuring program as well as the volume leverage we get from any incremental volume.","Dmitry Silversteyn","And then final question and I guess that that's sort of revisiting maybe a question that was asked earlier. But at the beginning of the year, you talked about a scenario of kind of slower first half of the year for European markets, and then a pickup in the second half of the year as the benefit from inflation of the currency and\/or energy costs and things like that. Your European businesses in the first half I think did a little bit better than that. Is your expectation for the second half of the year equally bullish, sort of less bullish? Are you seeing [technical difficulty] more confidence and demand or is it a little bit less bullish?","Charles Bunch","Well, Dmitry, you've been breaking up a little bit on the connection here. But I'd say, we feel here, we talked maybe with a question from Bob Reitzes we talked about Europe being a little bit better than our expectations, especially in automotive. Here in North America, we do feel I think about the same in terms of the positive outlooks that we're seeing in automotive and the construction markets.","As weather held that back we're looking at maybe some interest rate increases, the impact of the strong dollar and the weakness in the oil and gas sector here in the North America. I think overall it's probably helping us a little on the raw material side. But I would say North America is certainly not exceeding the expectations that we went into the year with some areas a little bit better.","So I'd say, it's consistent, but I would say that, we, and I, in particular, probably felt that lower oil and gasoline prices were going to be more of a stimulant for the economy. And I think we've seen a little bit of improvement in consumer confidence, but I wouldn't say from a retail sales level or other areas of GDP and we've seen an out performance as a result of lower oil and gasoline prices. So I would say, it's about where do we thought it would be.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I will now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Morales for any closing remarks.","End of Q&A","Vincent Morales","Thank you, Chris.

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Vincent J. Morales","Thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. Again, my name is Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations for PPG Industries. Welcome to PPG's second quarter 2012 financial teleconference.","Joining me on the call today from PPG are Chuck Bunch, our Chairman and CEO; Dave Navikas, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer; and Michael McGarry, Senior Vice President, Commodity Chemicals.","Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, July 19, 2012. As a reminder, based on our modified quarterly earnings call process, about 1 hour ago, we posted the detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on our Investor Center at www.ppg.com. Those slides are also available on the webcast site for this call. We do not read those prepared remarks during the call. However, during the call, Chuck will share his perspective on the results for the quarter, and then we will move directly to Q&A.","Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the company's current view about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements.","The presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided, in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC.","Now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch.","Charles E. Bunch","Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. PPG continued our earnings growth momentum during the second quarter, posting our highest earnings in the company's history. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.36 per share were up 11% versus last year and marked the eighth consecutive quarterly record for the company. We delivered these record results despite weakened European economic conditions and sizable negative impacts from weakening foreign currencies in Europe and Latin America. Continued organic growth in our coatings businesses in the United States and emerging regions, along with the favorable impact from our recent acquisitions, offset the reduced European sales results. As a result, aggregate coatings segment earnings grew by more than 10% versus last year.","The primary region for volume improvement was the United States, where our volume growth was fairly consistent with the first quarter. Sales growth in local currencies continued in the emerging regions, but was mixed by end-use market. Our effective cash deployment over the past year, including the performance of our recent acquisitions and a reduction of 5 million shares from our diluted share count, also contributed to the improved earnings.","To summarize our performance, PPG's record results in the quarter and over the past 2 years continue to provide measurable evidence of the strength of our global business portfolio, strong cash generation and the effective deployment of our cash. Looking ahead, we expect European demand to remain challenging. As such, we are aggressively implementing our previously announced restructuring programs, focused primarily in this region. Targeted savings from these programs is between $40 million and $50 million in the second half of this year. We expect growth in North America and Asia to continue but to remain inconsistent by end-use market.","Finally, we absorbed similar coatings input cost inflation in the first and second quarters, but we expect to offset the negative effects of this inflation in the second half of the year with selectively higher pricing and lower commodity input costs.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Now operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Chuck, I was wondering if you could amplify your thoughts on raw material cost trends in the back half of the year. Is it the case that the rate of inflation is decelerating or do you expect costs to actually come down sequentially in the back half? And then related to that, Chuck, if you could provide an update on the TiO2 pigment cost trends, please.","Charles E. Bunch","Okay, Kevin. What we expect in the second half of this year -- we  have absorbed a higher raw material cost in the first and second quarters. In the second half, we expect this trend to now stabilize with some declines in raw material prices by region and by commodity that will offset some of the price increases that we received in raw materials in the first half. In regards to the TiO2 pricing, we continue to see more favorable supply-demand environment and depending on the region, some changes in pricing for TiO2. In Asia, as we've commented in earlier calls, we have actually seen price declines in Asia in TiO2 pricing. That's versus not only the first half but also, in 2011. In Europe, we're seeing now not only stability, but some declines in the second half that we're anticipating even though we may be paying more in the second half of this year than we paid in the second half of 2011. And in North America, we're seeing stability around price trends going forward into the second half, albeit we are paying more today than we were in the second half of 2011, and prices for the second half in North America are still under discussion with our suppliers.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then as a second question, Chuck, if I may, with regard to cash deployment, you've indicated that repurchases will be on hold, pending completion of the Georgia Gulf deal. Can you speak though to M&A and what prospects you would see for acquisitions perhaps in the Architectural or Industrial Coatings arenas around the world?","Charles E. Bunch","We're still pursuing acquisitions in all regions and in all segments of the business, and we think that it is a more fertile opportunity for us in these changing economic conditions. But at this point, we do not have any imminent announcements for transactions. But we are continuing to pursue those across the board in our businesses.","Operator","And the next question comes from Bob Koort, Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Chuck, I think you talked a little bit about some uneven growth rates in Asia. I'm wondering if you can give us a little more granularity around that. What businesses there are still growing nicely, and which ones maybe have fallen off a bit from where you entered the year?","Charles E. Bunch","If you look at Asia, but in particular, our biggest market there is China. The strongest growth rates that we have seen have been in the automotive OEM coatings. Auto refinish has also been strong, as has packaging coatings. We're still seeing growth in our Industrial Coatings segment, although there are some end-use markets in Industrial Coatings that are not as strong. And in particular, I think the weakness that we have seen in China, but we've also seen it elsewhere in Asia. The Construction markets have slowed down there, and so both in Architectural but also, Industrial or other segments -- subsegments that are tied to the construction businesses, we have seen a slowdown in volume in China and more broadly, in Asia.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on Transitions, you talked a little bit about some customer inventory management. Is that something that can have a duration of more than a couple of months? And does this speak to general anxiety about consumer spend? Or where do you attribute the weakness there to?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, we think, in part, there was a strong restocking trend in the first quarter that we talked about that really boosted our results there, and I think what you're seeing now in the second quarter, and it could have a little longer duration, is a weakness in some of the consumer markets, especially in Europe, especially in markets in southern Europe. And I think some caution on the part of our customers in Optical business to carry inventories with their concern over economic conditions over the next few quarters.","Operator","The next question comes from John McNulty, Credit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones. On the Architectural EMEA business, the earnings were up nicely despite currency maybe impacting them in kind of the difficult economic environment. So I guess, I'm wondering how much, if any, of this improvement was tied to some of the early cost cuts and if some of the -- and the restructuring. And if some of that's coming in early, do you have any expectations for having a better number than what you originally were looking for the, for the year-end?","Charles E. Bunch","John, I would say that we are working on the restructuring program that we identified or outlined in the first quarter. I would say that we're on pace there. But by and large, the benefits that we're seeing here in the second quarter in our European architectural businesses are, I think, coming from good operations, no volume growth but slightly improved pricing and good operating discipline. We are starting to see the impact of some of the cost reduction, and that will be a little larger in the second half and into next year. But I would say it's too early, certainly, in the second quarter to have that really be measurable.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up, on the auto coatings side in the U.S., it sounded like you had a lot of strength. How much of that is tied to just the overall industry? And how much of it, would you say, if any, is tied to to maybe share gains that you're starting to see?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, the North American volume gains for our automotive coatings business have been very strong, and I would say that you have 2 effects. You have the market recovery. So we're seeing and we have been seeing this year 15% to 20% volume improvements in North America in overall builds. Some of that being helped by a year-earlier comparisons. Remember, we had the effect of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami that really restricted some of the production in the second quarter of last year. But I would say that our strength in North America has been across the board. Yes, a recovery with the Japanese-based OEM manufacturers, but clearly we're seeing, I think, a general improvement in the overall automotive OEM market, the tsunami recovery. And actually something that we've talked about in a number of earlier calls where you're seeing more production moved here to North America, both on the part of the Japanese-based manufacturers, but the Koreans are now producing here. And we've seen solid growth in North American manufacturing for the European-based companies, such as the Germans, the BMWs, Mercedes, VW, they're all here now and ramping up production. So I think you have the effect -- all 3 of those effects. I would say our improvement is more tied to those improvements. We think we'll get share, certainly our share and probably more as we move through this cycle. But I think it is the overall improvement in the business that we're benefiting from in North America.","Operator","And the next question we have comes from David Begleiter, Deutsche Bank. .","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Chuck, just in terms of U.S. demand trends, have you seen any weakening in the last few weeks or towards the end of June?","Charles E. Bunch","In our businesses?","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, generally speaking, given some of the macro headlines and any sense the U.S. is beginning to slow down at all.","Charles E. Bunch","Our view is that, obviously, the first quarter had strong growth year-over-year. We talked about some of the seasonality, the better weather, the caution at the end of last year around inventories. So the first quarter was stronger in terms of overall volume growth. But we've seen volume growth here in North America in the second quarter, and I would say we haven't seen any pullback or correction over the last few weeks or the last month. I would say it's been pretty steady growth even if it's not at the same level that we saw in a year-over-year basis in the first quarter.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just on TiO2, Chuck, you talk about your target reduced consumption by 5% this year and 10% next year. Are you on track? Are you ahead of schedule?","Charles E. Bunch","We said we identified for this year a 4% to 6% reduction in TiO2 consumption on a similar-volume basis. Over the first half, we were a little over 2% in terms of our more efficient use of TiO2 in our formulation, so we're on track. We're still focused on this area even if the supply-demand and pricing environment has stabilized, but we're still focused. And these projects are still delivering, so so we think that we'll be within that range in terms of overall improvement in productivity for our use of TiO2.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And last, Chuck -- last thing, Chuck, given TiO2 prices rolling over in Europe and Asia, I would think you would be asking your guys to push for price decreases in the U.S. Are you and do you expect U.S. prices to be down for TiO2 in the back half of the year versus the first half of the year?","Charles E. Bunch","We're -- as I said in my earlier comments, we're in discussion right now on TiO2 pricing here in North America with our suppliers. And at this point, I don't have any further commentary on the outcomes. They're still undecided.","Operator","And the next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas, JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Are there any constraints on share repurchase following Reverse Morris Trust transaction? And if there are, do they last for, I don't know, 2 years? Or are there no constraints?","David B. Navikas","Jeff, this is Dave Navikas. So there are -- Jeff, because of the need that we have to maintain the tax-free status of the transaction and the distribution of at least 50.1% of the newly merged company stock to PPG shareholders, there are some complicated tax rules for dealing with equity transactions during the 2-year period leading up to the closing of this transaction. And given that we're starting at the 50.5% threshold, we've got a very small cushion for any of our shares to be taken out of this calculation. So on advice of counsel because of that close margin, we won't be engaging any share repurchase from now until we close the transaction, either late this year or in the first quarter of next.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I don't think I perfectly followed you. So over the next 2-year period, does this transaction mean that you're really inhibited in what you can repurchase further?","David B. Navikas","There's only an issue, Jeff, between now and when the transaction closes. Once the transaction closes, we'll be able to continue to buy back stock at that time.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then, lastly, your sales were flat to down year-over-year. And your cost of sales was also flat to down, and your volumes overall didn't grow. So does that mean that there really wasn't much raw material inflation that you felt in the quarter since your cost of goods sold went down a little bit?","Charles E. Bunch","The other complicating factor in there, Jeff, is currency conversion, and cost of sales went down in part because the weakened currencies abroad, and we brought those back. And then that affected, basically, every line of the income statement. We did still see, on an inflationary perspective, somewhere in the 3% to 5% inflation range versus last year, which was fairly consistent with the first quarter for coatings raw material input costs.","Operator","And the next question we have comes from Don Carson, Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Chuck, in the first quarter, your strong U.S. architectural volumes suggested  that you were taking share, particularly at the big box, and I know you had some tough comps given the ramp-up of Olympic ONE. But is that a correct observation that you're taking share at the big box? And maybe you can just comment on trends in your other architectural distribution channels in the U.S.","Charles E. Bunch","Well, Don, as you said, in the second quarter of last year, we did have a pipeline fill for Olympic ONE. So I would say that it is difficult for us to determine exactly what the share position has been for us in the channels. We haven't seen all of the reports out. I would say that as we looked -- this year, we've had a very strong exterior stain year. We've seen volume recovery in every channel. So we're up mid-single digits in terms of volume in our channels -- all our channels, if you exclude this pipeline fill for Olympic ONE in -- at Lowe's or in the national account channel. So we feel we had good volume growth. We haven't seen everything out there yet in terms of our customers and some of our competitors. So I would say it's too early for us to comment, but we have seen a nice volume improvement. The business is, I think, showing some good momentum, and we're pleased with the pace of our performance here in the architectural business.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And how big a part has Olympic ONE been? What percentage would that be of your Lowe's business now? And do you think, in this market, there's still a shift down in price point and that, that's benefiting an Olympic ONE given how it's positioned versus some of those competitors?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, we wouldn't comment on how volume is going between price points or we just feel that Olympic ONE has been well received by both our direct customers and the consumers. They're seeing the value in the product and the way it's been positioned and marketed. We think it's a great can of paint, and so I would say that, right now, it's clearly a strong positive for our business.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And then just switching to one of your smaller businesses, on packaging. We've heard of some weakness in Europe. If you can just comment how that business is there. And are you gaining share in your North American packaging business given some of the new products you've come out with?","Charles E. Bunch","For us, again, share, on a short-term basis, is harder for us to track in this business. I would say that if you looked at regionally for packaging coatings, the strongest region, by far, is the Asian, so our Asian business, in particular China. Europe overall has not been as strong. We haven't seen volume growth there. But again, one of the big development opportunities is the BPA non-intend or BPA-free coatings in our food and beverage can businesses. And here, we think we're making excellent progress in terms of our products and their qualification, and I think this will be an opportunity for us to grow the packaging coatings space here in the near term and in the years to come because we're really providing a solution now for our customers because many of the consumers are more concerned about BPA in food and beverage coatings. And we are providing a real technological solution, which is one of the hallmarks for PPG and one of the things that we feel we do best.","Operator","The next question comes from Duffy Fischer of Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","If you look at your 3 coatings businesses, can you talk about the relative differences in those businesses, what we should expect kind of from incremental margins on a new dollar of volume-based sales growth?","David B. Navikas","Let me try to answer that, Duffy. The businesses that have, right now, the heavier fixed costs load would be the architectural businesses. They have store network. That's a bigger fixed cost as opposed to some of our industrial businesses. Obviously, some of our best businesses, which, we have said historically, have been aerospace, auto refinish, they're higher margins. We continue to argue for a solid incremental margin on that additional sales dollar. So those would be the -- right now, those would be the businesses with the most opportunity for incremental sales.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then could you comment on the strength or weakness you're seeing in the European auto industry in particular?","Charles E. Bunch","For us, European OEM production was the weakest end-use market or region. It's both the weakest end-use market in Europe, but it was also the weakest region and really the biggest decline. So we were looking at mid- to high-single digit declines in automotive production in Europe. That wasn't in every country or among every producer, and clearly, the Germans had showed more strength than the non-German-based producers. We had some markets in addition to Germany that were stronger, Russia and the U.K. But we saw weakness in what we would call southern Europe, and the majority of the declines in the OEM build rates were among, let's call them, the mid-tier or the middle market producers in Europe. But certainly, it was a very weak market in the first and second quarter of this year.","David B. Navikas","If I could just append to that even though Europe was weak for auto OEM, globally, that was one of our strongest markets for the company because of the strong growth in the U.S. and strong growth that Chuck mentioned in Asia. So those 2 have more than offset the European weakness.","Operator","The next question we have comes from Nils Wallin, CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","First is really on Europe. It seems like volumes are -- volume declines are accelerating, and I'm curious to know whether you believe, in the third or fourth quarter, we will see that acceleration continue or you -- we're kind of at the bottom here, and it will abate. But what are you seeing so far this quarter? And what is your expectation for the remainder of the year in terms of European volumes?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, we saw, in many of our markets, including the auto OEM market that we just talked about, that the second quarter was as weak or actually slightly weaker than the first quarter. The third quarter is a little more problematic, especially at this time of the summer, to determine what are the actual trends. You got vacation season in July and August, can be difficult months to gauge volume trends. So right now, we feel it's too early to say. But we do not feel, with the information that we have, that these volume declines are accelerating from what we saw in a fairly weak second quarter. But we'll be in a better position to follow these trends in Europe as we get into September and October. But we have not seen any change for the worse in this early part of the third quarter.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. In terms of volumes in your architectural business, I don't -- I apologize if I missed this. Did you say that across all the channels it was relatively the same in North America, your company stores, your independent distributors and in the third -- and in the big box? Is that true?","Charles E. Bunch","Yes, we said that, with the exception of the pipeline fill we had last year with the new product introduction in the national accounts channel. But excluding that, volume trends were similar across the channels.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. Now kind of more of a strategic question. Obviously, this nice acquisition that you announced today, when you look at the reconstituted PPG in the future, how do you -- one of the areas relative to some of your competitors seems to be as much of a greater exposure on the retail side in architectural. Is there any interest in bulking that up once the transaction is complete or at least, changing the mix there?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, I should clarify what we announced was actually more of a divestiture than an acquisition.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Sorry, sorry. My apologies.","Charles E. Bunch","In terms of our channel strategy, if you look on a global basis, we have a strong store and dealer network in Europe. And there with volume trends -- we're committed to the channel. It's been as you've seen. Our results have been, we think, very good under what have been difficult economic circumstances, so good performance there. So we're still committed to the -- to that store channel and our relationships with the independent dealers here in North America. We are participating in all 3 channels. We think that there are customers that are best served in each one of these channels that we participate in and that we would -- we expect to continue our participation and growth in all 3 channels here in North America.","Operator","And that's the end of today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call...","Vincent J. Morales","No, no, Andrew. We still have time.","Operator","The next question that we have is from Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Going back to the architectural EMEA business, did the wet weather in Europe have any impact on your business, any measurable impact? I know it's affected other industries, and apparently, it has been a very, very wet summer across northern Europe. Just curious if it had any impact on you.","Charles E. Bunch","Well, we think that the weather in Europe has kind of been the reverse of what we've experienced here with all this hot, dry weather here. They have had a colder, rainier summer. We think it may have had some impact, although, arguably, we've probably seen more of an impact in Europe from just the challenging economic conditions. But weather may have been a factor in terms of some of the volume weakness that we have. But it's really difficult for us to determine that.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then, in your prepared comments, you cited the Argentinian import policy change by the government there. Can you just expand on that and how it impacted your auto refinish business?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, in Argentina, for those of you who haven't followed it, they have changed a number of their economic policies. And in fact, if you're bringing in material into Argentina now, you need an import license. Previously, you had that  southern cone of South America that was operating as a free-trade zone, so in our businesses, we had focused many of our production and manufacturing activities in Brazil. And we were, let's call it, a net importer into Argentina across many of our businesses. We have one manufacturing facility in Argentina, but by and large, in refinish in particular, we were a net importer. And with these new government policies, then you had to apply for an import license, so that had the effect in the second quarter of really slowing things down because you had to take the additional step then of asking for, in effect, permission to bring in goods from outside of Argentina, whether it was Brazil or outside of South America. And that delay in approvals, especially with the rapid change of the policy, I think a lot of manufacturers were caught offguard. And I think the government was initially not prepared to handle the volume of requests. So we saw, in the second quarter, our volumes declined, especially in those businesses like refinish, where we were bringing in most of the material from outside the country. What has happened subsequently here in July, over the last few weeks, I think the government is catching up now with a lot of the permitting requests. We are getting approvals now, and we see that balancing out over the coming quarters. So we think that it will not have the same negative impact that we certainly saw in the second quarter for our Argentinian business.","Operator","And the next question comes from Ivan Marcuse, KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Most of them have been answered, and you may have already answered this one. But in the second quarter, what were your raw materials up on a year-over-year basis?","Charles E. Bunch","Ivan, they were up between 3% and 5%, which, again, was a trend that we saw in the first quarter.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great, and then if you -- looking at your China business. I know it's relatively small on the architectural side. Did you see -- is construction over there getting worse or is it about the same as it has been, on a sequential basis, the last couple of quarters? Or has there been any sort of maybe signs that it is getting better?","Charles E. Bunch","We have not seen -- again, we're a very small player through a joint venture in Italy. You're saying, that was China or...","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Yes, China, sorry.","Charles E. Bunch","In China, we are, again, a small player. We saw things stabilize for our business, but because we are relatively small, I'm not sure that you can take trends in our business to be an overall indicator. But what we see generally is that there's not any significant improvement in volumes in the construction industry in China. In fact, as we look at some of our other industrial businesses that touch on construction markets, those have been -- they continued weak in the second quarter, and we did not see any improvement as we went through that first half of the year.","Operator","And the next question we have comes from John Roberts, Buckingham Research.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","The glass segment had up 4% volume, and since fiberglass was down, was the flat glass business up upper-single digits?","Charles E. Bunch","The flat glass business did improve over the second quarter of last year. We saw, however, weakness in our fiberglass business now in 2 specific areas. Remember, this is more of a global business than our flat glass business, which is North American commercial construction-related. So we had some weakness in fiberglass in our European region. And also, we participate in a joint venture in Asia that is primarily a printed circuit board into the electronics market, and there, we did see weakness in the electronics or consumer electronics space that affected our fiberglass business, in addition to that European weakness.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Still on that, Chuck, I'm just thinking if flat glass had volume that was up, let's say, upper-single digits perhaps, and natural gas costs were down a lot year-over-year for the flat glass business, I would have thought it would have had more earnings leverage to offset the fiberglass weakness.","Michael H. McGarry","John, the volumes -- just to finish the volume story. Part of those volume gains for our flat glass business were selling into solar, and that is a jagged type of -- still a jagged type of end market. There's inventory fleshed out and then picked up. We did have more solar sales, part of that's a little bit of market share gain. The gas cost was fairly comparable sequentially, down a little bit year-over-year, but they're not as big as a gas consumer as our commodity chemical businesses. So that would have -- did have a positive impact, but not as, much as you would expect from like our chemical business.","Operator","The next question we have is from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.","Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This is Rob Walker on for Laurence. I guess, first, have you seen any indication of slowing in auto OEM globally? And just broadly, can you talk to your level of confidence in growth in that end market?","Charles E. Bunch","We're still seeing growth globally. Again, we were up some 5% globally. We still see good strength here in North America, as we've been talking about. Japan is rebounding from the tsunami effects of the second quarter of last year. China, although it's not the double-digit growth that we've seen over the last few years, we're up 5% to 7%, and sales have been solid in China. Europe is the weakest link, and we've talked about mid- to higher-single digit declines in the European automotive production. And I would -- we haven't seen any deterioration from what's arguably a fairly weak level. And in South America, the volumes have weakened there as well. That's not the biggest market. And if you look at Mexico, they're up significantly because they're more tied to the North American production, and they're really participating in this plus-20% kind of growth that we've seen. So I would say, overall, we still feel good about the automotive OEM market, with the caveat that we've got a couple of weak regions.","Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just broadly to the segment Industrial Coatings, can you talk about your visibility there in terms of how are customers feeling about their backlogs?","Charles E. Bunch","I would say, in general, Industrial Coatings is a fairly broad-based reporting segment in terms of end-use markets. So automotive, we've -- automotive parts that are part of industrial, they will track what we've just talked about in OEM production. We see some recovery in kind of the industrial production indicators and some markets, though tied to construction outside of North America. So all the construction-related markets for -- including coil and extrusion for industrial in North America, are pretty solid, but outside, fairly weak. Consumer electronics has been weaker in Asia. That's primarily an Asian story. So it is a mix with, again, more of a regional flavor, with things in North America working pretty well to varying degrees across the different end-use markets. And outside of North America then, you get into just about everything, and Europe is weaker to some degree. Asia, it's mixed by end-use market, so it just depends. And industrial probably touches almost every end-use market that we participate in. And so I would say those trends are confirmed for that business, as well as overall for the company.","Operator","And the next question we have comes from Dmitry Silversteyn from Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","A couple of questions in the businesses that haven't been talked about yet. You mentioned in your press release and in your prepared remarks about inventory correction in the Optical segment causing that division to deliver not quite a strong result as it has in the past. Has that inventory correction run its base? And what do you expect for growth on the other side of the correction? Usually, when people correct inventories, it's because they overestimated the growth rate of their markets and now they're trying to rightsize it. Should we expect growth in the other side of the correction, assuming it's over this quarter, to be somewhat slower than it's been in the recent quarters?","Charles E. Bunch","Yes, if we -- I would just clarify the question in the terms that we didn't see as much sales growth in that business unit. But from an overall profitability and margin performance, they had a very strong second quarter in Optical and Specialty Materials. In the Optical business, again, some weaker volume and currency trends were working against the business in markets like Europe or even in South America. We think that there is caution in the customer base, again, focused on Europe and some of the other markets where the volume trends probably are going to -- the growth, we think, will be lower as we try to get through some of these more challenging economic conditions in some of the regions. So I would say that we may continue to have, for a short period of time, maybe another quarter or so of reduced growth expectations. But we still feel good about the business and the other segments in specialty materials, including our precipitated silica business. The optical materials business and the Teslin inorganic printing material business had very solid quarters as well, so they were key contributors to the overall performance of that segment.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","That's helpful, Chuck. Thanks a lot for the color. Second question. On the automotive market -- automotive OEM market, particularly in the U.S., there have been some headlines about manufacturers perhaps taking shorter downtimes this summer or in some cases, may be eliminating them in certain plants to keep up with what you've described and what, certainly, we're seeing as a pretty robust demand in the market. Will that result in sort of diminished seasonality that you would typically see between the second and third quarter? Or is kind of the European deceleration going to overwhelm that and we should expect sort of a normal seasonality second to third quarter?","Charles E. Bunch","I think we should -- you should expect normal seasonality. I think you described it correctly. We're going to see more strength here in North America, probably a little less strength, just from a seasonal standpoint not from an overall market standpoint, in Europe because of the vacation shutdowns. But I don't think you're going to see a marked deviation in trend in the business.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Fair enough. And then finally, in your comments about the Industrial Coatings business -- or actually, I think it was about coatings in general for the second half of the year. You talked about seeing some raw material environment being more benign, and then, you referred to selective price increases. I'm just trying to understand, given that demand is not particularly robust with the exception of 1 or 2 channels and geographies and you don't experience the raw material pressure, what would be the justification and how do you think customers will receive price increase announcement in the second half of the year? Or is this going to be just in markets that are roaring and the supply is tight and you just have sort of the power to raise prices?","Charles E. Bunch","I would think that my remarks are more tied to price increases that have -- that reflect the earlier raw material inflation that we experienced. And again, as we've commented, our prices today, here in the third quarter, our raw material prices, are higher on average than they were at the beginning of the year. So that there is still -- we see some stability there, and we are still trying to recapture, in some markets or regions, the raw material price increases that we experienced in 2011 or before and also, in the first half of this year.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","But is it reasonable to expect these price actions to be successful given that your customers are looking at the propylene price chart same as you are and the TiO2 price chart same as you are and maybe dragging their feet for another month and then maybe they don't have to pay those prices?","David B. Navikas","I think, Dmitry, that's -- we certainly call them selective pricing, and again, there -- I think, you described it right. There are markets where we feel there is opportunity to recapture some of this inflation.","Operator","The next question comes from Gregg Goodnight, UBS.","Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Your currency headwind in the second quarter, how is it looking thus far in third quarter? What is your expectation?","David B. Navikas","Well, part of the headwind in the second quarter, Gregg, really reflects the strength of the euro and Latin American currencies last year, so the comparable period was extremely difficult. And then I think the euro -- our euro conversion rate in the second quarter of 2011 was 1.44. I think we ended this quarter like 1.28. The conversion in the third quarter came down last year, so the comparable period is not as difficult. That will lessen, if all things were equal, that will lessen the impact on a year-over-year basis. Sequentially, it's fairly comparable.","Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. Second question, I saw where you recently got approval from Indian authorities to expand this -- your JV, Asian Paints Limited. Could you give us some help in terms of sizing the opportunity and what would be the timing of an expansion if you decided to move forward with it?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, we've had a long-term joint venture with Asian Paints. It's called Asian PPG. That is primarily participates in the automotive OEM refinish and selected segments of the industrial business. The announcement with Asian Paints is now we're going to have 2 joint ventures: one a majority-owned or controlled venture of PPG, primarily with the automotive refinish and industrial segment; and another a majority-owned and controlled Asian Paints joint venture that'll be more in the distribution of protective and marine coatings and light industrial. But what you're going to see different is we will begin this quarter, the third quarter, in consolidating the sales from the newly formed or majority-owned PPG joint venture. It won't have a material effect on the earnings because we've been reporting 50% of the earnings from the joint ventures in previous years. But you'll see some growth in our sales line now as we consolidate those sales of the new joint venture.","Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Last question, if I could. True to your word on investor day, you have stepped up your activity in licensing TiO2 technology with Argex in Canada and your recent Chinese announcement. My question to you is, what do you think the likelihood is that a new grassroots TiO2 plant based on your technology will happen in the next 5 years? Not naming any specific potential licensors, but what do you think the probability of that is?","Charles E. Bunch","Well, I'd hate to speculate on what the probability is. But obviously, in the case of Argex, we think they have a viable technology. We've been working with them to validate the technology, and it's used on our products. They have already access to the mining rights for these materials. I would say given a longer time frame, like 5 years, I would say that is -- I would give that a higher level of probability. In the case of potential Chinese TiO2 producers, I would say that these plants require a lot of investment, a lot of technology. But I would -- as we've seen over -- the growth in China across a broad array of industrial commodities and we participated in what we think is a tremendous growth story in China in industrial markets. But I would not discount the probability of -- what are now a number of TiO2 producers in China, albeit primarily in the sulfate grades. But I would not discount their ability to develop the chloride technology in the coming years and get into production within the kind of time frame that you're talking.","Operator","The next question we have comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Chuck, what kind of same-store sales growth are you seeing in your stores business? And how does that compare -- how does that volume growth compare with your big boxes business?","Charles E. Bunch","Yes, as I said earlier, P.J., our volume growth in the second quarter was comparable across all 3 channels. We've talked about mid-single digit kind of growth with the exception of the, let's call it, the pipeline fill last year in the second quarter in the national accounts channel. So I would say we saw a fairly consistent growth across the channels here in North America.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So you're not seeing the contractor business growing faster than the DIY business currently?","Charles E. Bunch","I would say as I -- again, we saw comparable volume growth across the channels. It's still -- I would say I haven't seen a significant deviation in the trends. Obviously, we go through -- we go to market in all the end-use markets and the channels, and so I would say it's been fairly consistent.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And lastly, how much Chinese TiO2 are you currently buying?","Michael H. McGarry","Our total spend, P.J., it's high-single and low-double digit percentages.","Operator","The next question comes from Saul Ludwig, North Coast Research.","Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research","Which segments will benefit from the $40 million to $50 million in cost savings in the second half of the year?","David B. Navikas","Saul, we had, in our last quarterly call, a schedule that broke that out for the second half of 2012 and also, for all of 2013. We didn't replicate that here, but it's available on our website.","Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research","Okay. Looking at this sequentially, normally, you have lower earnings in your third quarter than you do in the second quarter, and that's been a pattern for most years. And you've talked about the sort of volume trends that you're expecting in the third quarter to be comparable to what you've seen in the second quarter. But when we look toward the back end of the year, it sounds like a, you're going to have the cost savings in the back end of the year that you didn't really have in the second quarter, and that your price-to-raws relationship, because of stability in pricing and in -- stability in raws and increases in pricing, should be somewhat more favorable in the back end of the year than it was in the first half of the year. So would that suggest that the seasonal pattern of earnings might be a little different, maybe more favorable than what it has been on a historical basis?","David B. Navikas","So the most pronounced impact on earnings is just the volume movements among the quarters. So if we're not buying product, regardless of the price as it is, we're not getting the benefit. So I agree with the general theory that you outlined that we should see some more favorable economics in the second half versus the first half, but we still need volume to apply to those economics.","Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research","Okay, and then finally, Dyrup contributed about $60 million in revenue in the quarter, and we are earlier discussing about the improvement in earnings in EMEA in the second quarter. Did Dyrup contribute $6 million, $7 million, $8 million of EBIT in the quarter that obviously you didn't have a year ago?","David B. Navikas","Yes, that's a good round number, so...","Operator","The next question comes from Bill Young, Chemspeak.","William Young","Many of the economists and certainly, the data collectors have indicated that the housing market seems to have bottomed here in the U.S. and starts are improving. And I realize an awful lot of the architectural goes into existing units. But are there any signs on the horizon from your perspective that would be consistent with these observations? Or how long would it take for PPG to see the impact?","Charles E. Bunch","I'm not sure I understand exactly, Bill. But as you referenced, the repair and the remodeling part of the paint market in architectural is, by far, the biggest share of the overall volume, and I think you are seeing some improvements there. The indicators have been, by and large, positive, and they've stayed that way most of the year. I think initially, in the first quarter, we said, \"Well, there is some weather impact,\" but most of the indicators have still stayed positive. The biggest indicator is sales of existing homes or existing home resales. Those have been positive, so I think that is a good indicator for the architectural market here. We've seen some year-over-year growth in new home construction, albeit on some very low levels, so that's a positive. Commercial construction, on the new OE -- let's call it new commercial construction, it's been a weaker market. We participate in that, both on the coatings side and also, in our flat glass business. So that has not really ramped up as much, but overall commercial construction, we think, is going to lag a little bit this improvement in residential. So I would agree with you, most of the signs are favorable. And it should be a good news for us, and that's the way we feel, although it's not -- this is not a straight line up for us. And I think we're going to see slow but steady improvement over the next few years in this business.","Operator","And I would now like to turn the call back over to Chuck Bunch for closing remarks.","Vincent J. Morales","Andrew, I'm doing the closing remarks. I just want to thank everybody for their time in the call today. And if you'll need further questions, please contact me in Investor Relations.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Scott Minder, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Scott Minder","Good afternoon. This is Scott Minder, Director of Investor Relations. We appreciate your interest in PPG Industries and welcome you to this teleconference to review PPG\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results. Joining me on the call from PPG are Michael McGarry, President and Chief Executive Officer, Frank Sklarsky, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Vince Morales, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Our comments relates to the financial information released on Thursday, January 21, 2015.","I will remind everybody that we posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the investor center of our Web site ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the opening comments Michael will make momentarily. Following Michael\u2019s perspective on the Company\u2019s results for the quarter and for the full year, a brief financial update from Frank we will move to a Q&A session.","Both the prepared commentary and discussions during this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the Company\u2019s current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG\u2019s operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ.

For additional information, please refer to PPG\u2019s filings with the SEC.","Now, let me introduce PPG\u2019s President and CEO, Michael McGarry.","Michael McGarry","Thank you, Scott and good afternoon everyone. Today we reported fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results. For the fourth quarter, our net sales were 3.7 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.23. While our net sales were flat with prior year, our sales in local currencies increased about 7% with higher sales volumes year-over-year and continued benefit from acquisition-related sales. These sales increases were offset by persistent unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts.","For the quarter, the unfavorable currency translation impact totaled about $250 million of sales and approximately $25 million on pretax income. Our sales volume growth in the quarter of nearly 2% represented our highest growth rate of the year. This solid volume growth stemmed from our ability to gain larger share of our customers\u2019 wallets through their adoption of new or leading PPG technologies. In addition, we benefited from broadening improvement in European demand as our volumes in this region steadily improved in each quarter of 2015. We grew coatings volume to 1% a year from the first quarter and steadily improved to 3% in the fourth quarter.","We also return to solid mid single-digit percentage growth rate in Asia, as demand in that region improved remarkably in comparison with a weaker third quarter. Volume trends in the Americas were mixed with countries, but consistent with the prior levels. We achieved organic growth in the U.S. and Mexico that was offset with lower year-over-year sales volumes in Canada and several South American countries. Our sales volume growth was broad-based across our business portfolio led by Industrial Coating segment, which grew by mid single-digit percentage. We delivered sales volume gains in all our business units within the segments, including in our general industrial business where we reversed the negative sales volume trend experienced in the second and third quarters.","Also, the automotive OEM industry growth rate improved sequentially and year-over-year and our automotive OEM Coatings business continue to grow at a rate above the industry average. Brand analysis segment our Packaging Coatings business continues to benefit from industry move to new interior can coatings. Customer adoption of Innovel our new interior can coating technology remain strong, supporting our mid single-digit percentage growth in that business.","In the Performance Coatings segment, automotive refinish, protective and marine coatings and architectural coatings EMEA grew sales volumes. Growth in architectural coatings in Mexico and the U.S. was offset by weaker demand in Canada, Brazil and China. Aerospace Coatings sales volume declined in relation to a strong growth in the prior year and due to year-over-year differences and certain customer order balance. This was the first decline in aerospace volumes in quite some time, and we expect the business to return to growth in 2016.","Finally, Glass segment sales volumes grew slightly, principally due to higher flat glass demand, supplementing the Company\u2019s volume growth in the quarter for acquisition-related sales gains of about 5% coming primarily from the Comex acquisition, which we completed in November 2014. For the fourth quarter we generally experience normal, seasonal sales trends in all our businesses and regions. Lastly, overall selling prices were flat which was consistent with our expectations communicated at the beginning of the year.","From an earnings perspective, our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.23 improved 17% versus the prior year. We accomplished this despite the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. We delivered higher year-over-year income in each reporting segment due to our improving sales volumes and an unwavering focus on cost, supplemented by earnings accretive acquisitions. With respect to costs and addressing to achieving our acquisition-related cost synergies, we also realized initial benefits from our previously announced business restructuring. We will continue to recognize additional restructuring related savings in 2016 as we implement these actions.","In addition to cash deployed on acquisitions, we also repurchased $250 million of PPG\u2019s stock in the first quarter. This brings our full share repurchase total to $750 million or about 7 million shares. In the quarter, our average diluted shares outstanding were 2.3% lower versus the previous year\u2019s fourth quarter.","Now let me comment quickly on our full year results. On a full year basis, our sales were 15.3 billion consistent with the prior year despite 1.1 billion of negative foreign currency headwinds. Our full year sales volumes grew about 1% led by a modest but broadening growth throughout the region or throughout the year in Europe. Our adjusted earning per diluted shares was a record $5.69, up 17% versus our prior records and consistent with the adjusted EPS growth rates we achieved each quarter this year. For the quarter and full year, we\u2019ve pleased with our strong financial performance and overall operational execution and which was a modest year from a global economic growth perspective.","Over the year, we continue to execute on our strategic objectives. First and foremost was the successful integration of Comex acquisition. Now that we have lapped the acquisition\u2019s one year anniversary, let me say that Comex performance has been excellent on virtually every measure. Specifically, the business grew organically by high single-digit percentage in the first year of acquisition. We were successful during the year in capturing our targeted cost synergies. In addition during 2015, we added revenue synergy targets and began to work toward achievement of those increased objectives. These additions include the sale of PPG legacy products through the Comex concessionary network, but incremental sale synergies in Central America. Lastly, Comex has maintained a space of opening up a new concessionary store location, about every two days. They have added almost 190 locations in total for the year and I am proud to note that we recently reached a milestone of 4,000 store locations in Mexico. While this was a great accomplishment, we had still considerable organic growth opportunities ahead of us.","In addition to the Comex results, we also completed six smaller acquisitions throughout 2015 with the purchase price of over 400 million. During the year, we continued our legacy of strong cash generation with about 1.8 billion of cash generated from continuing operations. We also maintained our heritage of returning cash to our shareholders, delivering about 60% of the cash generated for the year or about 1.1 billion through dividends and share repurchases. I will remind everyone that we have paid a dividend for 116 consecutive years and have raised our annual per share dividend payout for 44 consecutive years, including a 7% per share dividend increase in April 2015, again a very strong full year performance for our Company.","As we enter 2016, we anticipate global economic growth will continue, but at a varied pace and mixed by major economies. In the Asia-Pacific region, growth will most likely remain varied throughout the year, but solid on a full year basis. Some of this 2016 year-over-year variation will be due to uneven 2015 regional volume patterns. A primary driver for growth in Asia is increased consumer spending, which is beneficial to PPG as this effects the majority of our products sold in the region. With strong growth in Asia and our quarter book for the first month of 2016 looks solid.","Economic expansion in North America is likely to continue at a modest pace, comparable to 2015, supported by multiple sectors. We anticipate continued improvement in construction markets in the U.S. and for Canada to stabilize a lower activity level realized in the second half of 2015.","Overall, industrial activity is expected to remain modest, but positive in comparison to the lower than anticipated 2015 level. We continue to expect solid organic growth in Mexico, supplemented by revenue related acquisition synergies. One item specific to PPG in 2016 is that we will continue with our multi-year U.S. architectural coatings branding initiatives. During 2016, we will be working with our major national retail or DIY customers on various modified branding initiatives. As a reminder in 2015 we\u2019ve rebranded our U.S. Company-owned store network to PGG Penns.","Moving to South America where our business is relatively small at about 3% of total sales. Demand in that region is expected to remain erratic and subdued. In Europe, we expect the economy to build on the broadening growth rates achieved in 2015, which would be beneficial to PPG at nearly 30% of our total sales are in that region. Favorable end-use market trends are expected to continue in 2016 particularly in automotive OEM coatings and industry build growth rates in Europe and in aggregate globally are expected to be positive for the year.","Given that, we have substantially reduced our cost structure in Europe. We expect incremental margins in that region to be in the 35% to 40% range. From an overall PPG perspective, we remain focused on delivering higher organic growth including continued commercialization of our innovative industry leading coatings technologies. Over the past several years, we have deployed many new or leading technologies for our end-used markets. These include our compact process technology and automotive OEM coatings, which has been widely adopted by customers as it reduces their facility, construction cost and ongoing operating cost.","Our water based automotive refinished coatings, which is now the leading water based product in the industry. We\u2019ve converted more auto body repair shops at waterborne coatings than the rest of the entire coatings industry combined. Our new Innovel interior can coatings realized growing customer adoption over the past year. This allowed us to deliver mid single-digit percentage growth, which is well above the packaging coatings industry growth rates, but more to come in 2016. And several new products in our Aerospace business and end-used market that is driven by new technologies that fit our technical strengths and capabilities, this is the primary reason why we have a leading position globally.","In addition to organic growth, we will continue to be aggressive on cost and productivity initiatives. As those of you who know us and followed us over the years, this is a never-ending quest for PPG. We are always looking for better ways to improve our cost structure.","Finally, our balance sheet remains strong, as we ended the year with cash and short-term investments of $1.5 billion. We intend to continue creating shareholders value through earnings accretive cash deployment. We remain on-pace with our prior commitments to deploy between $2 billion and $2.5 billion of cash in the years 2015 and 2016 combined, including the $1.15 billion we deployed in 2015. We expect coatings industry consolidation to continue in 2016. Our pipeline remains strong as we continue to vest potential acquisitions around the world. Share repurchases as well remain an integral part of our capital allocation strategy.","Let me conclude by saying that 2015 was an excellent year for PPG. We delivered 17% adjusted earnings per share growth despite fit currency headwinds and uneven regional economic growth. We are looking forward to another successful year in 2016.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Frank to review a few 2016 financial assumptions.","Frank Sklarsky","Thank you, Michael and good afternoon everyone. I am going to cover several items that will assist in modeling PPG\u2019s 2016 sales and earnings. We have included in today\u2019s presentation materials a summary of these financial assumptions on Slide Number 12. First is the carryover impact from the six acquisitions we completed throughout 2015. As we\u2019ve discussed in the past, these acquisitions are expected to achieve full year sales of about $400 million in 2016. We realized about $150 million of sales in 2015 for these acquisitions and expect an incremental 250 million in 2016. This incremental revenue will be classified in the acquisition category until each acquired entity reaches its respective acquisition anniversary day. After which time the energy\u2019s performance will be include in normal operating organic results. These acquisitions will typically achieve at or below the segment average margins and may be comfortably integrated into PPG.","Next, we will continue to experience the impact of foreign currency translation headwinds that is measures against the U.S. dollar. As a result, the Company expects that year-over-year currency translation will unfavorably impact sales by $550 million to $600 million and approximately two-thirds of this impact will be in the first half of the year. Pretax earnings will be impacted by about $70 million to $80 million with similar phasing for the year. These figures represent our current assumptions based on current exchange rates as of this week. Again these impacts are currency translation related given the nature of our business we typically do not incur significant transaction-related currency impacts.","The next item relates to the Company\u2019s pension and other post-retirement benefits or OPEB expenses. Following an increase in 2015, we are expecting these expenses to decrease by about $20 million to $25 million in 2016. This decrease stems from our adoption of a spilt discount rate methodology for measurement of pension cost components. Probably offset by slightly lower expecting return on assets. We expect slightly higher interest cost in 2016, including impact of our placement of long-term debt at the end of the first quarter of 2015, along with the changes in the cash balances. As a result, we expect a total of about $20 million of higher net interest expense year-over-year and we provided our quarterly net interest estimates on the presentation slide.","Next, we anticipate that the Company\u2019s 2016 tax rate on ongoing earnings from continuing operations would be in the range of 24.5% to 25.5%, the comparable rate for 2015 was 24.5%. This increase relates primarily to our regional earnings mix. Finally, as Michael mentioned the Company still anticipates cash deployment of 2 billion to 2.5 billion for the year\u2019s 2015 and 2016 combined for acquisitions and share repurchases. Once again, a summary of these financial assumptions is contained in the presentation materials provided for today\u2019s call.","This now concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And now operator would you please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instruction] The first question comes from John Roberts of UBS. Please go ahead.","John Roberts","Mike, normally M&A multiples decline when high yield debt market rates rise that private buyers kind of get back out of the market, are you seeing anything yet in your -- because you indicated you are still engaged with a number of potential acquisition targets, are you seeing any drop in evaluation multiples finally?","Michael McGarry","John I think the way I would answer that is we don\u2019t see as much competition from the private equity side. But we haven\u2019t seen any reduction in interest level from the strategics. So at this point in time, I think it\u2019s a little early. Now we\u2019d be happy if it moves that direction as you know, but right now we\u2019d just wait and see.","John Roberts","And then just very little commentary here on raw materials, given the massive drop that we have had in the base petroleum raw materials for your suppliers?","Michael McGarry","Yes John, consistent what we have said previously. We saw modest benefits in 3Q and 4Q. We\u2019ve not lapped those benefits yet. We have always said it takes six to nine months for us to pull through any savings. And yes before you ask, we expect our selling prices be flat for 2016 similar to 2015. So we work with our suppliers on a regular basis, we expect to be priced fairly and we have a whole purchasing team down there that knows that\u2019s top of my mind.","Operator","The next question comes from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Bob Koort","Michael you have mentioned some rebranding though the DIY channels, is that going to be at both your major partners and what are you going to do exactly there and is there -- you mentioned that you had already rebranded the store base, is there some savings that offsets that 15 million in incremental spend?","Michael McGarry","Well, Bob as you know we started the rebranding of our stores in 2015 that was very successful. That work has been completed so there is no carryover cost if you will from, for that. We do have agreement with our retail partners to begin some newer brandings. I don\u2019t want to get in the specifics because you have to wait until you see it on the shelves, but we also have some new wins for 2016 that will require replacing some products on the shelves. So all those costs are front loaded into Q1 prior to the paint season and so it makes sense, it\u2019s a onetime cost we wanted to make sure you were aware of.","Bob Koort","And if I follow-up I know you\u2019ve talked about reinvigorating organic growth of the Company following a lot of M&A work. Can you give us any updates on what you\u2019re doing or some specifics, maybe some anecdotes of successes and what\u2019s on the horizon?","Michael McGarry","Well I think you started to see some of this, this is work that\u2019s been underway for quite some period of time. We have a lot of leading technologies that we were focused on, but maybe there are some additional regional opportunities for us in emerging regions, that\u2019s one. You\u2019ve seen the significant adoption pickup rates in our Packaging business. That\u2019s been a good one, you have seen in our Refinish business, more water-based sales there and of course in our Automotive business you\u2019ve seen the most recent acquisitions that we\u2019ve done in REVOCOAT where those products are applied in the paint shop they had limited customers, a limited geographic scope and we\u2019re going to take that out globally and get some shares there as well, so we\u2019ve worked hard on trying to commercialize all this faster and I think that\u2019s where the focus has been. We also had some new wins that we\u2019ll be rolling out later in 2016 in commercial transport, so that\u2019s all good as well. So altogether I would say probably the most recent one that you probably haven\u2019t seen in the past that are popping up would be our Protected segment, in protected we had significant wins in dry-docking, significant wins in the LNG sector, significant wins in what we call our advantage products, tank lines and things like that. So those are ones that we\u2019re rolling out globally as well. So I say all positive.","Operator","The next question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David Begleiter","Mike your Performance Coatings volumes fell 1% in 2015, I know you\u2019re expecting growth this year, but what would you expect volume growth to be in Performance Coatings in 2016?","Michael McGarry","In Performance Coatings, I would say that we should break that down into the various segments, right, so the Aerospace we would say that would be low single-digits, so that is a reasonable number. If you look into PNC given our last quarter, I would say that it should continue to be low single-digits, so obviously the marine side is a problem. The order book for the big guys in Korea were 50% of what their expectations were, so marine new builds will continue to be the challenge, but the protective side should be really solid.","If you look at our refinished business miles driven, continue to go up, gas prices are down, distracted driving is up, insurance claims are up so refinish has done quite well, so I would just call that historically that would be a zero business, but I\u2019d say that\u2019s going to be a low single-digit kind of year. And that leaves architectural and I think again that\u2019s going to vary considerably by the region. We were pleased with the UK, Ireland, Benelux, Scandinavia all had good three plus kind of numbers that was good for us. France actually stabilized and so we saw a couple of months in the fourth quarter that were marginally up. It\u2019s a little too early to tell yet what we expect there, but I would say France I am more optimistic now than I\u2019ve been the last say nine to 15 months. So that\u2019s all good.","The Eastern European countries are -- they have had a lot of promotional challenges, but I would say overall it should come back around when you look at the U.S., we\u2019ve obviously had some good growth in the U.S. except for the dealer market, the dealer market continues to be challenged. Canada I think is probably going to stabilize, so I don\u2019t expect a lot in there. Mexico we\u2019ve had tremendous growth there we\u2019re going to continue to expect to grow two times GDP, the one negative in Mexico is the fact that government spending has started to slowdown with the price of oil dropping. I think Brazil\u2019s going to be a challenge, I think China\u2019s going to be a challenge, Australia should be good at least mid, I would low to mid single-digits in Australia. So that\u2019s a good market for us, so all-in-all I would say we should be at or above GDP for the Performance Coatings segment.","David Begleiter","Very good Mike, same off the Performance Coatings, would you expect margins to be up in 2016 versus \u201815 given where it was and if so would 6 basis points be a low bar somewhere?","Michael McGarry","David I think it\u2019s a little early to answer that question. In my opening commentary you saw that we said pricing would be flat. We expect this to continue to see modest raw material deflation, so I think putting a number on it is way too early.","Vince Morales","This is Vince. The one thing we do have is restructuring benefit, we -- it is not the restructuring plan for everybody\u2019s recollection in April 2015, we saw very modest benefits, but targeted for all of \u201815 and we expect incremental benefits in 2016.","Michael McGarry","Yes, that would be partially offset by changes in the corporate cost, which should effect the historical levels, but overall our goal would be to gradually accrete with return on sales percentage overall for the Company.","Operator","The next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Duffy Fischer","First question just there has been a lot kind of about and written with the MROs in the refinish side of things and how they\u2019re rolling that up. As you look back at \u201815, how\u2019s that played out for you guys and what would you look at going forward whether it would be a lot more on that consolidation and does that favor you, would this favor you, how would you talk about that?","Michael McGarry","Duffy, this is Michael. I think you\u2019re referring to the MSOs Multi Shop Operators, that trend line is for the big guys that continue to buy the little guys it is obviously a positive for us. Some of these smaller shops lack the same productivity that the bigger shops too, that\u2019s where we bring tremendous amount of value to our multi-shop operators, we are there to improve their business instead of getting nine cars out of the shop, they can get 10 cars out in a day. So, that\u2019s been a positive for us. So, I\u2019d tell you that our share in the U.S. continues to increase. I don\u2019t know how much more the MSOs will aggregate this year because when I think about it from a dead market, I\u2019m not sure how aggressive they\u2019re going to be in trying to raise more debt given this environment, but regardless we are totally supportive and it\u2019s been a good trend for PPG.","Duffy Fischer","And then, it is a little bit nitpicky but it might be $20 million or so, last year currency hedged you 250 million on revenue, 25 million on income which was about a 10% margin, this year at the midpoint you have kind of moved that up to a 13% or 14% margin, what\u2019s the difference in how the currency is impacting earnings relative to sales this year versus last year?","Frank Sklarsky","Duffy, this is Frank here. It really has to do with some of the mix of where the currency translation impacts ours so for instance, so we have much larger component of Comex this year and given the margin structures and given that relative portion of that business to the total PPG that\u2019s really where the difference is and so the last year the largest impact for instance was the euro, it is a little bit more balanced in terms of the currency impacts this year with maybe, with a higher proportion of Latin America so that would really be the difference.","Operator","The next question comes from Rory Blake of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Frank Mitsch","This is Frank Mitsch, setting in for Rory. Michael, in early September we met with you and you were talking about how you were concerned about 10% or just under 10% of the PPG portfolio mentioning Brazil, Russia heavy-duty equipment, et cetera. As we sit here today late mid to late January, what percent of the portfolio would you say you\u2019d put in that concerning category?","Michael McGarry","Well, I think Frank it probably hasn\u2019t changed too much. Russia, we still see that as a challenging market, Brazil is probably more challenged today than it used to be, heavy-duty equipment though is I\u2019d say stabilized at a lower level, but it is a down, but the negativeness of those numbers have significantly reduced. Besides that I\u2019d tell you that the rest of our businesses are pretty good. So, I don\u2019t know that I would -- change what you got as a concerned level.","Frank Mitsch","That\u2019s very interesting, obviously you see the broader market melting down expecting that the global economy is going to tank here, but based on the guidance that you have put forth it doesn\u2019t appear that that was the case and I\u2019ll take your response so you reiterate that that\u2019s terrific, if I could follow-up and some granularity to the productivity progress , I think you had talked about or could you talk about realizing about $70 million of benefits in 2016 and exiting the year at a run rate of $100 million, is that still a target or is it higher lower? How can you help us there?","Michael McGarry","Now Frank that\u2019s still above right, I know we said that was on the program, we would get a between $15 million and $20 million if you remember by the end of 2015 and that was accurate and the incremental 50 to 70 for 2016, bringing us a total of just under 100 million by the end of 2016 and then a little bit of trailing into \u201817 and those assumptions are still good and nevertheless we continue based on macro environment. We\u2019re always looking for additional rationalization opportunities and that will be a very strong focus for us.","Frank Mitsch","Frank you mentioned though that corporate expenses are expected to tick higher in \u201816, is that correct?","Frank Sklarsky","I\u2019d say that because of the fact that Q4 number was a little bit lower based on stock-based compensation based on stock-based compensation, it will probably revert back to something closer to what we\u2019ve seen historically in prior years as you get back into Q1 and for the remainder of the year.","Frank Mitsch","So, it\u2019s based on stock-based compensation, that\u2019s the delta?","Frank Sklarsky","That was one of the primary drivers really going down form the Q4 the prior year, yes.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Jeff Zekauskas","I think your pension funding this year was about $300 million. What you expect your pension funding for the next year?","Frank Sklarsky","Yes, the numbers will come down substantially. The number for this year really includes that large $250 million that we put in the first quarter to really shore up the funding of the U.S. plans. Those numbers will come down into the I would say the low double-digits in terms of cash funding for 2016. We have very little in terms of mandatory funding for the year. And that was really related to some of the international plans. So that cash funding will not be what I would call material way. We may have some wind ups that we do in various parts of the world and we\u2019ll be very transparent about those when those happen, but on a trend basis that 250 was probably an anomaly.","Jeff Zekauskas","In thinking about your overall volume growth for 2015, the geographic area that you had your difficulties in was North America, that is Europe and Asia grew 2% or 3% and the U.S. and Canada was down 1%. Can you diagnose what went wrong in the U.S. and Canada in 2015? And how you expect it to be different than 2016?","Michael McGarry","Let\u2019s start with Canada first. I mean, clearly, the oil business has the first material impact on that and that was a challenge for us. I would say that the slowing Canadian economy was also a challenge for us. When you shipped into the U.S., clearly we told you that the biggest challenge we had in the third quarter was the destocking that we saw due to the weather challenges we had in May and June. We have a very large stain [ph] business, if you will, in our architectural business. So that was one. Then, you had heavy duty equipment and industrial was the challenge. So those were all the negatives. We also had the slowing in the industrial production. So, when you factor that in and look at what we\u2019re looking at for 2016, I am not nearly as pessimistic, I think industrial production will be more steady. You certainly see the housing market continuing to progress. I would say that our rebranding initiatives in our architectural business is a positive, the line reviews that we had with the major retail DIY chains were also positive. So, I am coming in the year feeling better about the U.S. So that would be my explanation.","Operator","The next question comes from P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Please go ahead.","P.J. Juvekar","Mike, I want to go back to some of your broader comments that you made. You talked about broadening out of the recovery in Europe, which is not something we have heard a lot about. You talked about auto sales growing from the mid $17 million -- or mid-17 million unit level. Do you think that\u2019s sustainable given some cautious commentary from auto companies and auto parts companies so far?","Michael McGarry","Well, one of the leading indicators we look at of course is registrations and the various countries. And if you look at registrations, they have been ahead of builds and sales in the fourth quarter were substantially ahead of builds. So, inventory wise, even though Europe historically doesn\u2019t keep much inventory, we still think that\u2019s a positive. If you look in the southern countries, in Europe, they all had very high growth rates, albeit coming off an extremely low base. But that was our positive. So, I\u2019d say unlike in the U.S. where we\u2019re in the late innings in the U.S. for automotive, I\u2019d say in Europe we\u2019re more like the middle innings there. So, I think that\u2019s just our viewpoint. Obviously, we could be wrong P.J., but I think that\u2019s our take on it.","P.J. Juvekar","And my second question is on TiO2. Can you just give us an update on where does the Henan Billions plan stand on chloride TiO2? And would you be willing to license that technology to other companies in China?","Michael McGarry","So P.J., you probably saw our press release. We qualified the material, let\u2019s call it in October. We had shipments on the water. We started commercially using the material in early December. More product is on the water going to other locations outside the U.S. So, it\u2019s going to get qualified in Mexico; it\u2019s getting qualified in Europe. The bottom line is they are making good products, their consistency is getting better. And we are pleased with what we are seeing. We have most favored nations with them, so that\u2019s the positive for us as well.","As far as licensing, no one else has approached us. But clearly, as we have demonstrated and people I think were a little bit concerned about but we have demonstrated that we are able to support them with our technology, and it\u2019s running well. And the biggest thing we are working with them on now is consistency and so far so good. And we are open. So, if you know somebody we should be talking to let us know, but right now Henan Billions is our partner.","Operator","The next question comes from Arun Viswanathan of RBC. Please go ahead.","Arun Viswanathan","I just had a question on the volume trends. It looks like Q4 you\u2019ve got 2% growth and most of the \u201815 was about 1%. And just look at the slide commentary, looks like most of the commentary is for continued improvement in Q1 outside of seasonality. So, I mean would you characterize what you are seeing right is any kind of positive inflection point? Then maybe you can talk about by end market, especially automotive OEM and architectural.","Michael McGarry","Well, so far in Q1 our order book looks very similar to what we saw fairly in Q4. As we told people in Q4, everybody thought that world was falling down in China, we tried to reassure people that we did not see that. I think people saw that car builds in China were up substantially in 4Q. We have good visibility all the way through Chinese New Year, so we see the Chinese auto builds continue to be up low single digits. Overall we see the U.S. car market being up low single digits as well. But as we described in the earlier comment, we see that in a later innings of ball game. So, those are our commentary as far as the other markets, industrial has been an up and down market for us. We talked about heavy duty equipment; the automotive parts business is being good; we had positive trends in coil in the fourth quarter, general finishes was up. Our electronic materials business was also up. That is not really due to electronic materials growth as much as the new product reductions we have. And electronic materials were pretty significant and our customers are adopting this new technology. So, it\u2019s more like a win in the marketplace.","And I think I have covered architectural quite substantially but there is a market I missed, I\u2019d be happy to cover it Arun. ","Arun Viswanathan","It\u2019s fair enough.","Frank Sklarsky","Arun, just to add to what Michael said, referring to his comments before too, we\u2019ve seen some good wins on the protective side, that should continue specialty coatings materials and packaging; that also applies to the packaging and industrial businesses in Europe where we continue to see recovery and then see some nice wins there. So that\u2019s also going to add to the organic growth as we go forward.","Arun Viswanathan","Great. And just as a follow-up, I mean have you seen any change in behavior amongst your customers? As you said, a lot of us -- lot of investors and maybe observers are just kind of skittish on what\u2019s going on in first half -- couple of weeks of the year. But is there have been any changes amongst yours customers and is that to be expected or your business is much longer cycle and we shouldn\u2019t expect that?","Michael McGarry","Well, we haven\u2019t got anybody calling us up all nervous. I would tell you the one packaging comment I\u2019d throw out [ph] that Frank didn\u2019t mention was that in California with Proposition 65 concerns, we see more of our customers actually converting to the newer technologies faster and sooner than we originally expected. So that\u2019s the positive for us. I think we read more about the nervousness than we see about the nervousness. But maybe people would turn off the TVs that might be a little better.","Operator","The next question comes from Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.","Don Carson","Michael, I want to go back to architectural, just both U.S. and Canada and that North American outlook, last year in the U.S. obviously growth was below trend due to weather. Do you see that snapping back this year or do you see that being offset by weakness in some of the energy related states? And more importantly, what was your growth in U.S. architectural last year versus the market, and how would you expect it compared to the market this year? Then just any general comments on Canada and Mexico market growth outlook?","Michael McGarry","So Don, let me start with the U.S. We saw the market at between 2% and 3%; that\u2019s been consistent. You\u2019ve seen that with retailers as well. I would say that we were a tick below that. So from that standpoint, we were disappointed with our performance but I would tell you that given what we have seen moving forward that the will be a better year this. We opened 25, essentially 25 new stores between U.S. and Canada, we opened a 190 new store locations in Mexico, we\u2019ve opened new locations in France as well. So, I would say overall, our global store network will be bigger and better in 2016 than 2015. So that\u2019s kind of my summation of that.","Vince Morales","We said earlier -- I don\u2019t if you caught it, this is Vince that we expected the Canadian market to remain soft in the first part of the year, but then we\u2019d lap that softness in the back half of the year so that -- I think you had question on Canada as well.","Michael McGarry","On the protective side, I guess you also made a commentary about that. Protective, [audio gap] we\u2019re winning share both in the U.S. and Canada, so we had built into our plans continued growth in 2016.","Don Carson","And then just to follow up on raws, not so much coatings raws, but just hydrocarbons, just Vince, you can run how much gas you\u2019re consuming in your glass business? And I would imagine just things like diesel fuel coming down given how substantial your truck fleet hours [ph] have to be a benefit as well. So, what kind of hydrocarbon benefit do you see going into \u201816 versus \u201815?","Vince Morales","Hey Don, as you know once you divested the commodity chemical business, our gas consumption dropped materially. A dollar change in natural gas for us is $15 million to $20 million a year. On the cost side, we do have some customer price indexing that mutes that whether it be up or down. So, really gas price changes are not material impact for us in any individual quarter. We don\u2019t buy a lot of hydrocarbon materials for coatings production. We do have logistics cost, so diesel cost is important to us in our distribution businesses. We do see some benefit there as oil moves down. It takes a lot of pass-through. We are seeing some inflation in trucker salaries. So right now those probably are moving equal and opposite directions.","Operator","The next question comes from Mike Harrison of Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.","Mike Harrison","Michael, I was wondering if you could talk about competitive dynamics you\u2019re seeing in the auto refinish business. As you look to expand share, what does that mean in terms of what\u2019s going on with pricing? ","Michael McGarry","The refinish business is a beautiful model from the standpoint that we have thousands and thousands and thousands of little customers. And what that means is that all -- we always have a price up opportunity, this year -- in 2015, we had a price increase in August. We would expect to have another price increase sometime in the third quarter of 2016. This has been an industry trend for quite some period of time. I don\u2019t know that I can ever remember the time that refinished business hasn\u2019t had a price increase. So that\u2019s a positive but it\u2019s not just PPG; I mean that\u2019s an industry event as well.","Frank Sklarsky","And you\u2019ve got to number too that pricing is just only one element in terms of winning a new business. PPG is known obviously for the color matching and the service capabilities, the things that we do really well. And it\u2019s the technologies change and go more to waterborne and so on, that plays to PPG\u2019s advantages.","Mike Harrison","And then looking over to the packaging coating side, you noted last quarter that you were going to be lapping the introduction of interior can coatings in that business. But it sounds like you saw straight despite what sounded like was going to be a challenging comp in that business. Can you talk about the uptick that you are seeing in the non-intent BPA coatings? How much additional runway does that have and are you capturing any additional exterior coating business as a result of the interior product?","Vince Morales","Hey Mike, this is Vince. We did see difficult comparable in Europe in the fourth quarter this year, as they were prepping last year in the fourth quarter for the legislative change in France. So that was actually our lowest growth region this year, due to the tough comp, it still grew year over year. But we had mid single digit or higher in the other regions as customers continue to roll this out around the world. And we still see very good runway; we\u2019re still in the infancy of this product introduction and this has no impact on the outside of the can. So that\u2019s still being competed based on the similar metrics it was in the past, similar customer metrics it was in the past.","Operator","The next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Vincent Andrews","Just a question on pricing, you said for \u201815 you expected to be flat, it looks like you\u2019re up 25 basis points. But if I\u2019m remembering the trend, through the year it seemed to decelerate a bit in the second, third and fourth quarter and you\u2019re anticipating being flat again next year. So, if you could give us a sense of maybe on an end market basis or if you\u2019re having to pass through some costs, just sort of what the dynamics are that sort of caused the deceleration through the year and then how we should be thinking about the cadence in \u201816 as well?","Frank Sklarsky","Vincent, if you look at -- you described the situation accurately. We did have call it, less than 1% in Q1 and we ended the year just very modestly over zero. We do re-price with new product introductions. We do have some customers where we talk about price annually. And again our situation as we look at it today is base case of flat price all in for the year. There are certain markets where we do get price as Michael mentioned. There are other markets that are more competitive. So, we\u2019re expecting flat price. We won\u2019t go into individual customers, individual businesses. That\u2019s been our customary pattern not to talk about this.","Vincent Andrews","And then just a quick one on -- there was a comment on challenges in the independent dealer channel in the U.S. Could you just speak to those a little bit more? And what\u2019s you\u2019re doing to change that?","Michael McGarry","Sure Vincent, this is Michael again. Independent dealers channel has been a declining channel for quite some period of time. These are small -- a lot of them are small business owners; as they retire, they would rather sell out to the large paint companies. Plus, as you know, large retail partners continue to win share from that segment. So, it has been under pressure for a long time. We do not expect that trend to change. And so, I think you can expect to be that going forward.","Vincent Andrews","So, there was nothing incrementally different about what you saw in the quarter versus the test? Okay. Thanks very much.","Michael McGarry","Very similar and the contraction rate remains minor but continues.","Operator","The next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi of Baird. Please go ahead.","Ghansham Panjabi","First off on Comex. Michael, you gave us a nice update on the integration. What about market conditions in Mexico and Central America as a whole? Has there been any deviation in the trend line there?","Michael McGarry","Let\u2019s start with Mexico, the one slowing trend has been the government spending. The spending from the consumer has been very solid. We saw good gains all across our network, whether it\u2019s in the north or the south. We added 190 stores. It was a very good year for the Comex team, up high single digits for the year. So that was really job well done by them.","In Central America, we\u2019re in seven small countries there. Those seven, all seven had positive year-over-year growth. And two of them, we had particularly high growth rates, but that was the introduction of our new Glidden product down there and that was specifically Panama and Costa Rica. We would expect to grow faster in those two particular countries than we would the others. The others should be at a GDP kind of run rate. But overall, I would say, both Mexico and Central America continue to be good markets for us overall.","Ghansham Panjabi","And then on U.S. architectural and I am sorry if I missed this. But can you give us a sense as to how that business performed in the big box channel and also retail stores? Also any benefit from the warmer weather in the country during the fourth quarter? And also how would you characterize the pricing environment by channel at current? Thanks so much.","Michael McGarry","I think we covered a lot of this originally, but the combined U.S.-Canada stores network was slightly flat. It was obviously held back by Canada. So, that was our challenge there. We\u2019ve had positive growth with our DIY partners in the quarter. There was probably some material improvement due to weather but not as much as you would think because obviously they\u2019re destocking at that period of time, so they probably took that opportunity to continue to move down. But all in all, we do think weather was a positive in the fourth quarter. And then, we talked about the dealers just recently. So, I think overall, we\u2019ve been performing slightly under the markets; if you say the market was 2% to 3%, we were 1 tick below that.","Operator","The next question comes from Nils Wallin of CLSA. Please go ahead.","Nils Wallin","First, would you remind us where you are in achieving all those various Comex cost revenue and Central America synergies?","Michael McGarry","The cost synergies we laid out were $45 million to $50 million, and we are on our pace to beat that number, so that\u2019s good. On the sales synergies in the Mexican market, we said that number was going to be $40 million to $50 million; those are PPG products, through the Comex concessionaire network. We are solidly on pace to achieve those numbers. And then the Central America number was $60 million to $70 and basis the most recent quarter, I am very comfortable with that number that we put out there. It\u2019s obviously early; we just closed on that acquisition in July, but the fourth quarter is a busy season down there and we had a very good fourth quarter in the Central American market.","Nils Wallin","And then just in terms of the cash deployment guidance, obviously last quarter you\u2019ve moved it up at the bottom end and then reiterated it this quarter. I am curious as to how you\u2019re thinking about next in \u201816; what would be the factors that would allow it or cause it to be below what you\u2019ve done in \u201815, or above what you\u2019ve done in \u201815? And then what you think the mix will be; is it likely to be more repurchases or more repurchases than M&A or is the likely to change?","Frank Sklarsky","So, if you look at what we did in \u201815 and we basically came in at half of what the midpoint of the range we reiterated, so 1.15 as compared with 2 to 2.5 for the three year period. And as always, the mix between the share repurchases and the acquisitions will depend on what we have in the pipeline and the timing of any -- closing of any particular acquisition. We\u2019ve continually said, we have a really nice robust pipeline of things that we continue to look at around the various regions and the various businesses from an acquisition standpoint, and that would be our preference do accretive acquisitions. But as always, at any given quarter that mix will change. And I think it\u2019s safe to assume that while we like to focus on the acquisitions that share repurchases will continue to be an integral part of our capital deployment strategy and no reason believe that will not continue including this quarter.","Nils Wallin","And just also what would -- would it just be the acquisition timing that would cause it to be above or below that midpoint or is there something else?","Frank Sklarsky","We look at the whole landscape between what we have available and acquisition pipeline and also in the deployment. And really it starts with what our cash from operations that we generate is going to be. And what we said as we came up with that range because we know how much cash we\u2019ll have to deploy and we fully intend to be midpoint in that range and the only thing would change the mix is the timing of acquisitions. But the absolute dollars we intend to bring in within that $2 billion and $2.5 billion range. ","Operator","The next question comes from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please go ahead. ","Dan Rizzo","Hi. This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. Just one question, so some of your competitors have talked about going from sole sourcing to dual sourcing as a means to reduce raw materials cost. Is that something you guys are looking into or would it be suitable for you; I mean how much of your raw materials are currently sole sourced?","Michael McGarry","Well I wouldn\u2019t want to get into the percentage that\u2019s either one of those, but I\u2019d tell you that we\u2019re consistently working with our suppliers to have maximum flexibility on how we formulate and how we work with our suppliers. So, I\u2019d tell you we\u2019re very comfortable with where we are.","Dan Rizzo","And then one more quick one. I think you just indicated that you opened 190 new stores in Mexico through Comex in 2015. Is that going to be the pace going forward, is that going to moderated at all or are those accelerating, some color?","Michael McGarry","We\u2019re expecting to open up 150 to 170 stores in 2016. So, we\u2019d originally thought we\u2019d do 170 this year, we actually did a 190. So, we might have pulled forward one or two but I\u2019d still think we\u2019re going to be in the similar type of a range.","Operator","And the next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn of Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Dmitry Silversteyn","A lot of my questions have been answered but I\u2019d like to follow-up on a couple of points. First of all, in fourth quarter, aerospace weakness that you mentioned, was that related to new builds or was that on the rebate part of the business? I know they are usually 50-50 for you. But I was just wondering where the weakness in the quarter came from.","Michael McGarry","The weakness was really one part of it. I divided it into two parts. One part of it was because in the fourth quarter 2014 we had a government annuity double order whether they tried to use up all their budget or not, we\u2019re not that -- we\u2019re not able to predict but we do know they double ordered. And then the other half of the slowdown was due to our sealants business. We have a customer that had a large new plane that they were working on and they\u2019ve gotten more consistent in ordering and their work practices have gotten slightly better. So, their waste has declined marginally. So, now that that\u2019s more stable, we see that returning back to a year-over-year growth. The only thing about aerospace is the general aviation market is very strong for the big planes and slightly weak for the little planes.","Dmitry Silversteyn","So, it sounds like it was more a new builds rather than sort of maintenance. So, it would imply that the overall industry is still in pretty good shape.","Michael McGarry","Yes, Boeing is expected -- I think you probably listen their commentary, both guys are trying to increase the production rate. So, they both had eight-year backlogs. So, it\u2019s not like they don\u2019t have a business.","Vince Morales","Yes, we do expect aerospace return to growth, as Michael mentioned earlier. And again just to give you the Q4 \u201814 comp, we were up high single digits in aerospace last year; that\u2019s a comp Michael is comparing against.","Dmitry Silversteyn","On the Comex store openings, are these being opened by existing concessionaries, are you signing new concessionaries or are these company-owned stores I guess for lack of better word, and just trying to understand where the source of growth is and how it\u2019s being supported by corporate versus concessionaries?","Michael McGarry","There are no company-owned stores in Mexico. We have a dedicated concessionaire network. We do not ever plan to be in the company store business in Mexico. It is a combination of both, some of our long term concessionaire partners as well as some new ones. So, we have a lot of people that would like to have a store. And so we are very, very selective of our about finding those entrepreneurs that are going to live, eat, sleep selling Comex paint. And that\u2019s our desire and we make sure we find the right people and it is the combination of both existing and new.","Dmitry Silversteyn","So, it sounds like sort of the hopper is being filled by people on the ground in Mexico and then it\u2019s sort of up to you to figure out who gets it and who doesn\u2019t; is that how the business model works?","Michael McGarry","This is definitely owned by Marcos Achar and his leadership team. All I do is bless it.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay.","Michael McGarry","They are way better at this than anybody else.","Dmitry Silversteyn","And then speaking of packaging and the shares that you picked up there inside of a can, I\u2019m assuming you talked about sort of gaining shares in Europe last year and I guess in 2015 it was more the turn of the U.S., if I understand your commentary correctly. So, I know that back a couple of years ago when you had your special day on packaging, you talked about zero percentage inside the can market share in the U.S. What is your market share in the U.S. currently with this 9 and 10 BPA transition taking place?","Michael McGarry","Well, what we told you was that we had a 3% global market share. I don\u2019t know that I want to get into what our market share is now. But I would call 3%, not the material; and what we have now is defiantly material but it is a substantial double digit kind of increase. And our customers are excited about what we bring to the table from a technology standpoint. More importantly, they are excited about our ability to launch flawlessly these new products. And that gives them a lot of comfort in giving us the business.","Dmitry Silversteyn","On the performance coatings and fourth quarter margins, they were a little bit lighter than I would have expected, and the year-over-year improvement wasn\u2019t what you saw in the previous three quarters. Was that just a matter of mix and the aerospace business being not as strong in performance coatings or was there something else going on with margins there?","Frank Sklarsky","Dmitry, the sole factor there was the fact that we lapped Comex. So, for the other three quarters this Comex, which comes in at above segment margin was a true adder. We only have one month of that benefit in Q4 because we closed the Comex acquisition in November last year\u2019s.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay, so that was entirely Comex related, fine. And on the glass side of the business, I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s the lower energy costs that are driving these mid teens margins that you haven\u2019t seen as far as my model goes to 2001?","Michael McGarry","No, the energy -- most of the energy in glass is on an index. And so, this is coming from true pricing in the marketplace. As you know supply and demand is relatively tight. One of our competitors closed the furnace in California. We sold our facility in the Midwest. And so with the reduction in industry capacity, pricing has been attractive in that segment.","Dmitry Silversteyn","And then finally, as a sort of a longer-term as I think about your cash flow, your working capital as a percentage of sales really has come down meaningfully over the last five years; I think it\u2019s almost half of what it used to be as a percentage of sales, at just over 6% here in 2015. Do you have a longer term goal or is this the level that you are happy with or is there an expectation that maybe given all the growth you have that working capital will go up as a percentage of sales in future years?","Frank Sklarsky","Well, our goal is still to bring working capital down as a percent of sales. And you are correct, over last two years we brought it down by about $300 million; about half of it was payables including supplier financing programs and about half was inventory where we took out about five days of operational inventories this year and we\u2019ve also improved the quality of the receivables by working down the percentage of past-dues. So, we are pleased with that and we still have a several days to go, we can get out of inventories and keep working on past-due receivables. So, the goal would be continue to bring down working capital by kind of on average of 100 basis points a year for the next couple of years. And then we think we will be kind in line with the peer group.","Dmitry Silversteyn","And what would your CapEx guidance be for 2016? One final question.","Frank Sklarsky","We couldn\u2019t hear you, Dmitry. Could you repeat?","Dmitry Silversteyn","What would the CapEx guidance be for 2016, what you expect to spend on capital expenditures?","Frank Sklarsky","As we put in our presentation 3% to 3.5% of sales would be our\u2026","Dmitry Silversteyn","3% to 3.5%, okay. Okay, fair enough. Thank you guys.","Operator","As we are out of time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Scott Minder for any closing remarks.","Scott Minder","Thank you, Andrew. I would like to thank everyone for their time today and their interest in PPG. You may now disconnect the call.","Operator","The conference has now concluded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Vince Morales, Vice President, Finance. Please go ahead, sir.","Vince Morales","Thank you, Rocco and good afternoon everyone. Once again, thanks for joining PPG\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2016 financial teleconference. Joining me today from PPG is Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Frank Sklarsky, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. One item of note is Scott Minder, our Director, Investor Relations, is not able to join the call today due to a death in the family. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Scott and his family during this difficult time. Returning to today\u2019s call, our remarks today relate to the financial information we released this morning, Thursday, January 19, 2016.","I will remind everyone that we have posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on our Investor Center at www.ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional supporting information for the opening comments Michael will make momentarily. Following Michael\u2019s perspective on the company\u2019s results for the quarter and full year and a brief financial assumptions update from Frank, we will move to Q&A. Both our prepared commentary and discussion and Q&A during the call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company\u2019s current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG\u2019s operating and financial performance. These statements may involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements.","Today\u2019s presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to the company\u2019s filings with the SEC.","Now, let me turn the call over to PPG\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.","Michael McGarry","Thank you, Vince. And before we start with my prepared remarks, I would like to take a minute to recognize the announcement today that we made that Frank Sklarsky will be retiring on March 1. Frank joined us 4 years ago and came to us with a very diverse background, serving as CFO for several companies in different industries. Frank has applied that past experience since he has arrived and has been truly a great thought leader, change agent and steady hand that has guided us through financially very strategic actions. Both internally and externally, including with our shareholders, Frank has brought a tremendous amount of skill and energy to the job. Frank, thank you for your many contributions to PPG and congratulations on your well-deserved retirement.","I also want to congratulate Vince on his announcement appointing him as CFO, March 1. Vince has been an integral part of the PPG family for more than 30 years, served in a variety of internal and external facing financial roles. Over that time, he has proven to be a broad thinker, leader and valuable contributor to the executive team as we transform the company. His deep knowledge of PPG and our businesses, the coatings and chemical industries and the capital markets will serve him well in the new role. So once again, congratulations to both of you.","And so now I want to talk a little bit about our fourth quarter performance. Today, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2016 results. For the fourth quarter, our net sales were $3.5 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.19. This represents an EPS growth rate of 3% for the quarter and we achieved an EPS growth rate of 7% for the year. While these figures fall short of our EPS growth goals, both numbers were noticeably impacted by persistent unfavorable currency translation.","For the fourth quarter, our reported net sales were down 1.5% while our sales in local currencies increased by more than 1%. Supporting the higher local currency sales were increased volumes approaching 2% in our coatings segment. This figure matched our highest quarterly growth rate in 2016. Also minimally impacting our net sales in the quarter were our portfolio optimization actions as acquisition-related sales modestly exceeded the absence of sales from the divested businesses, we are still including in our continuing operations.","As I mentioned, foreign currency translation remained a significant factor affecting our financial results with fourth quarter net sales unfavorably impacted by approximately $100 million and pre-tax income impacted by about $25 million. For the full year, this impact was about $400 million on sales and about $70 million on pre-tax earnings. Looking at some business trends in the fourth quarter and from an end market perspective, our highest volume growth rates was achieved in our industrial coatings segment with each business unit matching or exceeding industry growth rates by delivering at least a mid-single-digit percentage volume growth. Sales volumes continue to expand in automotive OEM coatings and were consistent with overall mid single-digit percentage global industry build growth.","Our above-market performance in the faster growing regions of Asia-Pacific, Europe and Latin America was in contrast to the lower industry and PPG volumes in the U.S. and Canada. We also continue to grow sales, volumes in general industrial coatings, delivering our fourth consecutive quarter of above market growth rates, with positive year-over-year contributions from each region. In addition, packaging coatings growth volume remains strong as customers continue to adopt our Innovel interior can coatings products around the globe.","In performance coatings, automotive refinish volumes grew a low single-digit percentage as the growth returned to Europe following lower year-over-year demand in the third quarter and volumes continued to expand in Asia. Aerospace and architectural coatings EMEA sales volumes were in line with prior year as industry growth remained tepid for both businesses. Specifically in architectural coatings, sales volumes grew in Europe, with the strength in the UK, Ireland and Benelux countries, but was offset by declines in Africa where many economies are closely linked to the depressed commodity prices.","Sales volumes improved in architectural coatings Americas and Asia-Pacific as gains in the U.S. and Canada company-owned stores was partially offset by lower demand in the independent dealer network and uncertain national retail accounts. Sales growth in Mexico continued despite comparison to strong prior year growth. Sales volume growth was also positive year-over-year in the smaller markets, Central America, Australia, China and Brazil. In contrast, significant low double-digit sales volume declines occurred in protective and marine coatings as further weakness in marine shipbuilding activity more than offset PPG\u2019s specific growth in protective coatings. We are continued to aggressively manage our costs in this business to neutralize the earnings impact of these expected market-based activity level declines.","Glass segment volumes declined 3% in North American fiberglass business, principally due to lower wind energy product demand. From a regional perspective, sales volume growth was led by emerging regions. Asian demand growth was broad-based across many of our businesses, but was partly offset by significant declines in regional shipbuilding as previously mentioned. Volumes in Latin America were also positive despite comparison to strong prior year growth in several businesses, including PPG Comex. Volume growth also improved in Europe after a relatively flat comparison to prior year in the third quarter 2016. Growth in this region was also broad-based, which was more comparable to the growth patterns we experienced for most of 2015 and the first half of 2016 when our volumes expanded for six consecutive quarters.","From an earnings perspective, our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.19 improved by 3% versus the prior year quarter. Aiding our earnings growth were higher sales volumes and lower overall costs, which included a positive impact from our prior year restructuring program. In addition, earnings per share benefited from our ongoing cash deployment actions. This included the impact of our repurchase of $650 million of PPG stock in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year 2016 share repurchase to $1.050 billion or nearly 11 million shares. In the quarter, average diluted shares outstanding were 2.8% lower versus the fourth quarter of 2015.","Now, I would like to comment quickly on our full year results from continuing operations. These results do not include the divested flat glass business financial results, which have been classified as discontinued operations. On a full year basis, our sales from continuing operations were $14.8 billion, consistent with the prior year despite an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of approximately $400 million or about 3%. Our full year sales volumes grew about 1%. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share was $5.82, up 7% versus the prior year. We were able to grow our full year earnings despite modest and uneven global economic growth for the second consecutive year.","We accomplished this by another strong year of operational excellence. Our more significant actions included commercialization of new products and technologies allowing us to deliver above market growth in several of our businesses, continued successful integration and earnings accretion from prior and current year acquisitions, completion of our previously announced restructuring program including achievement of savings commitments and lastly, a hallmark of improved productivity and aggressive cost management and our manufacturing operations and within our overall administrative and business support cost structure. In addition to these operational items, we allocated more resources and investments to our growth related opportunities and expect that this will continue to yield dividends in our organic growth rate going forward.","Over the course of the year, we continue to execute on our strategic objectives to strengthen the company. We further optimized our business portfolio with the acquisition of MetoKote, a global leader in coatings applications and Univer, an Italian architectural coatings company. In addition, we closed on the acquisition of Deutek, a Romanian architectural coatings leader in early January 2017. We were equally active in addressing the non-core part of our portfolio as we completed the divestitures of our flat glass business, our European fiber glass business, our ownership interest in two Asian fiber glass joint ventures as well as our minority interest in Pittsburgh Glass Works. These divestitures, which most occurred later in the year, provided us with almost $1 billion of gross proceeds. We fully intend to deploy these proceeds in an accretive manner that will create value for our shareholders. As a result of these portfolio actions, 97% of our 2016 net sales was composed from revenue from our core coatings, coating services and specialty material businesses. Our revised business portfolio has a broader geographic reach, more opportunities for enhanced customer intimacy and technology dependency. It also delivers strong and consistent operating cash flow, requires less capital intensity and we expect it to be more resilient to overall shifts in the economic activity.","In addition to the portfolio moves, we continue to reduce legacy related risk by fully funding our portion of Pittsburgh Corning Asbestos Trust and by annuitizing a significant portion of our U.S. and Canadian pension obligations. We are pleased to have put some of these significant non-core obligations behind us, thus reducing volatility in future earnings and cash flow. We also continue our strong cash generation with about $1.2 billion generated from continuing operations for the year. This included a reduction associated with a net after-tax cash flow related to the full funding of Pittsburgh Corning Asbestos Trust. Excluding this impact, cash flow from operations was almost $1.9 billion for the year. One of the key enablers of this cash performance was our continuing effort to be more efficient with working capital. This year, we reduced our working capital by another 120 basis points as a percentage of revenue, including noteworthy improvements in inventory efficiency. The company has averaged more than 100 basis point annual improvement in this metric for the past 4 years.","In addition, consistent with our capital allocation philosophy, we continued our legacy returning cash to shareholders with nearly $1.5 billion in share repurchases and dividends. Regarding dividends, 2016 marked the 117th consecutive year of dividend payouts and the 45th consecutive year of annual payout increases after an 11% per share increase in April 2016. As we look ahead to 2017, we are operating in an evolving macroeconomic and regulatory environment. Our expectations are for improved momentum in the overall global economic growth with \u2013 including gradually higher growth rates in developed regions and continuing but uneven growth in emerging regions. We anticipate economic growth rates to improve in the U.S. and Canada, including a modest acceleration in industrial production and GDP rates versus 2016. We expect construction markets to expand at a continued measured rate. Lastly, we believe that regional automotive industry builds will be flat or decline modestly year-over-year after several years of post-recession expansion.","In Latin America, we anticipate economic expansion in Mexico. And in South America, we expect to return to flat or slightly positive year-over-year economic growth following a multi-year contraction in economic output. Growth rates in Asia are expected to remain generally consistent with 2016, with continued industrial production growth in China as well as gains in Southeast Asia and India. Automotive build growth is expected to remain positive in the region, but at a more modest growth rates in comparison to 2016. Economic growth in Europe is expected to continue but remain varied by sub-region and country. Favorable end use market trends are expected to continue, particularly in automotive OEM coatings as industry build growth rates are expected to remain positive.","Despite our cautious optimism for 2017 economic growth, the timeline for this growth remains uncertain. As such, we will aggressively manage all elements of our business within our control to ensure that we remain competitive regardless of economic conditions. We recently initiated an almost $200 million business restructuring program focused on reducing our costs where business conditions remain the most uncertain and we will continue to support the momentum in our recent growth related initiatives. Additionally, we have initiated targeted selling price increases to combat recent inflationary cost pressures in several markets and regions. We will continue to closely monitor our input costs and we will work with customers in a collaborative and equitable manner.","Finally, we remain in a position of strength as we ended the year with nearly $1.9 billion of cash and short-term investments and this provides us with significant financial flexibility going forward. Supported by our strong cash generation, we reached the top end of our cash deployment range for 2015 and 2016 combined by deploying over $2.5 billion on share repurchases and acquisitions. Today, we announced a new 2-year cash deployment range of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion for acquisitions and share repurchases for the years 2017 and 2018 combined, reflecting our continuing focus on shareholder value creation. We continue to believe that the coatings space remains a consolidating industry and acquisition pipeline remains active across geographies and end use markets. And of course, share repurchases will also remain an important element of our capital allocation strategy.","I will conclude by saying that 2016 was a good year for PPG and we delivered record adjusted EPS despite uneven economic conditions and against a volatile currency backdrop. We have completed many strategic actions to make the company stronger and more resilient in the future. We look forward to another successful year, 2017. Now, I will turn it over to Frank, who will cover some 2017 financial assumptions.","Frank Sklarsky","Thank you, Michael. Thanks for your kind words and good afternoon, everyone. I am going to cover several items that will assist in modeling PPG\u2019s 2017 sales and earnings. We have included in today\u2019s presentation materials a summary of these financial assumptions on Slide #12. Before we get to the discussion of 2017, however let me briefly cover one housekeeping item and provide you with our total 2016 sales and adjusted EPS figures from continuing operations for each quarter in 2016. These figures have all been adjusted to exclude the flat glass business, which is now being presented as discontinued operations. These have previously been reported in our SEC filings or earning reports, but I quickly want to summarize them for you.","For the first quarter of 2016, net sales were $3.544 billion and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.27. For the second quarter, sales were $3.921 billion, with EPS at $1.78. For Q3, net sales were $3.789 billion, with EPS at $1.56 and Q4 as you know, was $3.497 billion, with EPS at $1.19 for a total year of $14.751 billion and earnings per share of $5.82. Please note that the EPS of $5.82 for 2016 compares to $5.43 for 2015 on a comparable basis, and as Michael pointed out, that represents an increase of $0.39 or 7% year-over-year.","Turning now to 2017, the first item relates to the impact from the MetoKote and Univer acquisitions that we completed in 2016 and the full year impact of the DEUTEK acquisition that we finalized in January of 2017. These acquisitions are expected to achieve full year sales of about $270 million in 2017. Since we realized about $90 million in sales in 2016, we expect an incremental $180 million in sales from these three acquisitions in 2017. This incremental revenue will be classified in the acquisition category until each acquired entity reaches its respective acquisition anniversary date, after which time their results will be included in normal organic revenue results. These acquisitions will typically achieve at or below segment average margins early on as we work to fully integrate their operations into PPG. Additionally, the company divested its European fiberglass business in October 2016. The divested business had sales during the first three quarters of 2016 of approximately $140 million that will not recur in 2017.","Next, we will continue to experience the impact of foreign currency translation headwinds as measured against the U.S. dollar. As a result, for the full year, the company expects that year-over-year currency translation will unfavorably impact sales by a range of $375 million to $425 million and impact pre-tax earnings by about $70 million to $90 million. For the first quarter, we expect an impact to the top and bottom lines similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2016. These figures represent our current assumptions based on exchange rates as of early this week. Again, these impacts are for currency translation-related impacts. Given the nature of our business, we typically do not incur significant transaction-related currency impacts. We also initiated a restructuring program in December 2016, targeting $125 million in total run-rate savings annually once fully implemented. We anticipate that this program will generate $40 million to $50 million in savings during 2017.","The next item relates to the company\u2019s pension and other postretirement benefits or OPEB expenses. We are expecting these expenses to decrease by about $15 million to $20 million in 2017. This decrease stems from a U.S. postretirement medical plan design change made in the third quarter of 2016. We expect slightly higher net interest costs in 2017 of about $5 million year-over-year. Next, we anticipate that the company\u2019s 2017 tax rate on ongoing earnings from continuing operations will be in the range of 24.5% to 25.5%. The comparable rate for 2016 was 24.5%. The increase relates primarily to a shift in our regional earnings mix.","Finally, as Michael mentioned, we announced a new 2-year cash deployment range of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion for the years 2017 and 2018 combined after dividends and capital expenditures, dedicated to acquisitions and share repurchases. Once again, a summary of these financial assumptions is contained in the presentation materials provided for today\u2019s call.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And now operator would you please open the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s first question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Good afternoon. Mike, just on these targeted selling price increases, can you discuss where you are getting them or targeting them, what regions, what product lines? And what portion of the portfolio you think can you capture price over the next 6 months?","Michael McGarry","So David, we have announced price increases in a number of regions. So, just Canada, U.S., Mexico, Brazil, Central America, UK, Ireland, the Benelux as well as select countries in Central America or Central Europe, excuse me. So we have been aggressive in doing that. As you know, historically, we have always told people that we work with our customers on a proactive basis. We expect that as they start to see the price increases coming through, they can expect us to come and talk to them. I think they can see it coming now and so we are in discussions with a number of our customers.","David Begleiter","And Mike, just on gross margins, how would you expect gross margins to trend throughout the year? Can you see some gross margin expansion by Q3, Q4 do you think?","Michael McGarry","Well, I think gross margins are \u2013 you could see that we went down a little bit in industrial. I\u2019m sure somebody will ask a question about that. And then raw materials will have some pressure. If you think about where we were in the first quarter last year with oil at $35, now we are at all oil at, let\u2019s call it, $55 to round it up. So, you can expect that even though sequentially, raw materials are going to be rather flattish from fourth quarter to first quarter on a year-over-year basis, raw materials are up. So, I would say margins are going to be challenged in the beginning, but we have our restructuring program we announced and that will certainly provide us some benefit in the second half of the year.","David Begleiter","Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Frank Mitsch","Hey, good afternoon gentlemen and Frank, congrats on your pending retirement. I will never forget your first PPG conference call when Chuck had laryngitis and you took over like a champ during that call. So certainly big shoes for Vince to fill, and of course, Vince, congrats. Looking forward to working with you in your new role. And so, Michael, I know that organic volume growth is an important metric and has become a more important metric for you and you have got two quarters now in a row of 1.5% organic volume growth. What should we be thinking you can do in the early part of \u201817 here in terms of volume and perhaps for the year as a whole?","Michael McGarry","Yes, Frank, clearly, we are still not happy with \u2013 it maybe our best quarter yet call it slightly under 2% for our coatings portfolio. So we have told people that we expect to be GDP and when we are performing at a high performance, we would be GDP plus. So you probably saw in the corporate line that corporate costs were down. That was partly driven by us not hitting our volume goals. So, you could expect to see us continue to push organic growth as a key lever for us in 2017 and I think we will continue to get better as the year goes by.","Frank Mitsch","During your commentary, you mentioned \u2013 you gave the phrase of improving momentum in terms of economic activity, so that would almost imply that we are going to start seeing that 2% plus type organic volume growth sooner rather than later. Is that not the way for us to think about that?","Vince Morales","Frank, this is Vince. If you look at our coatings volumes as Michael mentioned, they were actually higher than our total company volumes. Coatings volumes are 1.7%, 1.8%. That\u2019s our best mark of the year, and that\u2019s part of the reason why we feel there is some improved momentum. We did see a recovery in volumes in Europe as well. So those are pieces to the puzzle as to why we are hoping and continuing to see improvement as we go into \u201817.","Frank Mitsch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Kevin McCarthy","Yes, good afternoon gentlemen. So, you announced a capital deployment program of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion over the next 2 years. I was wondering if you could elaborate on the thought process behind establishing the bookends of the range, and Michael, I welcome any thoughts that you might have on the mix of likely repurchases versus what you are seeing in the M&A pipeline maybe not over the next 2 years, but perhaps over the next couple of quarters? Thank you.","Frank Sklarsky","Kevin, I will start out and then turn over to Michael. So the bookends, if you look at the center point, there is $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion. You think we are at the end of the year at $1.9 billion in cash and generate over $1 billion each in 2017 and 2018. That would still leave us a reasonable amount of cash on the balance sheet at any given time through the seasonal quarters. And of course in the recent past, we have been under $1 billion in cash. So what we want to do is deploy cash as we have it either on acquisitions, which would be our preference or share repurchases. That will depend on the pipeline in any given quarter, but returning that cash toward value creating activities, but that really relates to the center point. The variation around the mean, the $2.5 billion to the $3.5 billion really will depend upon business conditions and the amount of cash we have and the timing of any acquisitions that we might have over the period. And of course, always as before, we can always adjust that range as we did in the last program, where we started at one range and ended up at the top end of a higher range that we communicated later on and that was based on the fact that we had the affordability and the net cash to do so.","Michael McGarry","So Kevin, I will take the second half of the question, which is how do we think that will \u2013 mix will be. Right now, I would describe our acquisition pipeline as similar to what we have seen in the past. So we did slightly under $400 million the last couple of years in acquisitions. Obviously, the prices of acquisitions have gone up. We have adjusted our thinking on our own whack and those returns. At the end of the day though, we do see a lot of people think we see them paying exceptionally high prices for acquisitions. So we are going to continue to be disciplined and I would expect to see a similar type relationship between acquisitions and buying back shares.","Kevin McCarthy","Thanks. I appreciate the color.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi of Baird. Please go ahead.","Ghansham Panjabi","Hi guys, how are you? Congrats Vince and Frank as well. I guess first off, on industrial coatings and the significant growth in auto OEM growth, did you see any change in pricing for that particular end market, one of your peers has been pointing towards seeing some pricing givebacks with the larger auto OEM customers, curious on what you are seeing in that market, too?","Michael McGarry","Well, I think the way I would describe that Ghansham is that we have always said our large, global, sophisticated customers typically kind of ply more price pressure than our businesses that go through distribution. And you saw some price degradation across the company. So you could probably make a pretty good guess of where that would be. What I would tell you though, is we have already started talking to all our customers about raw materials. So this is the early innings of that. I would tell you that overall though, they are paying for technology. So when you think about the industry, we have been growing at a faster rate than the industry in three of the four regions. And most of that has to do with technology, where we have captured additional share due to our Compact Process as well as bringing better productivity in their own OEM shops. So I think overall, our growth has been pretty much driven by meeting or exceeding our customer requirements.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just Michael, in terms of your view on the macro trend line in Europe, the volume improvement in 4Q versus what you saw in 3Q, was that just sort of a catch-up from 3Q being sort of sub-par or do you sense any shift in the macro as you head into 2017 in that region?","Michael McGarry","Well, it\u2019s such a choppy environment over there in Europe. We have a number of countries, I mean you take UK, Ireland, I mean they have just consistently performed at a very high level. Germany doing pretty well. The laggards \u2013 I would say Southern Europe is also improving. So five quarters out of the last six quarters, we have had positive growth in Europe. And I would anticipate that we would have positive growth, but uneven in 2017. What also is in that number that has held it back, of course has been Middle East. Middle East is an important market for us and that market has certainly been under a lot of pressure as well as Africa. So Continental Europe, I am constructive on it. I think it is improving. And of course, from the automotive builds, I would say that we are probably in the sixth or seventh inning. We have a long way to go. They only made 13 million cars in Western Europe and we can see 16 million or 17 million cars easily, so more growth there to come.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay. Thanks so much.","Michael McGarry","By the way, I misspoke as 14 million in Europe, builds.","Operator","And our next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn of Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Good afternoon, I should say. You mentioned a little \u2013 previously the sort of the expectations of price increases in your raw material costs and your ability to get out of them and get this pricing over the course of months or quarters, if you look at your 2017 guidance, how much of a raw material inflation have you sort of baked in and is it more weighted towards the second half of the year or do you expect inflation to happen in the first half of the year and pricing to sort of come into effect and start offsetting that in the second half of the year?","Vince Morales","Dmitry, this is Vince. If you look at our 2017 year, a little bit of history here. If you look at the coatings industry historically, we typically see inflation. The industry and PPG\u2019s work to get price in place, there is typically a 6-month to let\u2019s call it 9-month lag between the earnest inflation and the price being adopted. So we are right in the let\u2019s call it the second, third month of that window. So we would expect additional pricing to come from our customers over the course of the back half of the year. We are seeing, as Frank mentioned and Michael mentioned, we are seeing a little more inflation in the beginning of the year really just because last year\u2019s first and second quarter were lower. We saw some step up in the back half of 2016. So we are anniversarying some inflation. So a little inflation in the first half of the year, offset by pricing in the second half, we expect that to neutralize the effect. And if not, we will take additional cost actions.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Got it. And as my follow-up, you have talked about and we have seen marine being a bad guy for you for going on 3 years now, are we getting close to the bottom on that business and\/or maybe anniversarying some of the more tough comps and hopefully, seeing a little bit better results in performance coatings overall, has that business stabilized, is that a 2017 or 2018 type of outlook?","Michael McGarry","Okay. So let\u2019s think about it this way, Dmitry. We typically paint a ship 9 months to 15 months after the order is taken. This year, orders in Korea are down 85% from the peak, and across Asia they are down 60% from the peak. So there is still more downward pressure in that market, but I don\u2019t think orders are going to get worse. So I think from an order standpoint, it\u2019s probably nearing the bottom. Now, the good news is we are aggressively managing our costs. So we can see as the order book thins, that we are taking aggressive action in that area and that\u2019s part of the reason why you saw the fourth quarter announcement about restructuring. That was one of the businesses that was significantly impacted by that.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Got it, okay. So it sounds like another year at least. Thank you very much.","Michael McGarry","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. It looks like the after-tax costs asbestos were maybe $675 million, is that right, which I think is maybe originally you were expecting $500 million and are there additional taxes that have yet to be paid on some of the properties that you sold and if so, what is the magnitude of the tax payments?","Frank Sklarsky","Yes. As for asbestos, it\u2019s a little bit lower than that in terms of the after-tax cost and the other number that you might have been quoting, it depends on the timing of the cash payments versus the P&L tax. But from a cash basis in 2016, it was in the low-600s. We are pretty much done with that. There are no real additional tax payments on the properties that were sold in \u201816 and there is minimal tax leakage due to some tax attributes and some tax planning that we were able to embark on. So with respect to the flat glass business and the fiber glass businesses and the JVs, we were able to really secure more than $1 billion in after-tax proceeds. Now that said, the cash taxes for 2017 will probably be closer to that adjusted tax rate than they were in 2016, where we were able to use some attributes to offset some of these gains, so that will be a dynamic going forward, but no additional taxes associated with the divestitures going forward.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. And then for my follow-up, in the fourth quarter in both of your segments, both of your key coating segments, your operating profits were down year-over-year and you are talking about raw material inflation and lacking price increases. So, it sounds like you have a bearish point of view towards your first half and then maybe you have some growth in your second half. So in 2017, are we sort of looking for maybe a flat or a flat to up year in earnings for PPG?","Frank Sklarsky","Well, first, Jeff, just for the year, just to clarify, so each of the operating segments for full year had increases in what we call that PTPI ROS margin. Now fourth quarter...","Jeff Zekauskas","[indiscernible] fourth quarter, yes.","Frank Sklarsky","Yes, for the fourth quarter, there were a couple of impacts and most notably as Michael mentioned before, industrial coatings was the one, where you saw a little bit of a reduction. That was driven really by a couple of different factors. There are probably a couple of tenths of a point driven by some acquisitions that haven\u2019t been fully integrated yet. There is actually about 0.3% impact from currency in Q4 industrial coatings just because the dynamics between the top and the bottom line, about 0.5% associated with some of the additional cost that Michael referenced for logistics and transportation to meet some demands in Asia, that\u2019s really a temporary dynamic. And then, of course, from the slide, you can back into the approximately 100 basis points of price in industrial for Q4 year-over-year. Now, I think the wildcard for 2017 will be exactly what the currency impact is going to be. The cost we are addressing clearly will fully integrate the acquisition, so that won\u2019t be a dynamic going forward. We are going to manage very carefully as Michael mentioned the targeting of prices versus input costs. So that should improve. We will get restructuring benefits. So, it\u2019s really the currency dynamic. So overall, for the year, margins were up. Q4 a little bit of a dip in the role, but based on some unique factors but going forward, we still expect the opportunity to accrete margins in \u201817.","Michael McGarry","And Jeff, let me just add. We are \u2013 I want to disabuse you of the thought that earnings would be flat. That\u2019s not our base case at all, not only are we going to have volume growth that\u2019s going to be a positive. We are going to have earnings accretive cash deployment, that will be a positive and we have the self-help from our restructuring program. So, that\u2019s also a help. So, we will see positive EPS growth year-over-year.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Michael McGarry","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","And our next question comes from PJ Juvekar of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","PJ Juvekar","Thank you and congratulations both Frank and Vince.","Frank Sklarsky","Thanks, PJ.","PJ Juvekar","Question on architectural paints, was there any inventory adjustment at the big boxes or was there anything going on there that you saw the decline on the national level and national chains?","Michael McGarry","Yes. So PJ, it\u2019s always hard to draw inferences from the fourth quarter. Obviously, we have line reviews going on. One of the major differences \u201815 versus \u201816 if you remember \u201815 we had a very warm October, early November. We had very good stain sales in that regard. It did not repeat in 2016. We had positive POS. So, the sell-out is better than the sell-in. That gives us some good feelings going forward. Like I said, fourth quarter and first quarter are always difficult to think about it from the standpoint that the home centers can make adjustments in their inventories. But when we look at the POS data, we\u2019re \u2013 I would say we are still optimistic.","PJ Juvekar","Thank you. And secondly, there is significant consolidation going on in paints. Recently, we saw Nippon Paint coming into the U.S. with the acquisition of Dunn-Edwards. So where do you think the multiples are that are being paid today? And what is your comfort zone, Michael, when you deploy that capital?","Michael McGarry","Well, I don\u2019t think I want to tell you my comfort zone, because people might know where we want to bid. But obviously, when you look at the Dunn-Edwards number, I would tell you that Nippon was aggressive, overly aggressive in our opinion. Clearly, they were wanting to get a toehold in the U.S. market. They viewed this as an opportunistic way to get in and they took advantage of that. So, I would tell you that the multiples are clearly higher, but we are just going to have to adapt to the changing environment.","Vince Morales","Thanks, PJ. If I could, as Frank mentioned earlier, we are going to keep our financial discipline and we are going to try to reward our shareholders and create value for our shareholders as part of any transaction.","PJ Juvekar","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dan Rizzo","Hi, this is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. You mentioned that the Comex performed pretty well in the quarter. Is there opportunity for expansion of Comex into other parts of Latin America? And that\u2019s the first part of the question. And two, I mean, is the unrest in Mexico having a clean affect, where the growth \u2013 the pace of growth is slowing?","Michael McGarry","So, let me address a couple of those questions, Dan. The first one is we have taken the Comex model into Central America. We gave guidance that it would be $60 million to $70 million in new sales. We are tracking above that growth rate. We said that would be over a 3 to 5-year period. Central America for us grew a very small business obviously, but it grew nearly 40% year-over-year. So, it was an outstanding performer from that regard. The Comex team, we have said it would grow more than 2x GDP, has exceeded that significantly, so another good year by the PPG-Comex team. The current unrest because of the raise in gasoline prices, we have lost about 300 store days, which through the first, whatever, 20, 19 days, it\u2019s really insignificant. It\u2019s less than 1% of our total store days being opened. I looked at the sales through the first 19 days. The sales are ahead of last year\u2019s pace. So we are tracking pretty well in that regard. So obviously, we are not happy with the unrest. But overall, it has not impacted our business. I am more concerned about the consumer sentiment. Right now, consumer sentiment in Mexico remains solid. And so we anticipate another good year. Last year, we opened 212 stores, which is more than one store every other day. We are up to 4,213 stores. We have a plan to open almost another 200 stores this year. So overall, we expect to have another very good year in Mexico.","Dan Rizzo","Is consumer sentiment such that, I mean, it telegraphs well enough where you can see that\u2019s changing and things like change \u2013 alter your plans or is it something you might be concerned that it happens kind of coincidentally, where consumer sentiment falls and sales falloff at the same time. I was just wondering if there is any lead time there?","Vince Morales","Typically in the paint industry in architectural consumer sentiment is real-time or close to real-time, Dan.","Dan Rizzo","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Nils Wallin of CLSA. Please go ahead.","Nils Wallin","Great. Thanks for taking my question. I was just curious in terms of the restructuring, where you have mentioned that a lot of it was in marine. What, if you would give us, where some of the big buckets are in terms of your restructuring program?","Frank Sklarsky","Sure, Nils. It\u2019s Frank. It\u2019s pretty broad-based. It\u2019s covering virtually all of our functions and virtually all of our business units and targeting those areas, mainly in USCA and EMEA is where the vast majority of the actions are taking place. It\u2019s where we have most of our operations in any case. But really I would say, the administrative functions really runs the gamut, where we move more into shared services and consolidate operations from various countries into hub-and-spoke operations. And then when you look at the various business units \u2013 virtually every business unit as participating certainly you mentioned PMC. That\u2019s one of them. All the businesses and fiberglass had gotten ahead of the game, because we knew we were divesting the European operations, so they got a little ahead of the game, ahead of this program, but nevertheless, they have made some reductions. But we haven\u2019t singled out any particular business or any particular region. It\u2019s just skewed more toward USCA and EMEA because of the size of the operations in those areas.","Vince Morales","And Nils, we use USCA for U.S. Canada as abbreviation.","Frank Sklarsky","Right.","Nils Wallin","I finally figured out that one. Thanks. Just in terms of marine, does marine, the business on its own earned its cost of capital over the cycle?","Michael McGarry","I would say right now, it does. It\u2019s certainly below the company average. But like many acquisitions, we do marine was cobbled together through various acquisitions. It starts lower. It appreciates over time. This business was pretty much at the company average prior to the downturn in the shipbuilding business and we fully expect it to be back at or above the industry or the company average, but certainly not until the industry recovers.","Frank Sklarsky","And it\u2019s a great question, too, because we have now deployed significant new capital against some of the businesses that are having a challenging macroeconomic environment, we came in below our CapEx plan in 2016 by mid double-digits, primarily because we look at the macro environment, we try to our capital spending just in time, and we target the spending to those businesses where we think we can get the quickest return and gears much toward those areas that are growing, not just maintenance capital. So yes, the cost of capital might be less, but we are not deploying any new capital until we see the light at the end of the tunnel in terms of volume growth.","Vince Morales","And there was one more comment because the marine shipbuilding is project oriented and we are able to very easily see with very good sight projects coming and getting completed, we are able to ratchet down our cost structure as projects get completed. So there is not a heavy fixed cost load. There is a lot of project costs. So, again, it\u2019s not \u2013 we are able to manage it towards not decremental to the earnings of the segment or the company.","Nils Wallin","Understood. Thanks very much.","Michael McGarry","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Roberts of UBS. Please go ahead.","John Roberts","Thank you. Do you think the antitrust review between two of your key peers will affect the timing of the North American spring channel sell-in, that is, do you think customers might want to delay a little bit here to see how that plays out?","Michael McGarry","John, I don\u2019t sit in either Atlanta or Charlotte or D.C. from a regulatory standpoint. So I really would be total speculation. I think I should stay away from speculating. But I think they are all looking at it and they will all make their best judgments depending upon how it all works out.","John Roberts","Maybe I will try an easier one and you may have answered this on the last call, I apologize, but will glass continue to be a reported segment through 2017 or is the objective here to just exit the rest of glass as fast as you can and it just \u2013 it disappears as the segment that way?","Michael McGarry","Well, glass will continue to be a reported segment while we have in our portfolio the North American fiber glass business will continue to be in continuing operations. We stated before that the glass businesses are not necessarily part of the core business, but the businesses did well in 2016. It\u2019s expected to continue to improve in 2017 based on the actions that the business has taken. They have done a good job. And it will continue to be reportable segment and continuing operations until otherwise.","Frank Sklarsky","And John, if I can just add if you look at the fourth quarter results, which just include the North American fiber glass business, they had significant improvement year-over-year in earnings, up I think 600 basis points and really reflective of the good work we are doing on the cost side and some good work we are doing on the technology side.","John Roberts","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mike Harrison of Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.","Mike Harrison","Hi, good afternoon, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your strategy in Europe and the architectural business there, you have done a couple of acquisitions. First of all, can you talk about how long you expect it to take to integrate those businesses, are there additional consolidation opportunities there and are there ways to really leverage the PPG brand across the whole continent or do you continue to view it as kind of a set of individual sub-regions or individual country markets there?","Michael McGarry","So the first question deals with the acquisition. So we owned 50% of Univer. So there is zero integration except that we have lower costs now with the former ownership and some additional layers that we are able to take out post the prior owners leaving. So zero, totally integrated, already performing at a higher level than previously. Deutek in Romania, this is a standard PPG deal, where we go in and raw materials get brought in day 1. So January 4, raw material prices went down there. And then we are going to bring in our additional products. They can sell in Romania. So that will be a positive. And then we will roll the back office into our various back office centers in Europe. So that integration we expect to go very smoothly, and there are more opportunities in Europe to acquire. This is still a very regional business. We are constantly talking to families that own coatings companies in Europe. They are always part of our pipeline. And we just can\u2019t predict when one generation will decide to sell. In regards to a pan-European brand, we have looked at that. We have also been asked by several of our larger DIY customers in Europe about that. We are expecting that they will roll out something similar but not quite pan-European in the early 2017 with one of our products. So we will wait to see how that launches. But by and large, it is still a very regional business.","Mike Harrison","Right. And then shifting over to the architectural side in North America, it seems like we are still seeing continued sluggish architectural volumes there even though the housing fundamentals look pretty good, how do you explain the current weak patch that we are seeing in the paint industry and do you think we are setting up to normalize next year and see some better growth in 2017?","Michael McGarry","Well, I would tell you that historically, we have been fairly accurate on the paint projections. We said last year in 2016, it would be 2% to 3%. I think that was borne out. I think people still underestimate the size of the maintenance business. I mean it\u2019s let\u2019s call it 70% to 80% of all paint is applied in a maintenance mode and so despite how strong housing looks in the house formation as well as new home sales, that doesn\u2019t move the needle as much as the maintenance side of the business. So I would tell you that we expect to see 2% to 3% growth again in 2017. And I might add one other item to your prior question and that is we don\u2019t participate in a number of countries in Europe, so there are still more growth opportunities in those countries that we don\u2019t participate in.","Mike Harrison","Alright. Thanks very much.","Frank Sklarsky","Thanks Mike.","Operator","Sorry. And our next question today comes from Christopher Parkinson of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christopher Parkinson","Thank you. In terms of your general macro expectations, can you talk a little bit more about your growth outlooks and what you are hearing from customers in Europe and Mexico, especially across the industrial and I guess architectural parallels, you just hit on that. And just generally, do you anticipate any changes in spending behaviors over the next year or so due to recent elections or even in some cases, some modest uncertainty pertaining to upcoming elections in Western Europe, just any general thoughts on how we should think about that, that would be helpful? Thanks.","Michael McGarry","So when I think about Europe there is obviously elections in France, election later in the year in Germany. I don\u2019t know when the elections in Italy will come because it\u2019s a very complicated country for that. But consumer sentiment still is what I would call modest and most of our customers are kind of put that other back of their mind. They say, hey, we are going to continue to perform. We are going to continue to push our own customers to grow. And so that\u2019s why we are thinking that Europe is going to grow 2 plus kind of percent next year for us. So I think that\u2019s our sentiment there. For Mexico, from the supply chain standpoint, we paint cars in Mexico and we paint cars in the U.S. So whatever consternation may or may not be out there, we will paint cars wherever they are built. So for us, that is a bigger question for our customers than it is for us because they know we will be there whenever and wherever they need us.","Vince Morales","In terms of some other macros Chris, we are seeing some early signs of recovery in energy CapEx. We think that\u2019s been a large drag on the U.S. industrial production numbers. So we think that\u2019s favorable. And as Michael mentioned in his prepared remarks, we are seeing a flattening in Brazil from \u2013 or South America from significant negatives. So those are two other data points.","Christopher Parkinson","Great. And just quickly turning back to the raw material basket outlook, can you just give us a quick update on [indiscernible] including ability to meet specs delivery numbers? And then any expectation you have for the cadence of the production ramp over the longer term? Thank you.","Frank Sklarsky","Yes, we can\u2019t speak about the production ramp per se. It\u2019s their process, their business, their facility. So, we will leave it up to them, but they are working with us. We continue to get product from them. We expect product to continue to flow certainly in the same manner, if not more in 2017 and they are still going through their normal startup process. So at this point, it\u2019s been a success for us and we continue to expect it to do so going forward.","Christopher Parkinson","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tom Narayan of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Tom Narayan","Hey, thanks for taking my question. Really appreciate Slide 12 here, the 2017 financial guidance. When I look at this and let\u2019s see assuming that, I guess, the GDP 2% to 3% growth kind of thing, the FX assumptions and then all the puts and takes below the EBIT line, it would appear that a lot of the EPS growth that you guys maybe seeing in 2017 could be coming from the share buyback. To what extent do you guys use EPS as a rationale behind deciding on how you allocate that the $3 billion over 2017, 2018 or do you not really look at that at all?","Frank Sklarsky","Yes, we do. When you look at the $3 billion or the $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion over the 2-year period, the first determinant is how much cash we have in the balance sheet and how much cash we expect to generate and the fact that we do not need to carry more than I will say mid to high triple-digits millions of dollars on the balance sheet at any given time to run our operation. So it\u2019s best used to create value for the shareholders. First priority on that, of course, this is after dividends and after CapEx, first priority being accretive acquisitions. But in any quarter where we don\u2019t necessarily have an imminent acquisition or line of sight when it\u2019s taking place, we would return the cash to the shareholders at a reasonable pattern. So in any given year, you would expect to see a balance between acquisitions and share repurchases with the first priority being acquisitions and then repurchases. But you are right, there is some element of EPS, EPS growth that is predicated upon deploying that cash either toward acquisitions that gets you additional EBITDA and against share repurchases which obviously increases the EPS just based on the arithmetic, but it is a component of that.","Tom Narayan","Okay, thanks. And then my last question, you guys just commented on the U.S. architectural market and what\u2019s going on despite what\u2019s going on with housing. I get the maintenance argument, that\u2019s very helpful. What about the share shift from DIY to pro? And could you maybe comment on what\u2019s going on like within your own U.S. architectural business in that dynamic. Could that be playing a role perhaps?","Michael McGarry","We don\u2019t really see a significant share shift from DIY to pro. I mean, obviously, the bigger issue is pros are full up. There is not a lot of new painters coming in the market. So, I would say there is probably a little bit of a drag if anything from the professional side, because I don\u2019t see a lot of young painters out there.","Tom Narayan","Understood. Thanks a lot.","Frank Sklarsky","Tom, if I could add to that, our mix of business between DIY and pro matches the industry. So we have said in the past we are channel agnostic.","Tom Narayan","Understood. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Richard O\u2019Reilly of Revere Associates. Please go ahead.","Richard O\u2019Reilly","Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Just have a question about the cash from operations. I just want to understand the math. In 2016, you generated $1.25 billion and that was after the asbestos settlement of $800 million?","Frank Sklarsky","Yes, it was. The $1.25 billion was after the $800 million asbestos settlement. Keep in mind though that there was some tax benefit associated with that. So the way we like to do it in a full transparency is to say that, that $1.25 billion would have been close to $1.9 billion if you were to add back the after-tax cost of the asbestos settlement.","Richard O\u2019Reilly","Okay, $1.9 billion. So if the dividends and CapEx or your free cash, so to speak, was about $1.1 billion?","Frank Sklarsky","It was approaching $1.1 billion.","Vince Morales","Including that adjustment.","Frank Sklarsky","Yes.","Richard O\u2019Reilly","Okay, yes including. Okay. So for this year and next, you are at the low end of that 2 point \u2013 if we double that, you are at the 2 point \u2013 at the low end of $2.5 billion range that you want to use?","Frank Sklarsky","And again we started the year with almost $1.9 billion in cash balance, which is more than we need to have because we \u2013 I got the after-tax proceeds from the divestitures all in Q4, so we started the year and then we add another $1 billion plus in each of the year. So we really have between $2.5 billion and $3.5 billion to deploy based on what we \u2013 I would add and still have plenty left to run the business.","Richard O\u2019Reilly","Okay. Second question, outside of North American fiber glass, there is nothing else that sticks out in your portfolio that doesn\u2019t fit the core or whatever you want to use the word, am I right?","Michael McGarry","That\u2019s correct, Tom [ph].","Richard O\u2019Reilly","Okay, fine. And third question, I am surprised no one has asked you about titanium pigment pricing or your costs going into the New Year, do you have any comments on that?","Michael McGarry","So this is a little history lesson. We saw a little modest second quarter and third quarter increases in 2016. In the fourth quarter, no increases except a little bit in China. So we still believe this is a supply-demand driven business. Supply is slightly up. Demand is slightly up. So they are pretty much in balance from that standpoint. The only thing we can see is that we see some of our smaller companies that we have been looking at buy-in, some of them do price buy-in. Obviously, that\u2019s an artificial demand. It\u2019s not a good business practice, but they feel like they need to protect themselves because they are not like some of the larger coatings companies that can negotiate hard in this regard. So we don\u2019t anticipate significant upward pressure. But again, it\u2019s a supply-demand driven business and we will react accordingly.","Richard O\u2019Reilly","Okay, good. Thank you and congratulations to Vince. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Matt Gingrich","Hey guys. This is Matt Gingrich on for Vince. On the restructuring initiative, does that include potential cost synergies associated with the recent acquisitions or will those flow-through separately. And then also how should we think about the cadence of the 2017 restructuring savings?","Frank Sklarsky","Yes. They do not include the synergies from the acquisitions. Those would be separate and over and above. In terms of the cadence, we are trying to actually accelerate these actions as best we can based on what we see out there. We said 40 to 50 for the year, it will obviously ramp up through the year. So there will be more in the back half than the first half. And we are trying to get to the execution as quickly as we can, but it will ramp up ratably throughout the year. Hopefully, we will get some of those savings booked in the first half.","Matt Gingrich","And then on packaging how much of the market at this point in North America and EMEA has now converted to non-BPA and where do you see that composition going?","Michael McGarry","I think the way I would describe that is we are in the third inning of a nine-inning ballgame. We have a number of trials still going on. We have a number of conversions that we have to get accomplished in 2017. And of course and then there is still more work to be done. They can\u2019t take on all that work overnight and there are still a number of countries around the world that they haven\u2019t converted. So like I said, we are in the third inning. And we have been winning more than our fair share. The brand owners really love PPG. They love the technology that we are bringing and that\u2019s been a real positive for us.","Matt Gingrich","Is your outgrowth in Asia Pacific related to non-BPA conversions or is that a product of other factors?","Vince Morales","Our holistic growth in Asia Pacific is related to many businesses. Our packaging growth in Asia Pacific is certainly aided by the BPA-free technology.","Matt Gingrich","Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from James Sheehan of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.","James Sheehan","Thank you. Can you talk about the performance of U.S. auto OEM business, you are showing it as having coming in a little bit below the market, is that because your technology is largely penetrated in that region or are there other factors to explain that?","Michael McGarry","No. James, we had covered this in previous calls. We had to make a choice on where to take business going into 2016 and we preferentially picked up business in Asia and Europe, where we saw the growth rates at a higher level. And so we have grown so much faster than the market. Our large customers wanted to make sure that we didn\u2019t get too large in that space. So that\u2019s what happened. We would \u2013 you should expect another one to two more quarters of negative comps versus the industry. And then we will anniversary it. Actually what I anticipate going forward is that they have not moved the Compact Process yet in the U.S. And when they decide to do some Brownfields in the U.S., we will then start to win at a very good rate. So I am optimistic going forward starting in 2000 probably \u2013 Brownfields will probably be a 2018, 2019 kind of initiative.","Vince Morales","And just if I could elaborate Jim, again our math worked out. We matched the global growth rate build for 2016. Again with our regional differences, we expect to at least match that global growth rate in 2017 and likely start to exceed it again based on the comments Michael made and the actions we took.","James Sheehan","Terrific and then could you also comment on the potential benefit you might see from any big increase in infrastructure spending from Washington and the timing of that?","Michael McGarry","Well, I would tell you that that\u2019s highly speculative. It takes a while for policy changes to work its way through the executive and legislative branches. Infrastructure is good, so if it happens, we will be all over it. It does take a while to gear up to do some of these things. So we have not put that in our forward-looking plan for 2017.","James Sheehan","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.","Don Carson","Thank you. Another question your heat map on Slide 5, Vince you mentioned that you are agnostic as to what architectural channel you sell-through, but you continue to have below market growth. So I am just wondering what\u2019s driving that and specifically referring to the U.S. market, is it your product mix and your greater reliance on stain that drives that difference?","Vince Morales","No. Don, if we hearken back to a few other calls we have had this year, one of our channels that\u2019s nice channel for us, but it does have a shrinking nature to it is the independent dealer channel and so we are that channel shrinking natively and we expect that to continue. So it\u2019s certainly one of the reasons why we are below overall market.","Don Carson","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vince Morales for any closing remarks.","Vince Morales","Again, I want to thank everybody for their time and participation today. We will certainly be available for calls after this call. So please reach out and we will handle any additional questions. Thank you.","Operator","And thank you, sir. Today\u2019s conference has now concluded. And we thank you all for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day."]}}
