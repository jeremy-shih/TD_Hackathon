This call is being recorded.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Mitch Haws, Vice President of Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Haws, please go ahead.","Mitch Haws","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' third fiscal quarter 2017 conference call. With me on the call today are Liam Griffin, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kris Sennesael, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our discussion will include statements relating to future results and expectations that are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Please refer to our earnings press release and recent SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for information on certain risks that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially and adversely from any forward-looking statements made today.","Additionally, the results and guidance we will discuss include non-GAAP financial measures consistent with our past practice. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company Web site for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Liam.","Liam K. Griffin","Thanks, Mitch, and welcome, everyone. The Skyworks team produced another quarter of strong results in fiscal Q3. Let me begin with a few highlights. We delivered revenue of 901 million, up 20% year-over-year and above consensus, with gross margin of 50.7% and operating margin of 37%.","We achieved earnings per share of $1.57, up 27% year-over-year and $0.05 better than consensus. And we continue to generate strong cash flow. Our operating cash flow in the first nine months of fiscal '17 exceeded $1 billion, up 63% compared to the same period last year.","In addition to our financial performance, we are aggressively expanding our design win pipeline. In mobile, we are broadening our reach across all premier OEMs. Specifically, we supported Huawei's feature-rich smartphones with SkyOne and SkyLiTE products.","We extended proprietary DRx solutions for Samsung's Galaxy platforms. We leveraged SkyOne and SkyLiTE at OPPO, Vivo, ZTE and Sharp to name just a few. And we extended our antenna tuning wins across virtually all of the leading Chinese OEMs.","In broad markets, we delivered ZigBee and Wi-Fi devices for Amazon's virtual assistants, ramped LTE MIMO solutions for leading infrastructure OEMs, commenced volume production of 802.11p modules supporting vehicle-to-vehicle communications, released optocouplers supporting healthcare monitoring, unveiled high-efficiency LAA and LTE new solutions for small cell base stations, launched home security sensors and motion detectors at Honeywell and Bosch, and we powered NetGear's latest mesh networking product line leveraging our proprietary 802.11ac technology.","So to summarize, we delivered strong financial results above consensus, diversified our design win pipeline across all key market segments and strengthened our balance sheet. In fact, we are targeting in excess of 1.1 billion in free cash flow this fiscal year, while systematically returning cash to our shareholders through buybacks and increasing dividends.","Let me remind you, we are still in the very early innings of a massive sea change as big data alters the way we live, work, educate and play. Growth projections around this opportunity are impressive.","Global mobile data usage is expected to grow seven times between 2016 and 2021. IoT volumes are exploding with 75 billion devices projected by 2025 and there is still a compelling opportunity to connect the unconnected which today represents over 3 billion people worldwide.","As we look to the future, the major stakeholders in this ecosystem will be dependent upon fast, reliable and secure connectivity providing Skyworks with a tremendous opportunity to leverage our systems level solutions and global scale.","At Skyworks, we have an ambitious vision. It\u2019s quite simply connecting everyone and everything all the time. The connection could be a smartphone, a screening device, a car, a DR headset, a drone or a foreign factor we haven\u2019t yet imagined. This vision is certainly relevant today and will be increasingly powerful as we look to the future.","Anticipating the needs of our customers and end markets, Skyworks strategy to drive integrated system solutions remains a centric theme supporting the success of our business. Our strategy is further underpinned by several key competitive advantages.","First, we have developed a broader technology reach and highest performing portfolio moving from power amplifier switches and filters to advanced SkyOne and DRx platforms.","Second, we engage at a deep level with the most innovative and influential companies in the wireless ecosystem working side-by-side, engineer-to-engineer to resolve challenges we see today and those we anticipate in the future.","Finally, we have global manufacturing assets and scale providing us with an ability to deliver unique form factors and world-class quality across a broad set of applications in customers. Moving forward, we will continue to play a leadership role in unwiring the planet, extending our reach across new markets and enabling billions or connected devices.","With that, I will turn the call over to Kris for a review of Q3 and our outlook for the current quarter.","Kris Sennesael","Thanks, Liam. Revenue for the third fiscal quarter was 901 million, up 20% compared to Q3 of last year and exceeding our guidance and consensus estimates. Gross profit was 457 million or 50.7% of revenue, up 30 basis points sequentially.","Operating expenses were 123 million. As a result, we generated 333 million of operating income translating into an operating margin of 37%, up 30 basis points sequentially. Our tax rate was 12.7%, driving net income of 293 million or $1.57 of diluted earnings per share, exceeding our guidance by $0.05.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash flow from operations was 314 million, an increase of 123% year-over-year. Capital expenditures were 113 million. Dividends paid in the quarter were 52 million and we repurchased 1.3 million shares of our common stock for a total of 129 million. We ended the third quarter with a cash balance of 1.4 billion, up nearly 50% from Q3 last year and we have no debt.","Now moving to our outlook for fiscal Q4. For the fourth quarter of 2017, we anticipate our revenue to be 980 million. At this revenue level, we expect gross margin expansion to 51% with operating expenses of 124 million.","Below the line, we anticipate roughly 1 million in other income and a tax rate of 13.5%. We expect our diluted share count do be approximately 186 million shares. Accordingly, we plan to deliver diluted earnings per share of $1.75. Finally, we announced today a 14% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.32 per share.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Liam.","Liam K. Griffin","Thank you, Kris. Clearly, Skyworks continues to demonstrate momentum in our business. Our Q4 guidance reflects record financial performance with 17% revenue growth and 19% EPS growth on a year-over-year basis.","Skyworks outperformance is driven by a vibrant dynamic mobile ecosystem, one that rewards companies who can resolve architectural complexities with simplified integrated solutions.","At a higher level, Skyworks is well positioned to capitalize on the rapidly approaching 5G technology wave, enabling new markets from autonomous vehicles to emerging segments in artificial intelligence, robotics and virtual reality.","In closing, we are focused on creating significant shareholder value while executing on our ambitious vision of connecting everyone and everything all the time.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let\u2019s open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Harsh Kumar at Stephens. Please go ahead.","Harsh Kumar","Hi, guys. Fantastic execution in the quarter. I just had a simple question. Liam, you just put up a 20% growth rate. You\u2019re guiding for 17. I think from previous conversations with your company, I remember you talk about 3%, 4% unit growth, content growth of 10 to 15 minus some ASP, but you seem to be doing a lot better than that as a company even when your biggest customer is sort of flattish, call it. What is working here at a broad level? And I have a follow up.","Liam K. Griffin","Yes, sure. Thank you, Harsh. Well, a couple of things. One of the points I\u2019d like to make is that we really are making great strides on expanding the reach of our portfolio, the content reach, innovating more and more with higher end platforms, adding customers. We\u2019ve named several in the prepared remarks. The other thing I\u2019d like to point out and we didn\u2019t comment on this in the script but in our Q4, our current quarter, we\u2019re going to get our broad market\u2019s business on a $1 billion annualized revenue run rate. So we\u2019re going to be above 250 million. That side of the business has been growing double digits. And then you add what we\u2019re doing with mobile by expanding reach, you put that together and I think that\u2019s really the catalyst behind that top line.","Harsh Kumar","And my follow up, Liam or Kris feel free to comment here. You talked about outpacing the industry growth. I was curious how you\u2019re looking at the industry growth in the next 6 to 12 to 18 to 24 months and how do you think you will do relative to that, how much better can you do relative to that?","Liam K. Griffin","Sure. Well, we still think that the content momentum in mobile is compelling. If you look at this ecosystem we talked about and the number of stakeholders that drive a mobile economy, right, whether it\u2019s Netflix or Amazon or Google, we know all these companies are making tremendous profits and leveraging mobile. So when we look out, we do see a significant content opportunity for high-performance integrate systems. That\u2019s what we do. So the market\u2019s still looks good. It\u2019s hard to characterize the total unit base because there\u2019s a lot of mix shifts, but mobile is getting more and more value within semiconductors and our ability to address that continues to expand.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we go to Blayne Curtis at Barclays. Please go ahead.","Blayne Curtis","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Liam, I was wondering when you look at the September quarter, actually the whole back half, maybe you can just talk about the ramp of the North American smartphone guys versus prior years? There\u2019s been a lot of talk about a later ramp. Just curious what\u2019s your embedding into the second half for yourself?","Liam K. Griffin","Sure, Blayne, thank you. We actually are seeing a predictable cycle with our largest customer and the areas that we can control are around content reach and our ability to drive technology. We feel really good about that part of the equation. And our backlog visibility and forward-looking momentum, we feel very comfortable with it. So we\u2019ve worked with our largest customer for years. We feel good about the cycle. And we also have a very broad mix across legacy, new models and also portfolio of non-mobile products within that account.","Blayne Curtis","Great. Then I want to ask you there\u2019s a lot of concern throughout the quarter, some of the sales data out of China for domestic China were a little soft for last couple of months. Obviously, it\u2019s a complex equation. They could be exporting or we heard last night from Qualcomm about a mix shift to the high end. I\u2019m just kind of curious to your perspective in that entire market and what you\u2019re seeing also into the second half?","Liam K. Griffin","Sure. China again there\u2019s spots of weakness I think more in the 3G, 2G area. The high end as you articulated is solid. Huawei is a big, big player for us now; OPPO and Vivo also important. In Q3, we were up in China and we\u2019re going to be up slightly in Q4. Q2 for us, the March quarter, was more of a challenge. We modeled through that. But Q3 up a little bit and then Q4 again probably flat to up single digits.","Operator","And next, we go to Rick Schafer at Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Rick Schafer","Thanks. I\u2019ll add my congratulations. I guess my first question is just on CapEx. I guess it roughly doubled quarter-to-quarter. Maybe you can provide some more color on what\u2019s driving that? Was it capacity adds for Mexicali? Was it anything to do with the buy [ph] effort? And how we should maybe model CapEx going forward?","Kris Sennesael","Yes, so CapEx tend to be a little bit lumpy quarter-to-quarter and typically it\u2019s higher in the second half of our fiscal year and then lower in the first half of the fiscal year. But we target to have our CapEx on or about high single digits percent to revenue. Most of that CapEx is of course driven by a strong revenue growth that translate into more units and so we\u2019re making the necessary investments in our program fabs as well as our backend operation, assembly and test and our filter operation. And for filter operation it\u2019s not only expanding or increasing the capacity but also making sure we\u2019re making the necessary technology investments to be able to provide a higher content for richer filter portfolio.","Rick Schafer","Got it, thanks. And then maybe a higher level one for Liam. How does the current situation between Apple and Qualcomm affect Skyworks, if at all?","Liam K. Griffin","Yes, we really at this point don\u2019t see any effect on us and we certainly support our customer and we\u2019ll do whatever we need to do to help them be successful at this point.","Operator","And now we go to John Vinh with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","John Vinh","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Kris, a question for you is I was wondering if you could give us the breakout between broad markets and mobile. And then, Liam, follow-ups that you had mentioned about getting to 250 million in broad markets, was that kind of a Q4 commentary or was that somewhere outside of Q4?","Kris Sennesael","Yes, so broad markets in Q3 was approximately 27% of total revenue and mobile 73%.","Liam K. Griffin","John, with respect to broad market in Q4, we\u2019re looking for that 250 handle in Q4 and obviously continuing from there. So that would represent the $1 billion run rate. Broad markets has been performing very well and we put a lot of investment and effort around that in our portfolio around Wi-Fi, around ZigBee, even LTE in some cases is really helping propel that momentum across really high-level diversification across customers and then products.","John Vinh","Great, thank you. And then my follow-up question is around DRx. You guys seem to be doing extremely well in that market. I was wondering if you could just talk about how much runway do you see left there. Obviously it looks like a lot of the flagship phones today have uplink and downlink. Should we think about most of that growth opportunity to be in China and at other customers, or can you just help us quantify that?","Liam K. Griffin","Sure. The DRx technology, I know that you study that and you recognize the value that it brings to downlink communication in mobile. It\u2019s a big deal. And with this whole ecosystem that we discussed and the amount of data that\u2019s being driven through mobile, the DRx technologies are more valuable than ever. Just like our movement toward SkyOne on the transmit chain. We see a continuous evolution with more content, more complexity, more opportunity. So you have \u2013 filling up the unit perspective, introducing DRx to customers that don\u2019t have it and then there\u2019s the continuous upgrade cycle with customers that have enjoyed that product and benefitted from it, yet want more. So we see that as really kind of the mirror image of what we\u2019ve done in transmit chain and the content opportunity continuing to expand.","John Vinh","Thank you.","Operator","And now we go to Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the good results and the consistently strong execution. Liam, for my first question, when I look at the implied mobile guidance for September, it sounds like it\u2019s up about 10%, 11% sequential which is somewhat below seasonality. So it is possible that you have predictable outlook at your large customer but still the ramp is somewhat backend loaded? And if that\u2019s right, then is it possible that December or March are perhaps better than seasonal for your mobile business?","Kris Sennesael","Well, I\u2019m not sure how your math works because we are guiding for the September quarter to be up 17% year-over-year which is up 9% sequentially.","Vivek Arya","Right. But when I look at the growth, Kris, then from your broad markets business, it implies the mobile business would be slightly better than 9%, so up 11% or so sequential. I\u2019m just looking at that sequential and comparing it to your historical September, right, which tends to grow up substantially more than that. So I\u2019m just trying to think whether that is because perhaps the upper ramp is maybe pushed out a little bit this year even though it is not really changed versus your expectations?","Liam K. Griffin","Yes, we\u2019ll have to triangulate on the math. What I can tell you is the outlook that we have in Q4 is solid. It represents record performance. We\u2019re not guiding Q1 but I think it\u2019s safe to say that you should expect continued growth into Q1. And so maybe some of that will flush through on your math. But we can discuss offline if we need to triangulate.","Vivek Arya","Got it. And then as my follow up, a longer term question, Liam. I\u2019m on the same page as far as all the long-term trends and the leverage to big data in mobile and IoT are concerned. The question is what can you do to reduce the reliance on Apple that is still close to 40% of your sales and has been that way over the last several years? Right now they are in front of a very good product cycle and in another year or so, right, they will probably start to decelerate at some point. So just conceptually how do you think about reducing reliance on Apple at some point?","Liam K. Griffin","Sure. Well, as the data represents, the broad market business has been on a substantial growth rate starting with relatively low numbers a few years back and now it\u2019s a $1 billion business. We talked about what we\u2019ve done with Huawei. We\u2019ve talked about what we\u2019ve done at Samsung. We\u2019ve introduced a rich product line throughout China. The IoT business within broad market has been incredible for us and it leverages different technologies. And with respect to our largest customer, we\u2019re going to win all the business we can with that account and that\u2019s not going to stop. So I think if you weave all that together, that\u2019s our strategy. And also you have to look at the market value of the opportunity across customers if you look at how the shares break out. It\u2019s important to be balanced and we certainly are.","Operator","Our next question comes from Edward Snyder at Charter Equity Research. Please go ahead.","Edward Snyder","Thanks a lot. And speaking more to the mobile question, Liam, do you expect this year that you might wind up on more different SKUs with your largest customers; last year on the Qualcomm SKU? Is that going to be the case in this year or things are going to be little different when you get a piece of the Intel?","Liam K. Griffin","Well, we expect to have solid position with all of the basebands that our largest customer use, we feel very good about that. We refresh our product line in ways that make sense. We have a technology reach that\u2019s expanded. We\u2019ve demonstrated our ability to work with multi baseband providers just by looking out through the market, whether it\u2019s HiSilicon, whether it\u2019s Qualcomm, whether it\u2019s Intel or MediaTek. I think you know we\u2019ve demonstrated diversification and our ability to link and synch up and calibrate with baseband. Nothing\u2019s different with our largest customer. We will demonstrate the same level of performance.","Edward Snyder","Just as a way of clarification, I know you had content on all SKUs last year but your concentration content was mostly with Qualcomm I think on the last model. And then to follow up on the DRx question was posed earlier here, I know you\u2019re talking general there\u2019s a lot of growth here. But more specifically now that cellular MIMO is coming into some of these flagship phones, doesn\u2019t that cause a significant increase, maybe even a doubling \u2013 maybe not doubling depending on the content but certainly in terms of units or modules, don\u2019t we see a significant maybe doubling and tripling of DRx modules to support cellular MIMO?","Liam K. Griffin","Yes, absolutely. I think that\u2019s a significant trend. Very early innings right now but the important part is getting the baseline right, which we\u2019ve done and then starting to move that technology forward and then having the multiplication effect of MIMO architectures is going to be a great opportunity. And as you know, what it does for the user, what it does for data delivery is incredible. So the value of that technology is good for us but it\u2019s great for the ecosystem, it\u2019s great for the end customer.","Operator","And next we have Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Toshiya Hari","Great. Thanks so much. My first question is on gross margins. Kris, I think gross margins of Skyworks has been relatively stable over the past, say, four to six quarters despite revenue being weaker a year ago and now much stronger today. So basically we haven\u2019t seen much leverage to the upside nor the downside. Can you remind us what the long-term goal is for you guys in terms of gross margins?","Kris Sennesael","Yes, our target is to get to 53% and we are making good progress towards that target. In Q3 we added 30 basis points. We Q4, we guide another 30 basis points. And of course in the December quarter, we expect on higher revenue further improvements on the gross margin as well.","Toshiya Hari","Okay. And then as a follow up kind of related to that, you guys have talked about in-sourcing filters going forward and that being an opportunity to improve gross margins. Can you remind us where you are in that process? And again, what the end goal is there? Thank you.","Kris Sennesael","Yes. Currently we have approximately 50% of the filters in-house. As we ramp in the second half of calendar year '17, here a new set of platforms that will further increase probably towards the 75%. And then we will continue to work on that in '18. Probably at the max, we will reach 90%.","Operator","And next we go to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kulin Patel","Hi. This is Kulin Patel calling in for Ambrish. Thanks for taking my question. My first is a follow up on the gross margin question. On a year-over-year basis, you\u2019re guiding September quarter revenues up 17% year-over-year but your GM is flat. Could you help us understand \u2013 you talked about issues on expanding GM, but what is offsetting that? Why aren\u2019t we seeing a year-over-year increase?","Kris Sennesael","There\u2019s a lot of puts and takes that\u2019s going to gross margin. Obviously on the revenue side you have pricing and mix shifts, although there from a pricing point of view there is no real change, it\u2019s a relatively stable environment. From a mix point of view, we continue to work on bringing more complex, more integrated, more value-added products to the market. We\u2019re growing our broad market business which is slightly above average gross margin and so that helps a little bit there. Then on the cost side, of course, we continue to execute on our driving operational efficiencies, yield improvement, test time reduction, sourcing actions as well as our in-sourcing. Also keep in mind that our days of inventory right now is approximately 10% lower than it was a year ago. So when you put that altogether, again I feel comfortable that we can continue to further improve gross margins towards our target level of 53%.","Kulin Patel","Thanks. And on the capital allocation, you recently announced increasing dividend. How does that synch in with your capital allocation? And can you remind us on your capital allocation framework?","Kris Sennesael","Yes, absolutely. So first of all, I feel good about the balance sheet. We have $1.4 billion of cash and no debt. Keep in mind that roughly half of that cash is onshore, half of that cash is offshore. Secondly, I feel really strong about our ability to generate cash on a year-to-date basis. Our free cash flow margin is approximately 31%, again taking into account roughly half of the cash being generated is onshore, half is offshore. And in terms of returning cash to the shareholders, our stated goal is that we want to return 40% to 50% of the free cash flow back to the shareholders using our dividend program and share buyback program. Actually year-to-date, it\u2019s approximately 60% that we have returned, 60% of the free cash flow. We are very active with our share buyback program. Last quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares or $129 million and we have our dividend program which we announced today that we increase it by 14% increasing the dividend from $0.28 per share to $0.32 per share.","Operator","For our next question, we go to Chris Caso at Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Chris Caso","Thank you. Good afternoon. I wonder if you could walk us through now with your guidance for September up 17% year-on-year, where did that comes from as best you can in terms of [indiscernible] where the growth in content comes. And I guess if I remember correctly, the first half of last year there was some inventory burn with your largest customer. So is it correct in thinking that this year-on-year comp is now a cleaner year-on-year comp?","Liam K. Griffin","Sure, Chris. Yes, this is definitely a cleaner year-on-year comp. I\u2019ll start with that. And if you look at the outlook here, 17% up in Q4 and then again we expect to be up in Q1. We haven\u2019t guided but we expect to be up. You\u2019ve got a couple things happening. You\u2019ve got a predicable mobile cycle and Skyworks having some real strong content aligned with that mobile cycle, so that\u2019s a positive. We\u2019re continuing to do well in the broad markets. The IoT space within broad markets is solid. And then again, I think if you just look out at some of these new accounts that we\u2019ve been developing beyond our largest Samsung numbers, the Huawei numbers, elements of China all contribute to that. But it\u2019s a mobile-driven second half. We\u2019re in excellent position for it. Our visibility is real solid and we expect to be able to drive the right kind of performance. Q4, as we outlined, is a record for us. Q4 with our guidance of 980, it\u2019s record revenue and it\u2019s record EPS and it\u2019s not going to be the peak quarter in the calendar year. So I think there\u2019s more to come.","Chris Caso","Okay. As a follow-on to that, how should we be thinking about content this year at your largest customer? And I guess for one, are you still expecting that to be up year-on-year? And then is it any way mix dependent? And like this year, there may be some differences in terms of models [indiscernible]. Is your content dependent to some extent on some of that mix going forward?","Liam K. Griffin","Well, we can\u2019t get into too much detail here with our largest customer but we are confident in what we\u2019ve modeled financially. We completely understand what we\u2019ve won with respect to content and we completely understand where the mix is and having all that flush through with our guidance. It\u2019s lined up very well in the position that we have with backlog is solid and the other accounts around that, we have very good visibility. So that\u2019s where we are at this point.","Operator","Next, we go to Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Vinayak Rao","Hi. This is Vinayak calling in for Craig. I had a follow up on China. So you said you\u2019re expecting China to be flat to up slightly in September. How does that compare to a typical seasonality? And secondly, what potential do you see in the region for content growth? Where are you now and where do you see the content heading over the next two to three years?","Liam K. Griffin","Sure. With respect to typical seasonality, normally we don\u2019t see going into September a big part from China. It\u2019s kind of a neutral period. That\u2019s been our history anyway. But we continue to grow overall the revenues in China. So on a sequential basis we look at it as slightly up, nothing substantial. China year-over-year for Skyworks is still a double digit grower. With respect to content, I think that\u2019s the real story for us and we talked a lot about names like Huawei where we posted very significant content approaching $9 to $10 with P9 and make [ph] series phones. OPPO and Vivo, they\u2019re kind of moving up the food chain not quite at the Huawei level in terms of performance or content but moving up. And we\u2019re a big, big player in the lower end of China. That\u2019s not our game. We do have some broad reach with MediaTek positions that do get us into some of the 3G markets and some of the other 4G markets. But content is a key element. We\u2019re starting to rollout our antenna tuning platforms now into China, the DRx attached in the mid-tier China really is early innings again. So there\u2019s a lot more to do in China but the current position that we have right now is solid.","Vinayak Rao","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. As a follow up, wanted to talk about your positioning for carrier agg, like with increasing penetration of carrier aggregation as we see a lot of mixing of bands in the mid and high band, how are you positioned there if you\u2019re strategy focusing there with multiplexers that involve TC SAW filters? Eventually would you require BAR filters there and that\u2019s something which you look for partners or some of it captive solution? How are you positioned for carrier aggregation?","Liam K. Griffin","Sure. We\u2019re actually delivering carrier aggregation based solutions; we\u2019ve been doing that for years. The SkyOne technology which is more transmit chain integrating multimode, multiband PA with switching and high-performance filtering, delivering CA uplink. On the DRx side, the category we discussed on a few questions already today, the diversity received technology is providing carrier aggregation on the downlink and there\u2019s a variety of filters depending upon the bands that you\u2019re engaged with. It could be a standard SAW, TC SAW, bulk acoustic wave or a technology that \u2013 it could even use a passive device in some cases. We\u2019re very well positioned and we\u2019re looking forward to carrier aggregation. It has been one of the catalysts that\u2019s driven content expansion through mobile and through the whole RF space and I think it will continue to increase. For us now, the DRx category where we\u2019ve led has been really illustrating the performance of CA on the downlink, as I mentioned, it\u2019s a big deal. But the DRx category has been lightly populated with just a handful of meaningful accounts. We have a long way to go to roll that out globally. So we\u2019re in good position.","Operator","And next we go to Craig Ellis with B. Riley Financial. Please go ahead.","Craig Ellis","Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the quarter.","Liam K. Griffin","Thanks, Craig.","Craig Ellis","[Indiscernible] topics that have been hit on but in a holistic and longer-term way. As we look at the last couple of years for the company, you\u2019ve had a very good rate of growth driving SkyOne and SkyLiTE into your customer base and then more recently diversity received has come along. As we look out over the next 12 to 18 months, what will represent that third leg of growth for the company? Is it MIMO on the diversity side or are you seeing some new content opportunities that could be somewhat similar to the diversity received where it gives you a net new content opportunity?","Liam K. Griffin","Yes, that\u2019s a great question, Craig, so a couple of things. We do believe and I think this is mentioned by one of the analyst already today. MIMO is real. It\u2019s going to produce significant gains in data rate and performance in content generated back and forth in the phone to the cloud. And MIMO is going to be a big deal for us. So we have the technology in place to deliver and that could be substantial. There\u2019s some other technologies that we\u2019re looking at with our filtering portfolio. For Skyworks there\u2019s a lot of customers that we have that use the SkyLiTE architecture which excludes filtering. So the filtering is handled on a discrete basis. We deliver everything else and we meet together. We want to drive that towards integration. That would be a benefit for us. The broad market in IoT space continues to look good and we\u2019re starting to see a migration as examples with one of the leading home surveillance companies, video companies where we started with a light-duty Wi-Fi device with relatively low content. And now the technology is moving to real-time streaming and 4K. And the value for us, the content opportunity goes up 3X to 4X and that\u2019s just with one example. So there\u2019s IoT in units and then there\u2019s IoT in content. And then again in classical mobile, you\u2019ve got the high end looking at MIMO, you have the mid-tier and low-tier looking at DRx and SkyOne with filters for the first time. So all of those things come together and that\u2019s kind of in your 18 to 24-month horizon. If you go out beyond that, we do think within 5G there\u2019s going to be a whole new set of opportunities that are going to be driven by the 5G capabilities; higher data rate, lower latency. Things like autonomous vehicles should be very strategic to Skyworks and some other applications. But we have a pretty good line of sight over the next couple of years on where the market\u2019s going to go and it\u2019s our job to be ready to deliver products.","Craig Ellis","Just a follow up there on 5G. I think it was in the last two months that another company that\u2019s in your ZIP code indicated that their expectation [indiscernible] for your device partners and your infrastructure partners on the broad market side for when you\u2019ll start to see some impact for that business. And will we see it more on the handset side or the broad market side for Skyworks?","Liam K. Griffin","Yes, I missed some of your question there but I\u2019ll try to answer it the way I believe I heard it. So on the handset side what we are seeing and again this is a few years out, we\u2019re seeing 5G engines will augment existing 4G technology. So it\u2019s a case where you\u2019re going to have an incremental slice of content to handle the higher frequency bands in 5G and some of the CA in downlink work required for 5G. So that will be an incremental value in mobile. On the infrastructure side, there\u2019s going to be a very substantial upgrade cycle going on to deliver 5G technology. So that could be \u2013 as you know, we have technologies there. There\u2019s also going to be I think a proliferation of small cell technology kind of in the metro areas around 5G and we\u2019ll participate there as well. So you\u2019ve got a mobile side, you\u2019ve got classic infrastructure and then you have the small cell space.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","David Wong","Thanks very much. Within your broad markets, do you have all the technologies and key products you\u2019d like to have to develop businesses of the rate you want, or are there specific new capabilities you\u2019re either developing in-house or thinking about acquiring?","Liam K. Griffin","Sure. Now that\u2019s a great question. We could always do more. We could always add to the broad market portfolio for sure. Today, what has been really the key for us is the connectivity portion of IoT in broad markets. So within IoT really just delivering whether it\u2019s ZigBee, or Bluetooth or Wi-Fi or GPS, Skyworks is able to attach to these applications. Other parts of broad market like infrastructure can bring in a whole different set of products. You can have A to Zs and Z to As and power management and other things. But I will tell you that our reach in the broad markets is expanding. And as we start to build better relationships and stronger partnerships with more and more companies, non-mobile companies in many cases, we\u2019re learning more about what the architectures look like. So there\u2019s been several occasions where you\u2019ve got an initial design win with a broad market customer on a certain component and that\u2019s led to an expansion in the relationship and opportunity and we succeeded with adding content in new applications. So we want to continue to do that. But definitely connectivity has been a key but there\u2019s a lot of things around connectivity that we could wrap up and lever into our system solutions much like what we\u2019ve done in mobile where we started with power amplifiers and then brought in switching and then brought in filtering and now deliver that as a single engine in SkyOne or DRx on the downlink.","David Wong","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Vijay Rakesh","Hi, guys. Just going back to the seasonality as you go to end of the year, you look at the December quarter, do you expect a similar trend as you saw last year where I think last year you had an up 9%? Or put another way, do you expect to see this same 17% to 20% year-on-year growth continuing to the back half as well?","Liam K. Griffin","Yes, we\u2019re not going to give you a full guidance for December. But certainly you should expect a sequential increase similar to what we\u2019ve been seeing over the last \u2013 we\u2019re not sure how it will roll up at this point. We\u2019re not going to guide the fourth quarter but it will certainly be up.","Vijay Rakesh","Got it. And as you look at \u2013 you talked about 1.4 billion cash on hand and 1 billion plus of free cash flow now. Any thought on if you\u2019re looking at diversifying your business M&A, any thoughts around that? Thanks.","Kris Sennesael","So in terms of M&A, we haven\u2019t changed our view. So we feel really good about our organic business, the ability to grow the top line and grow the bottom line to record levels. So we definitely are not desperate. But having said that, as we look at multiple potential targets out there, we keep our eyes open and if the right target comes along at the right price, we\u2019ll definitely have a look at it.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie Securities. Please go ahead.","Srini Pajjuri","Thank you for squeezing me in. Hi, guys.","Liam K. Griffin","Hi.","Srini Pajjuri","A question about China. As you look out to next year\u2019s design, I guess \u2013 you\u2019re probably bidding for next year\u2019s design cycle in China. Now I\u2019m just curious as to if you\u2019re seeing any change to competitive environment in a Qualcomm, TDK as well as the fact that the BAR filter availability has improved at your competitors?","Liam K. Griffin","There wasn\u2019t anything new related to TDK-Qualcomm. The filters were available before, they\u2019re still available now. I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s changed. What we do see in China though and this is a really important dynamic is that finally now the market leader in China Huawei who for years really kind of drove a mid-tier connectivity architecture, they\u2019re now driving a high-tier connectivity architecture and that\u2019s a big difference and that\u2019s an opportunity for us to bring $9, $10 of content to the market and we\u2019ve demonstrated that. We\u2019re starting to see the mid-tier move in cycle. Maybe not quite up to that level but they\u2019re also seeing the benefit of connectivity within their build of material in the benefit of high-speed data and what that means to their consumer and how that allows them to sell more and more phones. So we see some really nice upgrade cycles there. One of our partners \u2013 we have a lot of designs with Qualcomm in the region. We have a lot of designs with MediaTek in the region. And then if you go to Huawei which is the flagship account, that\u2019s HiSilicon. And our relationship there engineer-to-engineer in the lab developing unique architectures has been outstanding. So we\u2019ve got quite a bit of diversification. There hasn\u2019t been a big change. But I think today the catalyst towards moving upstream and adding more value from the OEM perspective is playing out really well for us here at Skyworks.","Srini Pajjuri","Great. And then my follow-up, I guess more of a longer-term. Liam, you mentioned 5G if it happens in the next couple of years. I\u2019m just curious as to what type of filtered technology will be used? I guess there are two different sets of frequencies; one is sub 6 gigahertz and then we\u2019re also hearing about millimeter wave. And I want to hear your thoughts and how well your positioned in both of these different frequency ranges?","Liam K. Griffin","Yes, sure. Well one of the things that you also need to mention is kind of the way that the duplexing is going on. So you\u2019ve got in China this FDD, frequency division duplexing, or TDD, time division duplexing and that\u2019s a big, big issue around filters. That\u2019s going to drive what filters you select. So in addition to just the frequency bands themselves and how high those frequencies go, you have to look at the duplexing technology. So one of the things we are seeing is in TDD, time division duplexing, you can use TC SAW. You don\u2019t need bulk acoustic wave. And in FDD frequency division where this is more of a burden, the bulk acoustic wave technology plays there. A shift in 5G is actually opening up more opportunity as the market\u2019s moving to time division. So that\u2019s one important point. Beyond that, the temperature compensated devices that we have today have a reach that goes up to 2.5 gig and we\u2019re continuing to push higher in mid-band. So one of the things that you have at Skyworks is we have a lot of greenfield in our filtering capabilities. We can go as low as 600 megahertz all the way to 2.5 and potentially higher with TC SAW. When you jump to 5G and you move to TDD time division, there\u2019s a whole new opportunity for us that doesn\u2019t necessarily require bulk acoustic wave.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Mr. Griffin for any closing comments.","Liam K. Griffin","Well, thank you all for participating on today\u2019s call. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming investor conferences and other events during the quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call.

This call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Steve Ferranti, Senior Director of Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Ferranti, please go ahead.","Stephen Ferranti ","Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks fourth fiscal quarter 2012 conference call. Joining me today are Dave Aldrich, Don Palette and Liam Griffin. Dave will begin today's call with a business overview followed by Don's financial review and outlook. We will then open the lines for your questions. Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those noted in our earnings release and those detailed from time to time in our SEC filings.","I would also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we will discuss today are from our non-GAAP income statement consistent with the format we've used in the past. Please refer to our  press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave for his comments on the quarter.","David J. Aldrich","Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. I'm pleased to report a strong finish to our 2012 fiscal year with fourth quarter results exceeding our prior expectations. As we enter fiscal 2013, our market drivers remain strong and we're capturing more content than ever before within our existing mobile and diversified analog markets. On top of this, we are rapidly expanding our footprint in complementary new verticals like automotive, like medical and the connected home.","Our competitive positioning continues to strengthen. With this design momentum and new product pipeline we have in place today, the stage set for us to outpace our addressable markets in 2013.","Now turning to the fourth quarter results. We posted revenue of $421 million. That's up 8% sequentially and slightly above our previously updated guidance of $420 million. We produced fourth quarter operating income of $103.6 million with operating margins of 24.6% and that's up 100 basis points sequentially. We earned $0.53 in diluted earnings per share, and that's a $0.01 better than our updated guidance. And we're guiding to 14% year-over-year revenue growth in the December quarter with expanding margins.","So it was another strong performance for Skyworks. For a more detailed commentary on the quarter, I'll turn it over to Don now for his financial review and outlook.","Donald W. Palette","Thanks, Dave and thanks again for joining us, everyone. I'll first provide a more in-depth review of our fourth quarter results and then outline our business outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2013.","Revenue for the fourth quarter was $421 million, up more than 8% sequentially. Gross profit was $180.7 million or 42.9% of revenue. Operating expenses were $77.1 million, consisting of R&D expense of $49.2 million and SG&A expense of $27.9 million, yielding $103.6 million of operating income and a 24.6% operating margin. Our cash tax rate ended the year at 4.8%, down from 6.3% in 2011, primarily driven by our successful implementation of multiple business restructuring initiatives. And as a result, we paid no cash taxes in Q4 based on favorable year-end adjustments to our annual tax rate. Net income was $103.5 million or $0.53 of diluted earnings per share, $0.01 better than our updated guidance range.","Now turning to our fourth quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement. We generated $50 million in cash flow from operations, bringing our fiscal 2012 total to $285 million. Exited the quarter with $307 million in cash and no debt. Invested $31 million in capital expenditures during the fourth quarter with depreciation of $17 million.","Now for our first quarter 2013 business outlook. With our new platform wins and design momentum, we   expect Q1 revenue to be up 14% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Assuming a revenue level of $450 million, we suggest modeling gross margin to be up slightly to around 43%.","Looking ahead, we see opportunity for further gross margin enhancement as we realize the benefits of our current capital investments and ramp up margin accretive products like SkyOne, SkyHi and our portfolio of a high-performance analog products. We expect fourth quarter operating expense to be approximately $80 million, resulting in operating margins just north of 25%.","Below the line, we anticipate $100,000 in expenses from interest income and other expenses and a cash tax rate of around 7.5%. We expect our cash tax rate to remain at these levels for the remainder of our 2013 fiscal year, and that's better than our prior expectations of around 10%. As a result, we expect Q4 EPS at $0.54 using a base of 195 million shares. And as Dave will discuss, the drivers are in place today for Skyworks to outpace market growth, putting us on a path to achieving our midterm business model of 30% operating margins at quarterly revenue level of $550 million which, as a reminder, produces around $3.00 in annualized earnings per share.","Now with that I'll turn the call back over to Dave for his comments on our business drivers. Dave?","David J. Aldrich","Thank you, Don. Now for the remainder of the call, I'd like to highlight 4 key elements of our strategy that underpin our growth and expectations. First, we are levered to high-growth markets. Second, we are broadly diversified across customers, product set and end markets. Third, our competitive differentiation provides a sustainable advantage in the market. And fourth, our unique business model enables us to efficiently convert strong top line growth into superior operating results.","So starting with our market opportunities. We are fortunate to be a participant in many of the highest growth markets within the technology space today. By every measure, the mobile broadband phenomenon continues to advance on a global basis, slowly displacing traditional computing. Internet stalwarts like Google, Amazon and Microsoft, who historically have not participated in mobile devices, today see mobility as a critical component of their long-term strategies. This has spurred a race to provide the next generation of leading-edge smartphones and tablets as a gateway for eCommerce, for on-demand content, location-based advertising, mobile apps, cloud-based services and social networks.","In emerging markets like China, the mobile broadband adoption rate is just beginning. Among China's top carriers, 3G still comprises less than 20% of the total subscriber base, creating a significant growth driver over the next 3 to 5 years as 2G subscribers upgrade. And in fact, a recent report from Barclays estimates that in China alone, 1.2 billion smartphones will be shipped throughout 2015. As a benchmark, around 300 million will be shipped throughout 2012.","As this technology revolution is by no means limited to mobile, wireless connectivity is becoming pervasive throughout a growing array of applications in consumer products, machine-to-machine, home automation, even spanning automotive and medical applications. According to ABI Research, the number of Wi-Fi enabled devices shipped is expected to surpass 1.5 billion this year. This is more than twice the number shipped just 2 years ago.","Second, we are broadly diversified, enabling stronger and more consistent financial results. Now as a reminder, there are 3 elements to our diversification strategy: diversification across our OEM customers, within our product offering and across a broad array of end markets. The result is that today, we are the supplier of choice with a leading share position at every mobile device OEM and baseband partner, helping to insulate us somewhat from customer share shifts.","We address more RF and analog content today than ever before, beyond traditional power amplifiers and RF front ends into power management, Wi-Fi, GPS, switch modules, filters and tuners. We're addressing a broader set of end markets. Increasingly, we are seeing new opportunities in consumer products, home automation, automotive, medical and military.","Third, complementing our diversification, we have well-defined and long-established competitive differentiators. We're experts in RF and analog system design, leveraging a global force of system and applications engineers. We offer an unmatched technology portfolio that includes deep expertise in SOI, CMOS, GaAs, BiFET and silicon germanium, along with a library of nearly 1,000 patents.","We have leading capabilities in advanced integration, including proprietary shielding, 3D die stacking, flip chip and others. And we are the lowest cost producer based on our global scale and our integration capabilities.","These differentiators allow us to produce the highest performing devices with the highest levels of integration. And SkyOne is a great example of this. Our customers are placing higher value on total solutions. And there's a clear premium placed on performance, supplier reliability and application support, which further reinforces our leadership position.","And fourth, by leveraging these competitive advantages, along with our industry-leading scale, integration capabilities and hybrid manufacturing models, we've assembled an engine that efficiently converts above market growth into best-in-class returns. We are firmly committed to achieving our target operating model of 30%, which puts Skyworks among the top of the class within the semiconductor space. And we believe these 4 strategic pillars provide us with a clear competitive edge in the market.","Now looking ahead to the year ahead -- now looking to a new year ahead, we have some very specific growth drivers in place that provide us a high level of confidence in our growth trajectory over the course of 2013.","First, LTE. We're already engaged in developing activities supporting several major 2013 phone models that incorporate entirely new LTE bands like 9 and 10; 18, 19 and 38, 41, in support of deployments in Europe and Asia, resulting in more addressable content.","Second growth driver are the emerging market smartphones. We have significant design momentum in leading smartphone reference designs within the China market, where we see our RF content opportunity more than doubling. On top of this, even the most basic smartphone provides new addressable analog opportunities that further expand our content. In total, it's not uncommon for us to be pursuing up to $3.00 or more in addressable RF and analog content in these applications.","Third, is the growing adoption of tablets. The recent introduction of smaller screen sizes and lower price points is expected to dramatically increase adoption rates over the course of 2013. In fact, analyst forecasts predict that tablet shipments could reach more than 350 million units within the next 3 years. This market segment is clearly performance driven. And based on the strength of our technology offerings, Skyworks has established a leading share position with strong incumbency advantages.","And finally, an explosion in mobile connectivity. Over the course of 2013, we expect to see a wave of 802.11ac enabled notebooks, tablets and smartphones enter the market with higher addressable dollar content for Skyworks. We already have significant traction in the 802.11ac market and have been designed into some of the first ultrabooks and smartphones to incorporate this technology.","In total, as we look at the year ahead, we see these trends providing a mid-teens TAM growth opportunity, representing a powerful tailwind for Skyworks.","So in closing, our fourth fiscal quarter marked another strong performance for Skyworks. And we're very optimistic about our prospects for 2013. We believe that our strategy of continuing to diversify our business, expanding into new verticals and maintaining a laser focus on operational execution is clearly working.","This concludes our prepared comments. Operator, let's open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go to the line of Craig Ellis representing Caris & Company.","Unknown Analyst","This is Brett Perry here for Craig. Could you just give some granularity on the segments in the quarter and the outlook between cellular and linear products where the growth was coming from?","Donald W. Palette","Well, the actual revenue breakdown, Brett, for the quarter was 40% high performance analog and 60% handsets, smartphones.","David J. Aldrich","And I think from a segment standpoint, from a market standpoint, we expect strong growth in smartphones and tablets. We also expect strong growth in mobile connectivity. And we expect to see some ongoing softness in areas like smart energy and infrastructure.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, thanks. And then on your intermediate term financial model, what's your confidence in reaching that in 4 to 6 quarters? And I guess, given that the revenue target on that is 20% above current levels, is that really needed to hit your 30% operating margin? Just maybe some gives and takes within the model.","Donald W. Palette","Sure. I mean, well first of all, I think you have to look back to the track record. At various points in the last 3 or 4 years, we put together mid-term models and we've had a very high success rate at hitting those every time and, if you think about that 550, it is about 22% growth. But if you look at what we've been talking about, as far as the market opportunity, without even gaining any share, we see 2013 as a 15% kind of growth opportunity. So that kind of hangs with the 4 to 6 quarters that we've talked about. So we clearly see that opportunity in that 6-quarter horizon, within that horizon. And the volume is critical to hitting the 30%. You do need revenue level to leverage the OpEx as well as to continue to enhance and generate margin improvements. So you do need that kind of level to hit the 30%.","Operator","Our next question comes from the lines of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Dave, just a little bit of -- clarifying that, just for Q4, do you expect stronger mix of smartphones? Can you maybe just a bit on the macro environment?  Certainly looks like on some high-volume smartphones you had strong content share, so can you maybe discuss if you might be losing short-term share in other customers or if it's still the macro backdrop has different customers struggling?","David J. Aldrich","Sure. Okay. First, we're quite pleased with our second-half performance. If you look -- include  our guidance, that puts us up about 15% in the second half versus the first half. So we're pleased with that, that's higher than the growth rate of the market. We are a very broadly diversified supplier. We ship to everyone. Therefore we are a bit of a proxy. And we continue to take share among the leaders while diversifying. So we're growing faster than the market. And I think that our sequential guidance this quarter being up 7% in the market, it's probably up in the mid-single digits range, is consistent with that.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay, thanks. And Don, can you just share with us, the 10% customers in the quarter, and the 2G and 3G mix within the wireless?","Donald W. Palette","Sure, Mike. The 10% for the quarter were Foxconn, Samsung. And 2G was roughly 20% of the revenue for the quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Aalok Shah with D.A. Davidson.","Aalok K. Shah - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. In terms of the pricing environment, is there anything we should make note of as to what might be going on in, particularly, in the smartphones space this quarter and maybe next quarter?","Liam K. Griffin","Yes, Aalok. This is Liam. We certainly see some pricing activity, some pressure in some of the lower end markets, the 2G markets in China. In the smartphone space, however, we see this market driven by performance and value, and our technology there has led us to a number of new design wins and that's given us pretty defensible position with respect to pricing.","Donald W. Palette","And Aalok, just like to add to that, if you look at our historical ASP erosion, and we do it part by part, year-over-year. I mean, it's a metric that we look at very closely. We are well within the historical ranges. We see a little bit of a bump in the open market 2G pricing maybe a little higher discounting than we see in the past, but other than that, it's right within historical ranges for the rest of the portfolio.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","And, Liam, in terms of kind of how you see the next few quarters, I guess this question's more meant you, you had a good ramp with Samsung on their flagship platform. Are you guys seeing some softness maybe at that customer, maybe going into this quarter? Or is there anything else we can make note of as to how you're progressing with that customer in the near-term?","Liam K. Griffin","Sure. What I can tell you, in general, that with the leading smartphone accounts, one of the things that we're quite pleased about, and Dave alluded to this is that we are -- we're gaining additional content here. We're gaining share but we are also adding new products to our mix. For example, I think, when you look out over the next several quarters, you'll start to see an increasing attachment with embedded Wi-Fi devices from Skyworks, 2GB, 4GB and 5GB, oftentimes 11ac. And we're one of the first to market with that technology. You going to see an increasing attachment with the GPS LNA suite of highly customized devices, higher margin, very high performance. You're starting to see antenna switch modules now become part of our story. So those are some of the themes here, as well as power management by the way, not only camera flash but also RF power when we move into voltage regulators and soon, DC to DC converters. So there's really a real upswing here in new products that we're bringing to market that complement our existing high share position in front-end solutions.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Tavis McCourt representing Raymond James.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk about kind of the flexibility in the operating plan if, for some reason, economic conditions or something else happens that makes that 15% TAM growth increasingly unlikely next year, how quickly can you kind of scale up or how much do you have to forward invest on the operating cost in a situation like that?","Donald W. Palette","Yes, the first we'll -- I think the first and most importantly talk about the hybrid manufacturing model, I mean, we -- I think we're extremely well positioned to handle any revenue volatility, whether it's upside or downside, with the combination of internal sourcing and external sourcing, so from a margin standpoint, we think that positions us for best-in-class margins regardless of what happens to the top line. So that's very positive. And from an operating expense standpoint, I mean, we have some flexibility. There's variable costs on the line. But at $80 million, we think we are sized appropriately. And we wouldn't expect to change that dramatically. But I do think from the margin standpoint, we will produce the best results, given any revenue condition.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then a follow-up on the balance sheet. How much of that cash is in the U.S. and unencumbered? And as we get close to the cash levels you were before the acquisitions just a couple quarters, how should we think about cash...","Donald W. Palette","The lion's share, that's in the U.S. It's probably 80% -- at 85%. And the amounts that aren't onshore can be invested in some investments we're making in some of the new business structures, so it can be utilized very effectively.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And in terms of cash usage, as we watch the cash grow now back to pre-acquisition levels?","Donald W. Palette","It's the same for us at all times. We're interested in using the cash as a competitive weapon and to generate shareholder value. So we're going to continue to look at the right M&A opportunities, where we can grow and accrete not only EPS but operating margin. We'd look at share buybacks at times. And so anything that we believe is going to add shareholder value would be a possibility for the company.","Operator","And we'll go to the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I wanted to drill into the OpEx, just wanted to understand why it is that you're guiding to such a significant quarter-over-quarter increase in OpEx?","Donald W. Palette","It's really when you look at where we ended up, Ittai, for Q4, the $77 million, we're guiding up to $80 million, and it's really there's some targeted headcount adds that we're doing both from an R&D and field application support standpoint. And we've got some variable R&D expenses that are tied to key programs. All these investments if -- we're very confident shareholders are going to be pleased because we see some significant return opportunities down the road for these investments.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Can you be then a little bit more maybe forward-looking in commenting on how should we think about OpEx growing from that December quarter level moving forward? I mean, is this a one-time kind of jump up and then it lands up somewhat?","Donald W. Palette","I wouldn't be expecting it to go from 80 back down the 77. That isn't that -- I don't think that's what you should...","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","No, can it stay flat? Or I mean, I'm just trying to -- it really seems unusual and I look at your increase last year also, and last year your OpEx was flat moving from September to December. So there wasn't anything seasonal to it. I'm just trying to understand again how do I get my hands around this?","Donald W. Palette","Well, yes. Exactly, exactly. My comments weren't seasonal at all. Hopefully that didn't confuse you about what I said. I was talking about program investments, they weren't seasonal at all. But yes, you can expect the 80 to be flat certainly into -- through the March quarter. We have pay raises midyear that start June 1 so that there's a -- there can be a slight increase with that. So there will be some increases beyond that. But they are really immaterial in the scope of things when you look at the amount we are investing.","David J. Aldrich","I think this is, Ittai, that these were variable expenses more than anything else. So we have a high masked charge, for example, this quarter, as we are ramping and transferring a lot of designs into production. So it's pretty simple. It's as simple as that.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. But this still leaves you comfortable that, with this increase, you can reach that 30% operating margin target at that specific revenue level?","Donald W. Palette","Absolutely. Because again, we're going get there as a two-pronged approach, as we always do. So our goal is both margin expansion and leveraging at 550, whether the OpEx is $81 million, $81.5 million a quarter. That's well within the range of what we can do to deliver the 30%. So yes, we are totally confident in that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Don, I just wanted to follow up with the mix of your business between RF and analog. I thought you said the mix was 60 40. Last quarter was 65 35. I know it's not perfect math but obviously, there's some rounding in there, but it would suggest the RF business really didn't grow quarter to quarter, if you get the math to work. I'm just wondering if you could give any clarity as to if that's the right math? And then conversely, what's driving the growth in analog?","Donald W. Palette","Well, Blayne, just to clarify, we're 40% high performance analog this quarter and 60% handset. And last quarter, 65% handset and 40% -- or 35% high performance analog. Correct? I just want to make sure your comments were tied...","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. Then the mix of handsets just declined but yet your revenue went up. So I'm just trying to understand the moving pieces. It would suggest the handset portion hasn't grown that much but yet the analog portion is.","Liam K. Griffin","Yes, we have seen some improvement growth on the high performance analog piece. Again, you have to take into account that we have some acquisitions that have come in, that we've been able to lever up with share gains. We've been able to take, for example, a high performing WiLAN portfolio and drive it into numerous customers. Not only handsets but also routers, we're enjoying an 11ac ramp, the GPS technology is launching and looking very strong for us. And then if you look at some of our antenna switch products and advanced antenna tuning products, we are starting to see some momentum there. So we've had benefits as well on the high performance analog side. That have -- that propelled the growth here in the last quarter.","Donald W. Palette","If you look at the Teardown and think of it this way, if you look at the Teardown reports and these numbers, 35% to 40%, we're kind of rounding a little bit, it's a little bit less than 5% sequentially, but be that -- but having said that, if you look at the Teardown reports and then listen to our commentary, we're seeing a lot of smartphone growth, for example in GPS LNA power management devices, camera flash drivers, antenna switch modules and Wi-Fi devices versus a traditional PA. So when you look at those products as being non PA-based or high performance analog, that explains parts of it. So think of it in those terms. Where we got your PA business, it'd be up slightly and bolt-on products that are up more dramatically because those are new growth drivers for the company.","Operator","And we'll go to the line of Anthony Stoss with Craig-Hallum.","Anthony J. Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","As your volume increases, anything you can do on the materials cost side to try and get better pricing from your suppliers? Also, as you're launching new GPS technology and Wi-Fi in the AC side, is that accretive to gross margins? I'd love to hear kind of your view on those 2 pieces and SkyOne ramp and [indiscernible].","Donald W. Palette","Anthony, as far as how we manage our supply base and we absolutely -- I think we're do an excellent job, we have very specific targets year-over-year as far as driving material content out and volume certainly helps with those discussions. But that's something we talk about and execute on every day. So that's clearly part of our ability to expand margins on a go forward basis and has been part of it for the last 3 to 5 years.","David J. Aldrich","I think as you look forward to 2013, the products that you are seeing in the most recent Teardown reports and that we have been highlighting on this call are on balance and, on average, accretive to our company gross margin. That includes SkyHi, it includes SkyOne, it includes Wi-Fi and GPS. Those products are all accretive to our averages. They're relatively new to us and they're ramping now. So as we look at the mix of products moving away from to 2G, more commoditized segments and towards more highly integrated products at which SkyOne is probably the most dramatic example, those products are indeed accretive. And you'll see those playing out through 2013 in improving margins.","Operator","And we'll go to the line of Edward Snyder with Charter Equity.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","Thanks. A couple questions here. It's clear that your analog products are starting to grow here and I guess that's where some of your balance shift towards HPA has been on the quarter. How much of that are your acquiring to hit your target market? Sounds like it's going to be a big growth area for 2013 especially since these new acquisitions, you're leveraging the share gains. So is that a big component, Don, of the target market? And then I know SkyHi was introduced last year, I think it's sampling, now, when is it likely -- are we likely to see that in a Teardown of a production phone? Is it -- are you targeting first half of next year, late next year? Any idea at all?","Donald W. Palette","So Ed, just to clarify your first question, you meant for the target model? You said, market. You mean, model, right?","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","Yes, exactly.","Donald W. Palette","And in order to achieve that 30% we are not assuming a big shift in the HPA handset percentage at this point in time. So if that 60 40 goes more towards high performance analog, that's a positive. That actually accelerates margin accretion. But we are not expecting a big movement from that in the model estimate.","David J. Aldrich","And I'm not sure I understand you, did you mean SkyOne? When did we see SkyOne, you said SkyHi.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research",".","Yes, I meant, SkyOne.","David J. Aldrich","Okay, just because SkyHi is in production now. SkyOne, we have sampled to multiple customers. We have a lead customer who's putting it through its paces now with an expectation that very early in 2013, you'll be able to buy by a phone with SkyOne incorporated. And just to remind the listeners, SkyOne is a complete multimode PA addressing both 3G and LTE bands. It has all the duplex filtering, all the switching logic and control to extend from the output of the transceiver chipset, right to the antenna and back. It is the most highly integrated product in the market, in the world. In fact, in RF front end and it's accretive to our margins.","Operator","And we'll go to the lines of the Vivek Arya from Bank of America, Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm curious, if your analog products are growing faster than some of the handset parts, why are gross margins under some pressure? Is it because of more outsourced parts or is it just that some of these new analog parts are going into a handset also? And if also, the same time, if you could comment on Q1 gross margin outlook, I think the fall through appears to be about 39% or so, which is below your 50% target. So if you could just address the Q4 and Q1 gross margins there, the moving pieces in that.","David J. Aldrich","This is Dave, I'll take the first part of that. First, the smartphone and these higher level mobile devices incorporate both our FVS [ph] products as well as the suite of HPA products. So again, the GPS LNAs, the mobile connectivities, the high throw count switches, the power management devices, LED products, they're high performance analog. So it is a mix.","Donald W. Palette","Yes and as far as the question on the margin, yes, you're right. We've historically -- as we've been generating margin expansion, we've been dropping through in the high 40s. And just to remind everybody when we had our Analyst day, we talked about that going into 2013, when we had recommended modeling 45% to 46% kind of drop going -- and it's really -- in the guidance that we just gave on the 450, the 43% off of what we produced in the fourth quarter is a little over 44% drop. So it's pretty consistent with what we said. And the reason for that is, that we talked about, it's a higher mix of outsourced material with volumes ramping. We've made some CapEx investments, it takes 2 or 3 quarters, we're working through the payback on that. So some of that benefit isn't yet in the numbers. Some of the higher margin segments as we talked about on Analyst day, like infrastructure, still a little sluggish. And we had a little higher in Q4 and Q1, a little higher 2G mix which is, again, has had the most ASP compression, a little bit lower margin. So those are really the reasons. But again for modeling purposes, we would recommend using 45% to 46% going through the balance of the year, as far as contribution.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Alex Gauna from JMP Securities.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","I know you don't guide 2 quarters out, but I was wondering if you could give us an idea of what you would consider normal seasonality in this environment? And based on your visibility, if you think you can better than normal seasonality in the March quarter and maybe some of the puts and takes on that.","David J. Aldrich","Yes, thank you. It's a little too early to tell what margin is going to shape up to be. It depends somewhat on holiday season sell-through. I think it's -- given our design status and recent wins, we do expect to outperform whatever the market may be. But honestly, I think we need to see a little bit more the December quarter as we move through October into November, December.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Fair enough. And I was wondering, you mentioned some of the opportunities, I think your content doubling in some of your China opportunities. Can you talk about what percentage contribution you think as an end market China is for you today and maybe some insights into your optimism around that?","David J. Aldrich","Well, the end -- the 2G end market China business is mid-single digits as a percentage of revenue. And that's really defined as kind of the indigenous local providers and the products we sell through the likes of MediaTek and others. That's about 5% or 6% of our revenue. And we step forward into 2013, that business kind of hit a trough of unit volume, where the decline in 2G was more than offsetting the uptake in 3G, TD and smartphones in general. We see the crossover point occurring about now certainly into early 2013, where the TAM will begin to expand again as the most heavily commoditized segment of the whole wireless business today is open market 2G China. I think that business gets smaller and smaller and will finally begin to see real increase in smartphone adoption rate in China. So we think China is a great story in 2013 and '14. It hasn't been a great story in the late 2011 and 2012.","Liam K. Griffin","Right. And Alex, this is Liam. As a follow up to that, I think, you're going to see China being a gross margin mover for us, whereas the 2G business today is the lion's share, you're going to see more customized infrastructure solutions to lever to ZTE and Huawei. We're actually starting to deliver some of the Wi-Fi technology that we mentioned to companies like HTC and also Huawei. So I think you're going to see a mixed benefit as well as revenue move in 2013.","David J. Aldrich","Yes, one other thing. It's probably an early indicator is when we're competing now for design win sockets on reference designs, for example, for 3G and so on in that market. We're competing with highly specialized, customized designs for that chipset. In 2G, we're competing with several competitors, many of whom really had no choice but to compete on the basis of price. We do not see that model replicating in the 3G smartphone space. So not only will there be increased content, the products will be far more complex. There'll be more bolt-on capability because there'll be higher Wi-Fi attach rate, there'll be GPS, there'll be other products, there'll be more complex power management needs. We can address those. So it's really -- it's a double whammy. We get the growth in unit volume with higher dollar content driven by complexity and we get to bolt-on a lot of new HPA products as a result of the very nature of those products being more smart than 2G voice only.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Dale Pfau from Cantor Fitzgerald.","Dale Pfau - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Dave, may we talk a little bit about connectivity? I know in that's in HPA, are you seeing that grow faster than your overall sort of 15%, 14%-15% year-over-year growth? And can you talk about -- a little bit about how you are seeing that not only in the December quarter but could we see an acceleration of that in the first calendar quarter?","Liam K. Griffin","This is Liam. That is certainly one of the fastest-growing portfolios for us, the whole 802.11 suite. We have 11ac now as the leading driver for growth, but we also have sustainable gains even in 11n. So one of the themes here is just really the attachment into smartphones and tablets, which is relatively new. We see an increased content and margin pop as we move to 11ac, and we are also seeing some of these advanced routers, we referenced a few in our business highlights with NetGear, where the addressable device content for us is 15 to 20 units with MIMO technology, multiple in\/multiple out data streams. So that is really an important driver for us. We see that really in it's early innings now. We think 2013 is going to be a big move but we're also going to see more devices be attached 2014, 2015. So we think it's sustainable. We're in the right place right now. Our share position is outstanding but there's many, many accounts that haven't yet turned on the 11ac pump here so there's lots more ahead.","Operator","We go to the line of Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just a housekeeping question first. When you look at your antenna tuning and antenna switch products, you guys put that in analog, right? So when people look at analog growing it's probably some of these products going to handset that are growing also, right?","David J. Aldrich","That's correct. I think it may be useful to think of FVS [ph] as front-end solution, which would be power amplifiers, power amplifier duplexers, multimode PAs and the balance of the products that bolt around those on the analog side, being high performance analog.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got it. Now when you look at the December quarter, when you look at the handset overall versus, let's say, core analog only, obviously, analog markets now seem to be [ph] weaker into December. Have you seen -- when you look at that December, again, are you seeing [ph] weakness on analog offset by a little bit stronger -- the handset side growing better? Is that how you look at it?","David J. Aldrich","Yes, but let me clarify. Yes, the short answer is yes. We're seeing smartphones, very strong. We are seeing tablets, very strong. We are seeing mobile connectivity, Wi-Fi, very strong. 11ac routers initial ramp plus a lot of home connectivity devices, Wi-Fi devices, attach rates into tablets and the like. So we're seeing those markets very, very strong. We are seeing kind of the broad catalog of analog products not being so great, flattish. Infrastructure remains stubbornly flat. I think that finally starts to see some growth, or our customers are finally beginning to show growth in infrastructure and smart energy, would be, I guess, the third that's showing just flatline here in December. And it is important for us to see that infrastructure -- we are seeing signs of growth in infrastructure, that there clearly isn't enough capacity. Our customers in that space have held off as much as they can, but those products are very accretive to our gross margin. So we really want to see 2G decline, smartphones increase and then a return to growth in the core analog business. We expect to see that in '13, but we don't expect to see it in December.","Operator","Then with the line of Quinn Bolton representing and Needham and Company.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Dave, just wanted to follow up on that question about the China business you'd referenced in your script, multiple baseband references and targeting the emerging markets, 3G handsets. Can you expand a little bit about that position? And a sort of follow on question, I think you said that 2G was still the dominant mix of your China business. Yes, when do you think you'll see that 3G crossing over the 2G? Is that first half of next year? Is that later in 2013?","David J. Aldrich","I think we see it this year, in the first half of 2013. We're finally starting to see a balancing in that portfolio where the decline in 2G is no longer resulting in a net decline in that business. And we when talk about baseband partnership, it's clearly MediaTek, but we're also lined out very nicely with the chipset providers into Huawei and ZTE and the other foreign OEMs. So we look at Qualcomm, MediaTek and others as being our reference design partners.","Liam K. Griffin","And let me add to that. One of the unique benefits that we bring to the China accounts as they ramp up into 3G and LTE is our architectural experience, our systems knowledge, our application support. It's really critical now as these customers and the OEMs move up in complexity. These are not easy products. I think the Skyworks team is doing a great job of really not only providing product but the architectures and the systems know-how to turn these customers on.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Can I, just a quick follow on that. Do you include the Huawei and ZTE sort of branded OEM accounts in China in that bucket that you discussed? Or would you exclude those branded OEMs and really just looking at the white box?","Liam K. Griffin","No, we include them, but one point to make, is that the revenue -- the 2G revenue has largely been smaller OEMs. There's Huawei and ZTE but it hasn't been -- the 3G opportunity is going to be much more Huawei and ZTE than it will be some of the smaller white box players.","David J. Aldrich","I think those folks didn't play very big in 2G. They really kind of cut their teeth in data cards and they were 3G enabled or EDGE enabled. And so we do include them and we have a very high growth expectations for them. We did not have a high growth in the 2G space for those customers. They really were indigenous, smaller companies supported by local reference designs.","Operator","And will go to line of James Faucette representing Pacific Crest.","James E. Faucette - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions for me. Wanted to once again touch on China and the opportunity for dollar content growth there. As you look at that opportunity, how much do you assign to the ability to capture dollar content from others with your newer products and more complete products, versus how much are you looking at as being an actual step up in the overall RF content within those new phones?","David J. Aldrich","Yes, let me take a stab at that first. One, we do expect to have disproportionately more share as this market converts to 3G and to smartphones because it's where technology differentiates, where the challenges are the greatest. So as there are more brands, as there are more needs for filtering and switching and control, we'll gain more traditional front-end content in that segment than in the 2G where we have a strong product portfolio but frankly the margins are dilutive and there's quite a bit of competition. We do not see that in this space. So that's one element of it. The second area is that we will grow dollar content and grow share in that sort of traditional front-end solution within that market. But we will also see a higher attach rate with GPS, with Wi-Fi and more complex power management needs as an example. More complex switching and ASM requirement simply by virtue of the number of bands and what those phones are going to be required to do. So we'll have a lot more HPA content bolted around that front end, in 3G, where we have, frankly, very little in 2G. There wasn't much we could do in 2G beyond the front end.","Operator","And we'll go to the line of Cody Acree with Williams Financial.","Cody G. Acree - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","If we think about Samsung for a second, I know Samsung usually does kind of an end of year inventory clean up and then there's a myriad of things that you're designed into, do you expect Samsung to grow for you in the December quarter?","Liam K. Griffin","Actually, that's a good -- that's a good question. And right now, our view for Samsung is it's probably flat into the December quarter right now.","Cody G. Acree - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","And I guess could you give me a little bit of color on to how -- is it inventory? Is it specific programs? I guess why the flatness, given Samsung's growth?","David J. Aldrich","I think -- I would at it this way, Cody. It's a great question. We see an OEM shipped in the December quarter where you have a couple of products that are selling so well that other customers will tend to see -- other OEM customers will tend to see less strength in the December quarter. So you do see an offset. And we see that with Samsung and others. However, when I get into the March quarter, there are some new products that have been announced to be released and our content there is very high. And we have really high expectations for those products. So we're very excited about Samsung moving into 2013. But I think you have to realistically expect that when you have a big ramp going on in the December quarter that other OEM customers won't do as well.","Operator","And will go to the line of Ian Ing with Lazard Capital markets.","Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Sounds like you're still pretty committed to the 2, 2.5G China open market while 3G grows. So perhaps you can explain if there's scenarios where that gets more benign? I know you got CMOS PAs, there were a lot of startup CMOS PAs in that market, vendors. Or perhaps as a larger vendor, you're better able to fill some [indiscernible] patterns.","David J. Aldrich","I'm sorry, is the question related to supply? Or just how we're playing that market in terms of...","Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Just how you -- you sound committed to that market still so how are you going to play that market and...","David J. Aldrich","Okay. Well, the 2G market is in steep decline in China. Our position there has remained 40%-ish, we think. Hard to -- I say we think because it's hard to calculate. There is a big sort of gray market, if you will. It's hard to really quantify but we sell a lot of product. And so, near as we can tell, we're about 40% share, maybe it's slightly, may be a couple points less than that. We're committed to the extent that we have products, we have a very low cost structure. We have a tiered structure of products, everything from low-cost, relatively low performance CMOS designs to low-cost higher performance GaAs-based designs as well as front-end solutions that are very high performance, and the price changes accordingly. So we are committed to it. It is, however, dilutive. It is where ASP decline has been the most intense because it is by far the most commoditized section of our business. So I'm not disappointed to see that it is getting smaller. And while we are committed to it, we're also delighted that there'll be an upgrade cycle because we're going to make a whole lot more money in China in the 2013 and 2014 than we did in '11 and '12.","Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And for a follow-up, I know it's early to talk about the impact of Hurricane Sandy but any impacts on internal and outsourced manufacturing? I think for RF, people source pHEMT and silicon and insulator wafers from Massachusetts and New York, any impacts on delivery of materials and cost of that delivery?","Donald W. Palette","No. No, not at all.","Operator","And we'll go to the line of Edward Snyder with Charter Equity.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","Yes, this is a quick follow. Dave, it sounds like -- I mean, you've done so well in the handset side of the business, it's your own show, you're kind of preeminent position in both iPhone and in Samsung, you've done well. And then I know that you got a good position in a lot of other OEMs even if they're shipping. Doesn't this speak to 2013 that more of your growth is going to have to come from the linear side of the business? And I don't necessarily mean organically. You have not been afraid of acquisitions in the past. Your cash probably will start to move up again. I know, having talked to everybody in the space, on the CEO [ph] side that everybody would like to do tuck-in acquisitions on the linear side. Can it reasonably expected that we could see Skyworks' mix, whether through growth, organically or acquisitions, to start moving more towards the linear side and mimic something more like an HPA company, TI or something like that?","David J. Aldrich","I think, Ed, we are committed to continuing to diversify, but that, by no means, implies -- I don't think you implied this, that we are backing away or shying away from the mobile sector. In fact, to the contrary, what we really expect -- I expect our mobile business to grow very strong in 2013. And there'll be components of traditional products there, like front-end modules, we had a long discussion about China, we think we'll get more PA and front-end module dollar content. It will be equally as strong as we bolt more technology that we work very hard to address, that becomes this bundling in system level sell is becoming increasingly important because these products are quite problematic for most of our customers. So we can solve those problems for them and get paid for it. So yes, it will be -- it will be RF ES business, it will also be more analog and, as Don mentioned earlier, we're always looking for opportunities to expand into new verticals and add to our technology and our market footprint. We'll do more of that in '13.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","So if we just take, say, the non-wireless business off the table for a minute, just look at the core GaAs, AM [ph], filter, switch-type business, is it fair to assume that more of your growth is going to come -- not come from that? You got great share everywhere but to increase content it almost seems like you'd have to branch off into power control and a number of the things that you got through ATI and like SiGe, for example, SiGe, the entire group is in your HPA side of the business today, correct?","David J. Aldrich","Yes, well, yes. The TAM growth in the front-end will be double digits, we believe in 2013. So the core front-end business driven by the conversion of 2G to smartphone, the increase in content with LTE, the increased switching content, we expect that to go up maybe double the unit volume increase. So if volumes are up 7%, you would expect a 14% to 15%. We probably are adding more TAM, a bigger target to high performance analog products. So over time, I think you will see the business balance more between diversified analog and our traditional FVS [ph].","Liam K. Griffin","Yes, Ed, this is Liam. I think if you look at the  individual market opportunities between Wi-Fi, I mean, power management, which is a $5 billion market, GPS, ASM and some of the other organic products that we're developing, mixers, VCL synthesizers, INQ mods, that are traditionally non-cellular go into infrastructure. Those markets, in aggregate, present a very significant TAM for the HPA team. And we've gained a lot of share this year but there's a tremendous amount of room for us to grow in 2013 and 2014. We've seen great momentum in a few of these categories but infrastructure and some of these other markets, we're well-positioned. We get a little tailwind there and you're going to see some upside.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's question-and-answer session.

This call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Steve Ferranti, Vice President of Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Ferranti, please go ahead.","Stephen Ferranti - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Kathy. Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' second fiscal quarter 2016 conference call. Joining me today are Dave Aldrich, Don Palette, and Liam Griffin. Dave will begin today's call with a business overview, followed by Don's financial review and outlook. We will then open the lines for your questions.","Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those noted in our earnings release and those detailed from time to time in our SEC filings.","I would also like to remind everyone that the resulting guidance we will discuss today are from our non-GAAP income statement, consistent with the format we have used in the past. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave for his comments on the quarter.","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Steve, and welcome everyone. Well we delivered another solid financial performance for the second fiscal quarter of 2016, posting year over year growth in revenue, profitability and earnings, even as we navigated through a combination of inventory adjustments and forecast reductions at one of our major customers.","During the quarter we delivered revenue of $775 million. That's in line with our guidance. We posted gross margin of 50.8%. That's up 410 basis points year over year. We generated operating income of $285 million. That's up 10% year over year. We produced operating margin of 36.8%, and we provided $1.25 in earnings per share. That's up 9% versus the prior year. For the first half of fiscal 2016, we generated roughly $383 million in free cash flow, redistributing over 60% or $234 million to shareholders through our dividend plan and our share repurchase activity.","Q2 was a solid quarter, highlighting the strong execution of our team and the robustness of our financial model. Our gross margin initiatives and operating expense discipline enabled us to both expand margins and earnings in a seasonally down quarter. The market environment remains challenging entering the third fiscal quarter. The June quarter is normally a transitional period in our sector, bridging the March quarter seasonal trough with a stronger second half of the calendar year. This year, inventory drawdowns and slower sell-through trends at our top customer are providing a drag on overall demand levels, impacting our Q3 guidance despite our strong growth in broader markets and with other OEMs.","As we navigate through these customer-specific dynamics, our competitive position and our financial model remain quite strong. We continue to improve our gross margins and our overall financial returns, while investing aggressively in innovation and in capacity. It's also worth emphasizing a couple of important points. First, among our top customers, we see complexity and increasing performance requirements driving content expansion across the board. As an example, our overall content on Samsung's flagship Galaxy S7 platform is up 20% versus prior models. We've also secured more than $9 of content within Huawei's new flagship smartphone platforms, helping to drive over 40% year over year growth with this customer.","Secondly, we continue to be highly successful in leading the market transition toward integrated solutions, and we're consolidating share while extending our technology leadership. And third, we continue to see significant traction with the Internet of Things, as evidenced by our 18% year over year growth in our broad markets products segment. These factors give us high confidence in our longer term growth prospects, and before providing more specifics on the market environment, I'll turn the call over to Don for a more in-depth review of our financial results.","Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Dave, and thanks for joining us everyone. We appreciate it. Revenue for the second quarter was $775.1 million, and that's in line with our guidance, and up 1.7% versus the year-ago quarter. Gross profit was $393.6 million, or 50.8% of revenue, in line with our guidance, and up 410 basis points from the second quarter of fiscal 2015.","Operating expenses were $108.6 million consisting of R&D expense of $73.1 million and SG&A expense of $35.5 million. We generated $285 million of operating income, up 10% from the year ago quarter, and that translates into a 36.8% operating margin. Our cash tax rate was 14.3%, resulting in net income of $242.3 million, or $1.25 of diluted earnings per share, and that's $0.01 ahead of our guidance and represents around a 9% year over year earnings growth.","Turning to our second quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement. We invested $37 million in capital expenditures with depreciation of $53.6 million. We generated $154.5 million in cash flow from operations and we exited the quarter with roughly $1.2 billion in cash on hand and no debt. We also repurchased 2 million shares of our common stock during the quarter at an average price of just over $67.50 a share. Given our confidence in our long-term business trends, we expect to continue to be very active with our share repurchase activity at current levels.","Moving to product mix. For the second quarter of fiscal 2016, power amplifiers represented 17% of revenue, integrated mobile systems was 58%, and broad markets was 25%. We saw healthy growth in both integrated mobile systems and broad markets. We're quite pleased that our broad markets portfolio grew over 18% year over year in the second quarter. We continue to expect IMS to remain our strongest growth segment, followed by broad markets, while power amplifier products continue to decline as a percentage of our revenue as the market shifts towards higher value integrated solutions.","Now for our third quarter business outlook. We expect third quarter revenue to be approximately $750 million with softness at our largest customer being partially offset by strong year over year growth at Samsung, in China and across the broad markets. At this revenue level, we suggest modeling gross margin at 51% with operating expenses flat to Q2 at approximately $108.5 million. It is worth noting that our Q3 gross margin guidance implies a 200 basis point improvement versus the prior year. Our strong gross margin outlook in the face of current market conditions highlights the benefits of our higher value integrated systems, along with our scale and flexible manufacturing operations.","Looking ahead, we see opportunity for additional margin improvement, as we continue to ramp our custom solutions and leverage our recent capital investments. As a guideline, we recommend modeling a 60% incremental gross margin off of the third quarter baseline. We continue to target a goal of at least 53% gross margin for the company and have a number of initiatives in place to accelerate our progress towards achieving this goal.","And below the line we anticipate around $1 million in interest and other expenses and a cash tax rate between 14.5% to 15%. We project our tax rate to remain in this range for the remainder of our 2016 fiscal year and we expect share count to be around 192.5 million shares, which results in a third quarter EPS of $1.21.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave.","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Don. Well, I'm very pleased by the resilience of our financial model in spite of the well-publicized market challenges to our near term top line growth. And even more importantly, I'm highly confident that the underlying technology themes fueling our long-term growth remain quite positive. And we're fortunate to be levered to powerful secular technology trends and we've spent the last decade aligning the company to capitalize on these.","And with that in mind, I want to take just a moment to reiterate a couple of the more significant drivers that we see fueling our growth in the coming years. First is the Internet of Things. This opportunity is measured in the tens of billions of units, and projected to grow at an 83% CAGR through 2020. And our success here has been borne out by a broad and a growing list of wins in new markets like automotive, medical, industrial, wearables and the smart home. Today we participate in all of these verticals through our suite of connectivity solutions, which now includes support for low power, for wide area networking, for Wi-Fi, ZigBee, Bluetooth and GPS standards.","Our design win pipeline provides a number of tangible examples of our success in this market. In fact, in this quarter alone, we landed new opportunities which include a vehicle-to-vehicle communication systems with Cadillac's 2017 platform, GPS-based industrial tracking devices for Iotera, a new connected home hub for a leading online retailer, Cat-M solutions for machine-to-machine applications in a variety of end markets, connectivity modules in set-top boxes for ARRIS, temperature control systems for multiple smart home solutions, analog IC supporting new smartwatch platforms, and 16 Skyworks devices in Cisco's latest large enterprise access point systems.","The second major growth theme for us is the skyrocketing demand for data, wireless data, which is being fueled by a growing number of new applications like streaming media, like mobile advertising, virtual reality, and cloud-based services across consumer and enterprise applications. These services are all in their infancy, and they consume a tremendous amount of bandwidth, drastically increasing demands on networks and on devices. As sophisticated as today's devices are, they're simply not good enough to support the immense data requirements of these types of new applications, which will be rolling out over the next few years. To address this performance gap, OEMs today are implementing techniques like carrier aggregation, receive diversity, MIMO and ultimately 5G, which require dramatically higher levels of analog performance at the semiconductor level.","As a technology enabler to these system upgrades, our addressable content per device is rising, driving TAM growth well in excess of the broader semiconductor space. Both of these secular growth themes are playing out for us in real time. And we're capitalizing by combining a strategic focus on higher value added integrative solutions with unrivaled scale, advanced manufacturing capabilities, and a deep system level knowhow. This is the key reason that we are consistently delivering among the best financial returns in the semiconductor sector, in a variety of market conditions.","In closing, looking past the near-term volatility, we've created a unique and a robust business model, fueled by the proliferation of connectivity, and combining above market top-line growth, healthy cash flow, and the financial returns of a best-in-class diversified analog company.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open the line, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Given time constraints, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And our first question will come from Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Go ahead, please.","Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, thanks guys. My first question is, I guess basically, how do you see revenues trending through the quarter, through the June quarter? Maybe what the shape of that revenue curve is. Do we expect to see a V at any point during the quarter, or does that come in the July timeframe.?","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Rick. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, I think June is normally a seasonal and a transitional period for us. Now it's a little bit challenging this year for a couple of reasons, and it's with our largest customer, right. Unlike prior years, units will be down year over year really for the first time, and they're also absorbing some excess inventory, which adds a headwind. So I think as we absorb that issue outside of this, we expect all other areas of the business to be very strong. We think our revenue will be up over 10% when we exclude this customer. We're seeing strength at Samsung on G7, growth in China. Our broad markets business will be up 15% to 20% on a year over year basis. So we're obviously not immune, though, to significant reductions from this customer. But I think we'll fare better than most, and we'll continue to focus on return to the business.","Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, and then maybe a related question, Dave. If you look at how your internal capacity, today how does it line up with the current demand? And I guess, can you quantify? Or is there a discernible impact on gross margin today that we'll see a natural or a noticeable uptick in the second half as volumes improve?","Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah hi, Rick, this is Don. I mean one of the things if you looked at what the forecasts continued to change in this quarter. And one of the things you see that in is our inventory is up a little bit more than normally would be up for us. And that's you're seeing there where we discontinued the product. It was a lot easier to do that in the short term than to worry about taking labor out and making changes, so that all made sense for us. So as far as going forward, so our fabs and our Mexicali facility, we're pretty much at utilization, and we don't expect that to change a lot going forward. So the margin improvement you're seeing is just the normal improvements that we would build off of the product mix that we're shipping. So I wouldn't expect a big change because of that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great, thank you very much. Just on a big picture, if you look at the RF TAM market for 2016 and 2017, obviously with Apple going through its product transition and softer demand and the premier tier weak, that's impacting the growth for 2016. Do you still see this growth in this market as a mid teens CAGR and do you think it would reaccelerate in 2017? And do you think the industry could be below 10% growth this year? Thank you.","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Well I think, Mike, there's some positives and negatives going on in the current environment, right. On the positive side, answering the growth question, we continue to see our content go up with each and every new generation. This year is no different, no different. We're pulling more functionality into our integrated mobile systems, we're expanding our footprint with more functionality. And in fact, we're continuing to see fewer competitors, so we're able to consolidate share. Our IoT business, as we mentioned in the prepared comments, is up both sequentially and year over year and these are very positive tailwinds.","I think 2016 is a little bit of a unique year because I think you're going to see some high level smartphone softness given global macroeconomic choppiness, and of course as we discussed with our top customer, there's overall unit sales decline in the second half of the year, which gives some unfavorable comps. And of course, they're aggressively ramping down the legacy models, which creates an inventory burn. So I think 2016 we have to look at as a unique phenomenon, and I suspect as you go through the second half of 2016 it will be much more positive. We'll start to see strong sequential growth in 2017. I do absolutely see growth in the overall RF and analog TAM being double digits year over year.","Operator","Okay, was that all, Mr. Walkley?","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Yes, thank you.","Operator","All right, thank you. Then we'll go next to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Vivek Arya - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question and good job on the execution. I know there are headwinds that the industry is facing. So as my first question, Dave, how should we think about the back half and what the visibility looks like in terms of content growth and if there are any differences, if your flagship customers go with an Intel baseband versus a Qualcomm baseband?","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think we answered it. I think you're going to see this inventory headwind with our large customer, as well muted overall year over year growth. That's an issue we're going to deal with here in 2016. I would expect that in September you'll see double digit sequential growth, so I think that's going to be no different. We'll see a very strong back half of the year, moving into 2017 on the backs of more content, a larger target for our newer products, broad markets being up. Maybe, Liam, you could add.","Liam K. Griffin - President","Sure, Vivek. With respect to the baseband partitioning that you may have mentioned there, I mean certainly we do quite well with both Qualcomm as well as Intel. And let me give you some confidence that we fully expect in the second half of the year to be launching with our flagship models with incremental gains year over year, significant incremental gains, regardless of baseband, well diversified across both and also well diversified across our product reach.","Vivek Arya - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Very useful. And then as my follow-up, Dave, what are your latest thoughts on M&A? Because I understand you do have very good organic growth prospects, but the volatility around your largest customer is not going away any time soon, but you do have a very good balance sheet. You have a good record of operational consistency. You have good packeting assets. So how do you leverage those aspects to diversify? And as part of that, if you could also sort of roll in what were the learnings and feedback from the PMC bid that might inform you as you think about any potential M&A?","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Vivek, thanks for the question. We think of diversification in two ways. First of all, we have been consistently diversifying our business. We've used M&A each year since we formed the company to continue to look for more functionality, more relevance in the broad market sector, more content in both mobile and our broad markets business. And the most recent addition was filters, prior to that power management, Wi-Fi and the like. And so we view acquisitions as an important element of our growth where we are selective. We don't need to buy growth. What we need to do is continue to look for ways to differentiate ourselves in our target markets. So you should look for us to continue to add strategically acquisitions that make sense and they'll primarily be as you mentioned in diversification and driving diversification into new markets and more content in new markets.","Operator","Thank you. We now have a question from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Go ahead, please.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Don, I just wanted to make sure I understood. You built inventory in the March quarter these on sales levels, and then I guess you're down into June's. It sounded like you were going to keep utilizations the same. And so does that mean inventories go up? And then the second part is, can you just talk about your visibility? You said new products should have higher margins. Just as you look into the second half, that's the other put to gross margin. Are you seeing a drag on utilization? And then what is the new products? What's your visibility into the uplift there?","Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, keep in mind, and thanks for the question, because it sort of needed to fill in a piece there, that we do have the high remodel. Recognize that we outsource some wafer supply. We outsource some assembly and test, so we're able to modulate that. But as far as running our internal operations, we're going to keep that utilization relatively high, so that will in fact allow us to continue the margin story. And we're not going to be building inventory levels that really are far ahead of demand. We'll flush through what we've seen at the end of this quarter, and we would expect that to get to a more normalized rate as we move forward.","As far as the margin expansion in the back half of the year, it's been a consistent story. And you see it in our margin gains quarter over quarter, that as we release new products, we're seeing better margins on those products, that whether it be in emerging markets like China, or whether it be large OEMs. So there's nothing in that story that's going to continue to slow down. It's more about integration adding value, and customers are paying for it.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys.","Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd.","Hi. Thank you for taking my question. My first question is regarding the pricing environment. Clearly, your customers are experiencing pressure in their gross margins. Have you sensed any change in how you guys price product, and the amount of pressure that you're seeing from them?","Liam K. Griffin - President","Sure. Well, there's always going to be a dynamic there, where suppliers and customers negotiate. But I'll tell you what's happening. As Don alluded to, gross margin invariably, our technologies have become more and more unique as we wrestle with customer complexity. So the engines that we provide, the solutions that we provide, tend to be very, very elegant, integrate lots of technology, are a perfect fit for a specific baseband, a specific application, and they're very different than what our suppliers do. So it's really about differentiation and delivering performance, number one. And from there, we can command better pricing and margins.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd.","Okay. Thank you. And as my follow-up, just a question on your long-term gross margin target of 53%. You mentioned how you have a number of initiatives in place. Maybe if you can elaborate on what the initiatives are, what the timeline is going forward, that would be helpful. Thank you.","Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, if you step back, and you look at the things that we do on a quarterly and annual basis, first from an operations standpoint, it's about the CapEx investments we make and the productivity improvements and driving the operational improvements, the things like yield. It's focusing on our material sourcing, and being able to deliver year over year annual reductions that support that. That's a piece of it. That's kind of the blocking and tackling on margin improvement. Then where you get the step function for us is when you talk about the new products, the releases and the integration, and maybe Liam could talk a little about the things we're doing as we move forward. But those two pieces together are really what drives margin for Skyworks.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Craig Ellis, with B. Riley. Go ahead, please.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to go back to the comments that you made, Dave, regarding some of the new product activities. SkyBlue seemed to be quite successful in the first half with one of your big customers in terms of contributing to significant content. As we look at the back half, do you expect SkyBlue to broaden out across your broader customer base? Can you talk a little bit about some of the other developments that might be occurring within the product portfolio that would add further to content, as we look at the second half of 2017?","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, and I'm glad you brought up that particular platform. The customer is Huawei in their flagship model. And we have over $9 in content, and I'm particularly pleased by the fact it's low, mid, and high band PAD. There's power management. There's Wi-Fi. There's pretty sophisticated switching architectures. We're using an architecture that's allowing us to control power management levels and voltage across all bands. We're starting to see the ability to take a very sophisticated module and integrate using different approaches, much lower current-consuming functions. And we're incorporating things like temperature-compensated SAW, regular SAW, bulk acoustic devices.","And it's an architecture that our customers see simply as being elegantly easy for them to use in the sense that it's very highly integrated. It tunes up at the antenna and saves them point of current and size. And we absolutely will see that in other customers, architectural approaches that will be customized for different markets that you'll see continue to contribute to our gross margin, but a bit of a more of a winner take all capability, because it's so easy for our customers to use and far fewer competitors.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thanks for that. And the follow up is for Don. Don, as we look at the other part of the target financial model below gross margin at the $8 in annualized earnings, can you just walk us through your thinking in terms of the timeframe with which you think we could get to that earnings level?","Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I mean, when you step back and you look at the core elements of the financial model, that's gross margin expansion, that's top line growth, that's managing OpEx, they continue to strengthen. And you see that, for instance, on the margin line what we just guided at 51%, so we're up sequentially in margin even though we are down some in revenue. So the assumptions underlying the new target model are very, very solid. The gross margin, our ability to manage OpEx, we know how to do all those things.","As far as handicapping when it happens, right now we're in a little bit of a tough backdrop that we're working through. So as you model growth opportunities off of let's say the September quarter, or December, pick a quarter, you apply whatever annual growth rate you want to that. The 60% drop through, you'll see that the model is still in place, and that'll get you there in a reasonable timeframe. But you have to model that and make your own assumptions to get to that timeframe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citi. Go ahead, please.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. A question carrier aggregation. David, you guys have talked about ramping a BAW filter next year. If you can kind of share the update on what are the latest plans on how you kind of plan to ramp that? Are you looking to licensing technology or do you have it in house? And then I have a follow up.","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thank you, Atif. I'm glad you asked that question, because I'm going to take maybe a two prong approach to it. First, the details are that when we look at the carrier aggregation requirements with the advanced switching, with the tuning, with the module capabilities that you require, different band aggregation and combinations that are quite challenging to our customers, there's a lot of content expansion. And so what we've been doing is we're leveraging a lot of in house filter expertise. You asked specifically about filters and intellectual property. We've been making investments in foundry partnerships to support bulk acoustic technologies. Of course, we have our own increasingly relevant at mid\/high frequency temperature-compensated SAW, so you'll continue to see wins at the higher frequencies.","And the SkyBlue system architecture allows for more content, because we're able to control all the system parameters in a way that they get the current consumption and they're able to do it. And we're tuning it in a quite sophisticated way between the amplifiers, the switchers, the filters, and obviously the antenna on the transmit side. But if you take a step back, our customers truly don't care what the process technology is in those filters. What they want is current. They need size. They need time to market. Obviously they need overall performance. And so I think over time, the question of what filter technology is chosen, which band will be less relevant and what will be relevant will being able to have a system architecture that provides the kind of current that they need to add the functionality that their customers demand.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Very helpful. Thanks. And then a follow up, when I look at the tier down, the product tier down, the Galaxy 7 versus Galaxy 6, I see RF sockets getting swapped among suppliers. And then I look at iPhone SE, it seems like there's a lot of reuse going on of iPhone 6s components. And so the question is, has anything changed with respect to the sockets being more kind of specific to each phone? And its impact on maybe pricing going forward.","Liam K. Griffin - President","Sure, yeah, well every customer has a different way to go to market, and Samsung has been traditionally a high SKU company where they have potentially regional SKUs where you may open up a regional SKU, we have low content, global SKU we have very high content on Galaxy. And at Samsung where they may have eight or nine SKUs, our blended content is up about 20% to 25% generation to generation. Our revenues at Samsung will be up about 20%. Our largest customer, similar story. There can be some partition changes, but here again, our ability to engage early. We are agnostic with baseband.","By the way, let me just clear that up. There's no issue with us relative to Qualcomm, whether relative to Intel or internal basebands at Huawei, Hisilicon, Samsung, LSI. We're with all of those players. And we have the ability to work with our customer to make sure we have the right solution. And fortunately, as Dave was outlining, customers really want complexity solved. And we do it in unique ways, and we're continuing to gain share on the leading flagship models across all the major accounts and we'll continue to do that this year and next.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research. Please go ahead.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","Thanks a lot. Dave, there are a lot of reports of strength in China, especially in the low and mid tier. MediaTek was talking it up on Monday. Qualcomm was even bragging about it last week. Can you kind of characterize how that affected you? I know you were very big in phase two at MediaTek, but it sounds like things are moving more to the five mode and I know there's a little bit of a share giveback there. So, I'm interested in how much of an offset China was, specifically in the white box area, where you're dealing with these reference designs.","And then, Don, you're sitting on a record high inventory while your largest customer is winding down the flagship model. With the big declines in the demand that that model is going to go through here, what gives you confidence you can work through that inventory? The parts I would assume are not interchangeable with the new model coming up in the fall. So I'm a little confused here because you're talking about running the fabs near \u2013 and your pad facility at relatively high utilization rates, but then also burning off inventory. So, I'm just trying to figure out what I'm missing here. Thanks.","Liam K. Griffin - President","Sure, Ed, this is Liam. I'll start with the China piece. So China, actually the story has been getting better for us with China, kind of consistent with your remarks. The open market or the white box China, which not only serves the domestic market, but also is a catalyst for serving emerging markets thoughts. So China, for example, in Q2 we were up about 14% sequentially. We think year over year when we finish FY 2016, China will be up about 20% to 25%. So we have great traction with OPPO, Vivo, Xiaomi and a number of other white box players.","But really today what we're seeing is nice, nice content gains and real material revenue gains from Huawei. Talked about it earlier, but that's a customer that's adopted high, mid, low band solutions, receive-side solutions, Wi-Fi as well as some of our power solutions. So we're really pleased with that. That's a customer that's a clear number three now for Skyworks. We expect solid growth there next year, and also continuing to do the work with MediaTek and others to ensure we pick up the white box players.","Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, and on the inventory question, remember we said we're going to keep our internal facilities relatively high utilization, but we're pulling back capacity from outsourcing. So that's a big piece of that equation. And all of the inventory that we've completed to date, we're very comfortable is going to get consumed. There's going to be no issue there.","Operator","Okay, thank you then. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Aldrich for any closing remarks. Thank you.","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, thank you everyone for listening and we'll see you at upcoming conferences.","Operator","Okay, thank you ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"19666":["Skyworks Solutions, Inc.

This call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Mitch Haws, Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Haws, please go ahead.","Mitch Haws","Thank you, Laurie. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Skyworks' first fiscal quarter 2019 conference call. With me today are Liam Griffin, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kris Sennesael, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our discussion will include statements relating to future results and expectations that are or may be considered forward-looking. Please refer to our earnings press release and recent SEC filings, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for more information on certain risks that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially and adversely from any forward-looking statements made today.","Additionally, the results and guidance that we will discuss include non-GAAP financial measures consistent with our past practice. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Liam.","Liam Griffin","Thanks, Mitch, and welcome everyone. Despite macro weakness across our global mobile business, Skyworks delivered solid financial results driven by content games, our expanding footprint and broad markets to continued execution of our innovator product strategy, and the strength of our business model. Specifically in Q1, we've generated $972 million of revenue, delivered gross margin of 51% and operating margin 36.7%. We posted an EPS of $1.83 and we produce $549 million in cash flow from operations a new quarterly record for Skyworks.","In addition to achieving strong profitability and robust cash flow, we've clearly expanded our design wind pipeline in several emerging high growth categories. Our solutions are now enabling the newest Wi-Fi standards along with the latest advances in MIMO base stations and across mobile payment platforms. For example, our Wi-Fi 6 products are now powering NetGear routers, Charter Communications Home Gateways and Ruckus Indoor Access Points to name just a few.","We also partnered with Square, a market leading mobile payment platform, powering their latest long range retail systems. And we supported next generation high fidelity audio solutions for Bose enabled by Alexa voice controls. In addition, we've ramped advanced wireless engine supporting Phillips end-to-end street light management platforms. And across the infrastructure space, we've secured a number of massive MIMO wins with leading base station providers as they prepare for the ramp to 5G.","Across automotive, we reported next generation telematics solutions for leading German and Korean manufacturers. And these results highlight our success as we continue to increase our product reach across a growing set of end markets, applications and customers. We have extended our technology leadership in cellular and are capitalizing more broadly across the Internet of Things, leveraging a diverse set of connectivity protocols, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth ZigBee and GPS.","Looking ahead, 5G technology will fuel a broad array of markets and applications, ranging from industrial IoT, automotive, machine to machine, healthcare, smart cities as well as artificial intelligence. Capitalizing on the advances of our mobile solutions, the launch of strategic product categories and the diversified strength of broad markets, we remain confident in our ability to outperform. As a management team, we are squarely focused on operational excellence while continuing to invest strategically across innovative technologies and products, establishing a firm foundation for future growth.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Kris for a discussion of last quarter's performance and our outlook for Q2.","Kris Sennesael","Thanks, Liam. Revenue for the first fiscal quarter of 2019 was $972 million. Momentum in our high-growth broad market business allowed us to partially offset unit declines across our mobile business. That was mostly driven by weak and customer demand in China. In fact, revenue from broad markets continued to outperform in the first fiscal quarter. We have double digit revenue growth compared to the first quarter of last year, demonstrating continued diversification across multiple end markets, customers and applications.","Gross profit was $495 million resulting in a gross margin of 51%, down 20 basis points sequentially on lower revenue. Operating expenses were $139 million or 14% of revenue, slightly below our guidance. We generated $356 million of operating income, translating into an operating margin of 36.7%. First quarter effective tax rate was 9.7%, this draw net income of $325 million or $1.83 of diluted earnings per share.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. First fiscal quarter, cash flow from operations was a record $549 million and capital expenditures were $129 million, resulting in a strong free cash flow margin. We paid $67 million in dividends and repurchased a record high of 4 million shares of our common stock for a total of 284 million, and we ended the quarter with a cash balance of 1.1 billion and no debt.","As noted in our separate press release issued today, Skyworks Board of Directors has authorized a new $2 billion stock repurchase program. This new buyback plan reflects our confidence in Skyworks' business model and our ability to consistently produce strong free cash flow, allowing us to leverage share repurchases and dividends to generate higher shareholder returns. Our strong balance sheet and cash position provide important competitive advantages, allowing us to make the strategic investments in R&D while funding the capital requirements for 5G, as a complexity of our solutions intensifies.","Now, let's review our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. We anticipate revenue in the range of $800 million to $820 million. We expect gross margin to be between 50.5% and 51%, which is flat year over year at the midpoint of the range despite lower year over year revenue. In light of the market backdrop, we will continue to drive operational efficiencies and prudently manage our operating expenses down to approximately $135 million.","Below the line, we anticipate roughly $3 million another income and an effective tax rate of 10%. We expect our diluted share count to be approximately 175.5 million shares, assuming a revenue midpoint of approximately $810 million. We plan to deliver diluted earnings per share of $1.43.","With that, let me turn the call back to Liam.","Liam Griffin","Thanks, Kris. As all results indicate, we are continuing to deliver high levels of profitability with consistently strong cash flow. More importantly, we have strategically positioned Skyworks to outperform, as we seize upon a complex set of new opportunities in both mobile and broad markets. For example, the shift of 5G is a tremendous catalyst representing an entirely new connected ecosystem, one where Skyworks will play a leadership role.","At a higher level, 5G will be transformational, requiring step function increases in analog performance, advanced filtering and power efficiency. With decades of experience spanning successors technology generations, Skyworks is well positioned to capitalize with strategic partnerships across all smartphone and IoT customers, differentiated systems solutions, enabling unmatched levels of integration and performance, focused investments to expand our product portfolio, IP and scale.","And finally, a business model that leverages both mobile and broad market diversification with leading financial performance, we are committed to creating shareholder value while executing on our ambitious vision of connecting everyone and everything all the time.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Please go ahead.","Craig Ellis","Guys, I want to start just by understanding the different dynamics in the businesses we look at the second quarter. Kris, can you just clarify for us, what was the split between broad markets and integrated mobile in the first quarter? And then, as we look at the second quarter, what are the gives and takes in the second quarter, Liam? Do you think that can be a trough for the year and integrated mobile or would that come later in the fiscal year?","Kris Sennesael","Yes, Craig. I'll start by giving you some of the details there. So, in the December quarter broad market was approximately 27% of total revenue and of course mobile was 73%. So, in terms of broad market, we are still running at over $1 billion on an annualized revenue run rate. Also as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, broad market was up double-digits on a year-over-year basis into December quarter. So, we continue to see a lot of strength in our business, in our infrastructure business, some of our wireless connectivity solutions and as well we start turning revenue in our automotive business as well.","Liam Griffin","Right, Craig, and also if you think about the back half of the year pivoting off Q2 which is seasonally down and certainly hit with some macro effects where we feel much better about where the second half is going, consummating strategic design wins, which we will be launching in the back half of 2019.","Craig Ellis","And then, the follow-up question is on the new share buyback announcement. So, I believe it was the year ago that the program step up significantly to 1 billion. I think around 88% of that was executed within one year. So, the question is this; one, should we look at the new program as something that could be executed with similar pacing to last year's program? And if not then, should we think about other uses of cash whether it\u2019d be further M&A beyond Avnera or potential action with the dividend as things that the Company would try prosecute?","Kris Sennesael","Yes, so first of all, we continue to generate very strong cash flow, very strong cash from operations; and even when you look at the free cash flow taken into account, our CapEx, we continue to generate a very strong free cash flow. Obviously in the December quarter, the free cash flow margin was approximately 43%. We benefited there from reduction in our DSOs, but on an ongoing basis, we expect and we\u2019re well on track for the 30% free cash flow margin. So, we feel good about that part of that business.","And yes, in January of 2018, we put a $1 billion buyback program in place. There was only $129 million left under that pervious program so that got cancelled, and we did put a new $2 billion program in place right now. If you look at cash return to the shareholders in fiscal \u201918, we actually returned over a 120% of our free cash flow back to the shareholders, a combination of our dividend program as well as our share buyback program. And we\u2019ll continue to use those two programs to return substantial amount of the free cash flow back to the shareholder.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Toshiya Hari","I wanted to ask about 5G both on the infrastructure side as well as the mobile side, going forward. Can you remind us how meaningful your infrastructure business is within broad markets? And what kind of trends you\u2019re seeing there as it relates to 5G? And then on the mobile side, I believe it's one of the 20\/20 dynamic, but what are your thoughts on that as a potential driver for both units as well as content for your business?","Liam Griffin","Sure, well, we have been a consistent provider of infrastructure technology for years, across the global set of customers in Europe and Americas and in Asia. So, that something hasn\u2019t changed. We\u2019re starting to see some ramp up in architectures in 5G on the base station side. There is new technology. There is MIMO integration there as well. So that is definitely a driver and a catalyst for broad market. And then in parallel with that, we are absolutely committed to delivering 5G technology.","We\u2019re working on that right now with customers that matter. A lot of collaborative strategic dialogued between our customers and ourselves to craft the best possible solutions for 5G. It brings with the tremendous opportunities and filtering tremendous opportunities in our gallium arsenide technology. Our ability to integrate basically these products in our own sites and we launch as you know our Sky5 platform here last year.","So, we\u2019re making great strides. We think those products will come to market probably in 2020 and more readily in 2021. But the great opportunity and as we noted in our prepared remarks, the real catalyst for this industry will be at the forefront.","Toshiya Hari","As a quick follow-up, I wanted to ask about China smartphones. What percentage of your revenue came from your Chinese customers within mobile into December quarter? And I guess going forward, do you think the current quarter as the trough for that business? Or do you think we should prepare for multiple quarters of weakness, just given the inventory situations there?","Kris Sennesael","So in the December quarter, revenue from our Chinese customers was approximately 20% of our total revenue. It was down substantially on the sequential basis, which is somewhat in line with normal seasonality. However, we do expect in the March quarter a further minor sequential decline of that business.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Blayne Curtis","Maybe just following up over the last question, if you look, obviously there's a lot of well known weakness in mobile, but it equates to some down substantial down year-over-year. So I'm just kind of curious as you look back at December and then maybe even that whole fiscal year. In terms of your, the market versus your sharing your content, you can kind of look back there and have analyzed. What drove those substantial year-over-year declines and then kind of any perspective as you look forward at that reversing?","Liam Griffin","Sure, Blayne, this is Liam here. The way I would look at this is, you've got a regional effect with China specifically with the China demand really softened. And so think about that is a geography set, it certainly impacted customers in China. It also had a bit of a headwind on the export market, but a lot of China brands would populate technology from companies like Skyworks, and then those products would go all over the world and emerging markets and they're hard to track. But we use it as revenue there.","So you have the China consumption coming down, you have the export markets also coming down. And thenm we have some specific unique challenges with Tier 1 customers that had much more advanced richer content with a lot of value and technology and their units coming down. Some of that was China and some of that with other markets, but it was a combination of that affect China at a high level, and then you could port that into individual customers of Skyworks and kind of read through the day, even Samsung had some challenges here in the last quarter. So, that's what we've been doing.","If you look out in time, I feel a lot better about where we're positioned. We're executing on the things that we can control. We're delivering great content, high performance technologies that our customers love. We're reading for 5G. And then in parallel, we've got a broad markets business that continues to grow double-digits. So, we feel better about the second half, this was a tricky period or that we've navigated through but we expect to show better results here if you get into the second half.","Blayne Curtis","And then I just wanted to go back to the broad market. It seems like and freshly, if you mentioned some momentum in March just kind of going back to the first question. Is December the trough and broad markets? And do you expect it to increase sequentially?","Liam Griffin","Yes, it should be and we should continue to see some increases sequentially here. It tends to run on it's on an uncorrelated vector, right, vis-a-vis mobile, and we continue to be upside surprised by some of the new design wins that we bring forth. And one of the nice things I will say is where mobile is fairly well characterized in terms of customers in TAM and value, the broad markets businesses, there is not the headroom there. So, even in a market that could move sideways to down, we could grow and we're doing that. And one of the things to remember is that the breadth of our wireless protocols whether it's Wi-Fi or Bluetooth or ZigBee, or cellular really offers a great opportunity for us as we look at increasingly diverse set of customers and providing a menu of options for those customers as they move to connected solutions.","Operator","And our next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Jim in calling for Ambrish. Thanks for the question. First, I was wondering if you guys could give us a bit of an idea of when you expect to your BAW revenue to become more meaningful? And how does it translate into margins? I guess specifically, do you expect there should be a tailwind towards your 52% gross margin target?","Liam Griffin","Sure. Well, as we noted in the last earnings call, we have been making very good progress in our Bulk Acoustic Wave portfolio, and as you know, we have been a market leader in temperature compensated SAW. We continue to invest in that category and that\u2019s become and continues to become a real strategic weapon for us. And the Bulk Acoustic Wave technology is moving along very well. We have design wins. We expect revenue in the second half.","I don\u2019t want to quantify too much to that right, but we have made the kind of progress that we expected to make. We have made more investments in capital as well to fortify the scale of our BAW technology. It's just another great opportunity for us to expand TAM and create the most diverse set of solutions that we can provide our customers, very meaningful for us in 5G as well, as we move into that category.","Blayne Curtis","And my follow-up is I guess turning towards broad markets. I think you point to bit of a macro slowdown I guess across your whole markets. But looking at broad market specifically, why are we not seeing the slowdown there beyond infrastructure and IoT? Where are you, I guess like, are you seeing I guess the slowing?","Liam Griffin","Yes, so broad market has provided an upside here and we\u2019ll continue to do so. Again as I mentioned, there is just so much opportunity that we haven\u2019t yet covered. We\u2019re doing great work with our Wi-Fi product lines, with our ZigBee product line, getting into the infrastructure space now that\u2019s taken off again for us. A lot of connected devices in the home, security, working with customers like Amazon, like Nest. We even have some defense business in our broad market portfolio. So, it creates a great opportunity because we\u2019re really not -- we\u2019re not constrained by TAM and sort of markets. We are growing the TAM. We\u2019re expanding our reach and we\u2019re getting into new customers and accounts. So, there\u2019s a lot of headwind for growth even if some of the market dynamics at a macro level are not in our favor.","Operator","Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig, your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","This is [Enaya] calling in for Craig. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to discuss like the opportunities do you see for content increase at your marquee customers when you look at appeal to in front of you? Like you know what are the key products that drive content increase to you? And what kind of boost would 5G provide?","Liam Griffin","Sure, well, if you look at the opportunities today, there is still an incredible ecosystem that lives and breathes on connected devices and smartphones, and the higher end players really embrace that. And if you look at what we have been seeing, as we have been seeing an increasing opportunity in mobile devices, even in 4G, we have been seeing that. Much more complex solutions, our DRX category for example, our high band solutions now bringing BAW to the table, all of that is moving in the right direction. But the big inflection is going to be the step up into 5G and that will absolutely happen.","And when that happens, it's necessary that new technology that brought into the same physical form factor, that same handset, new technologies, new spectrum, new frequencies, more filtering. The ability to coexist with different devices brings in a tremendous amount of complexity and challenge and creates a unique opportunity for Skyworks and the top tier players in our space to win. So, we're looking forward to that. And those all again as a parallel opportunity in the infrastructure side, but we are absolutely seeing the block diagrams, the expectations and the dialogue with our customers at point to tremendous opportunity when 5G arise.","Unidentified Analyst","And from a follow-up, just want to touch upon Avnera, like can you just provide us an update how the integration is going? Where do you see the key opportunities and any milestones that we should be looking forward as you measure your progress on that acquisition?","Kris Sennesael","So of their and December quarter came in, fully in line with our expectations, by now we have fully integrated that business into our growth markets. And so, we're really pleased with the Avnera there. It came with a very strong management team, some great IP and technology. And we see a lot of good progress there as we integrate that into our business.","Liam Griffin","Right and if you think about the strategic rationale with Avnera, it's increasingly clear that voice is becoming one of the most important interfaces now in devices whether it's connected devices whether it's automotive. Voice technology is very critical and it's going through a phase now operates with more IP being layered in. So that technology for us by virtue of the Avnera, they'll put us in a great position to capitalize, levering their unique solutions, and then allowing Skyworks with a greater scale and manufacturing and also greater reach from a customer perspective to weave that all together to develop new sets of opportunities and new sets of revenue curves as we look out.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.","Timothy Arcuri","I guess my first question is. How to think about the shape of the year as you go through the end of the fiscal year? I think June is usually -- it's usually flat up maybe a little bit and September's usually up about 10%. So are there any sort of weird things that you point to with the comps this year that would make this year sort of abnormal versus what is typical seasonally?","Liam Griffin","Sure, yes, it's a great question. As we look out, what you just modeled is kind of what we see as well, you typically have March quarter that's seasonally down obviously more pronounced this year across the space. And if you look at the June quarter, that's flattest maybe a little bit. And then we get into the second half of the calendar year, our Q4 and then Q1 calendar, calendar and fiscal. We would expect higher level to grow. So what we do know is that, we are doing the work that necessary to win and platforms that matter.","And not just mobile platforms, but also in broad markets, and also an infrastructure and the design win execution has been very, very favorable for us, it doesn't show up in the march for numbers. So we feel good about that. The breadth of the technology for us is really opening up and it's not one or two accounts. We're going moving the dial with some of our unique solutions across more and more players and mobile, and then the broad market is really just about adding new applications and customers.","So we expect -- again, we're not guiding the full year but we do expect knowing what we know about our business and what we deliver on content and a lot of cases have you been shipped yet. We feel very good about that signature where you kind of have a flat the slightly up Q3 and then we move into the second half with a stronger top line and the financial performance in the bottom line should follow.","Timothy Arcuri","And then I guess the last -- the first half of the last fiscal year, you gave a little bit of granularity in terms of your largest customer there portion of your revenue. Can you give us a sense in terms of what that was in December and maybe what you think it'll be in March?","Kris Sennesael","So in the December quarter, our largest customer was over 50% of our total revenue pretty much in line with what it was in the December quarter a year ago. Keep in mind that the December quarter is a very strong quarter for our large customer. When you look at it on a full year basis, we expect that large customer to be in the mid 40s as a percent of total revenue, again pretty much in line with what it was last year.","Operator","And our next question is from Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Shawn Harrison","Just wanted to follow up on the commentary of increased investments for VOD, does that change in any way the CapEx outlook for the year which I think was around $400 million?","Kris Sennesael","No, not really. I mean we expect our CapEx to run slightly above 10% to revenue. It's a combination of some capacity expansion CapEx that we do, especially in our filter operation as we continue with our in-sourcing process that we talked about in the past. But in addition to that, we are making the necessary technology related CapEx investments in our filter operation and in our back end operation. And especially in the filter operation, a substantial part there is in support of our ramp with BAW filters.","Shawn Harrison","As a follow-up, the OpEx guide of $135 million, you're only up about $3 million year-over-year in spite of Avnera. How much of that kind of the OpEx you're taking out as temporary versus any permanent changes in that number?","Kris Sennesael","Well, as a management team, we will manage our operating expenses. We know what we can control. We are -- we will look at discretionary spending. Obviously, the rest on variable operating expenses as well that's come down on lower revenue. And so, at the same time, we will not hesitate to make the necessary investments for our future and make the necessary investments to build those new technology building blocks that support 5G, all the good R&D activities to support further expansion of our broad market business. So, it's a combination of both again we will continue to very prudently manage our operating expenses and adjust, if and when necessary.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Bill Peterson with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Bill Peterson","Wanted to ask a question similar to the revenue trajectory for the year, I guess, how should we think about gross margins given -- it sounds like you have a pretty good feel through your content later in the year for products that are released yet. How should we think about the gross margin expansion through the year?","Liam Griffin","So, first maybe a couple of numbers there, right. So, December came in at 51%, down 20 basis points on lower revenue. We guide March at 50.5% to 51% which is sequentially down, but in line with normal seasonality and so approximately flat on a year over year basis. Looking forward to the remainder of the year and beyond that, I feel good about our ability to further expand the gross margin towards our target model of 53%. Obviously, if we have more revenue tailwinds that will help us to get faster through the 53%, but we are again focusing on operational efficiencies, we are driving the technology curve, we are introducing new products to the market that are more value add type of products, and the combination of all of that will help us to further improve the gross margin.","Bill Peterson","And I guess, I think in the past broad markets you described is margin accretive and presumably that can grow faster than mobile. I guess, do you think you can still -- as you look at your design wind pipeline, do you think that business can continue growing at a double-digit clip for the full fiscal year?","Kris Sennesael","Yes, so, broad market is above average gross margin and we do believe that we can continue to grow that business double digit.","Operator","And our next question is from Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Srini Pajjuri","Liam, so if I look at the December quarter revenue and also the March quarter outlook, they're down almost double-digit year-on-year even though your content is up and then broad market is growing nicely in a double-digit pay. So my question is, to what extent do you think your March quarter outlook actually reflects the end demand? I mean, we know that obviously the end demand has in week. But I'm just wondering, if there's inventory of the component level that you need to work through and then the March quarter outlook, it's probably not a true reflection of the words and demand is. So if you could shed a light on that that will be helpful.","Liam Griffin","Yes, I mean, obviously, the way the quarter rolled out for us is now what we expected and now what we anticipated, and I think that that's kind of a shared by a number of peers, not just in mobile, but anyone in semis and even in tech kind of absorb this reduction is changed. And again, it's not even specific to a customer. I think we had, as I mentioned, a China effect that really hurt us and then some other trickle down challenges. But how do you set all that? Where we are here off of our current guidance and into the March quarter? We feel it's the right guidance is balanced and positions ourselves well for recovery in the second half. We were always keenly analyzing where the inventory is, and what our customers have on hand if we can see that and we usually can. One of the reasons why the number was down in Q2 quite frankly is to reconcile that. So, we feel that we created a balanced view here from our guide in our position to move forward and up from here.","Srini Pajjuri","And then, you talked about 5G obviously that's probably a bigger driver next year, but it looks like several of your customers are going to announce 5G phones in the not too distant future. I'm just curious as to, what you're seeing in terms of design win interaction? And then also, if you can comment on when you talk about content expansion, what exactly will drive constant expansion? Is it simply you need more powerful PAs and filters or either more bands? Or if you could shed some light on that, that will be helpful.","Liam Griffin","Yes, it's a couple of things. Yes, you will see announcements for 5G in the next 12 months. There's no question about that. And we are absolutely going to be populating those phones when they're announced. I think the big shift to the 5G ecosystem will probably get a little bit later kind of end of 2020 and 2021, but there will be steps along that path. Now, if we look at the opportunity, if you could just envision what we're looking at here is, you've got a 4G technology engine that is in place already in your device and that is not going away.","5G is going to be incremental and additive to your current handset. So, no one is walking around today with 5G frequencies in their phone or dealing with 6 gigahertz and above or dealing with millimeter wave in their phone. They're not doing that yet. That is coming. So, what's going to offer increased opportunity for companies like Skyworks, it's also going to drive a great deal of architectural complexity.","And those that know how to handle that and know and companies that have the ability to be configurable and flexible in the architecture because what we are seeing in 5G is, every customer wants it differently whether it's a geographical roaming issue, it's a size issue. They're different, they're different. These are not cookie cutter devices and that's great for us because it gives us an opportunity to shape the curve, work with the customers, provide the greatest technology and also be in early.","So we're looking forward too, we're making investments, we've rounded out our filter portfolio now with BAW. We've done a tremendous job today with our Sky5 platform on both transmit chain and receive side with the DRX technology. We were even weaving in some of our devices and Wi-Fi 6, GPS and some of these applications. So, we're looking forward to this. And again, this was forward looking revenue that we'll be seeing you know late into this year and further into 2020 timeframe.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Tristan Gerra with Baird. Please go ahead.","Tristan Gerra","Elaborating on the previous 5G and cluster show question, would you be able to say whether you had content currently into the Asia geography currently ramping and then kind of think of China specifically in the second half of this year. Just trying to see you know how impactful that ramp could be on your revenue line as you exit kind of 2019? And also, could you give us a bit of color on your market share looks like in 5G base stations versus what\u2019s you\u2019ve had so far in 4G?","Liam Griffin","Sure, well, we expect to and we are positioned to support all of the global infrastructure players in 5G, the U.S. players, the European players and the players in Asia and all of them today our customers for us. And the advances that we see in the MIMO architectures and the specific spectrum that's required to deliver the 5G wave forms, there's some great challenges there that we're going to work with these suppliers and these infrastructure players to overcome.","So, we have a balance to do. We've seen a lot of great work come out of Ericsson and Nokia Siemens Networks. There is obviously some players that we see we see in APAC and we're well positioned there across this space. We need that. The infrastructure has to be in place for this new network to perform. So, we have great technology and opportunity in the handheld devices, but we also have to pair that up with the infrastructure side. So,we get that signal working together and we're all over it in each one of those customers.","Srini Pajjuri","And then given that before we see a more meaningful one of the 5G upturns in U.S. in 2020, RF content increases in the U.S., this year probably somewhat muted, so are we -- should we be bullish in terms of RF content specific to China markets which is probably where there's is going to be more 5G production this year? How should we look at the year over year potential comps in your mobile business for this whole year?","Liam Griffin","So, there's a lot there, but what I would say is, it's possible that China may be early in 5G, that's possible. But I think you also got to look at the global theater here because I think you've got some tremendous technologies coming to market across the globe in Korea from the U.S. from Europe as well as China. So, I think it's going to be more balanced in my perspective and what I'm seeing in my dialogue with customers, it's going to be more balanced launched. And as I also mentioned, you're going to have different flavors and technologies they're going to be put forth.","Some of it is just absolutely necessary. There are new frequencies and new spectrums in products that go into these phones have to be able to deliver advantage and deliver signals across that spectrum. And we'll be one of those players. There will be some other things that will be required as well. Just think about the coexistence of all of this technology in a single device is going to create lots of challenges, harmonics challenges, coexistence challenges, that have to be overcome. We will be working with our customers to do that.","They'll be players in China, but I think it's going to be much more of a global impact. And also remember, 5G is truly a technology, it's a technology that brings incredible data rate, low latency in capacity. So, 5G is not just a catalyst for the mobile phone, it's going to create IoT opportunities, it's going to create small cell opportunities and enable markets that we haven't even seen before, as we moving into future, automotive as well. So, there's a lot to look forward there and we're in good position working with market leaders globally.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Your line is open.","Vijay Rakesh","I am just wondering on the BAW site work show. What is the roadmap there? And what do you see us mix of broader and you said exists 2019?","Liam Griffin","Sure, sure. Well, what I will say is that, we've been working on our BAW products for quite a while. We haven't said much about it until the last earnings call, but we're making great advancements, great strides, sampling customers that matter getting incredible feedback, delivering on the successes that we have and then also learning about new opportunities that we haven't yet addressed. So, it's certainly round out our portfolio as a lot of players in that space as well, but we're going to we're going to be a meaningful, meaningful elements in BAW.","As we go forward, as Kris mentioned, we made strategic investments in this technology. So, this isn't just IP, this is also being able to deliver the kind of technology and scale and the production side that makes this happen. And the BAW process is very different than surface acoustic wave that requires a whole different type of manufacturing complexity, and we know how to get that done now with a lot of help. So, you should just continue to see a steady growth in that area as we move forward.","Our TC SAW technology is also vital to these architectures. We're seeing a lot of growth there as well. We continue to work that. But one of other things that we do differently than some of our peers is, it's the integration, it's bringing in the right filter, the right ICs, the right mix of gallium arsenide and SOI technology, the packaging and the configurability that we can offer each customers I think makes it unique. Having BAW now within our portfolio ready just solves another issue and we're looking forward to delivering and then as time goes on.","Vijay Rakesh","And then, the inventory side, I know it's tough to get a handle on all the inventories, but your inventory went off looks like in the December quarter. But if you're going to March with the revenues coming down, we expect inventories in-house to go up again or do you coming down? And also on the channel inventory side, any thoughts on how channel inventories look in China et cetera? What's your best guess there?","Kris Sennesael","So, on the inventory on our own books in the December quarter was flat, slightly up $3 million versus the September quarter. And when you look at inventory going forward, of course you have to take into account our seasonal pattern for fiscal Q2 and fiscal Q3 are the lowest quarters and then we see strong sequential growth into fiscal Q4 and fiscal Q1.","We obviously want to maximize our capital equipment efficiency and trying to minimize our CapEx. So as a result of that, we will level load our operational activity into our factories. And so, during the low seasonal quarters, we typically build some internal inventory and so you will see inventories go up in fiscal Q2 and fiscal Q3, and then we start reading that off in Q4 and Q1. That's our own inventory level.","On the inventory -- in the distribution channel, I think Liam already talked about that. We've definitely have seen some cautious behavior from most of our distributors given the level of volatility in some of the macro headwinds out there. And so, we are not fighting the tape there. We are working with our distribution partners and we keep a very healthy, normal level of inventory into the channel.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Rajvindra Gill with Needham and Company. Please go ahead.","Rajvindra Gill","With respect to the gross margin question, so in terms of margins kind of stabilizing and potentially expanding as you increase your mix of broad markets. I was wondering about any particular pricing pressure you're seeing in your mobile business that could potentially offset that mix shift, that positive mix shift going forward?","Liam Griffin","Sure, yes. So, certainly, the broad market portfolio has accretive margins to the Company. But what I will say is, as we move into more advanced 5G, the mobile business is going to get much more complex, and differentiation and execution and scale are going to matter. And we think we're going to do very well in that environment and provide a tremendous amount of value to our customer but also get the kind of margin that we deserve for bringing our technology to market. So, we feel good about our outlook and gross margin as we move to 5G and beyond.","Rajvindra Gill","And for my follow-up, with respect to the broad market. I wonder if you could give us a sense of what percentage of that revenue is coming from ADAS and autonomous driving? And what's your position there? What areas of growth -- what specific products do you think you'll have outsized share gains whether that's in Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or the sub 6 gigahertz band or MIMO? Just wondering, how you think about the 5G system architecture for the connected car?","Liam Griffin","Sure, that's a great question. We are fortunately today before 5G has arrived, we've had a really strong, I would say, the last year and a half a real strong uptake in automotive and engagement with a number of leading players, some we can announce and some we just can't announce. And it started with some of the instrument clusters that work in infotainment work, and now we're doing a lot of the telematics work. So, it's a meaningful part of our broad market revenue. We don't segment auto with a specific product line, but it's a meaningful piece and one of the fastest growing.","When you move to 5G and we're working with the players now, the connectivity element is vital, it is critical. Again, you need the data rates a 100x what we see in 4G. Latency is absolutely at a premium. Near zero latency is required, and in many cases redundant cellular engines are required to ensure reliability and performance. And each player has a different way of looking at this, but it's going to be a significant opportunity for connectivity and wireless connectivity.","And then from that, I think we can move further along within the automobile and collision avoidance, and even some vision systems and things like that down the road. Some of that we don't have in the portfolio today, but we absolutely will be well positioned on the core connectivity elements which are vital in 5G autonomous vehicle. So, that's an exciting opportunity. I'm happy that the team has been able to execute today on 4G opportunities and some other in-dash automobile solutions, but 5G for automotive is going to be really special.","Operator","And I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Griffin for any closing comments.","Liam Griffin","Thank you, all for participating on today's call. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming investor conferences and events during the quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes our teleconference for today. Thank you for using AT&T Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect."],"19661":["Skyworks Solutions, Inc.

Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Operator","Good afternoon, and welcome to Skyworks Solutions Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Mitch Haws, Vice President of Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Haws, please go ahead.","Mitchell J. Haws - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Thank you, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks Fourth Fiscal Quarter and Year-End 2017 Conference Call. With me on the call today are Liam Griffin, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Kris Sennesael, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our discussion will include statements relating to future results and expectations that are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Please refer to our earnings press release and recent SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K, for information on certain risks that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially and adversely from any forward-looking statements made today. Additionally, the results and guidance we will discuss include non-GAAP financial measures consistent with our past practice. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for our complete reconciliation to GAAP.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Liam.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Mitch, and welcome, everyone. The Skyworks team produced record results in Q4 in fiscal 2017, demonstrating our traction within the increasingly vibrant and profitable Mobile and IoT ecosystems. Let me begin with a few fourth quarter highlights. We delivered revenue of $985 million, up 18% year-over-year, and above our guidance. We expanded gross margin by 30 basis points, and operating margin by 150 basis points sequentially. We achieved earnings per share of $1.82, up 24% year-over-year, $0.07 ahead of consensus. For the full year, we generated revenues of $3.7 billion, up 11%, with earnings per share of $6.45, up 16% year-over-year. And we produced exceptional operating cash flow, $1.5 billion, up 34% from last year.","In addition to our strong financial performance, we've significantly expanded the aperture of our design win pipeline. Last quarter, we broadened our reach across all premier customers. Specifically, we powered Samsung's Galaxy and Note platforms, with proprietary DRx and SkyOne solutions, while adding GPS and DC\/DC converters. We enabled Huawei's newest premium smartphones with low, mid and high band SkyOne, Wi-Fi, carrier aggregation, and proprietary SkyBlue power management solutions. And we leveraged SkyLiTE and SkyOne across new platforms at Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, and Motorola.","And across our broad markets, we delivered fully integrated Zigbee and ISM modules for Bosch home security and Cisco's smart lighting systems. We commenced volume production of in-vehicle telematics at Hyundai, and launched wireless networking engines within DirecTV's 4K Genie receivers. We also supported Sonos' latest hi-fi speaker featuring Amazon Alexa. And we introduced next-generation 802.11ax Wi-Fi solutions, enabling a fourfold increase in speed and supporting up to 50 simultaneous users. We secured connectivity wins at DJI for virtual reality and drone applications, supplied precision GPS and antenna tuning for Fitbit's newest smart watches, and we unveiled high power solutions with leading base station customers for 5G MIMO deployments.","So to summarize, we delivered yet another year of record results, capturing strategic design wins across all key market segments, while strengthening our balance sheet. At a higher level, the ubiquitous connected economy is gaining significant momentum and enhancing the way we live, work, play, and educate. The growth opportunity is enormous. Global mobile data usage is expected to grow five times between 2017 and 2021. IoT volumes are exploding, with 75 billion devices projected by 2025. And there is still the opportunity to connect the unconnected, which today represents over 2 billion people worldwide.","In parallel, the applications driving our business are expanding to now include connected homes, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, wearables, as well as network infrastructure. And by definition, these applications would not be possible without fast, secure, power-efficient connectivity solutions provided by Skyworks.","As we've previously discussed, the equity market is recognizing this macro-tend as powerful, highly profitable and accelerating. In fact, if we look at today's top five S&P 500 companies by market cap, they are all demonstrating successful monetization of the rapidly growing mobile economy. As a group, these five companies have created 2 trillion of incremental shareholder value since 2012, a clear testament to the strength of this industry. Meanwhile, the broad range of usage cases and expanding scope of newly connected platforms are creating an increasingly crowded radio spectrum, stressing network capacity and slowing data throughput.","Our mission is to enable this data-driven world and alleviate the looming digital traffic jam. This will require an inflection point in global communication standards, and that's 5G. 5G will represent a significant boost in speed, up to 100 times that that we see in 4G networks. 5G will offer extremely low latency, a requirement for mission-critical applications such as driverless cars, machine-to-machine, and robotics. And 5G will be a key enabler to a massive rollout of IoT, greatly expanding network capacity and improving reliability. 5G will also spawn new and previously unimagined applications, while greatly enhancing the performance and utility of existing mobile platforms.","We will see this reflected in new unit growth in IoT applications and also across the global smartphone installed base. Keep in mind, the 5 billion subscribers today all operate on 2G, 3G, and 4G networks. In order to make the leap to 5G, system architectures will require significantly more powerful connectivity engines to ensure the intense performance challenges are realized. This upgrade wave will create an enormous growth catalyst for the entire smartphone ecosystem. And as a leader in unwiring the planet, Skyworks is well-positioned to capitalize, with extensive technology breadth and depth, strategic partnerships with all leading smartphone and IoT customers, differentiated system solutions enabling unmatched levels of integration and performance, all underpinned by our aggressive investments over the past two decades to expand our product portfolio, IP and scale.","As a result, we have the profitability, cash flow, and balance sheet to extend our leadership position. Our strategic R&D and CapEx investments will be pivotal as the scale and technology requirements around 5G intensify. Finally, and most importantly, we are committed to delivering premium levels of profitability with above-market growth, while continuing to create sustainable shareholder value.","I will now turn the call over to Kris for discussion of last quarter's performance and our outlook for Q1.","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Liam. Revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017 was a record $985 million, up 9% sequentially and up 18% compared to Q4 of last year, exceeding our guidance and consensus estimates. Gross profit was $502 million or 51% of revenue, up 30 basis points sequentially following 30 basis points of sequential improvement in the June quarter. Operating expense were $123 million or 12.5% of revenue. As a result, we generated $379 million of operating income, translating into an operating margin of 38.5%, up 150 basis points sequentially. Our tax rate was 11.1%, driving net income of $339 million or $1.82 of diluted earnings per share, exceeding our guidance by $0.07. Fourth quarter EPS of $1.82 was up 16% sequentially and 24% compared to Q4 of last year.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, fourth fiscal quarter cash flow from operations was $425 million, and capital expenditures were $85 million. Dividends paid were $59 million, and we repurchased 1 million shares of our common stock for a total of $102 million.","As this is the fourth and last quarter of fiscal 2017, let's also review our annual results. We delivered a record $3.7 billion of revenue, up 11% year-over-year. Operating income was $1.4 billion, and net income was $1.2 billion, translating into $6.45 of diluted earnings per share, up 16% versus last year. In addition to the strong top and bottom line year-over-year growth, we generated cash flow from operations of $1.5 billion, up 34% from fiscal 2016. CapEx for the year was $300 million, resulting in $1.2 billion of free cash flow or a 32% free cash flow margin. We returned 55% of the free cash flow to shareholders, with $215 million of dividend payments and $432 million in share buybacks, as we repurchased just over 4.6 million shares throughout the fiscal year. We ended fiscal 2017 with a cash balance of $1.6 billion and no debt.","Now moving to our outlook for fiscal Q1. We plan for revenue to be up 15% year-over-year to $1.05 billion, with gross margin expansion to the 51% to 51.5% range. Operating expense are expected to be $127 million. Below the line, we anticipate roughly $2.5 million in other income, and a tax rate of 14.5%. We expect our diluted share count to be approximately 185.5 million shares. Accordingly, we intend to deliver diluted earnings per share of $1.91, an increase of 19% year-over-year, demonstrating our sustained operating leverage.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liam.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Kris. Skyworks enters fiscal 2018 with strong momentum. Our outperformance is being driven by a vibrant, dynamic Mobile ecosystem, one that rewards companies who can resolve architectural complexity with simplified integrated solutions. The value inherent in the connected economy is apparent in our results. In the past five years, our revenues have more than doubled, EPS has more than tripled, and operating cash is up five times.","In closing, our ambitious vision of connecting everyone and everything all the time has never been more relevant and exciting. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay. Our first question will come from the line of Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.","Atif Malik - Citi Research","Hi, thanks for taking my questions, and good job on the execution. First question, the gross margins, Kris, if you can talk about what's driving the gross margin expansion into the December quarter, and then I have a follow-up.","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, so first of all, I'm pleased with the ongoing gross margin expansion. As we said in the prepared remarks, we added 30 basis point in June, we added 30 basis points in September here, and for December, we guide gross margin up between 0 to 50 basis points. And so, the way we do that is three elements. Of course, more revenue, more volume helps with size and scale and fixed cost absorption, that's one. Secondly, we continue to drive operational efficiencies across all our operations and with our third-party suppliers. And then last but not least, we continue to make good progress on filter insourcing. As a reminder, roughly 50% of the filters we use are being produced in-house, and 50% is purchased from third parties. We are moving towards a 75%\/25% allocation there and making good progress in that. And so, when you combine this all, we continue to make good progress and moving towards our target of 53% gross margin.","Atif Malik - Citi Research","Great. And then, Liam, your execution has been very strong. This year, you're outgrowing your peers on a tender basis, particularly in China with major OEMs like Huawei picking up your RF solution. If I look at \u2013 historically, your share in China has been mid 20s. Can you talk about what your market share or the percent of your sales could be this year? And how much of this is permanent or in terms of share gains into next year?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure, I'll try to give you as much color as I can here. Well, as you know, I mean, China has been a strategic market for us for some time. It's a growing market. It's also a market that not only produces product in country, it exports. And as you've seen lately, they've also been a great consumer of global Tier 1 phones, so there's a lot that goes into that mix. For us, the theme that we're seeing right now and the theme that we're capitalizing on is this move towards higher-end performance within China. Huawei is a great example, where we have mid band, high band, low band, SkyOne, DRx technology, power technology, really rich content, moving that to Oppo and Vivo and Xiaomi as well. So, the real theme for us is moving that content up, moving that performance level up. And we're really happy to see that the consumer in China is up for that and asking for those products.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Thanks, guys, for taking the question. Congrats on the progress.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Thanks.","Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Liam, if you could maybe just follow up on that last question. If we go back to statements that Qorvo made on their conference call, they were talking about a consumer movement in China toward middle-market phones, cheaper phones that have, obviously, lower RF dollar content. It's definitely different from what you just stated, I guess. Can you maybe help us to square that a bit what you're seeing maybe versus their comment?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, well, I think, both can be right. There's a low end, there's a mid end, and then there's a premium end. We participate in both the premium and the mid-tier, not so much in the low end. But where we're seeing real acceleration is when you look at $3 to $4 content 4G product moving up to higher end 4G that could be $6 or $7. That theme is playing out very well. We still have participation in the mid-tier, but again, the driving theme right now is about getting global phones that are rich in content that can sell in China, can sell even outside of China. So that's where we're seeing the benefit. I mean, Huawei has been a class case study for us. We've done extremely well with that customer. We've engaged early. We have incredible relationships and have been able to drive a wonderful set of products through their portfolio. And that's not changing.","Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Thank you for that. And then lastly, the Street has gotten pretty used to pretty inarguable beat-and-raise quarters out of you guys, and so a good September quarter but relatively in line December guidance. And with the delay of a launch of your largest customer, what might that be doing to the December to March transition? And does maybe what might be considered a little lighter December mean we might see a little stronger March?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure, well, here's what I can tell you, Cody. We have a process for our guidance. We look through our backlog position. There's not a lot of speculation. We have great visibility in the current quarter as to where we are. And our job is to try to cement our designs with the right customers in the right markets, whether they're in mobile, whether they're in IoT or infrastructure. And the team has done a great job of putting great product with the right companies. And then it's up to the customers to actually deliver on the mix side on their end. So, some of that is out of our control, but we have a balanced view with the Q1. We don't really have any guidance for you yet for March, but I wouldn't expect anything different than from kind of our normal signature there. But we go through that process every quarter and nothing has really changed.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Peterson with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Bill Peterson - J.P. Morgan","Yeah, thanks for letting me ask a question, and congrats as well on the quarter. I guess, can you give us a feel as you've done in the past on the size of broad markets in the quarter as well, I guess, first is mobile?","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yes, Bill, so broad markets was approximately 26% of total revenue. Our integrated mobile was 64% of total revenue, and the Power Amplifiers was approximately 10%. So, I'm definitely very pleased with broad markets at 26% of total revenue. So we actually exceeded more than $250 million of quarter revenue in broad markets. So we've now over $1 billion in annualized revenue in that market. As you could hear from the prepared remarks, we have a lot of design win momentum in that segment. We experience a lot of growth in that segment and so that's definitely helping us to overall grow our business.","Bill Peterson - J.P. Morgan","Okay. Thanks for that color. And I guess, if we look in the next year based out of your design win pipeline, I guess, which of the two between mobile and broad markets would you expect to go faster at this stage? And I guess, that's just kind of a content question as well for mobile but also just the pipeline you have for the broad market side. Thank you.","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yes, so broad market in fiscal 2017 has been growing high teens full year, year-over-year. We expect that to continue to grow mid-teens, mid to high teens, so we definitely see a lot of growth there, but at the same time, of course, we are very bullish about our mobile markets as well and continue to see double-digit growth in that area.","Bill Peterson - J.P. Morgan","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thanks for taking my questions. My first question, I just wanted to follow up on the broad markets question. I realize that this segment is exposed to many, many customers and many, many end products, but if you can point to some of the drivers in the quarter, and perhaps the areas where you have high expectations going into calendar 2018, that would be helpful. Thank you.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure, Toshi. It really is a broad set of applications and customers. I think one important point is the ability for Skyworks to create a broad and growing presence in the actual wireless topology. So we're offering Wi-Fi, 11ac, 11ax. We're offering Bluetooth, we're offering ZigBee, we're offering GPS. There's really a wide range of topologies that we bring, and even cellular in some of these applications.","So that allows us to manage opportunities and grow the business, whether it's short-data range devices, whether it's devices that demand a stronger signal, faster data rate, longer-range, premium Wi-Fi. The customer set, we rattled off a few in the prepared remarks, continues to grow. There's connected home devices, there's security systems, there's more and more video applications that really drive a tremendous amount of content for us. So it's quite diversified. There's customers with applications and then there's the breadth of wireless topologies that we bring that really creates the differentiation.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And as my follow-up, we've heard from Broadcom as it relates to their bid for Qualcomm, and I'm thinking you guys have spent some time at least brainstorming what the implications could be for the overall industry and for your business. Perhaps you haven't, but in case you have, how should we think about the impact to you guys, what are the potential benefits, potential negatives when you think about a potential team-up between the two companies? Thank you.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure, well, it's very early to call the implications here, but one of the things I would say is it clearly shows the value and significance of this mobile economy that we've been talking about for a while. This is a really significant change in the way we work, live, play, monetize. So I think it speaks to that. For us, we have great position with both of those parties. We do a lot of work with Qualcomm, we've had a lot of work with Broadcom Avago on Wi-Fi. So for us, I think that we would certainly be able to coexist with those folks. But think again about the statement that I see on this is the value of mobile and the economy that's supported by it, and I think that's the big takeaway here.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Please go ahead.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi, thank you. And Liam, maybe if we could just stay with that theme of the high level, and since you've been on board, you have pretty much laid out your conviction on the business. And it sounds like you're \u2013 the change at least that I get is that you're not that interested in diversification just for the sake of diversification. Is that the right way to think about how you view your business and, as you just laid out, the mobile economy as you highlighted in your prepared remarks? And then I have a quick follow-up.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure, well, I will say that my conviction in Skyworks and what we're doing is sound, and I'm really excited and happy about the execution of this team. And we've laid out a framework a few years back and even longer about what we want to accomplish. And I think we're doing quite well. There's more to do. But what I think about really is, we can call it mobile, we can call it connected, but there's definitely a big change in this industry. It's cloud-to-client, it's driverless cars, it's IoT, it's 5G smartphones. There's no question that the opportunity in those markets is unmatched. I don't see anything else in semiconductors, quite frankly that would compare to it.","So we're really excited about that. And that's where you're hearing the dialogue and the conviction. Now, are there other things that could occur? Are there other potential partnerships or deals that could be made? Absolutely. And the balance sheet and the cash generation really gives us more and more options to do that. But day to day, we love what we do here, and there's just so much great opportunities in front of us.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you. And my quick follow-up, Kris, on the full year, could you \u2013 just for modeling purposes, how should we think about the OpEx trajectory and also CapEx? Thank you.","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure, so for OpEx, there's no change there. We've said in the past, we are keeping our OpEx on or about 13% to revenue. Of course, there will be some seasonal fluctuations quarter-to-quarter, but on a full-year basis, the target is 13% to revenue, so if you have double-digit top-line growth that allows us to make strategic events in R&D and sales and marketing to capture more value, which is out there in the market.","On CapEx, we are running high-single digits as a percent to revenue for CapEx in fiscal 2017, and you can expect the same in fiscal 2018. Here, again, we are making the strategic investments in our filter operation, not only expanding the capacity but also making technology investments to widen the scope of our technology. And a similar thing is going on in our back-end operation, capacity expansion, as well as technology investments that we are making.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you. Good luck.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Wills Miller - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. This is Wills Miller for Vivek. Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on the results.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Thank you.","Wills Miller - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess, first, if I look at your December quarter sales growth guidance, it seems a bit below seasonal. Can you just talk about the puts and takes there?","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","So, for December, we are guiding up 9% sequentially and up \u2013 sorry, for December, 7% sequentially and up 15% year-over-year. I think that's a pretty strong guidance. It's really hard to look at what is normal seasonality when you compare 2017 or 2016 or 2015. The last couple of years has not been really normal. So, again, 7% sequential, 15% year-over-year, I consider that a very strong guidance.","Wills Miller - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's helpful, thank you. And just a quick one. What was your largest customer as a percent of sales in the September quarter?","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","So our three largest customers has not changed, obviously. It's Foxconn, Samsung, and Huawei. And so on a full-year basis, our largest customer is in the high 30s, approaching 40% of total revenue. Samsung is in the low teens, and Huawei is on or about 10%.","Wills Miller - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Edward Snyder, Charter Equity. Please go ahead.","Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research","Thanks. Merced announced they went to Wi-Fi (28:07) each quarter there, which is an interesting development, given you guys have not done a lot of modules in that. I know a few, but not on this scale before. Just generally, what are the ASPs of those modules in the typical $1 to $4 range for Wi-Fi module? Are they more like SkyOne? And where are you in the design pipeline with that? Are you sampling and qualified, designed in) or in production?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","With respect to Wi-Fi modules, Ed, was that it?","Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research","Yes.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Okay. Yeah, I mean, we've been working higher and higher levels of integration with our Wi-Fi solutions from basically just single chip solutions to multi-mode devices to fully integrated systems. So we're along that curve right now. We have some customers that are deeply engaged and are looking forward to a complete module, which would definitely enhance the ASP. And then we have some other customers that are halfway there that still look at integration beyond just the chip level. So, it's a work in progress. I think one thing that does create tremendous advantage for Skyworks is our ability to integrate through Mexicali our package assembly and test, our ability to bring in filters now through our Panasonic deal, as well as our strength just at the chip level in Wi-Fi. So those elements are in place. It's just about bringing them together, harmonizing them and then bringing them to market.","Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research","And then, Kris, if I could, last year, you had high channel inventory going into the \u2013 in the second half of the year, and it kept you from seeing any real revenue from a legacy product at your largest customer. That's got to be a tailwind this year. Are we talking $10 million or $50 million? Can you give us a scale on that? And Liam, one more for you, there was a question about Broadcom and Qualcomm, I just want to follow up with that. Are you seeing any serious comp today right now in the market, are you seeing any serious competition or any competition at all from RF360 on the RF\/Analog side? By that, I mean, not the ET solution, which is tied to their base, and which they always claim is (30:00) RF360, but any components that you sell in the space, are you seeing anything from them?","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","So Ed, I'll take the first one on channel inventory, that is very much normal. It's not high, it's not low, it's right where it's supposed to be.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Right. And then on the RF360, Ed, we really haven't seen much of a change. I know there's efforts for that product across the globe, but we really haven't seen anything substantial.","Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research","So they're not really a serious competitor to you today?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Right.","Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research","Yeah. Thanks.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Mike Burton, Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Mike Burton - Longbow Research LLC","Thanks, and congrats on the strong September numbers. Looks like you had a lot of ramps across your customer base in September. Can you help us understand some of the pieces in the quarter a little better? You obviously had a ramp from your largest customer, but was Samsung and the China OEMs also up sequentially? And any color there for the September quarter, but also how you would expect them to trend into December would be helpful. Thanks.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, sure. Yeah, this was \u2013 Q4 was really kind of the early stages of launches for really the suite of top tier mobile players. And that will carry through in our strong December guidance here today. It's great to see diversification across a higher set of customers that are all kind of adopting now variations on DRx and variations on SkyOne and some of the other what would have been kind of classic analog type product, our switching products, some of our antenna tuning products, GPS. We're starting to see that portfolio really grow among the high tier. You saw a bit of it in the September quarter, and it really is kind of the leaders that will propel us here in the December quarter.","Mike Burton - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, and then sorry if I missed it, but as we look at gross margins heading into fiscal 2018, what are some of the puts and takes we should consider or how should we think about modeling that going forward? Thanks.","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, so we only guide one quarter at a time, and so we provide you with the guidance for the December quarter, 51% to 51.5%. And so, as I said in the prepared remarks, we're making good progress towards our target model of 53%, and so we'll, quarter after quarter, make further progress towards that target model.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christian Sayaka (32:33) with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, good afternoon, gentlemen. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I just want to first dig into the tax rate on this quarter. It clearly came in materially lower than your guidance. And I'm calculating it to roughly a 5% benefit to EPS this quarter. Can you just delve in a bit deeper as to what happened this quarter on that tax rate and where \u2013 and if we should expect this to flow through for fiscal 2018? Thanks.","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Right, so we did beat on an EPS line with $0.07, $0.02 of that was operational benefits, higher revenue, and $0.05 came from a lower tax rate. The tax rate came in at 11.1% in Q4, and on a full-year basis it was 12.8%. That's the non-GAAP tax rate. That tax rate came in slightly below what we expected as we did some fiscal year-end true-up calculations. And we had a slightly more favorable mix between our domestic and foreign income. And that drove a little bit of a lower tax rate for fiscal 2017.","For fiscal 2018, we provided guidance for Q1, 14.5%, and we also do expect on a full-year basis the tax rate to be on or about 14.5%. That obviously does not take into account any potential benefits from tax reform. It's too early to call that. But fiscal 2018 is slightly up from fiscal 2017, mainly as a result of a reduction in tax deductible stock-based compensation expenses.","Unknown Speaker","That's helpful, thank you. And then I just want to pivot back to the China market for a quick second. I've been hearing from some investors that there's actually been some de-specing going on in the RF content as you've seen some other pricing pressures from memory, display, so on and so forth. This is in clear contrast to what you guys are describing on the call right now and saying that you're seeing content increasing especially in the mid-end tiers. Can you maybe try and just, I guess, maybe try and describe if you have been seeing this trend in the market at all or maybe try and reconcile the differences from what I'm hearing to what you're saying? Thank you.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure, sure, yeah. Well, I mean, China is a very broad, broad market with a lot of companies, a lot of customers. There are some mid-tier and low-tier players that are selling on price, and maybe de-specing is a way to get there in lowering their prices. But what we are seeing is \u2013 and our focus has been on mid to high, and on that segment, we see a push for performance. We're also seeing more and more China players like Huawei that will build a global phone that will carry frequencies and content that can be used globally not just specifically to China. And again, the next set of players starting to move up, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi are also are moving up from, in some cases, a lower base of content. And there can be de-specing in other areas. It doesn't rule out that that possibility exists in certain markets and certain customers. A great deal of mid-tier and low-end phones, they get built in China, get exported to emerging markets that may not have the same demands for performance. So it's possible that could be happening. In the area of focus that Skyworks is interested in, we continue to see the performance push.","Unknown Speaker","Excellent. That's helpful. Thanks, guys.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis, B. Riley. Please go ahead.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question, and nice execution in the quarter, guys. Just a couple clarifications at this point. First, Kris, you mentioned that you expect internal filter sourcing to get up to 75%. Over what time period would you expect that to occur from where we are today at around 50%?","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","So we were at 50% a quarter ago, we are now somewhat halfway on towards our 75%. So we should be there in early 2018.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks. And then, Liam, oftentimes at this time of year, given the design win visibility which you have, which is around 18 months or so, you have a pretty good sense for where content is shaking out for the coming year. So the question is, one, can you just qualitatively speak to content gains that you've seen now that all the major handsets have been announced in the back half of the year? And two, what's the content gain potential for broad markets next year both in Tier 1s and in some of the lower tiers where it seems like there's a good mix-up dynamic playing out to your favor?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure, that makes sense. Yeah, so this is what we're seeing. And we have pretty good visibility now with the players. There's definitely going to be some early elements of 5G stepping into this market by 2018 into 2019. We talked a lot about 5G here in the opening comments, and as you know, this will be kind of additive to existing 3G and 4G engines. So you could have connectivity solutions, 3G, 4G, and then augmented with new content around 5G, new frequencies, new filtering, and in many cases, MIMO implementation as well.","So there's a great opportunity there. It will take a while before it's fully implemented, but that is on the roadmap today. It's going to be a big driver on the mobile side. When you look at IoT, Craig, what we're seeing is a couple things. We're seeing a much broader proliferation now with more and more applications that we're able to address, whether it's with a Wi-Fi device or a Bluetooth device or embedding GPS for location, we're getting a broader set of applications. And we're also starting to see applications that we've already had step up through an upgrade. For example, smart watches that now carry cellular technology or a streaming media device that was a 2x2 MIMO for Wi-Fi that now carries nine streams of Wi-Fi to enhance speed and data rate. So, it's really twofold. It's the continuation of broadening the IoT reach, and then there's kind of the upgrade cycle within the IoT applications. So all that is opportunities for us looking forward.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. A couple of clarifications, I guess, just starting with that 5G topic. When do you think that'll be meaningful, Liam? And then before we get to 5G, obviously 4G premium has been driving your content for such a long time. What are the incremental content opportunities within 4G in the premium segment? I mean, do you think we'll continue to see tailwinds for content here before we get to 5G or do we take a little bit of a pause and then a step function increase when we go to 5G?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure, no, that's a great question. So I think we're going to see a continuation here as we evolve from 4G to 5G. It won't be necessarily a step function, and I don't think we'll see a pause. And within each opportunity or each customer, they have their own story. I think that the winners in this market are the ones that are adopting performance-driven technology, customers that are adopting DRx-like systems that greatly enhance the downlink speed. We're seeing applications where we could have two or three DRx modules on the receive chain. That's really mirroring what we've been doing in transmit with SkyOne, low, mid, and high band. And most of our customers are somewhere along that continuum from a couple of modules to five or six modules.","So there's a lot of work that we can do in 4G to grow our content and grow our business by populating existing customers with new technology and then also winning with some new accounts within mobile. And then when you look at 5G from an IoT perspective, one of the big, big drivers is creating that network capacity that can handle all of these devices. There's just going to be such a dispersion of devices, up to 25 billion or so by 2020 that we're going to need a new network to deliver those frequencies and deliver that data. So that's just another opportunity for connectivity through a number of different protocols, it could be Wi-Fi, it could be ZigBee, it could be cellular. But there's really going to be quite a massive upgrade cycle in the IoT space as well.","Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thanks for that clarification. And then one \u2013 another clarification on the M&A front. You talked a little bit about diversification, but I guess, in the past, you did try to diversify a few years ago. That didn't work out. Given the strong balance sheet as well as the strong cash flow you're generating, maybe you could remind us what your M&A strategy is going forward. And if you don't find attractive opportunities out there, what are the plans with the cash? And what are the cash usage priorities?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure, sure. Yeah, as I said earlier, we really do feel great about the outlook in the business that we're pursuing and the markets that we're pursuing. At the same time, we're up for diversification as long as it enhances the franchise. We're not as interested in things that are just totally adjacent on a different vector to diversify the portfolio. So, we got a great management team, we know how to enhance businesses, we've done a few deals that have turned out fantastic for us. Our joint venture with Panasonic, which is now a wholly-owned entity in Japan, has brought tremendous filtering technology. We did a deal for Wi-Fi with SiGe in 2012. That's been a home run. So the deals that we do are very careful and thought through, and we want our team to be able to execute on the entity that comes in. We'll continue to have that kind of a mindset as we look at potential opportunities going forward.","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, let me just remind you, we have $1.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Half of that is onshore, half of that is offshore. We do have a very strong cash innovation capability with a free cash flow margin of 30%, 30-plus percent, but keep in mind that half of that cash is being generated onshore, half of the cash is being generated offshore. And so currently, our stated goal is to return 40% to 50% of that total free cash flow back to the shareholders through our dividend program and share buyback program. Actually, last year, we did 55% of total free cash flow, which means 100% of all the onshore cash generation was returned back to the shareholder. And we will continue to execute along that strategy.","Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, thank you. Just wanted to follow up on the topic of gross margins, and just given some of the recent trajectories there, your target of 53%, do you think it's just a matter of maybe it takes you longer to get there or how do you kind of frame the bridge to today and timeline of getting to 53%?","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, no, we \u2013 first of all, we've never specified a timeline where we said we will continue to make quarter-after-quarter progress towards that target. And so, we continue to do so. I said we did 30 basis point in June, 30 basis point in September, we expect to do anywhere between 0 to 50 basis points in December. And so, it's a lot of hard work, but we continue to add more value in our products, in our solutions and at the same time continue to drive down the cost. And a combination of that will help us to get to that 53% gross margin.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, Craig, and the other thing just to keep in mind is that as our business is moving more and more towards these highly integrated, unique, custom solutions, the margins benefit. It's not only fewer competitors, but we're getting paid for the value-add, the engineer-to-engineer work, working within our customers' ecosystem to cement these really challenging \u2013 resolving these really challenging problems with elegant, some integrated solutions. So that's a theme that will continue. If we look out into 5G and some of these more complex markets, that's really going to be the strike zone of what we do at Skyworks. So we should be able to see margin benefit from that, in addition to looking within the company internally to become a more efficient operator.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks. And Liam, as a follow-up, as you think through 5G, you mentioned some early phase coming in, just even intermediate term, are there particular areas that excite you that from an R&D perspective, you'd look to be more opportunistic in terms of how you're evaluating where you're spending R&D?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, no, absolutely, I think couple things. You're going to see a wide range of new frequencies that will come about above 3 gigahertz, up to 6 gigahertz and beyond. That's going to create tremendous filtering opportunities. There's also some topology shifts from today, a 4G world, which is largely FDD, frequency-division duplexing. In 5G, a great deal of the frequencies will be in a TDD zone, time division, so our TC SAW product can play very, very well, even on high frequencies there. And then the level of integration and the amount of noise and interference within these modules, within these handsets is going to be unbelievable. And that requires very crafty solutions from companies like Skyworks to resolve it. So it's going to create a tremendous benefit to the consumer and a great uptake in speed and improvement in latency, but a lot of challenge for players like Skyworks. So we're looking forward to that.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Yeah, hi, guys. Just on the SAW, TC SAW, I was wondering if you could give some color of how your fiscal 2017 grew year-on-year from a SAW, TC SAW perspective, and how would you see fiscal 2018 given the cadence of 5G TDD? Thanks.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure. Yeah, well, we don't \u2013 as you may know, we don't sell any of that product discretely, so there's no specific revenue tied to SAW or TC SAW directly. However, you can certainly intimate that we are moving our portfolio up in frequency. We're leveraging our TC SAW now to 2.5 gig and potentially higher over the next couple of quarters. We're looking at all the different nuances in 5G. Again, I've mentioned FDD has a certain standard. TDD has a certain standard. There's implications for filtering. There's implications for switching and how we handle our SkyOne and DRx solutions.","All that will come together. I think the important point though is that we have that flexibility, we have a very broad portfolio, all the way from gallium arsenide to switching to packaging and tests in Mexicali, selecting our own filters in-house. And occasionally, if we need to partner with whether it's a filter vendor or a strategic supplier for silicon, we have that in place. So it's going to be all about flexibility and managing the various configurations that we may see with our customers so as these 5G challenges build.","Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Got it. And if you look at fiscal 2018, if you were to prioritize between the carrier aggregation picking up or .11ax or TDD for 5G, how do you look at what the drivers were for fiscal 2018 from the RF side?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, well, I mean, carrier aggregation is kind of in the middle innings right now and continuing to grow. And that's a sure thing. I mean, there's no question about the adoption on that. It's very hot and it's let get it done as fast as we can. 11ax is a relatively new standard in Wi-Fi. It has tremendous benefits in speed and performance. We'll be there. I think it's really about how that rolls through access points and routers and other end user applications for the most part, so I think those are important. And then the filtering that we discussed, we'll continue to add to our portfolio filters, stretch the frequencies a bit, improve the yields within our factories, and try to grow that through a number of customers.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks very much. In your mobile products division, what areas do you think offer the most \u2013 what types of products offer the most opportunity for content increases in handsets? And where are you investing to build products?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure, yeah. What we're seeing, again, is the mid-tier players that want to grow into high global Tier 1s or global Tier 2 brands. Huawei was a great example. Names like Oppo and Vivo are great examples. We're seeing companies like Samsung that have a great high-end portfolio, still hundreds of millions of phones that are in mid-tier that were moving up. And so the way that we're doing it is really to provide enhancements in our transmit chain solutions, which would be our SkyOne product line, trying to give them more output power and create a more efficient solution.","We're working hard with our DRx solutions, which have been adopted by some strategic customers that have realized great benefit in improving downlink performance. That technology has not been fully populated so there's quite a bit of opportunity for us to go out and submit new wins there. And then you look at some technologies like Wi-Fi and power management, we have great product and our adoption rate has not been substantial through certain markets and is growing. So we're seeing more and more Wi-Fi now embedded in smartphones throughout Asia, the U.S. has been pretty solid. And we're starting to see just some more advancements in our power portfolio. So all of that is coming together. We look at a name like Huawei, on the Mate 10 phone, where we have $9 or more of content. That's kind of the benchmark that we'd want to see across the entire mobile space.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Okay.

This call is being recorded.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Mitch Haws, Vice President of Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Haws, please go ahead.","Mitch Haws","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' First Fiscal Quarter 2017 Conference Call. With me on the call today are Liam Griffin, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Kris Sennesael, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our discussion will include statements relating to future results and expectations that are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Please refer to our earnings press release and recent SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for information on certain risks that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially and adversely from any forward-looking statements made today.","Additionally, the results and guidance we will discuss today are non-GAAP financial measures, consistent with our past practices. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.","With that, I'll turn the call to Liam.","Liam Griffin","Thanks, Mitch, and welcome, everyone. The Skyworks team delivered exceptional results in the December quarter. Let me begin with a few highlights.","We achieved revenue of $914 million, up 9.4% sequentially and above our guidance range. We expanded gross margins to 51.2% and operating margins to 38.8%, illustrating strong operational execution and prudent expense management.","We produced record earnings per share of $1.61, $0.03 better than our guidance and perhaps most importantly, we generated nearly $0.5 billion in cash flow from operations in the quarter, another record for Skyworks.","In addition to our strong P&L and balance sheet performance, I am especially pleased with our design win execution, particularly at marquee customers. Of note, we secured SkyOne platform wins with multiple Tier 1 Sky OEMs, extended our leadership position in diversity received systems and secured a key win in our custom high band PAD portfolio.","We ramped fully integrated fully integrated low, mid and high band solutions integrating SkyBlue technology for Huawei's Mate9 platform, their flagship phone. We launched multiple devices across Samsung's entire portfolio and gained momentum in China, with key wins at market leaders Oppo, Vivo, Meizu and Xiaomi.","All of these wins were captured by resulting the growing complexity and performance requirements inherent in today's advanced mobile architectures. Specifically, we're seeing the continued shift to highly integrated transmit solutions, leveraging our core capabilities in gallium arsenide, temperature compensated SAW filtering and enhanced power management.","In addition, we are benefiting from the rapid move toward carrier aggregation, a major catalyst in driving higher data rates with expanding bandwidth in both uplink and downlink transmission. In parallel, we continue to expand our opportunity by growing our content reach with new revolutionary diversity receive systems, specifically targeted at the most complex carrier aggregation challenges, as well as a growing suite of analog solutions from Wi-Fi, GPS, antenna tuning, signal conditioning and more.","Now moving on to our broad markets portfolio and IOT. We expanded our design win pipeline to include wins with Netgear home security system, ARRIS cable modems as well as Comcast and Rogers with carrier-grade broadband gateways.","In addition, we secured design win supporting the latest voice assistant technology from Amazon, Google and Microsoft. We also capitalized on the newest trend towards home Wi-Fi mesh networking, with key wins at Linksys, Ubiquiti Networks and other leading OEMs.","And finally, we broadened our footprint across the automotive sector, leveraging the diverse array of wireless protocols supporting connected car applications, vehicle to vehicle communication and 4G telematics.","In this past quarter, we were pleased to have consummated a strategic design win at a leading U.S. electric car OEM. Our Q1 results, strong outlook and design win momentum reflect solid tracks in spanning out mobile, IOT and broad market portfolio.","The success we are demonstrating is part of a secular multiyear fee and we are still in the early innings. At a higher level, Skyworks is at the epicenter of a sea change in mobility. Our end markets are driving a substantial move from brick-and-mortar to a rapidly growing mobile economy.","This trend places an unprecedented burden on analog RF and mix signal performance, vastly increasing the value and utility of our solutions. It's compelling to see how many different avenues mobile technology now supports, whether it's streaming 4K video, social media, mobile payment or rapidly evolving areas such as augmented reality, virtual assistance and the connected car.","Popular apps including Facebook, Uber, Netflix YouTube, Spotify, and Wave, all share key characteristics. They require ultrafast, low latency highly secure and efficient connectivity, as well as location-based services. These challenging needs are invariably facilitated by an integrated Skyworks engine. Importantly, we uniquely support all the wireless protocols enabling these diverse applications including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, GPS and LTE.","Further 5G represents a massive growth opportunity for our industry and certainly for Skyworks. In fact, market projection suggest 5G data rates will approach 10X the speed of card 4G and LTE solutions. To put this in perspective, downloading a full-length HD movie in 3G took one day. In 4G, the same file took minutes. On a 5G network, this content will be downloaded in mere seconds. At the same time, the connected car is yet another catalyst that offers significant opportunity for Skyworks.","Looking out over the next years, the amount of data that will be delivered to and from the car is estimated to be 5 to 10 times more than the bandwidth used by today's smartphone. For instance, by 2020, a single autonomous car is expected to consume 4,000 gigabits of data per day and real-time diagnostics, positioning, vehicle-to-vehicle communications and that's equivalent to the daily data consumed by more than 2,000 smartphone users in 2017.","Skyworks is uniquely positioned to capitalize with solutions that solve all of these daunting connectivity challenges, setting the stage for outperformance across cars and new markets.","With that, I will turn the call over to Kris for review of our financial results and Q2 outlook.","Kris Sennesael","Thanks Liam. The revenue for the first fiscal quarter was $914 million. up 9.4% sequentially and exceeding our guidance and consensus estimates. Gross profit was $468 million or 51.2% of revenue and operating expenses were $113 million. As a result, we generated $354 million of operating income, translating into 38.8% of operating margin.","Our tax rate was 14.7%, driving net income of $302 million or $0.01 -- $1.61 of diluted earnings per share, exceeding our guidance by $0.03.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, cash flow from operations was a record $496 million, driven by higher profitability and ongoing improvements in working capital. In particular, DSOs declined from 45 to 37 days, while days of inventory declined from 94 to 86 days.","Improvements in overall working capital generated over $100 million of cash flow in Q1. Capital expenditures were $50 million about 5% of revenue and in line with our target model. Further in Q1 we repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock at an average price of roughly $76. Finally, we ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $1.35 billion from $1.8 billion at the end of Q4.","Now moving to our outlook for fiscal Q2. For the second quarter of 2017, we anticipate our revenue to be $840 million. up about 8% compared to Q2 of last year. At this revenue level, we expect gross margins to be in the low 50% range with operating expenses of approximately $115 million as we continue to invest in grow initiatives, including our IOT business.","Below the line, we anticipate roughly $0.5 million in interest and other expense and a tax rate of approximately 15%. We expect our share count to be roughly 186 million shares. Accordingly, we plan to generate earnings per share of $1.40 in the second quarter up 12% year-over-year.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Liam.","Liam Griffin","Thank you, Kris. As our first quarter results and outlook illustrate, we are off to a strong start in fiscal 2017. We delivered solid revenue and earnings, set a record for EPS and quarterly cash flow, while guiding about March quarter consensus estimates. Our profitability and increasingly strong cash generation is allowing us to fund growth and deliver higher returns to our shareholders.","In fact, the new $500 million share buyback authorization announced today reflects the confidence of both the executive team and our Board with respect to our strategic outlook. Skyworks' systems level expertise, operational scale and deep customer engagement are enabling us to capitalize on the rapidly expanding mobile and IOT ecosystems, while positioning us for 5G leadership.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's set the lines up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] The first question will come from the line of Harsh Kumar with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Harsh Kumar","Yes. Hey, congratulations. Tremendous quarter and guide. Liam, let me ask you. At this time, usually in the year there's a lot of movement and a lot of concern amongst investors about the end markets and the different geos. Would you be able to comment for us on where the inventory stand and what you are able to see in the marketplace at this time?","Liam Griffin","Sure Harsh. For us right now, the market backdrop looks quite good and we continue to see an increasing push in mobile for higher complexity, higher performance and that for us as you know translates into opportunity. It's not all with one or two accounts. We're starting to see some great penetration with leaders in China.","We mentioned Huawei, certainly large players in the U.S., large players in Korea are all exhibiting that. And then in parallel and we talked about this for a while, but it's really coming together nicely that our broad business, our broad market portfolio continues to grow.","Looking at a year-over-year basis, we're reporting a 10% to 15% year-over-year growth rate with that opportunity and that providers just another boost for us in terms of topline.","Harsh Kumar","And Liam as my follow-up, would you be able to tell us what your largest customer was as a percentage of revenues?","Liam Griffin","It was slightly above 40%.","Harsh Kumar","Thanks guys. Congrats again.","Liam Griffin","Thanks, Harsh.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Blayne Curtis","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question and I'll echo the nice results. Liam, maybe just as you talked about your happy with design progress at marquee customers. Maybe as you look at the rest of the year, where do you see the biggest opportunity gain content adding color by product or by customer region would be helpful.","Liam Griffin","Sure Blayne. What we're seeing is very good success in keeping pace with our core architecture SkyOne architecture, switching architectures, but we're now augmenting this with new technology and kind of what I call an expanding product reach doing great work in carrier aggregation, both uplink and downlink.","We have some unique solutions that we really pioneered in the industry around downlink receipt side, addressing CA and the complexities. We're taking that kind of an engine and pushing that forward to names like Huawei and names like Samsung and some of the other China players.","Our GPS technology is getting adopted now on a quite consistent basis. Wi-Fi has been moving to MIMO architectures in mobile and also in some of the broader markets. So, it's really quiet a mix and what I am really pleased about is our ability, our team's ability to look long at these challenges in mobile and then architect very unique solutions with customer\u2019s hand-in-hand to finally deliver what makes Skyworks special. So, we see that trend continuing.","Blayne Curtis","Thanks Liam. I just wanted to ask on the gross margin, I know it's seasonally weak this period, down a 100 basis points. If you can just talk about the puts and takes and then maybe your outlook for margins for the rest of the year.","Liam Griffin","Yeah absolutely. So first of all, I'm pleased with our execution in Q1 with gross margin coming in at 51.2%. Looking at Q2 obviously, this is a seasonality softer quarter with revenue down approximately $74 million, $75 million and so that you can see reflecting into the gross margin.","Having said that, we are feeling -- we're very well positioned for further margin expansion in the second half of 2017 as we expect the next three quarters to see sequential revenue growth going forward.","Blayne Curtis","Thanks so much.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question. Just one more on gross margins pressure if I could. When I look at last year, there was a bigger revenue drop from December to March and I believe gross margins declined about 60 basis points. I think this time you're guiding to somewhat higher decline in gross margins.","Is it just prudent factory management, utilization management, what is giving a bigger hit to gross margin this time versus last year?","Kris Sennesael","Yes so, we're talking here a couple basis points right. And so we will see where we come in with the actual of Q2, but it's definitely so that last year there was some inventory build, but now for the last two quarters in a row, we have been working on an inventory reduction program.","Again, it's all about the same level of gross margins as it's important for us to go and further drive gross margin expansion in the second half of 2017 as we see to strengthen the business and the revenue growth coming in.","Liam Griffin","Yes, and let me add to that Vivek. We were very confident that as Kris articulated, as we stepped through the second half fiscal and second half calendar year, you're going to see revenue and margin step up. So, we're committed to continuing that path.","Vivek Arya","Got it. And as my follow-up Liam, if you could just give us the breakdown you usually give between the different product lines and integrated mobile broad markets etcetera, but the bigger question is you gave a lot of detail around your IOT and automotive wins.","When I go back to the 10K you had filed, outside of Apple, your sales grew about 8% last year or so. So, I am just wondering how are your sales doing outside of Apple in December and in March? If you could just give us some color what your design win and progress has been outside of that large customer, whether it's my product or segmented or what have you, thank you?","Liam Griffin","Sure, our growth and success outside of our largest customers has been outstanding. Huawei became the number two account for us this last quarter. They're going to continue to be one of our leaders. We have our customer in Korea, who will continue to grow significantly into 2017 and our largest customers will set up very well for us as well as we address some very complex architectures with compelling products. So, we feel really good about that on the mobile side.","And then let me remind you that the broad market portfolio from the infrastructure to IOT to early stages of automotive, all look good and the staff there are double-digit year-over-year.","Vivek Arya","Thank you.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of John Vinh with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.","John Vinh","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. My question is can you talk about what your expectations for the RF TAM growth for the industry and the flagship smartphone this year and maybe talk about what your expectations of growth is relative to that TAM? I know historically you've talked about that TAM growing at a 10% to 15% CAGR?","Liam Griffin","Sure John. I think part of the driver there as you probably know is just really the upgrade cycle across the Board. So, you have your most developed accounts that will be moving up with higher levels of complexity, bringing in more complex EA architectures, maybe even going MIMO on the radio potentially that's out there.","And then you have your value tier players that are moving up maybe at a higher rate percentagewise, but haven't quite hit the dollar value of the top tier. So, we address all of that. We're not a player that spends much time with the 2G or 3G market. So, the segments that we address, we think it is a double-digit tam opportunity.","One of the things that we've been going at Skyworks is we continue to innovate and elevate our portfolio. So, these products today that we're selling and enjoying share gains, that just didn't exist three or four years ago. So, we're continuing to push the envelope. There is also a lot of technology that flows between mobile and IOT. Our very strong portfolio and Wi-Fi, we have a Bluetooth portable. We have a GPS portfolio. None of that is really part of the traditional RF TAM, but it matters.","Our SkyBlue technology for power management is becoming more and more pivotal for us in design wins. So, it's really a broadening suite. In overall TAM, probably 10% to 12%, but I think we have some unique opportunities to address it in our portfolio.","John Vinh","Great. Thank you. And my follow-up question is on 5G. Liam, you seem to be very optimistic about your prospects in 5G. If I look at some of the initial frequencies being discussed in 5G, they tend to be much higher than what we've even seen at 4G. Can you just break down the opportunities for you to benefit from content growth in 5G? And also, maybe can you talk about the role of TC-SAW within 5G given the higher frequencies?","Liam Griffin","Yeah absolutely. So 5G is really going to be a game changer for the space. It could present up to 10 times the date rate that we see today in 4G. There are these three big themes when you look at 5G, you try to create a faster data pipe, lower latency, more efficient. It's about increasing bandwidth which is going to drive carrier aggregation of the click, higher modulation schemes that you're going from 256 QAM maybe to 1024 higher density as complexity.","There is MIMO architectures that will scratch that pipe. All of these themes are very important and if you think about frequency for it John, if you move up to some of these higher frequencies in 5G, they are very often TDD modulation, so time division duplex and TDD requires band pass filtering. It doesn\u2019t require duplex or so. We have a unique opportunity there to stretch our TC socket with only too higher frequencies in a TDD domain and gain additional share.","John Vinh","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes. Thank you. Question on growth this year, as you look through, can you give us some sense in terms of whether it's that leading smartphone OEMs in North America and Korea versus China, kind of where you think your growth will skew in 2017?","Liam Griffin","Sure, Craig. Yes, the growth should span across our larger customers. It should also span across kind of what I would consider a value Tier portfolio, the Oppo and Vivo and maybe to a lesser extent Meizu and Xiaomi moving up.","Huawei, we mentioned today is now a clear number two customer for us. They have really stepped up in terms of the content, the richness of content and the reach of technology, providing opportunity for us to deliver mid-band, high-band, low-band solutions, power management, diversity receive, addressed CA uplink and downlink.","So, we see a great opportunity with the value tier moving up and then the high tier actually increasing their content. Those are the important themes. And then the additional in parallel opportunities in broad markets continue to span and we expect double-digit growth there for the foreseeable future.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. And then as my follow-up on the buyback announcement, can you put that into the context in terms of as you evaluate internal growth opportunities and also just M&A in the industry?","Kris Sennesael","Yes, we are definitely committed to continue to return cash to the shareholder with our dividend program and our share buyback program. We returned $106 million in Q1 repurchasing 1.4 million shares in Q1 and saw -- we have now put in place a new $500 million program. Historically, we have been returning 40%, 50% of our free cash flow to the shareholders and so that's something that we will continue to do so.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Steve Smigie","Great. Thanks a lot, guys. You guys have been seeing pretty good dollar content gain on flagship phones. I think around order of about 20% and maybe address this a little bit, but I was hoping you could talk a little bit about if you expect to continue to see 20% growth, dollar content growth across flagships.","But also. I wanted to drill down on the midrange phones where it seems like there is a lot of opportunity. Could you see 20% growth at this point on midrange phones or is it -- should we be looking at a different relative growth?","Liam Griffin","Yes, sure. Both sides of the equation there are critical for us. Certainly, flagship phones and what we're seeing there is really a great opportunity -- actually we're really happy about it as we talked a lot about this technology and this ecosystem within mobile and that tremendous ecosystem, all these great applications that we enjoy driving change in hardware and it's happening.","And each year every customer has different cycles, but every success of generation of smartphone technology that we address has had increasing burden, increasing challenge and increasing opportunity for Skyworks. That's what drives the content for us.","We've also been able to push our reach. We're moving the areas within this technology, new areas to enjoy further gain. So, we feel really good about that trend continuing. Our teams are doing a phenomenal job right now with the most critical customers, with the smartest people on the customer end and in Skyworks to make sure that that happens.","So, that's going to be big part of the story. But in parallel you hit on the other key point. There's a tremendous volume of mid value tier players producing smartphones today that haven't yet enjoyed that big step up in performance.","And if you look at Huawei as a case study, we've worked with them for many, many years and had a great relationship and been involving just about every platform and the big swing for us is when finally, the technology and PAD technology in power management ad Wi-Fi and some of these complex system were adopted the revenue accelerated. There's a value tier today that's significant that hasn\u2019t yet made that movement. We're going to work very closely to make that happen with them.","Steve Smigie","Okay. Great. And I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about China overall as a percentage. Huawei has shut up a lot and so I was wondering if you could still quantify say China on its own as a percent as a bucket, and may be with and without Huawei and then if you're willing what Samsung was as a percentage of revenue in the quarter?","Liam Griffin","Sure. Well, China all in for us is about 25% of revenue and it\u2019s not just mobile. We have a pretty strong infrastructure position in China across Huawei, across ZTE and others. The mobile business is strong and then there is some other broad market portfolios there. So, it\u2019s about 20%, 25% of the revenues there and what was the second part of the question?","Kris Sennesael","It was on the Samsung, so Samsung just fell below the 10% level and we all know why that is. But we see a nice bounce back of the Samsung business already starting in Q2 and in the second half of 2017.","Steve Smigie","Okay. Thanks, and congrats on the good quarter.","Liam Griffin","Thank you.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Please go ahead.","Ambrish Srivastava","Hi, thank you. I wanted to focus on the free cash flow, last couple of quarters so now this is two quarters in a row, your free cash flow margin has gone up to 50% and you laid out. thanks for laying out the contribution from the working capital levers that you were able to put. The question is, how should we think about what is the steady-state free cash flow margin profile for the company, because it has jumped up significantly?","And then second kind of tied to that and I am not sure if you answered the question that was asked earlier how to think about the buyback that you just announced vis-\u00e0-vis your appetite for M&A. Is that the sign that you're more comfortable in the business and returning shareholder value just via that or it's a sign of that plus the fact that you're now generating enough cash that you can make an acquisition as well as follow the step? Thank you.","Kris Sennesael","So, I\u2019ll take the first part on free cash flow and I'm really happy with the performance there, especially in Q1. We\u2019ve almost $0.5 billion of cash flow from operations. We have been focusing very strongly on working capital management driving down DSOs, driving down days of inventory and so that has helped a lot in the quarter.","We're at the level right now that there is not a lot of improvement from that level now and so you won't see a repeat of those further improvements in working capital. But having said that, when you look at our business model, we will continue to generate a ton of cash every quarter going forward.","Liam Griffin","With respect to the M&A element there, just to remind everyone, we are very focused on our core franchising connectivity. It's a significant market. There is a great deal of investment going forward there that has turned to be profitable for us and fruitful for us.","But at the same time, we do evaluate M&A opportunities. We look at a lot of potential transactions. We have a very high bar with our financial consideration on that end. But we keep an open mind. We announced the 500 million shares repurchase program here today and we certainly have the opportunity if the right deal comes about to exercise an M&A transaction.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham. Please go ahead.","Quinn Bolton","Hi, guys, let me add my congratulations. Liam, just wanted to first ask the guidance was better than seasonal trend, what do you attribute that to? Is it sort of dollar content gains on the platforms? Is it the end of the inventory reduction program you mentioned earlier on the call?","Liam Griffin","Yes absolutely, it's really about our ability to outperform on design wins that were consummated kind of in the middle of the prior year and now flowing forward. So, we were really excited about that the content reach again is expanding.","We\u2019re engaging more and more with fully integrated SkyOne Solutions rather than power amplifiers and filter separated. The carrier aggregation products that we put forward and diversity received are quite compelling in the market and then again, the roster of IOT accounts that we\u2019re bringing forward continues to grow and the content within those applications where maybe we had -- we started with a single Wi-Fi device. Now we have 3x3 devices.","We\u2019re embedding GPS more and more. We got Bluetooth opportunity. So, the whole spectrum is expanded. And as we look at March, we feel very good about our guidance there as Kris indicated. Backlog coverage is solid. We\u2019re fully booked and it\u2019s a very balanced quarter as well.","Quinn Bolton","Great and then a follow-up, just you mentioned on the prepared comments a couple of high-band pad wins, a scenario you\u2019ve been underpenetrated. What's your outlook for that business going forward and can you comment whether those are using outsourced pass filters or are you starting to be able to source some of those filters in the high band with TC-SAW internal capacity?","Liam Griffin","Yes, sure, sure, great question. Well as know, when we go to market, our strategy is to sell a system solution. So, it input to output performance. So, it incorporates our highly customized and curated gallium arsenide technology, unique filtering technology, SOI packaging, testing. The whole engine is really a Skyworks signature and within that engine, we select the best process and the in best technology to deliver what our customers want and outperform technically.","So, this is not the first high band win. We have been clocking and clicking design wins here for a while. This one was meaningful for us. It did move us up to some higher frequencies above 3 gigahertz and let me also remind you and I answered the question earlier that in some of these domains, there is a need for a TDD Time Division Duplexing versus FDD, Frequency Division and that can change the technology curve and the selection as well.","So, it will continue to grow in that space. We\u2019ll continue to grow in mid band. We\u2019ll continue to move our TC technology up higher and continue to lead in low band as well.","Quinn Bolton","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Timothy Arcuri","Thank you. I guess the first question, you did not answer before, revenue breakout by broad market mobile and PA, and then I had another question.","Kris Sennesael","Yes, so the broad market was approximately 25% of total revenue. Mobile was slightly above 60% and so the rest power amplifier is slightly below 15%.","Timothy Arcuri","Great. Thank you and then just a follow up on BAW and given the trend in carrier ag to have front-end that are going to cover a mix of high end low bands, is there a trigger point where you guys are obviously bullish on TC-SAW, but is there a trigger point where you decide you have to invest to add captive BAW and if so, what is that? I\u2019m just wondering how you think about the decision to sort BAW on a merchant basis or to invest in it captively. Thanks.","Liam Griffin","Sure, well let me start with you mentioned carrier aggregation. We have an incredible portfolio in carrier aggregation. It nothing to do with BAW. We can use TC-SAW. We can use other capabilities, organic capabilities and we're a market leader there without question. Looking now, there are opportunities where a higher frequency, high performance BAW filtering makes a lot of sense, but we don\u2019t sell discrete devices.","So, our plan is to try to create the best engine, the best complete sub system that meets our customer's needs. In many cases, we can do it with our organic technology. We do have a path foundry partners to bring in BAW within our modules if needed. Our TC-SAW capabilities continue to improve and if you look at spectrum, the most crowded spectrum is in the lower frequency bands. 700 meg up to 1.1 gig, very, very crowded.","TC-SAW capabilities are ideal. Bulk acoustic wave can\u2019t play at those lower frequencies and anywhere some frequencies that are very high with extremely high performance needs where BAW\u2019s critical. So, we\u2019re not hindered by any of that. I think we feel very comfortable with our outlook. We have a lot of great technology choices.","And if you look across the peer group, there are some players in our space that don\u2019t in-house gallium arsenide. They go to foundry partners. So, it's not uncommon to have a few points of technology where you outsource in partner and we do that on occasion, but invariably, we use our own organic products.","Timothy Arcuri","Thank you.","Operator","Next question, we'll go to the line of Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","Cody Acree","Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the progress. Liam, may be if I can say that last question another way, I guess can you just talk about your filter roadmap, your capacity plans, you had talked or maybe your predecessor had talked previously about specifically getting into BAW capability and I guess with those foundry partners in BAW, are you capacity constraint or are you limited as to some of those sockets you can get into just from a market availability?","Liam Griffin","Sure, sure well let me start with the organic product line. So, we have a really strong competitive left in with our TC-SAW facility, SAW Japan as you may remember, this came about through our joint venture with Panasonic, which is now wholly owned entity with Skyworks.","And we have capacity to do about 3 billion units of TC-SAW per year and we have room right now. We're not a full utilization, but we have a really strong pipeline going forward that\u2019s going to enjoy the benefit of those filters.","If you look at what we can do, it's just really again, it depends on the customers' need, it depends on whether you are in a frequency duplexing domain or a time division duplexing domain. There is nuisances there and so we try to match the best complete system with the customer need. We do have BAW, we're completely aware of BAW acoustic wave technology and what it can and can't do. We have strong partners right now that we can bring it in on a foundry basis.","We continue to look within the walls of our company to do it organically or construct devices that are just as competitive organically. Some of that is TDD. What I'll tell you today we enjoy a robust opportunity with the filtering we have today augmented by our gallium arsenide or switching our packaging and our complete systems focus.","Cody Acree","And then Kris maybe on the OpEx side, you constrained spending to this last year where revenue was in decline, but it sounds like you are getting right back into a bid of spending on IoT and other areas. Can you talk about where you're spending and what your plans are for this year?","Kris Sennesael","Yes, absolutely. So Q1 came in at $113 million up $6 million from Q4, but keep in mind that we started accruing for incentives again and so going forward, we target to have our OpEx on or about 13% of revenue.","So, you will continue to see some modest increases quarter-over-quarter there as well. 13% is actually I believe world class and so I feel good about that level of investments that we make. We definitely make sure that we continue to make the necessary investments to further diversify the business in the broader market in IoT and we won't hesitate to make those investments.","Cody Acree","Thanks. Congrats.","Kris Sennesael","Thank you.","Operator","Next, we'll go to line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Toshiya Hari","Great. Thanks for taking my question. My first one is on China and I was hoping you could provide a little bit more detail on what trends you saw in fiscal Q1? If you can provide kind of a year-over-year number that would be great. And also, if you can talk about your expectations for fiscal Q2, again specific to China? And then on inventory, how comfortable are you today in terms of inventory in China both in the supply chain and also in retail?","Liam Griffin","Sure, sure, well, China of course is a meaningful growth driver for Skyworks. I mentioned earlier on the call it's about 25% of our revenue all in. And it's a market that consumes and exports, right. We have a lot of Tier 1 players that are moving up and inside Huawei and then it's an export market as well and we can enjoy both sides of that.","One of the things that has helped us in China is having a strong baseband partnerships, very tight coupling with Hisilicon captive to Huawei today. Also, a lengthy relationship with MediaTek and MediaTek is really in route now to move towards higher levels of integration adopting SkyOne like structures from Skyworks that's a big pop and names like Oppo and Vivo continue to look strong for us.","We don't do much at all with the 3G and 2G white box markets. So, our revenue is really driven around the market leaders. And I'll tell you that right now Huawei is the one that's really stepping up in content and the others are moving along that curve. So, I think there is going to be some upgrade opportunities within 4G with some of the mid and value tier players within China.","Kris Sennesael","And so, on your second question on inventory in the channel, we actually feel very good about the level of inventory in the channel. Most if not all of the inventory that we had with our largest customer has been consummated and so we don't see any issue in terms of inventory in the channel.","Liam Griffin","Right and that's China as well, so that's global in China specifically.","Toshiya Hari","Okay. Great. And then as my follow-up, I had a question on your production ramp in Japan. I guess I am curious which inning are we in the ramp and what are the implications for gross margins going forward as we continue to ramp that facility?","Liam Griffin","Yes, the facility has several innings of opportunity ahead. It continues to be competitive weapon. And we've got our growing list of customers and expanding set of new frequencies that we're going to be addressing. So, it continues to be an important weapon.","I believe right now if we look at our outlook, we'll probably be okay for capacity for a bit, but just depends on how big our designs wins are here going into the second half. But I think that the factory is running well, increasing number of customers enjoying that benefit and the demand signal for integration -- intergraded duplex's, integrated filtering for us has been tremendous.","Kris Sennesael","So, we continue to in source some of the filter fabrication there as well. And we haven't really quantified that, but it's going to have a meaningful impact on our further gross margin improvement in the second half of 2017.","Toshiya Hari","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Please go ahead.","Craig Ellis","Thanks for taking the question guys and nice job on the execution. Liam, I wanted to ask to ask an intermediate to long-term question, it's nice to see the business back to 8% year-on-year growth in the fiscal second quarter. So, the question is as you look at the business, what's your view on the potential for this return to year-on-year growth, could be sustainable year-on-year growth and what do you think the right level of longer-term growth is for Skyworks given the portfolio mix that you have and the investments that you're making in the business?","Liam Griffin","Yes, no, I appreciate that and you're right. I think we weathered a bit of storm here in '16 and most of the clouds there have abated and it's not just market shares. We\u2019re gaining share, we\u2019re creating new content. We\u2019re expanding in IOT and in broad markets and its meaningful and its sustainable.","We\u2019re confident that the second half for us should be a double-digit growth rate year-over-year. We think we\u2019ll have strength going into the next fiscal year as well just given our outlook and our design wins that we've secured recently. So, we feel good about it. Again, there is room to go on the margin line. We\u2019re going to work that. The demand side let's say, looks very good and more diversified I should add.","Craig Ellis","Thanks for that and then the follow-up Kris regarding the quarter, you may have mentioned earlier perhaps I missed it, but can you specify where the upside was from on a segment basis? It looks like on a revenue mix basis it must have been coming from integrated mobile, but is that correct or was it somewhere else.","Kris Sennesael","Yeah on a sequential basis mobile was the strongest growth driver absolutely.","Craig Ellis","Thanks guys.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Anthony Stoss with Craig Hallum. Please go ahead.","Anthony Stoss","Hi guys, my congrats as well. You bumped up CapEx in the quarter. I'm curious if you can give us more detail on what percentage of that is going towards TC-SAW? Also, Liam if you won't mind, give us an update on your -- I know your GPS newer solutions are starting to ramp an update on that as well as SkyBlue? Thanks.","Kris Sennesael","So, the vast majority of the CapEx was actually in our backend facility where we continue to expand our capacity.","Liam Griffin","Right. Tony and also GPS, GPS has really been prolific here over the last two or three quarters and forward-looking outlook as more and more devices now location services matter, highly precise locations matter. And we have some really unique things that we do in our Mexicali factory to shield and kind of manage the complexity of GPS and the size requirement.","So, that continues to roll out and it\u2019s a big driver in IOT. So, we have attachment across mobile, but the number of IOT nodes that we could lever with GPS I think is quite compelling and that's in other case where we're just starting to rack up the design wins. We have really good technology. It takes advantage of some of the core IP that we have in the amplifiers that we have today in cellular and trying to design and shape those for other applications.","Anthony Stoss","And then as a follow-up, I know you guys in the past talked about a midterm goal of 52% gross margins. Has anything changed in your view in getting there?","Kris Sennesael","No, absolutely not. We have our goal to get to the 53% gross margin. We've 30% operating expense and that get you to 40% operating margin. And so, we're committed to that and driving the whole organization very hard to go and execute towards it.","Anthony Stoss","Great job, guys. Thank you.","Liam Griffin","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Atif Malik","Hi, thanks for taking my question and Liam, a good job on the execution since you took over last year. My question is on the guidance, can you just qualitatively talk about how do you see the mobile and the broad markets in the March quarter relatively they're down 8% sequential decline?","Liam Griffin","Sure. Yes, the broad markets in IOT space should be up about 10% to 12% roughly. If mobile is not typically bullish here in the March quarter, we do have unique customer dynamic where some customers in fact are up even within mobile and that\u2019s all about content. So, it\u2019s not a particularly unusual signal.","One of the reasons why we\u2019re doing better than seasonal is just again a higher growth rate in the broad space and also with one of our larger customers in Korea content step up, which also provides a sequential gain in revenue.","Atif Malik","Okay. And then Chris on the last call, you talked about 100 basis points of gross margin improvement exiting fiscal '17. I understand that there is some sequential weakness in the gross margin guide because the revenues are coming down, are we still on track for that 100 basis points improvement exiting fiscal '17?","Kris Sennesael","Yes, as I said before, Q2 is a seasonal soft quarter. It\u2019s the low end of the gross margin and so we're driving really hard to further improvements in Q2 and Q3 as we strengthen the business and expect to successfully grow the revenue in the next two, three quarters.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ve the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. ","Vijay Rakesh","Hi guys. Just looking at inventory looks like it stayed flat through the December quarter. How do you see inventory exiting the March quarter?","Kris Sennesael","Yes, first of all again I\u2019m very pleased with the fact that we have been able to drive down inventory days. Remember in Q3 it was 108 days. It can down in Q4 to 94 days and we now are at 86 days. Again, Q1 is a seasonally soft quarter and we do see a lot of strength in our business in the second half with double-digit year-over-year growth in the second half.","And of course, the second quarter we are going to prepare for that and so we are increasing our factory loadings and as a result of that, you will see an increase in inventory during the March quarter as well an absolute dollars as in days of inventories.","Vijay Rakesh","Got it and just one follow-up here, on the gross margin I saw you mentioned that you still see a 52%, 53% gross margin target. The gross margins have stayed in that 50%, 51% for the last four quarters. Can you give us what the puts and takes are? Is that a 6 inch to 8 inch transition or how do you see the margins work or drives that? Thanks.","Kris Sennesael","So, the present group margin expansion is basically coming from three ways. First of all, and I repeat myself here, but we do see drastic revenue growth in the second half of '17 and of course revenue growth helps with the fixed cost absorption and the margin expansion.","Secondly, we continue to execute on our cost reduction programs and operational efficiencies that will continue to have further margin improvements and then last and we talked already a little bit about that, we continue to ramp the filter factory, continue with our insourcing into the filter factory and that will also further drive margin improvements.","Operator","Next, we go to Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Josh Burkhalter","Hi, this is Josh Burkhalter on behalf of Rick. Congratulations on the great results. I wanted to re-ask a question that was asked previously, but on a longer term. So, in the medium term you mentioned you think you can grow above the RF industry in general. I was wondering how much of that do you think is derived from broad markets versus mobile?","Liam Griffin","Sure, sure. We\u2019ll take a shot at that. Well, the broad market opportunity is more unbounded right. There is really kind of an infinite set of customers that we're addressing and moving the dial across the Board whether it be just adding the new applications and new customers.","And then even within IoT, there's a content opportunity where the customers and consumers they get used to a low range technology want to augment it perhaps with higher-end solutions maybe they had MIMO and Wi-Fi or maybe they go from a wearable technology that is just Wi-Fi and then it stretches to LTE. So, there is an action there that I think has tremendous upside and really the market continues to expand.","In mobile, mobile is more characterized. I know there's a lot of detail on the unit count. There is a lot of detail on customer innovation, interaction, but what is missed in mobile is again this tremendous economy that relies upon the hardware and relies upon the kind of technology that we offer and so what we see there and it\u2019s been increasing, is a continued push for performance-oriented solutions and every year there is a different requirement, there is a different opportunity for us to expand upon may be its frequency bands, may be its bringing in new opportunity for us to expand upon maybe it's frequency bands, maybe it's brining in new technologies.","We talked about Wi-Fi and GPS there happening, they're happening in some cases. Diversity we see as a new solution for Skyworks. So, all that continues to move and then we have this major 5G upgrade cycle on the horizon. It's a few years out, but Skyworks will be very well positioned there and when that does occur, you will have the backward compatibility for 4G and 3G.","So, you'll basically have some duplication of content or some enrichment in content without the legacy going away. So, there is a lot of things on the horizon if you look out. Again, the near term looks good. We talked about it, but if you think long about where the markets are headed and the continuous demand for mobile technology and mobile data and the economy that we've been speaking out far, it looks promising.","Josh Burkhalter","Okay. Thank you. And then on the last earnings call, you mentioned you had some mid band wins in China and also selling some SkyOne integrated products to media tech customers. Are there any -- are those meaningfully contributing and how should we expect, how are you viewing the traction there so far? Thank you.","Liam Griffin","Yes. Good question. They're contributing, but there's a long way to go in terms of the adoption. While we've talked a lot about, they're embracing this technology now and it's been great for them, it's been great for us and I think it's going to propel their business with the performance driven product, a number of products and we're seeing that move up a bit.","MediaTek is a partner of ours. We're working with them and their reference designs to continue to bring integration to the masses in China. Some of the value Tier players Oppo and Vivo for example are moving along that curve, but they're still not to where we expect them to be.","So, that's a continuous process and that doesn\u2019t mean units have to go up. That's really the content and again there is a big, big opportunity for us value tier moving up to mid-level and high levels of performance and bringing the kind of technology that we have into their products.","Operator","As we are approaching the top of the hour in our allocated time, we have one final question. It will come from the line of Bill Peterson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Bill Peterson","Yes, thanks for sneaking me in and congrats on the quarterly execution. I wanted to kind of maybe ask within broad markets a few questions. I guess first can you help us understand some of the more let's say higher growth segments within broad markets and then compare that with the more legacy products for the example base stations as we think about growth in that in this 2017?","Liam Griffin","Sure. I think the highest growth categories are really around the connected home high-speed access points and routers. You got these HD cameras. We have design wins with the whole Google net suite. We have design wins with the Netgear, Linksys, Ubiquiti, Wi-Fi mesh. That continues to roll and the content in some of these access points and routers and gateways could be very high, can be double-digit content. A lot of it is Wi-Fi and there are some other switching technology as well.","We're then taking that and spanning out into a variety of newer opportunities early innings with products like drones and we have designs there. Automotive, we think could be a phenomenal catalyst for us for semiconductors in general and for Skyworks. If you think about what really matters in an autonomous car, the connectivity piece right. We have cars today. We're all driving cars, but connectivity is going to really matter.","So, in order to make that market work, we're going to need very aggressive 5G solutions, massively expanded data pipe for both the transmit and downlink. All of that's going to be incredible opportunity for us and broad markets are that's going to be out there a few years.","Cellular infrastructure has been a market we've enjoyed for a while. It's not the fastest growing market. It's solid from a market perspective and we have a number of players there that we're engaged with and that also will go through a 5G upgrade cycle.","Bill Peterson","Okay. Thanks for that, and then within broad markets too, I noticed in the recent investor call it last year, you talked about your various let's say tools in your tool chest and one of them you mentioned was in the presentation was actually GaN. Just curious where do you stand again in terms of productization and strategy with GaN and maybe early it seems like it's early within GaN, but wanted to kind of ask more of a longer ranging question relative to that part of your portfolio.","Liam Griffin","We have within the portfolio. It's not a significant piece, but it does play in some of the infrastructure markets. It plays in some optical products. We have a little bit of business there, but we monitor the right technology for the application and for the customer need. The gallium arsenide technology that we have as you know we have two very significant fabs are really highly customized and curated gas solutions that proliferate our portfolio.","We do have some opportunities with foundry partners to bring in SOI and some other variance around the semiconductor space. And we had access again as needed. So, it's not a mission critical technology. We have access to it. It may play a little further out here in 5G, but at this point it's on our radar screen and it's an opportunity.","Bill Peterson","Okay. Thanks for the color and congrats again.","Liam Griffin","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, it does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over for any closing comments.","Liam Griffin","Thank you, operator and thank you all for participating on today's call. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming investor conferences and other events during the quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, it does conclude our conference for today. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"19538":["Skyworks Solutions Inc (NASDAQ:SWKS) F3Q 2013 Earnings Call July 18, 2013  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Stephen Ferranti","David J.

This call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Steve Ferranti, Senior Director of Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Ferranti, please go ahead.","Stephen Ferranti ","Thanks, Lori. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' Third Fiscal Quarter 2013 Conference Call. Joining me today are Dave Aldrich, Don Palette and Liam Griffin. Dave will begin today's call with a business overview, followed by Don's financial review and outlook. We'll then open the lines for your questions.","Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those noted in our earnings release and detailed from time to time in our SEC filings.","I'd also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we'll discuss today are from our non-GAAP income statement, consistent with the format we've used in the past. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.","With that, I'll turn over the call to Dave for his comments on the quarter.","David J. Aldrich","Thank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone. We had another strong performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, exceeding guidance across all key metrics. I'm pleased with the progress we've made towards our overarching strategic goals of diversification and market expansion. Both of these initiatives contributed towards our outperformance in the third quarter. Along with this, our growing portfolio of highly integrated, high-performance analog solutions helped to drive strong sequential margin improvement and helped to drive earning upside.","During the quarter, we posted revenue of $436 million. That's up 12% year-over-year. We delivered gross margin of 44%, nearly a 200-basis-point increase versus the prior quarter. We produced operating profit of $112 million. That's up 22% versus a year ago. And we earned $0.54 per share, and that's up over 20% year-over-year and $0.01 better than our guidance. We also repurchased roughly 4 million shares of our common stock during the quarter and ending with a cash balance of $400 million. And finally, our return on invested capital was over 20%. This is well in excess of our cost of capital. And for the current quarter, we are guiding revenue to be up nearly 9% sequentially to $475 million, driven by contributions from new market initiatives, program ramps and share gains.","During the fourth quarter, we'll continue to demonstrate the significant earnings leverage in our business model. Based on the outlook for strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage, we are guiding for fourth quarter EPS of $0.62, representing a 17% year-over-year growth.","Our near-term results continue to be quite healthy, but more importantly, our long-term outlook remains very bright. We're in a unique position to capitalize as advanced forms of connectivity spread across a widening array of end markets. As our guidance implies, fiscal 2013 will be a record earnings year for Skyworks. And with our current opportunity funnel and recent design momentum, we put in place the groundwork to continue our above-market growth trajectory, realizing our vision of providing mobile Internet growth with the financial returns of a diversified analog company.","Before going into more detailed market update, I'd like to turn it over to Don for an in-depth review of our financial results and our outlook.","Donald W. Palette","Thanks, Dave, and thanks again for joining, everyone. Revenue for the third quarter was $436.1 million, slightly ahead of our prior guidance of $435 million. Gross profit was $191.8 million or 44% of revenue. That's up 180 basis points sequentially and 80 basis points from the third quarter of 2012. Our strong margin performance reflects the strategic shift in our product portfolio toward more differentiated performance-based solutions.","Operating expenses were $80 million, in line with our guidance and consisting of R&D expense of $49.3 million and SG&A expense of $30.7 million. We generated $111.9 million of operating income, up 22% versus last year. Operating margin was 25.7%, a 220 basis-point increase versus the year-ago quarter. Below the line, we recorded $200,000 in other expenses and had a cash tax rate of 7.5%.","Net income was $103.8 million or $0.54 of diluted earnings per share, and that's $0.01 better than guidance and representing earnings growth of 20% year-over-year.","Turning to our third quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement, we generated $65 million of cash flow from operations. We invested $33.4 million in capital expenditures and had depreciation of $18.5 million. We also repurchased nearly 4 million shares of our common stock, representing an investment of roughly $92 million. And we exited the quarter with $400 million in cash and no debt. Our business continues to generate very strong cash flow, and we are on a path to produce over $450 million in cash flow from operations for fiscal 2013.","Given the positive momentum in our business and our fine confidence in our future prospects, we continue to believe that repurchasing shares of our common stock represents a highly accretive use of cash. As a result of our more aggressive activity over the last 3 quarters, we have largely completed the $200 million repurchase program that we initiated back in November 2012. We expect to remain active in the market, and to that end, we are pleased to announce that our Board has authorized a new $250 million program, providing us with a capacity for additional repurchases in the coming quarters.","Tuning to our fourth quarter outlook. Based on our current backlog and order visibility, we expect revenue to be $475 million, up -- roughly up 9% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. We expect gross margin to be between 44% and 44.5%. And as a reminder, going forward, we suggest modeling incremental gross margins at a 48% rate from the fourth quarter baseline.","We project fourth quarter operating expenses to be around $81 million. Below the line, we anticipate $200,000 in expenses from interest income and other expense, with a cash tax rate around 8.5%. Putting all this together, at $474 million -- $475 million in revenue, with gross margin at the midpoint of 44.25% and $81 million in operating expenses, we anticipate fourth quarter operating margins to be over 27%, with EPS of $0.62 on a base of 190 million shares.","In summary, we're continuing our track record of execution, producing above market growth and best-in-class financial returns. All of the underlying drivers are in place for Skyworks to continue to outperform, putting us on a clear path to achieving our mid-term business model of 30% operating margin, which, as a reminder, generates earnings per share of around $0.75 a quarter.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave for his comments on the market.","David J. Aldrich","Thank you, Don. For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our ongoing diversification efforts and in more detail and provide some additional perspective on our growth ahead.","As we touched on earlier in the call, diversification across end markets, customers and product offering has been a contributor to our recent outperformance and a cornerstone of Skyworks' long-term growth strategy. Over the last several years, we have established a strong track record of identifying high-growth market opportunities, of utilizing our technology advantages, advanced integration capabilities and customer relationships to carve out a leading share position and leveraging our scale and flexible business model to translate these revenue drivers into superior financial returns. And as our performance over the last few years indicates, we have been highly successful in executing on this strategy. And following this very same game plan, we are currently in the early innings of the next phase of growth at Skyworks, as advanced forms of connectivity expand from the mobile markets into a broader analog world. In fact, we see connectivity and mobility as being the biggest secular drivers within the analog landscape over the next several years, all of which are long-standing core competencies of Skyworks.","So with this in mind, I'd like to highlight 3 key themes as you consider the opportunity ahead for Skyworks. First, the Internet of Things is upon us, and the opportunity is enormous. It's virtually impossible to find an end market today that is not incorporating some form of always-on access. Whether it's within mobile devices or the Connected Home, the automobile, medical devices, machine-to-machine applications or in completely new areas of innovation like smart lighting, connectivity is on the rise across a broad array of end markets. In fact, a recent white paper from Cisco Systems projects a tremendous surge in connected things within the next few years, suggesting that the number of connected devices will exceed the world's population over the next few years. And the opportunity increases even further when factoring in technologies like 802.11, ZigBee and others. In total, the market is projected to reach a staggering 50 billion connections by the year 2020. All of this translates directly into new growth avenues for Skyworks. In fact, some of our fastest-growing segments are within areas like medical, industrial, automotive and Smart Energy, where connectivity is being adopted for the very first time.","Second, complexity is going up across our addressable markets. By all accounts, data consumption is skyrocketing and, along with it, so are the ways in which consumers stay connected by seamlessly utilizing multiple modes of connectivity. Many applications we see today involve the integration of several different communications protocols like cellular, like Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth and Near Field Communications to transmit sensitive signals within close spectral proximity across crowded licensed and unlicensed frequencies. Further complicating matters, customers are desperately seeking efficiency gains within their system power budgets to bring out additional battery life to support more process of power, higher resolution displays and a host of new functionality.","Third and perhaps most important, analog complexity translates into more addressable content and higher value add for Skyworks. This technology evolution is happening today, driving our addressable dollar content higher across the board in product areas like signal transmission and switching, voltage regulation, filtering and power management, among others. And as you know, we spent the last few years broadening our technology portfolio, extending our product lines and investing in applications teams in key vertical markets to address these challenges and to create new incremental revenue opportunities for us. And as some examples of our recent success, we've captured a number of new program wins during this quarter that include a complete suite of RF and analog products for leading 802.11ac enterprise routers from Cisco, NetGear and others; backlighting and power management ICs for tablet and ebook applications; telematics and infotainment system design wins, with a strategic global automotive supplier; integrated systems incorporating mixers, down converters and IQ modulators for 4G base stations. Incidentally, these devices represent a threefold increase in content for Skyworks; and silicon-based ultra-high speed switch ICs for carrier aggregation applications.","So in summary, it's a great time for Skyworks. And before closing, I'd like to reiterate some of the key messages from the call. Skyworks is levered directly to the global megatrend of rising connectivity attach rates across a broadening array of analog markets. Our addressable content is on the rise, driven by increasing complexity. We have the critical mass and we have the financial strength to capitalize on this financial opportunity. And finally, we have a long track record of converting these positive dynamics into consistently strong operating results.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please turn the call over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley Caris.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","David, just looking at the businesses, cellular and high-performance analog, can you give us a typical split-out in the businesses? And as you get traction with a number of the vertical market opportunities and as you succeed with diversifying the customer base, do you expect the relative growth rate of those businesses to change over time? More specifically, do you expect high-performance analog to accelerate relative to cellular from here?","Donald W. Palette","Yes, Craig, the mix was really relatively consistent with what we've seen. Linearity today was 40% of the revenue, and handset smartphones was 60%.","David J. Aldrich","Yes. And Craig, for all the dynamics we described in our prepared comments, I would expect over time to see the more diversified elements grow faster than traditional business for Skyworks, incidentally with accretive margins.","Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then as my follow-up, looking within the high-performance analog business, the business has good exposure to communications infrastructure. It's been a fairly muted end market, but there are signs of spending improvement in China and other areas. What are you seeing in that end market? And how does that end market impact the way you're looking at the back half of the year?","Liam K. Griffin","Sure, Craig. Well, we are seeing a great opportunity for the infrastructure space to pick up. It's been somewhat soft now, and there really isn't a meaningful change in our near-term guidance. But we continue to gain market share. We've noted some recent design wins with companies like Ericsson, where we've increased 3x our content on LTE base stations. We're also doing some very good work with a small cell opportunity, which we think is going to be a big driver for us, also, some attach with WiLAN. So the design win position for us actually is getting much, much better. And we're confident that the carriers are going to be spending shortly, and we're going to see some upside.","David J. Aldrich","Yes. I would add that our highest growth customers in that segment today are Huawei, followed by ZTE. But as Liam said, we don't think that market is reliable enough for the count on it in short- and mid-term growth. We're simply not factoring in any growth and hope to someday be surprised.","Operator","And our next question from the line of Harsh Kumar with Stephens.","Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","A quick question for you. We heard from another company that plays in the smartphone area this morning talking about negative trends. I'm curious, what was the offset in your business? In other words, what part did you see strength in if you saw weakness in 1 or 2 of the parts?","David J. Aldrich","We saw our strength in connectivity, broadly speaking, Wi-Fi business, our home business. We saw the early program ramps of some automotive programs and some industrial applications. So that was a nice uptick for us. Those segments in aggregate are becoming meaningful growth drivers for us now. We also saw some nice growth in emerging markets, with highly integrated systems and devices going into some of the smartphones. As you probably know or have seen in Teardown reports, we're aligned very tightly with, for example, MediaTek, with some pretty slick, highly integrated devices that are beginning to ramp. So we're seeing some uptake in the emerging markets and expect that to continue.","Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. And as a follow-up, very nice job on the margins, gross margins, particularly. So what's the -- in your mind, what's the single biggest driver of that number moving up?","Donald W. Palette","Yes, Harsh, I mean, as we had guided, we expected and we did deliver some meaningful expansion in the third quarter. We ended at 44%. Through multiple factors, I'd say that 2 of the critical ones, is, as Dave said, we're seeing an increase in the diversified analog content in our mobile space, as well as in the other vertical markets. And that -- those all have accretive margins. And we're also see -- with the new products that were ramping across a lot of different markets, this isn't just mobile or diversified analog, we're just seeing accretive margins, and we're starting to realize a lot of benefit from our design for cost focus and the value that our customers are assigning to the differentiated performance-based solutions that we're providing. And the volume helps as well. And we're a company that continues to focus on factory performance and product cost. And it's about yields, it's about productivity, the CapEx you see us spending that has very quick paybacks. All that contributes to incremental margin performance. So it's a lot of things.","Operator","And our next question from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","On the guidance, it was much better, I think, some investor fears out there. Could you maybe elaborate? In some of your comments, you talked about some share gains embedded in the guidance. Can you give us some color on where you're seeing share gains relative to the overall market?","David J. Aldrich","Well -- I think Liam could help me with this question as well, Mike. I don't -- it's not really share gains that's driving the growth and that's driving the margin expansion. It is much more a function of -- I'd put it in this order. One is, we are gaining a lot more content as we bundle our system solution around what had been traditional analog and RF content. So you're seeing a very high attach rate with GPS, power management, Wi-Fi, in addition to switching and control and amplification. So that's a big driver for us. I would put right up there with that just penetration into new markets. We're getting high ASP with very high contribution for products that have been custom-designed into some of the vertical markets we've been talking about. You thought about energy. You think about energy management, infrastructure, but this is much broader than that now. We're seeing the Connected Home, the automobile. And these are meaningful revenue drivers with really nice margin. So I think that we're in the right place at the right time with the right chipset partners in the case of the emerging market growth, so that was also a contributor. So I wouldn't call it share gains as much as I would, just a concerted effort to diversify and to add more value to our customers. And yes, as a result, you do gain share, and you box out competitors as you raise the bar technically with these more integrated solutions. But the intent is really to service our customers with more content and a better overall system experience.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay. And just as a follow-up to that with your more integrated solution for the lower-end 3G smartphone market, upgrading from 2G in China, as you mentioned, MediaTek's reference design, is that business going again sequentially in Q3? There are some concerns of some inventory in China, but it might be with some other customers and not MediaTek. Can you comment at all about your guidance? Would the China-related business be up sequentially in that guidance?","Liam K. Griffin","Yes, Mike, this is Liam. The China business, as Dave outlined earlier, is actually really moving in the right direction for us now. We've been engaged with MediaTek and Spreadtrum for quite a while. We're seeing the early stages of an upgrade cycle there where our content can go up 2 to 3x from the baseline 2G business. The other important thing about China, you still have the majority of the subscribers carrying 2G feature phones. So there's opportunity in our core business, but we're also seeing an extended reach. As you go into the smartphone world in China, you're increasingly seeing Wi-Fi for the first time. You're seeing more complexity in the Antenna Switch Modules, GPS applications and power. So as Dave said, it's share gains, but it's also a broadening reach for us. And China, for the most part, has been really slow to adopt some of those new technologies, and we're looking forward to some upside there.","Operator","And our next question from the line of Ed Snyder with Charter Equity Research.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","A couple of questions. Dave, last year, around this time, you -- we chatted about product mix, especially the Cellular One. And you made a prediction that turned out to be accurate, that you'd be the largest manufacturer of pads in this space. Do you still feel that's going to be the case over the next 6 months? Or do you think your makeshift is more to analog now than it has to FAS? And increasingly, SOI is becoming a very big deal in some of the leading smartphones. One of your competitors has led in that area, but it sounds like you guys are gaining a lot of ground. Where do you think that mix is going over the next say 6 to 9 months? Is Skyworks going to start showing up? Or is your presence, say, in antenna tuners that you have in the past? And then SOI, in general, so we can get some color on the CMOS SOI mix, if you could.","David J. Aldrich","Yes. Okay. I think, Ed, the first part of your question was about filters, specifically, I take it, our participation in filters. You mentioned pads and so on. So let me try to clarify that a little bit. We participate in filters when it's part of a more integrated system. A pad is a good example. SkyOne, as a product family, incorporates many of the duplexers. We can use our manufacturing techniques to do a lot of die stacking and inexpensive small footprint integration that's pretty unique, and we have some proprietary capabilities there that we're exploiting. And we are one of the largest integrator of filters in the world. I think we are the largest by unit volume today. Again, we don't sell discrete filters. That's not our business. And I expect to continue to do extremely well there. We are in a unique competitive advantage, oddly enough, because since we don't -- we're not vertically integrated or filtered, nor do we want to be. We think that's a long-term lower margin, more commoditized segment of the mobile business. However, because we are not in a filter business, we've got great relationships and strategic partnerships with a growing list of filter suppliers because we use a different filter below 2 gigahertz. We use simple SAWs that are cheap. We temperature compensate a SAW for certain applications where spectrum is very tight, and that temperature compensation improves the frequency performance. Above 2 gigahertz, we use some volt devices from a couple of different suppliers that really give us an advantage again with spectral crowding and higher frequency. So we're a really good partner for these filter suppliers because we're really their only conduit to some of these very high-volume sockets. And they view us that way, and they're opening capacity up for us. And we're doing some proprietary packaging and designs to make it sticky.","Liam K. Griffin","Yes, Ed. And with respect to SOI, silicon product, we certainly have been deploying those technologies in our switching business. And when you move into high throw ASMs, which now is the prevailing approach 6 to 8, and it's up to 12 throws, carrier aggregation, as you note, is becoming a very important part of the equation now, as you stitch channel bandwidths wider and wider in upcoming smartphones. Even Wi-Fi, we've been using SOI technology broadly. So we feel real good about our position there. We have PM technology as well. And whatever the market needs, we're going to be ready to deliver.","Operator","We'll take a question from Blayne Curtis with Barclays Capital.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to follow back on the China business, if you could maybe just quantify, one, just about how much that was of your business in the June quarter. And then I just wanted to clarify. You clearly have an opportunity as 2G goes to 3G. I was just curious, in the near term here, your outlook for September, are you still seeing growth there? Because there definitely is a lot of concern there. I just wanted to make -- clarify that you weren't just talking about the longer-term trends there.","David J. Aldrich","Our China business has been running in the mid-single digits. That's been fairly consistent. And it's really been the intersection of less investment in 2G, a technology that's in decline unit volume-wise. And I think profit-wise, it's in decline. So we focused exclusively on those areas of integration where we have a competitive advantage. And I think that the market is, over the long term, going to see that it's very difficult to hit the BOM cost targets with the amount of complexity that's inherent in the smartphone, even for -- even in China. And so we've done some things that are very unique around low cost but high-performance, highly integrated. And we get good margin on those products. So it's relatively small today, though. It had hit -- it has passed the inflection point where 2G was declining faster than the uptake in 3G. And we now are seeing growth. And we saw growth this quarter. And we're ramping some new programs. And we expect to see some growth in the next quarter as well.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then I just wanted to ask you about SkyOne, if you could just update on some timing and some milestones and whether you still feel as positively there.","Liam K. Griffin","Sure, Blayne. Well, we've made great progress over the last quarter with SkyOne. And let me just remind you that this is really an engine that provides our customers with a unique value proposition. We're delivering a fully functional yet highly simplified solution. It is configurable, it sweeps in all the key elements of the RF chain and we do all the tuning and matching. It addresses the challenges that we've all discussed here about increasing complexity, and band count also matched with the need for power efficiency and size. So with that said, we've made great progress. We're sampling a number of customers. We continue to do that. And we actually have design wins now that we would expect to be shipping by the end of the year.","Operator","And our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Dave, could you address the competitive and pricing dynamics in the market? Because I think this has been a key concern about not just Skyworks but all the other vendors is that there is customer concentration risks and that pricing is likely to get more aggressive as the mix moves more towards the lower end. So can you just help set the record there as to what are the pricing dynamics? Are you seeing more pricing pressure than you have experienced before? Any color would be very helpful.","David J. Aldrich","I would say this year and our pricing negotiations for next year, we're seeing a little bit less pricing pressure than we saw last year. I think it's partly the mix. Remember, pricing pressure is in direct proportion to the number of competitors and how sticky a product is or how much value the product adds. And what we're increasingly finding with the products we're addressing is that we don't see multiple competitors. It's custom. It's virtually all custom. So what we're trying to do is develop a product that, from its onset, hits the customer's desired BOM point but does so in a way where we have high contribution because the product is very unique. And as subsequent generations of designs, and if you look at -- in fact, if you look at recent Teardowns, you'll see a lot more Skyworks content with devices that are fully shield, that are integrated or that are at least bundled and optimized for the ultimate system performance. You're seeing a lot more power devices, more voltage regulation devices, more connectivity devices. So Vivek, I think it's not the case that we're selling components with a bunch of competitors. We're selling system solutions with a narrow set of competitors to change as we move from market-to-market. And that's been a concerted effort on our part to migrate our business away from components and commodities, and we're being much more successful today.","Donald W. Palette","And Vivek, that's part of what you're seeing in the margin profile, too.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Absolutely. And then just 1 follow-up on that. As you look at the opportunities you have both in your traditional power amplifier and front-end module segment versus the high-performance analog, are you seeing better attach rate, so better attach with your high-performance analog solutions? How should we think about sort of the -- you're selling more of these complementary solutions into a bigger TAM that you had been able to do before?","Liam K. Griffin","Well, I mean, it's a combination. We certainly will take advantage of opportunities to bring what we would call traditional analog technology into our mobile suite, and we've done well with that. But we are seeing an increasing suite of opportunities and applications in broad markets. We've talked a lot about Smart Energy. We're also doing work now supporting connectivity and LED lighting. We're doing panel power for tablets. We've been doing work with video security. There's just a whole plethora of opportunities that we're going after with our high-performance business. Some of it uses traditional products like our 802.11ac. Some of it\u2019s more organic technology that we've grown in-house. But we're very pleased with that opportunity. And quite frankly, as much as our numbers have been strong, there's tremendous market share there that we haven't yet tapped.","David J. Aldrich","And I think to follow on to Liam's comment, I really should stress that almost no one is buying a PA today or a switch. They're concerned with, look, I've got a number of bands that's exploding. I need to go from the output of that transceiver. I need to know what voltage and power that front-end is going to see. I need to tune it at the antenna. And I need you to shield all of this and frequency synthesize and convert it in a manner that I don't have harmonics problems and I can fit it in a physical footprint off the board. And that's very different than a model that I think you're referring to when you talk about commodity pricing. And I think if you're only selling -- for those few customers who want to buy a discrete PA and a 2G, there's too many competitors. I don't -- that's not our business focus.","Operator","And our next question from the line of Alex Gauna with JMP Securities.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","A number of the prior questions addressed some of the turbulence being seen in the end markets. I just wanted to check with you. Are you, in fact, seeing any slowdowns, adjustment downs and build plans for some of your key OEMs? Is that a factor in the outlook? Or is there somehow through mix that you're actually not seeing that? And then a follow-up on the China question. I know you addressed the longer-term opportunity for content to go up 2 to 3x. You've got the MediaTek attach, as well as the Lenovo, Huawei and ZTE wins. Are you seeing both unit volume attach and ASPs go up or content per device go up right now? Or is it more one or the other?","David J. Aldrich","Alex, the first part of the question, with respect to mix and slowdowns and so on, I think it's helpful to point out, that there isn't an OEM with meaningful volume today that we don't have some business with. And overall, that business is increasing in content and TAM share, if you will. We're adding more functionality. So yes, well, of course, we're not immune from any OEM who's having a difficulty. We see it. If there's another customer who's taking some of that share, we typically see it as well. And so we're more of a broad proxy in terms of the overall growth in unit volume and then we add to that incremental content and then we add to that the higher attach rate in these focused vertical markets, which are -- were coming from a relatively small position and seeing strong sequential growth for several quarters now.","Liam K. Griffin","Sure. And Alex, with respect to China, you've got 2 dynamics. You have just a richer content mix in smartphones, whether they're 3G or 3G TD-SCDMA. You've got that benefit. And then you have the actual subscriber upgrade cycle going now where the majority of new subscribers are moving into that category. So you have more units of smartphone increase, and then you have a content gain in each smartphone.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","So you're seeing it be accretive to content, as well as profitability, and then also your latest thoughts on the TDD-LTE opportunity ahead of you?","Liam K. Griffin","Yes, I think -- well, exactly. So we are seeing accretive for sure. And the TD-LTE opportunity for us is actually quite positive. We've been working with a number of the key players. We're also starting to talk with carriers a bit and looking for ways to do something unique, create more of that systems approach that, really, in markets like China, when you're dealing with customers like Lenovo and some of the smaller players, the benefit for us to come in and provide more systems architectural solutions really plays well. So I think that will all come together, and we have the right people on the ground to make it happen.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Anthony Stoss with Craig-Hallum Capital.","Anthony J. Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Dave, on -- or maybe, Liam, getting back to SkyOne, you're going to start shipping by the end of the year. So in addition, just to additional bands and more content in China, do you think your overall content can go up once you start launching SkyOne? And where do you think SkyOne goes, say, by the end of next year? And then lastly, is it fair to say that Wi-Fi is growing faster than your cellular side?","David J. Aldrich","Thank you, Anthony. With respect to SkyOne, SkyOne is a unique product. It is, as Liam mentioned, highly configurable to region of the specific customer architectures. But it has 1 common theme, and that is it is all bands of amplification with matched to the duplexer with all the switching and frequency conversion. And so it's a pretty unique product. By definition, Anthony, when we capture those socket, we capture the entire analog front-end. There isn't anything outside of it. And then, of course, the attach rate with Wi-Fi for us is very, very high. So I think you should think of it in terms of -- the SkyOne isn't for every application. It's not for every socket. But it's a great product platform for a number of customers who are going to be able to get to market quickly, where otherwise, they simply could not deal with the complexity, even of a strong reference design. They need to take -- they need this to be shielded, dropped, have it be completely bulletproofed, and that's what SkyOne does.","Liam K. Griffin","Right. With respect to WiLAN, I mean, we're seeing ubiquitous attachment. Now it's an incredible market for us. We're benefiting with an 11ac rollout and a handset that's just starting, and we have great position there. We're seeing an access point opportunity that is incredible. We have MIMO technology, multiple in\/multiple out. Teardown is available across the board that show the richness of that opportunity. And the need for the speed. When you think of what is available today for content to the consumer, you need 11ac technology to bring that home. So that's great. And then we're seeing Wi-Fi move into some of our home automation markets, where we see Wi-Fi for video security, set-top box with customers like Comcast and others. So Wi-Fi for us now just creates such a broad opportunity that some of it's mobile, some of it's analog, some of it's home automation. It has a pretty amazing growth rate to it.","David J. Aldrich","Anthony, in the public domain now, there are a couple of the early high-running ac routers, for example. And those products, we've got $5, $6, $7. We've got upwards of 10 devices, power-management devices going to multiple antennas with amplifiers and switches and filters. I mean, it is amazing how complex those devices are and how much value we can add by being out in front of ac and then to be able to do some unique things to integrate and package. That's a great business for us.","Operator","And we'll go next to Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer.","Richard E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Yes, I just had a couple of questions. One is kind of a follow-on to the earlier stuff on the smartphone tablet. I'm just curious, I know it's early to discuss the December quarter, but how do you think it shapes up for that vertical for smartphone tablet? I mean, do you expect that it could be a little slower quarter if Samsung kind of follows their typical seasonal end-of-the-year kind of pattern of flush in inventory and maybe Apple reorders fall a little short? I mean, I guess, I'm curious what your process is, if you could walk us through your process for sort of evaluating or even haircutting some of your customers' forecasts.","David J. Aldrich","Boy. Well, the December quarter we expect to be seasonally up as it normally is. We could debate how to handicap what up means, but we expect it to be up relative to September. I think more importantly, we have good visibility for December because a number of phones and smartphones and tablets in that segment of our business, you will be seeing new platforms hitting the market. That's just the way it is at the end of a calendar year. And we like our position there a lot. So we think the market will be up in December. We think we'll be up more than the market, and we can identify those programs today.","Richard E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then a question on RF360. I'm just curious what's your customers -- what you've seen from your customers in terms of their reaction to that part. How do you guys look at it? And maybe, I don't know, give us any color you have on what's going to be sort of key to that part getting traction and when do you think that will be.","David J. Aldrich","Yes, that's a great question. I think that in one sense, the RF360 and Skyworks' highly integrated products, including SkyOne, are really addressing a fundamental issue that we have common to both of us, and that is that RF complexity is exploding dozens of bands. Harmonics, coexistence issues are a real issue. OEMs need to simplify all this complexity. So I completely agree with Qualcomm on that front. And there are painfully few suppliers who can do anything close to the level of integration our customers need today, which is why we're seeing the margin accretion that we're seeing in the mobile space. However, here's where we differ. Every customer is different. No one-size-fits-all. They have differences in terms of the regions they want to address, the number of bands, how they look to implement, where they see the sensitivity in the system, given what they're trying to deliver in terms of functionality. So we do not see a one-size-fits-all design approach, which is why we've made SkyOne, for example, to be highly reconfigurable, even though it's highly integrated. The other place where we differ is we do not see any customers willing to take any iota of compromise on performance, particularly with respect to current consumption. And so if you look at SkyOne, it has the very best process functionality, the very best packaging technology to deliver the best performance for each functional block within that transmit chain because we just don't see any customers willing to say, \"Well, it's not that -- the performance isn't as good, but it's highly integrated.\" Well, so what? So we see this is an area where Skyworks excels, in fact.","Operator","We'll go next to Steve Smigie with Raymond James.","Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","My first question was just on the operating expense. If I look at what you did last quarter, what you just reported and what you've guided, you're doing a pretty good job of keeping those dollars pretty flat despite growing revenue. Can you talk a little bit how we should think about those dollars over the next several quarters? Are you going to try to keep those dollars flat there still? Or would we expect to see a little bit of growth as well?","Donald W. Palette","Well, we just guided $81 million, which is a little bit up from where we've been running around $80 million for the prior -- several prior quarters before that. We're making some targeted R&D and field apps investments that are going to support some new growth opportunities. We think they're going to drive shareholder value. So we'll do that whenever that opportunity presents itself. So you're going to see some increases as we move forward. There's pay increase maybe mid-fiscal period for us that does move OpEx a little bit. So I would think about that you can ramp that so that we're at that kind of $84 million level by the end of 2014. That's kind of a good way to think about it.","Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just to go a little bit into the diversification story. I think in the past, one item you've talked about is your partner with Texas Instruments on some smart meters. I think those guys do a pretty good job in that market as does somebody like Maxim. And overall, that looks like it's going to grow pretty nicely. Would you say that's going to be a significant driver for you? Or is that even the wrong way to think about it? There are so many of the things out there like smart meters that over the next 18 months, there's not going to be 1 or 2 big diversification platforms for a whole bunch of them.","Liam K. Griffin","Yes. I think there will be many platforms. We do work with TI on some ZigBee sockets. There's also silicon labs and some others that we work with there. So that business is great. We've been in that market for quite a while, doing a lot of work with Itron and Sensus, Landis+Gyr, Silver Spring Networks in the Bay Area. But what's equally exciting now is this proliferation of what we call home automation where the unit count goes way up. We've got, as I said earlier, opportunities to connect lighting, to connect appliances, to connect security systems. And the unit count there is much higher than it would be just with a meter communicating back to the utility. So the good news for us is that we have the technology to play. We have the ZigBee technology, we have the Wi-Fi technology, the switching and systems capability to deliver the solution as the customers may see. But back to the opening comments about 50 billion connected things, however that number goes, it's going to get much higher, and the ability to connect is going to be there. And Skyworks has the right to policy. So we're very -- we're excited about it and look forward to updating you over the next couple of quarters.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And I just want to ask a question on the China market. I know you said your content is going up. You have good partnership with Spreadtrum, MediaTek. How do you see your share overall as you move to these higher content 3G margin and TDs picking up there?","Liam K. Griffin","Yes. So markets moving up, one of the important points is that the competitive landscape is narrowing. The 2G market, we've been a player there for years, still do some work. But the landscape there is somewhat commoditized by the simplicity of the products. When you're moving to the next generation, whether it's the quad-core MediaTek design or some of the new TD-SCDMA devices out of Spreadtrum, there's a great deal more complexity, there's more energy around efficiency in the design. There are smartphones now, so they're driving more current. And our ability to kind of flex our engineering muscle and to lever our differentiated products goes up as these phones launch. So we think it's a better field for us to play on. Margins should be better, and content will continue to grow.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I know you mentioned in your press remarks that second half '13 should be pretty strong. You're diversified very well. How do you see -- as you look out into December -- I know it's a little far out, but given that you're diversified and there's a little bit of a SKU in builds, do you see strength continuing into the -- continuing out?","David J. Aldrich","Well, we do. My expectation is that December, we'll have -- be seasonally high. It always is. We're not trying to handicap what that number is. But we've got some strong program ramps, some content gains and some verticals that are ramping going into the December quarter. So we expect to outperform whatever that seasonal number is.","Operator","And we go next to Mike Burton with Brean Capital.","Michael A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","On the gross margins, you mentioned that mix played a role, but obviously, given your guidance for contribution margins, you expect more upside. I was just wondering, what is driving that going forward? Is it all mix? Or are there other opportunities on increasing utilization and cost reduction? And should we get a new update on the mid-term model for a target?","Donald W. Palette","Well, as I said, Mike, that it's a combination of factors. It's the increased diversified analog content. It's better margins on products, new products that we're ramping. And we're seeing the benefit of the differentiated performance that we're providing with the customers, as well as the cost focus. Volume always helps, and it's driving improvements across all the metrics. And, in fact, it's all those things that are driving margin expansion. And we've said to use off of this new forecast we just provided you, which is 44.25%, is to drop the incremental revenue in your models through at 48%. And what that gets you when you look at the 30% model we had originally targeted around $550 million, that drops that number down to a slightly lower revenue level when you do that.","Michael A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. And then also, just 10% customers in the quarter.","Donald W. Palette","Foxconn and Samsung.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Maybe another content question for you. So in the past, you've talked about how the high-end smartphone has a total addressable market of somewhere between $10 to $12 per phone. I'm curious what your view is of kind of the low- to mid-range smartphone at this point.","David J. Aldrich","Well, it depends. I think the upgrade cycle from 2G to 3G, particularly in China, is going to take a lot of different forms. It will be ultimate very high-end smartphones, and they'll have similar content. I think there won't be that many of those, frankly, because I think a lot of the upgrade will be more regional or be TD-LTE and bypass some of the bands. I think they need to do that to hit those -- what the market price will bear from a price point standpoint. So I think it's anywhere from a few dollars to several dollars, and that's a -- it's a big uptake obviously from the $0.50 in 2G, but that's where I kind of see it, a few dollars. It's not the $10 or $12, at least not for very many phones.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then when you look at the adoption of the highly integrated products, does that impact revenue even though it gives you higher margin?","David J. Aldrich","Well, it impacts revenue because we, by definition, capture more content. Yes.","Operator","And our next question from the line of Ian Ing with Lazard Capital Markets.","Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Back to this Internet of Things, it sounds like a potential big opportunity, lots of units but lower content. So any sense of when that could become potentially 10% of revenues? What would have to happen for that to occur? And then what sort of content do you have? Is it mostly like ZigBee or analog, et cetera?","David J. Aldrich","Well, it's not -- the Internet of Things, it\u2019s not one thing. We kind of -- we're talking about the Connected Home and all the various forms that connectivity is taking in automobiles and other applications. And I'm not sure -- maybe I don't understand the question. It's well over 10% today if you look at what the Internet of Things means to us. It's huge.","Liam K. Griffin","Yes. I think in the -- yes, in the unaddressable -- on the markets that we haven't yet addressed, let me put it that way, there's a lot of upside. So we're just starting to tackle markets like medical and home automation and tackle markets like automotive. And we're actually very surprised -- pleasantly surprised with the opportunity that we see as many of these markets move to connectivity. Telematics and automotive, for example, really wasn't a market 2, 3 years ago, and we're addressing that. We're doing home monitoring and medical. So there's a number of things that we're now going after and seeing kind of a convergence to wireless that we can take advantage of, and we haven't done it yet. It's just early innings.","Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","But like a ZigBee connection would be like a sub-dollar type of content then?","Liam K. Griffin","Some of our ZigBee connections are more than sub-dollar. It depends on where you are. When you tend to be -- if you're at the meter, for example, there's higher-end product than you are if you're in an LED light. So it can vary depending on the opportunity.","Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And then my follow-up, just a couple of housekeeping questions, 2G versus non-2G percent of sales. And then how should we model net OI&E going forward? It's moved around a bit in the past few quarters.","Donald W. Palette","Yes, the 2G is 15% in the quarter, and so the 3G, 4G was 85%. I'm sorry, repeat the second question again?","Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Net OI&E, it's moved around a bit the past several quarters. Just wanted to get some sense of how to model that going forward.","Donald W. Palette","I would use the $200,000 expense. Every once in a while, we'll get some impact from currency, but it's minimal for us. That's the right thing to do.","Operator","And we'll go next to James Faucette with Pacific Crest.","James E. Faucette - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just a few follow-up questions here. First, you've talked a little bit about ultimately high-performance analog growing faster than cellular, but yet the proportion seems to remain relatively stable at least over the last few quarters. How should we think about timing to when we'll start to see that faster growth manifest?","David J. Aldrich","Yes, James, it's hard to say, to handicap it because there are an awful lot of high-performance analog devices in our mobile products. So, for example, take a look at a Teardown report of a phone today, of a smartphone, and there's a number of them out there, we have several dollars of content that has nothing to do with kind of a PA switch sort of a thing. So it's really hard and in some ways not quite as relevant, right, because if it's high-performance analog into tablet, so be it, right, or in a smartphone. So...","Donald W. Palette","Yes, we're just scoring it.","David J. Aldrich","Yes. So I think it will -- over time, it will continue to trend faster and higher. But the distinction -- when we talk about the connectivity of things, the distinction between that which is a mobile device and that which is not is getting increasingly hard to do because the challenges are the same and the products are quite similar.","James E. Faucette - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Right, absolutely. I guess, just for future reference, we're looking at it from the standpoint of, hey, those particularly high-performance analogs, they tend to go into longer-life cycle products and ultimately drive better margin contribution, in general.","David J. Aldrich","That's true. Good point. That's true. So it will trend higher over time, but it won't be a big needle or a curve. We think it'll be graceful.","Liam K. Griffin","And certainly, James, we have a lot of headroom there. I think we're doing very well in mobile, and we're bringing analog into mobile, of course. But there's a lot of work and opportunity in front of us where we can bring accretive margins in with our high-performance analog in the markets that we talked about before, whether it's infrastructure, whether it's automotive markets that typically have the 50-point-plus GMs.","Operator","And our next question from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a quick clarification first on the China business. Will you talk about China's mid-single digits? Does that include the branded players like Huawei, ZTE and Lenovo? Or was that really more of a reflection on the white box percentage?","David J. Aldrich","I think it's more a reflection on the white box percentage. We're seeing -- we have a lot of business now with Lenovo, Huawei, ZTE. So I think it's more of the sort of the open market stuff.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just trying to get a sense on the September quarter guide. You talked one of the drivers being program ramps. I'm wondering, can you make any comments about how diversified the growth is in the September quarter? Or is it more concentrated to a couple of larger program ramps in the quarter?","David J. Aldrich","Quinn, I'm glad you asked that question because what I'm really thrilled about is that if I look at this quarter, if I look at September, it is very diversified. It's diversified in the sense that it's a diverse set of customers. It's diversified in the sense that those existing customers are buying more content from us across the board, Quinn, across the board. And I really like the work that our high-performance analog teams have done with these teams focused on specific verticals and what they've been able to undercover in terms of underserved opportunities for us. Sometimes it's manufacturing integration, often, it's the intersection of manufacturing with high-performance devices with a newly connected market -- existing market that becomes newly connected. And so I am thrilled with the degree of diversification that we're rolling out in September, and you see it in the margins.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that's going to conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Aldrich for any closing comments.","David J. Aldrich","Thank you, everyone, for participating, and I look forward to seeing you in upcoming conferences.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T's Executive TeleConference Service. You may now disconnect."],"19663":["Skyworks Solutions, Inc.

This call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Mitch Haws, Vice President of Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Haws please go ahead.","Mitchell J. Haws - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Thank you, Kieran. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' second fiscal quarter 2018 conference call. With me on the call today are Liam Griffin, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kris Sennesael, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our discussion will include statements relating to future results and expectations that are or may be considered forward looking statements. Please refer to our earnings press release and recent SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on certain risks that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially and adversely from any forward-looking statements made today.","In addition, the results and guidance we will discuss include non-GAAP financial measures consistent with our past practice. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.","With that, I'll turn the call to Liam.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Mitch, and welcome everyone. The Skyworks team produced solid results in Q2 once again demonstrating above-market year-over-year growth in revenue and earnings per share.","Let me begin with a few highlights. We produced record Q2 revenue of $913 million, up 7% year-over-year. We expanded gross margin to 50.7%, up 30 basis points over last year. We delivered 13% EPS growth year-over-year to $1.64, $0.04 ahead of consensus, another Q2 record. And finally, we generated $434 million in cash flow from operations and achieved a 38% free cash flow margin.","From a financial perspective, continued strength in our fundamentals and improvements in profitability directly translated to cash flow growth. At the same time, our solutions are enabling an expanding and diversified set of end markets. For example, during the quarter, we partnered with the world's largest automotive manufacturer to leverage connectivity across their global fleet; deployed integrated solutions for Honeywell's LTE handheld enterprise hubs; ramped Wi-Fi and ZigBee modules for Nest's connected video systems; secured new design wins at Belkin for mesh networks; supported Garmin's latest Forerunner advanced fitness smartwatches; delivered SkyOne and SkyBlue platforms for upcoming Lenovo and Asus high-performance notebooks; and we launched 802.11ac solutions for the newest DIRECTV streaming gateway.","We also captured strategic design wins across a number of flagship platforms, inclusive of SkyOne, DRx, GPS, Wi-Fi, power management, and antenna tuning solutions In parallel, in our infrastructure markets, we powered Massive MIMO for India's largest carrier, and finally, we collaborated with a premier European base station supplier for small cell deployments supporting AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Vodafone.","At a higher level, the overarching connected economy is rapidly expanding with global data traffic expected to grow 40% compounded over the next five years. High-performance data centers are enabling client-to-cloud big data analytics, supporting artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, industrial IoT, machine learning, and virtual reality by facilitating a multi-trillion dollar ecosystem.","The sea change towards mobility harnessing cloud access and storage is creating commensurate demand for increasingly more powerful connectivity engines. Our mission at Skyworks is to enable this data-driven world, powering billions of new intelligent devices through instantaneous, reliable, and secure wireless connectivity.","Moving forward, 5G will usher in an age of truly ubiquitous connectivity and intelligent automation, enabling richer, smarter, and more convenient ways to live, work, play, and educate. Skyworks is leveraging our deep systems knowledge, strategic partnerships, and formidable investments to accelerate the deployment of 5G, uniquely meeting the requirements for low, mid, high, and ultra-high frequency bands with our differentiated Sky5 platform. In short, Skyworks is well-positioned to capitalize on the revolutionary applications ahead while facilitating the more expansive connected economy of tomorrow.","I will now turn the call over to Kris for a discussion of last quarter's performance and our financial outlook.","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Liam. Revenue for the second fiscal quarter of 2018 was $913 million, up 7% compared to Q2 of last year, exceeding our guidance and consensus estimates. Gross profit was $463 million, or 50.7% of revenue, up 30 basis points over the prior year.","Operating expenses were $132 million. As a result, we generated $331 million of operating income, translating into an operating margin of 36.3%. Our tax rate was 9.5% in the quarter. Net income was $302 million, translating into $1.64 of diluted earnings per share, up 13% year-over-year and exceeding our guidance by $0.04.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Second fiscal quarter, cash flow from operations was $434 million and capital expenditures were $90 million, driving a strong free cash flow margin of 38%. Dividends paid were $58 million and we repurchased over 1 million shares of our common stock for a total of $112 million. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.9 billion and no debt.","Now moving on to our outlook. Strong growth in our growth market portfolio is mitigating the near-term softness at leading smartphone customers and the trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. government on a Chinese OEM. Specifically for the third fiscal quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $875 million to $900 million.","We expect further gross margin expansion to between 50.7% and 51% with operating expenses remaining flat sequentially. Below the line, we anticipate roughly $3 million in other income and a tax rate of 9.5%.","We expect our diluted share count to be approximately 183.5 million shares. Accordingly at the midpoint of approximately $888 million in revenue, we plan to deliver diluted earnings per share of $1.59.","Finally, based on new program ramps heading into the second half of the calendar year, we anticipate a resumption of sequential revenue growth in the September quarter with sustained momentum into the December period.","With that, let me turn the call back to Liam.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Kris. As our results demonstrate, Skyworks is on track to deliver another year of record performance underpinned by content-rich design wins, spanning a number of strategic end markets, world-class operational execution and scale, the launch of our Sky5 platform as 5G becomes a reality, and decades of experience in developing innovative solutions over successive technology generations.","Finally and most importantly, we are committed to delivering premium levels of profitability and cash generation, consistently creating value for our shareholders.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","All right. Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from the Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. Liam, I just wanted to delve a little bit into the top line. This is a notoriously bad visibility industry to be in. But what gives you the confidence, not just for the September quarter, but you said sustained momentum outside of normal seasonality? Could you please talk about the content growth that you would be seeing on a year-over-year basis as we go into new platforms? And then I had a quick follow-up.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure, sure. Yeah, well, as you know, our products are designed into some of the most compelling companies on the planet, whether it's smartphones, whether it's IoT applications or infrastructure, other broad markets. And the design cycles are long, and we have very good visibility into the content that we ultimately enjoy.","And the challenge is obviously units, right? You can't always tell what the unit numbers are going to be. But when we look at our data today, looking at the content position that we have in leading applications, the continued push for performance that we see in mobility, and the appetite for the consumer to want that data faster and faster as we just discussed in the prepared remarks, we're very confident in our position in terms of gaining content, gaining share, extending reach, and also with great visibility as we look out into the next couple of quarters. So that's sums up where we formulate our guidance and our outlook.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Could you just quantify how much content you will be gaining?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, it's not one number. It's a customer-by-customer opportunity. Certainly, the customers that are pushing the performance barriers and really raising the connectivity speeds and data rates and performance, those accounts provide more opportunity for us on a dollar basis. But there's also some operates from 3G to 4G, and some players in emerging markets that are just starting to move the needle. So it's a culmination of all of that that provides us with a view to see upside here in the second half.","Operator","Thank you. And now to the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Please go ahead, sir.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys, thanks for the question. Liam, maybe you can just talk about \u2013 obviously this is a tough seasonal period for handsets. And maybe you can just talk about the China market, what you're seeing in terms of recovery, and then maybe as you look into June, if you could maybe just think about \u2013 obviously the marquee smartphone is weak, everybody knows that, maybe just what impacted the guidance? And then highlight China recovery in the second half.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. So China is obviously an important market, they're a market that consumes technology, they export technology, they're also a conduit for us to address emerging markets from an end user perspective. And it's been a market that we've enjoyed and we continue to enjoy.","There's a lot of content opportunities across the diversified players within China. We do well there. We're starting to see kind of that translation from low end to mid-tier within China and then the mid-tier players getting a little stronger. There have been some cases where you have some pockets of kind of sideways action in China that can happen as we kind of pause into 4G and get ready for 5G. But our content position there continues to move up. Certainly as we noted, we do have an issue with one player in China, ZTE, where we've got about a $25 million to $30 million hit on revenue. That is now completely contemplated in the guidance, so that's an issue.","But as we move into the second half, as we noted, the tier 1 players where the opportunity is greatest, the performance is most difficult and the opportunity to drive connectivity speed and data rates continues to go up. That's where we see the real opportunity here in the second half.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I just wanted to ask you on the broad market side, it's been a consistent double-digit grower. Just opportunity with 802.11ax is in terms of content, and then just timing as it seems like that is pushed a little bit to the right, but just as you look into next year, when do you think 802.11ax will start hitting?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Well, we're starting to see 802.11ax show up in roadmaps now for products that would come probably late next year. We can deliver that through smartphones, we can deliver that technology through access points, routers, streaming applications. And I should also include that broad markets in general is going to be a meaningful catalyst for us in the second half in addition to the comments on smartphones.","And Wi-Fi in general continues to be a real strong piece of our business through IoT. So we'll see that coming together. But 802.11ax will definitely be there. You're right it's been pushed out of it, hasn't been an impediment to our growth, but it will be an accelerator as we get into late 2018 and into 2019.","Operator","Thank you. And now to the line of Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, thanks. Just had a question on gross margin, just a sequential, I mean, you should probably see some benefits from mix perspective in terms of mobile weaker and broad market stronger. So anything else within the gross margin mix that you call out into the June quarter?","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. So revenue is down slightly on a sequential basis. So we don't get a little benefit from size and scale. But there's definitely some moving parts from a mix point of view that is helping us, and that's why we guided the gross margin on to be up potentially between flat to up 30 basis points sequentially. Again looking forward to the second half of 2018, we believe that we can continue to make some good progress, further gross margin improvements towards our target model of 53%.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just a follow-up to Liam, the discussion around kind of weakness at smartphone customers, where do you think you are at this point from a production perspective and inventory? And how much is being worked through versus how much you think has to continue to come out of the system in the smartphone side?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure. Yeah, I mean, certainly we felt the unit number for the Q3 period was a little bit light and one of the reasons why our guidance is roughly flat if we add back the ZTE. But as we go into the second half, we see turnover of portfolios with our leading customers. We see new products ramping. We know what our position is within those products. We're very comfortable with that.","We see the technology being pushed yet again, which allowed us to continue to grow our content and position. So we do feel very good about that. And second half data points really do have some independence from what we're seeing in the first half with different products.","Operator","Thank you. And now to the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for taking my question. Liam, I wasn't sure if you quantified how much of a headwind ZTE was. And then importantly, my first question is, is there a way to help us at least get a sense for how much year-on-year growth rates can you get towards in the September and December quarter? I understand that the unit trends might be a little bit volatile. So just because I think there is so much focus on that part of the year, if you could just give us, even if it's a range of where do you think year-on-year growth rates would shake out in September and December, that would be very helpful.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure. Yeah, with respect to ZTE, they're about $25 million to $30 million of revenue. The lion's share of that is mobile, but there's also some infrastructure pieces. So that one is pretty well quantified. And when we look out to the second half, we're definitely \u2013 again I can't provide complete guidance here, but we're clearly anticipating meaningful sequential growth into Q4 September and then meaningful growth again into December, following a traditional seasonal pattern for mobile and smartphones. There's an ability for us to have a higher inflection on that given content gains we expect, but you should anticipate solid growth two quarters in a row there from Q3 close.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And as a follow-up, in some of the places where I think you are expected to perhaps expand your share or gain more content and know that fact for example, right, and maybe add more diversity to receive, for example, how is the competitive situation beyond just the traditional competitors? Do you sense any more competition from Japanese players, for example? If you could just give us a sense for how is the competitive landscape in the places where you are gaining more content. Thank you.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Well, the competitive landscape is being vetted out based on performance and technology. That's what it is today. This isn't just about capacity. It's just not about having good enough product. It's about having the best product. And in the markets that really matter that really drive change and push the envelope, we're winning. And I would say that our Tc-SAW capabilities are not only world class in terms of output but in terms of performance. The quality of that technology right now has been advanced by Skyworks and allows us to push the frequency envelope wider and wider and broader and broader.","Our DRx diversity technologies provide a tremendous benefit to the customer and the end user, very unique stuff that's crafted and tuned and tested here at Skyworks and developed completely in-house. Those are the kind of things that really move the dial. So there's a competitive environment, of course, and this is a great market. And competitors see some of the things that we see. But the real strength of Skyworks is moving up, advancing that technology, adding functionality, extending our reach, and creating the most compelling end products for our customers.","And we commented today on the prepared remarks, when you look at markets like data center and cloud, which are really important today, invariably they are tethered to a handheld device that needs very high-speed instantaneous data in order to make that cloud ecosystem really, really pay off. So that client-to-cloud connectivity is a big deal, and in the client side where we play, we have to be better and better every year and support our customers, and that's what we're doing.","Operator","Thank you. And now to the line of Tristan Gerra from Baird. Please go ahead.","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. What is the extent to which, as we move above 3 gigahertz frequencies, the extent to which this is an opportunity for Skyworks medium term, either in terms of technologies or higher content opportunities, if you could elaborate on this.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure. Well, when we start to move above 3 gigahertz, we're entering the domain of what we call 5G. So we've talked a lot about that in the past, and Skyworks has a really strong, compelling platform, our Sky5 platform, which really is a culmination of multiple solutions from transmit to receive chain, solutions addressing that new spectrum that one would see from 3 gigahertz up to 5 gigahertz and even beyond.","So we're working on that right now. We have the key elements, the IP, the engineering technology to it put together, we have the devices now that are in process and in the development stage clearly targeted with customer opportunities in mind.","So we'll start to see that evolve. And I think it's an important point in the industry because as 4G has proliferated quite well from 3G and we are probably in mid to late innings on 4G, 5G is going to step up and bring a whole new wave of technology opportunities to Skyworks.","And they're going to be more challenging, but we're making those investments today across the board and the elements that we provide and then the ability to integrate and configure for our customers. So that's something that we look forward to here over the next several years.","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then as a quick follow-up and following up on a prior question about inventories, should we make the assumption that excess inventory and specifically of component inventory in the smartphone supply chain should be basically back to normal by mid this year, or do you expect lingering impact into the September quarter?","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","No, I think when we look today at the inventory including the inventory on our books, the inventory in the distribution channel as well as the inventory further up in the supply chain, it's currently at a healthy level. There's always some minor fluctuations there, but I would describe it as a healthy level currently.","Operator","Thank you. And now to the line of Harsh Kumar from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Yeah, hey, Liam, I had one for you at a broad level. Do you think that we are still, as a handset component supplier, we're still in a 10% to 12% growth environment? And if so could you tell me may be what 5G can do to help that number out as it comes along next year?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure. Yeah, I think if you look at the culmination of smartphones today that are really right for the uprate cycle today, that we're on the cusp here of a big turn in wireless connectivity, and that's 5G, and an even broad market. So when you look at broad market what we're doing there, which is somewhat uncorrelated to smartphones, it runs with a whole different customer set, and we've been doing great there. And then you look at our position in 4G moving to 5G, we're very comfortable.","And so the opportunities to be in the double digits top line are absolutely there. When you look at 5G, a couple of basics here that we want to make sure we understand. 5G is additive to current 4G and 3G phones. So when you have a device today that you're carrying around today, it doesn't have any 5G technology.","It has a lot of great technology a lot of content opportunity, but it's not 5G. So 5G is incremental adds to what you see today. It's new frequencies, the last question that we had from the last call talked about what do you see 3 gig and above? We see new technology, new waveforms, new opportunities to filter to transmit to receive, very complex, and you have to do that in a device that carries 4G and 3G as well.","Current budgets are challenged, efficiency is challenged, integration capabilities, all that has to come together, and that's really good for us, that's in our sweet spot. So we look forward to that and it's going to be faced in over time as we saw 4G. There's an infrastructure side, there's obviously the handheld side.","And then the other thing that 5G will do is create network capacity expansion that will allow more and more independent IoT devices to join the network. So there's a lot there, we're excited about it, it's going to require some incredible technology investments and scale, and some of the smartest people in our company to work on this. So we're looking forward to it, it will be incremental, and it will be one of the key catalysts to getting to that double-digit growth.","Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey, Liam. Thank you. For my follow-up, on the last call, I think you guys specifically talked about tremendous amount of content increase perhaps in the back half with your largest customer. I'm curious what you're seeing there. And then also you mentioned something very interesting, Massive MIMO on the infrastructure side. You gave an example in India. I'm very curious what you're doing on the infrastructure side that involves Massive MIMO.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure. Yeah, so with respect to the infrastructure side, we have these incredible antenna arrays that we've develop and sell to our networking folks and they're quite powerful and very unique. And so we're leveraging different technology that when you see a smartphone there's a lot of low-noise amplifier technology and some switching technology and some filtering technology, but done at a higher grade and a higher level for infrastructure.","And to make all those really interesting things happen in 5G, you do need that network upgrade. So we're working on that in parallel with the great stuff that we're doing inside the handset and inside the IoT devices. And I think the infrastructure market has been somewhat stagnant for a while, the 5G step-up is a way to really light the fire again in that space, and we'll be there.","Operator","All right. Thank you. And now to the line of Chris Caso from Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yes. Hi. Thank you. Just for first question is just a housekeeping. Could you give us the split between broad market and mobile in the March quarter? And just to confirm, assume by your other comments, you're expecting broad market to increase as a percentage of revenue as you go into June, correct?","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, that's correct. So in the March quarter, broad market was approximately 27% of total revenue, so we're around that $1 billion annualized run rate. And there's a lot of design win momentum as we explained during the prepared remarks. And there will be further strong growth in the second half in broad market. As a result of that the percentage of broad market of total revenue will continue to increase.","Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. For a follow-up question, I wanted to ask about the impact of the move to 4x4 MIMO. Could you detail what that means with regard to content both on the low-band pad, as well as diversity received? Perhaps quantify the increase or give us some sense of how that affects content in both of those areas?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure. Yeah, so I think what you're seeing here now is just the push for performance. It's being delivered by more intense requirements and specifications on mid-band, high-band, low-band. Diversity received is another really important section. And then MIMO, which is going to give you some incremental data streams within a mobile device. So, that technology, the MIMO technology is now starting to flow through with some of the leading smartphone players. We have some other players that haven't yet even hit the diversity receive side that we're working with.","And again, the DRx, we call DRx diversity receive is really about downlink performance, which has been \u2013 lately it really has been the bottleneck. It's downloading high-speed video, high-speed data, the burden has been quite strong there.","So we're seeing incremental content, Chris, in these applications. So these are devices and engines that weren't needed three or four years ago, weren't required, and now they're coming forth. And certainly the leaders in the space are first to market on these technologies, but we do see the opportunity to pick up in the mid-tier as well and bring that technology forward.","Operator","Thank you. And now to the line Krysten Sciacca from Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Krysten M. Sciacca - Instinet LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. First one, I just want to dig into broad markets a little bit for this quarter. I think I had it modeled up a little stronger this quarter. So if you can maybe just talk a little bit on what were some of the push and pull factors in the quarter in broad market.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. The broad market business in Q2 I believe was about 10% sequential. And it will be a similar level coming into Q3. And it really is a diversified pool of applications and customers that we pursue, and we talked about some of them, infrastructure as part of broad markets. We have some early-stage automotive engagements that are moving along. We do a great deal of work in access points, routers, applications like Nest, Dropcams security systems. It's a very broad set of end markets and customers, and it's also a very broad set of wireless topology. So we go from Wi-Fi to Bluetooth to ZigBee to Thread, and back up the LTE if we need to. So it's a broad set of end markets and customers served by a pretty rich, deep portfolio of wireless topologies. And we work with our customers to make sure we put the right solution in the right application.","Krysten M. Sciacca - Instinet LLC","That's helpful. Thank you. And then just kind of pivoting over to mobile, I think there's been some debate between whether BAW or SAW will be used in 5G, and I feel like there is \u2013 I've heard both scenarios. And I was just wondering if you can comment on what you're seeing developing so far for 5G.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Absolutely. Yeah. I think what you're going to see in 5G is depending on the frequency and the waveform the right filter or the right engine will be deployed. So what we do at Skyworks is that we have access into all the necessary filter elements and then we bring our gallium arsenite technology, our packaging, our test technology to make sure that the engine, the transmit or receive engine, SkyOne transmit and DRx on the receive side, are going to fit the requirements of our customer.","When you get to 5G, you've got a lot of new technology. It's higher frequency. There's more challenges, there's more issues, and the solutions are not laid out yet. So everybody's going to go at it somewhat differently. You will need filtering, of course. The filtering could be bulk acoustic wave, or BAW. It could be Tc-SAW, temperature compensated SAW. But it will be high-end. It will be high performance. So I think there'll be some differentiation there of the companies that can provide not just the filter, but the complete solution to navigate the challenges within 5G. And it's going to be a great opportunity for us.","Operator","Thank you. And now to the line of Craig Ellis of B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Liam, I wanted to follow up on an earlier question regarding the return to double-digit growth, and I think a lot of that was couched in the context of what happens on the integrated mobile side. But what I wanted to ask is as you look at 5G and given the evolution of the portfolio towards a lot more IoT, how does the 5G transition for broad markets compare to what you saw in both 3G and 4G? What does that do to the company's overall growth rate?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. No, that's a great question because ultimately our job is to try to put the best products out there for our customers, and it really doesn't matter whether we call it broad or whether we call it mobile, right? So I think what's going to be interesting about 5G is you're going to start to see things like IoT really proliferate, and some of those IoT devices may carry a cellular engine, not necessarily a Wi-Fi engine, right. And we'll be able to address that. We'll have that flexibility.","So I think there's going to be some great things. We're going to have the classic, hopefully the classic upgrade cycle that we see in 5G where again we bring in new technology that is additive to what we see in smartphones. But then in parallel, one of the really important points around 5G is enabling new markets, enabling markets like autonomous driving where you need incredible high data, incredibly fast data with literally no latency, right. Instantaneous latency.","So those are markets that would be technically broad market for us but could have a very powerful growth factor and technology need that we can supply. So we'll see more and more of that industrial IoT, a lot of really creative interesting markets that need a 5G connection to really work. So we're going to see it in IoT. We're going to see it in autonomous vehicles. We're going to certainly see it in smartphones. And all of that together will hopefully support and really bring some tailwinds behind our double-digit growth rate.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Okay. And then for the follow-up, I'll ask one for Kris, and maybe part of it as a two-parter question we'll return back to you Liam. But, Kris, it looked like there was a tax benefit in the quarter. Are we now seeing a tax rate that's lower for fiscal 2018 and 2019 than what was guided last quarter at 11% and 10%, if I've got these numbers correct?","And then, Liam, it looked like there was about $120 million or so of share repurchase in that quarter and you just raised the share buyback on the last call. Is the recent level of share repurchase activity the level we should expect, or off of such robust operating cash flow, would you expect that to tick up as we go through the rest of the year? Thanks, guys.","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. So let me first answer the tax question. So for this year we expect a tax rate on or about 9.5%. For next year, previously I've said 10%, and we are still looking at on or about 10% for fiscal 2019. And then on the repurchases and the cash return to shareholders, you're absolutely right, last quarter we've initiated a $1 billion share buyback program. Last quarter we repurchased approximately 1 million shares for $112 million.","We've also indicated that it's our target to return 60% to 75% of the free cash flow back to the shareholder. We will continue to use our share buyback program, as well as our dividend program to drive the cash return to the shareholders toward that target. Definitely at the current stock price level of somewhat in the low $90s, it's a great buying opportunity and we definitely will continue to step up our share buyback program in this quarter.","Operator","Thank you. And now to the line of Bill Peterson of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Bill Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Hi. Thanks for letting me ask a question, and nice job on the financial performance. I guess you did mention that ZTE is largely in mobile but obviously some in broad markets. So I guess the question is when you look at the potential impact for the full year in broad markets, do you still sort of stick with the mid-teens type growth level, or does it come off a bit? How do you think about that? What's driving the growth really in the second half, specifically between, let's say, Wi-Fi or more EDGE devices?","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. So in terms of broad market, we target somewhere between 10% to 15% year-over-year growth. So call it somewhat in the low teens potentially approaching 15%. Obviously we have a little bit of a headwind here with ZTE. I would say probably $5 million to $10 million per quarter of the ZTE business is in broad market, especially in infrastructure. So we're having a little bit of a headwind. And so without the ZTE headwind, we would be close to 15% year-over-year growth.","Bill Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. And I believe in the last call you mentioned that CapEx could be in the range of around 10% of revenues. I guess in light of some of the weaker demand profile in the first half, how should we think about CapEx for this year?","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","So if you look historically, CapEx has been flipped away in between low 6% and as high as 13%. This year there's definitely some seasonality to it as well within the year and quarter-over-quarter. But this year we're probably going to end up somewhat in the high end of that range, especially in support of two items.","As we discussed, we have a major ramp with new platforms with leading customers coming up in the second half that are very content-rich products with a lot of filters complicated or complex integration in the back end. And so we are making the necessary capacity CapEx investments to support that growth in the second half of the year.","In addition to that we continue to make technology-driven CapEx investments improving the technology, the filter technology, the reach of the technology there. And so a combination of that will result in a slightly higher CapEx this year. Longer term we will be on or about that 10%.","Bill Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. And now to the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Please go ahead.","Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Kris, I just wanted to confirm that that calendar 2018, that the mobile business is going to grow double-digit for the full calendar year.","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","We didn't say that. And again, we haven't provided any guidance for September. But given where we are now two, three quarters into it, it's not likely that we will see double digits in mobile.","Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC","Not likely. Okay. Okay. And then on Huawei, obviously they were a 10% customer last year. Are you seeing them sort of hedged in terms of their suppliers given that they're being looked at by the U.S. government as well? Are you seeing them move into business away from you to any other supplier to sort of hedge themselves?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","No, we have not seen that. And they continue to be a strategic customer of ours.","Operator","Thank you. And now to the line of Edward Snyder from Charter Equity. Please go ahead.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","Thanks, Liam. Huawei, ignoring for a minute the potential for the U. S. government to say nothing happened, they were a 10% customer last year, which was the first time in a long time. But a lot of that was a concentration in the node. I think you've guided for when you guided about 10% or $10 in content per phone. Given the changes that have occurred in both those models this year and their unit volume issues, et cetera, do you expect them to be a 10% customer in this fiscal year?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yes. I mean, we still \u2013 the fiscal year is not over. Huawei is a very important customer. We have a great relationship there. We've populated the P20, the P20 Pro, we have infrastructure business. And they've been a great partner for quite some time. And the technology reach that we put forth there has been great for both of us. So we don't see \u2013 I can't quantify the full year right now but they're certainly an important customer, one that we spend a lot of time with, one that really values our technology. And we have, I think, a business relationship there that should prosper.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","Yeah. And I know you guys have done a spectacular job of actually solving a lot of the problems from some of your largest customers that's why you gained so much content in all these ancillary areas, especially DRx. And now that Qorvo has bugged out of the low-band pad, you got the business to yourself. But given the push especially all by the big guys of dual sourcing, we've seen a number of replaces, why should we expect them to bring someone in or open that up to other players in the next 12 months or so, both DRx or may be low-band pad? Do you anticipate new competition? And maybe going back to sharing some of these swatches based on the fact that they wanted to diversify the supply chain like we've seen in the high-bands? Thank you.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yes. I think the number one requirement for customers is great technology and conveyance of value to them, and we bring it. So competition has always been there especially at the largest customers, but the competition is at the highest of the largest customers, everybody knows where the dollars are. And I'm really happy with our team's performance and executing and raising the bar with technology in great solutions and continuing to gain.","Operator","All right. Thank you. And our final question for today comes from Srini Pajjuri from Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Clarification, Kris, on the gross margins, you said you'll see some mix benefit next quarter. But I guess as we head into the second half of the calendar, you probably have some mix headwind because of mobile coming back strongly. So can you talk about the puts and takes for the second half? And then how did you get from 50.7% to 53% which is your longer term model? Is that just a function of the volume or is it mix, or are there any other puts and takes that you can give us color on? Thank you.","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","So there's definitely two sides to the equation when you talk about gross margin. One is on the revenue side and the value creation, and the other side is the cost and cost reductions. And on both sides we continue to make good progresses. Liam talked about the level of complexity, the higher data speeds, 5G, which is coming around, that is definitely helping us to deliver more value to our customers, and that's helping from a margin point of view.","On the other side, of course, cost and cost reductions that is a key process and a key focus item of the management team. We continue to drive cost efficiencies, yield improvements, OE improvements. We continue with our filter in-sourcing process. And definitely in the second half of the year, as new ramps with leading customers is happening, we will have additional benefits there from size and scale. And so a combination of all of that will \u2013 I'm comfortable that we will steady progress towards that 53%.","Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And, Mr. Griffin, you have your final remarks?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure. Well, thank you, all, for participating on today's call. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming investor conference or other events during the quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

This call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Mitch Haws, Vice President of Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Haws please go ahead.","Mitchell Haws ","Thank you, Kieran. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' third fiscal quarter 2018 conference call. With me on the call today are Liam Griffin, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kris Sennesael, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our discussion will include statements relating to future results and expectations that are or may be considered forward looking statements. Please refer to our earnings press release and recent SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on certain risks that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially and adversely from any forward-looking statements made today.","In addition, the results and guidance we will discuss include non-GAAP financial measures consistent with our past practice. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.","With that, I'll turn the call to Liam.","Liam Griffin","Thanks, Mitch, and welcome everyone. The Skyworks team produced solid results once again in Q3. We generated a revenue of $894 million above consensus estimates. We expanded gross margin to 50.9%, up 20 basis points both sequentially and year-over-year. We delivered record Q3 earnings per share of $1.64, $0.05 better than our guidance. And finally, we continue to deploy our cash to create shareholder value, returning nearly $300 million during the quarter through share repurchases and dividends.","From a market perspective, we are entering the seasonally strong second half while on track for another year of record financial performance. Based on our Q4 outlook, we will end the fiscal year with mid-single-digit revenue growth, greater than a 10% EPS increase and record cash returns. This despite a choppy market backdrop and a government imposed trade ban on a sizable Chinese customer.","Our confidence is underpinned by our product expansion and reach, expanding premier mobile and broad market accounts. For example, during the quarter, we commenced production of access solution for Cisco, capture content and Linksys new dual-band mesh networks ramped connectivity engines for Amazon\u2019s 4K Fire TV, a leading voice enabled streaming media platform. Partnered with Sierra Wireless on LTE CAT-12 data cards for M2M applications, deployed networking solutions supporting AT&T DirecTV gateway, extended our footprint across Nest home automation platforms. Enabled LTE telematics at TM and BMW and we introduced high precision GPS functionality, improving ride sharing, mobile payment and fleet management services. We also secured strategic flagship wins at Huawei, Samsung, Oppo, Vivo, LG and Nokia. And then our infrastructure markets, we powered massive MIMO solutions for a leading European base stations supplier.","In summary, we continue to expand the aperture of a design win pipeline spanning mobile, IoT, in a broadening set of diverse end markets. With IoT, the rapid proliferation of volumes represents a significant growth opportunity for Skyworks. Ericsson, for example, estimates that there will be 29 billion connected IoT devices by 2022. And at the same time 5G is upon us to dramatically higher speeds and lower latency enabled by 5G will catalyze a wide range of uses cases from the connected battery to the autonomous car to artificial intelligence. In order to make the leap to 5G system architectures require significantly more powerful connectivity engines to ensure performance hurdles are overcome.","Skyworks is leveraging our deep systems knowledge, strategic partnerships and formidable investments to accelerate the deployment of 5G with our Sky5 platform providing end-to-end performance across this critically important new spectrum. To that end, we reached key milestones this past quarter, including the launch of our Sky5 antenna tuning portfolio. Our newest 5G solutions deliver enhanced bandwidth coverage from 60 megahertz to 6 gigahertz. This is an enormous and incremental source of content growth for Skyworks as the number of antennas increased substantially across 5G engines.","In addition, last quarter we successfully demonstrated our proprietary fully integrated Sky5 sub-6 gigahertz engines supporting new 5G and our radios across frequency bands and n77, n78 and n79. Quite simply Sky5 is enabling new 5G networks and facilitating ubiquities wireless connectivity for both people and things.","I will now turn the call over to Kris for discussion of last quarter\u2019s performance and our financial outlook.","Kris Sennesael","Thanks, Lian. Revenue for the third fiscal quarter of 2008 was $894 million, exceeding consensus estimates. Gross profit was $455 million with gross margin at 50.9%, up 20 basis points sequentially as well as year-over-year. Third quarter operating expenses were down sequentially to $130 million. As a result, we generated $325 million of operating income translating into an operating margin of 36.3%. Our tax rate was 8.9% in the quarter.","Net income was $300 million, translating into $1.64 of diluted earnings per share exceeding our guidance by $0.05.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Third quarter cash flow from operations was $258 million and capital expenditures were $191 million supporting further revenue growth in the second half of the calendar year as well as the necessary technology investments for emerging 5G opportunities in IoT markets.","Dividends paid were $58 million and we've repurchased 2.5 million shares of our common stock for a total of $240 million, bringing our total share repurchases this fiscal quarter to over 5 million shares. In fact, in fiscal '18, we have returned essentially all of our free cash flow back to the shareholders through our share repurchase program and dividend payments. And we enter the quarter with the cash and investment balance of over $1.6 billion and no debt.","Now moving on to our outlook. For the third fiscal quarter, sorry, for the fourth fiscal quarter, we expect revenue to be up 11% to 13% sequentially or $1 billion at the midpoint. We anticipate further gross margin expansion with fourth quarter gross margin between 51% and 51.5%. We expect operating expenses in the fourth quarter of $135 million. Below the line, we expect roughly $4 million in other income, a tax rate of 9% and a diluted share count of 182 million shares. Accordingly at the midpoint of these ranges, we planned to deliver diluted earnings per share of $1.91, up 16% sequentially.","Finally, today we also announced a 19% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.38 per share, reflecting our confidence in Skyworks' business model and sustainable cash generation capabilities.","With that, let me turn the call back to Liam.","Liam Griffin","Thanks, Kris. Liam. As our results and outlook demonstrates, Skyworks continues to financially outperform, driven by content-rich design wins, covering a number of strategic customers and applications, increasingly strong momentum in broad markets, world-class operational execution scale, our Sky5 platform enabling the 5G applications of tomorrow, decades of experience in developing innovative solutions over successive technology generations, and finally, superior cash flow performance allowing us to out invest our competition while providing premium returns to our shareholders.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Alright, thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Craig Ellis from B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.","Craig Ellis ","Yes, thanks for taking the question. And I'll just start with a clarification for you Kris. Kris, could you help us with the segment breakouts in the fiscal third quarter and then as we look at the guidance for the 11% sequential growth in the fourth quarter? Can you provide some color on how the segments can perform within that?","Kris Sennesael","Yes, Craig. So broad market in Q3 was approximately 30% of total revenue, was actually slightly above 30%. And so mobile was approximately 70% of total revenue. Speaking about the broad market, we continue to see really nice growth there.","We are growing in the low to mid-teens year-over-year, and so we are now at a $1.1 billion annualized revenue run rate. So we see really good strength across the board, especially the IoT segment that\u2019s including the connected home, the connected car, machine-to-machine industrial applications, some consumable applications. And in addition to that, we also see some really good traction there on the infrastructure segment, so broad market is doing really, really well.","Craig Ellis","And the second part of that clarification question was the fourth quarter. Would you expect broad markets to continue to grow in the fourth quarter? Historically it\u2019s been up in some quarters down and others?","Kris Sennesael","No. We definitely expect thrown sequential growth in broad markets into the fourth quarter. And so continue on that low to mid-teens year-over-year growth.","Operator","Thank you. And now to line of Mike Burton from Benchmark. Please go ahead.","Mike Burton","Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the results. First, the China business, can you talk about how your Chinese OEMs fair in the June quarter? And then update us on the size of that group relative to revenues and talk about how we should be thinking about the momentum of that business in the second half of calendar '18?","Kris Sennesael","Sure. Yes. So Q3 actually China faired pretty well despite some of the choppiness in the market and the specter of trade dynamics. We were able to put up some sequential growth in the Q3. If we look at China for Skyworks, it\u2019s about 25% to 30% of revenue. And of course China for us is mobile, the infrastructure, there\u2019s IoT, there\u2019s many parts. It\u2019s been a great region for us deploy emerging markets, right. A number of our players in China, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi et cetera. They also deliver globally to some of the most emerging places. So we\u2019re interest in that, we benefit from that. Should also note that we have a very diverse set of baseband partners that help us deliver in China. So we\u2019ve got within Huawei, we\u2019ve got there HiSilicon product, we\u2019ve got partnerships with MediaTek, we attached to Intel, we attached to Qualcomm. So we\u2019ve got all the bases covered and our position there was solid.","Mike Burton","And then on margins, last quarter, you talked about progress towards the 52% target in the second half with some cost initiatives to kick in. It looks like based on the guidance it's going to be dropping down 54%, 55% next quarter so some progress there. But can you just update us on your -- the latest thoughts about some of those costs initiatives and maybe a timeline for when we can get closer to that target? Thanks.","Kris Sennesael","Right. So from a gross margin point of view, I\u2019m pleased with the progress that we continue to make. So in the June quarter, Q3, we were up 20 basis points sequentially as well as 20 basis points year-over-year. For Q4, we just guided 51 to 51.5, which is up 10 to 60 basis points sequentially, so at the midpoint, up 35 basis points. So we continue to make really good progress towards our target model of 53%.","Operator","Thank you. And now to line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Please go ahead.","Ambrish Srivastava","Chris, maybe I\u2019ll start with you. Good progress, good follow-through on the capital allocation via the divi increase. But I was just a little puzzled and I was hoping you could answer these questions. Free cash flow came down a lot this quarter, and thanks largely to AR being up a lot as well as inventory. Could you help us understand what are the dynamics there? And also kind of related to that is CapEx was up a lot and you mentioned capacity as well as new investments. So does that mean that CapEx would be higher than what you had earlier guided to? And then I have a quick follow up for Liam please?","Kris Sennesael","Yes, so first of all we have a very strong cash generation business model and that continues to be very strong. Obviously there are going to be some seasonal situations. And typically Q3 is somewhat of the softest cash generation quarter in part because inventory is going up both in dollars as well as days of inventory as we are in anticipation of a strong ramp in the September and December quarter. And also from a receivables' point of view, we saw an increase of the receivables both in absolute dollars as well as DSOs because of the seasonality.","Typically in the April and May months you still have a seasonal decline and then its flicks over and starting in June you see the start of the seasonal increases. As a result of that, Q3 was from a billings point of view somewhat backend loaded. And as a result of that, you see slightly higher DSOs, slightly higher AR. And it has somewhat of a muted impact on the cash generation within the quarter.","But if you look at it from a LPM point of view, we continue to generate very strong cash, cash from operations as well as free cash flow. Having said that, CapEx in the quarter Q3 was $191 million. So it was definitely a heavy CapEx quarter. Again all or most of the CapEx there is related to capacity expansion in preparation of the steep ramp that we have in front of us here in the September and December quarter. As well as some technology related investment as we continue to be a technology leader and expand our capabilities there as well.","Ambrish Srivastava","Okay. And clearly no lack of confidence because you have daily up a lot I just wanted to make sure, I understood the dynamics. So Liam, just on the third calendar quarter, when you look at the mobile and the trends that you're seeing there, and I don't even know if there anything that such thing is seasonal anymore. But how would you characterize the environment where this is somewhat seasonal more or less, worsen that or better than that? Thank you.","Liam Griffin","Sure. Yeah. So you're saying the third calendar quarter, so the third calendar quarter we started to see this time a year preparation for some pretty sizable ramps with premier customers. And that work is ongoing. We are very comfortable on our ability to move content up and actually expand a reach of our content, that's even more important. We're bringing more technologies, higher grade functionality to really less connectivity, improved data rate and reduced late fee manage some of the more intricate designs on our DRX platforms bringing in -- MIMO architecture. Just really bringing out those rich solutions to our customers. So we're in the very, very early innings of those ramps. Again calendar Q3 and then moving into the calendar Q4 where the number should come up again. That's how it's playing out right now. We have very good visibility on this as well.","Operator","Alright. Thank you. And now to line of Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Craig Hettenbach","Yes. Thank you. Can you discuss in terms of how you're thinking about guidance just with the ZTE ban recently lifted. How that's incorporate or not into the September quarter?","Liam Griffin","Yeah. So our business with ZTE was approximately $25 million to $30 million per quarter. Obviously that was not there in Q3 and the June quarter. In the meantime, the ban has been lifted, which is good news. However, it will take time for ZTE to rebuild their supply chain that could take multiple months, if not multiple quarters. So we do expect a little bit of revenue related to ZTE in Q4, but it\u2019s just a couple of million dollars.","Craig Hettenbach","Okay. Thanks for that. And then just as a follow-up on capital allocation and just to step up noticeable uptick in buyback increasing the dividend. Liam can you talk about that move in the context of how you\u2019re also viewing M&A opportunities?","Liam Griffin","Sure, sure. Absolutely, correct. Yes, I mean, fortunately, the cash machine and the Skyworks engine is continuing to do well. The market backdrop is I believe very favorable for us. And we understand mobile, there\u2019s a lot of great stuff happening there. We're advancing the technology, expanding the reaches as I mentioned, and making some really strategic investments. We also have 5G upon us, which is going to be an incredible opportunity for Skyworks and our ability to do the complex things well. In parallel, we talked about broad markets and double-digits. So there's a lot of really needy opportunities on the table today with the card business.","Having said all that, we\u2019re fortunate to have the cash generation, the balance sheet, the powder to do acquisitions when they make sense. So we'll to look at that and we have been looking at it, but we will continue to have a very high bar and a great deal of vigilance on transactions if we go forward. So that\u2019s the best way I think frame it for you today, Craig.","Operator","Thank you. And now to line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Blayne Curtis","Let me question, Liam, I wanted to ask you there is -- you mentioned that number of OEMs in China is going to create as you look as basic in this business in China the competitiveness if we saw that this ball based solution is that becomes a bigger part of mix for the next couple of years?","Liam K. Griffin","Sure, Blayne. I think if you look at China. As I mentioned, we\u2019ve been working that region for years and have great partnerships and relationships and some incredible success stories within the leading players. As I mentioned earlier, again based in partnerships agnostic, we\u2019re able to play all the angles. So as we start to move into extending in the 5G where China is going to be a big, big player. They\u2019re all going to be some new opportunities that are going to require unique filtering, expanding carrier aggregation, much greater focus on downlink data speed, data rates and speech as we do well with our DRx. And the other thing is that your ability to solve those problems can be different depending on the supplier, depending on the customer\u2019s needs. And what we bring to the table is really that high degree of configurability where we can go in and lever TC saw, we can lever our DRx, we can love our homegrown gallium arsenide in our packaging to create really unique solution. So each customer gets exactly what they and only what they want.","As you know, in China, you have more of kind of a proliferation of models rather than one or two flagships that that\u2019s for global markets. So the ability to work with each customer and get it right based on their needs is really important. And that\u2019s what we intend to do. And I think it gives us a chance to really exceed our number shares we get into 2019 and beyond.","Blayne Curtis","And then just maybe a last one. [Indiscernible] answer them already. Just curious on the marketing ramp as we kind of compare this year, the timing of those ramps versus the last couple of years. Obviously, last year was a little bit different than you did in the prior years before that. I'm just kind of curious, as you look at that kind of guys, how that kind of competitive with our mark even?","Kris Sennesael","Yes, so you're referring to the large customer ramp, is that right Blayne? Yes, I think I assume that what it was. Yes, so the -- what we're seeing right now for ramps -- going through the second half of the calendar year following a predictable cycle, obviously there will be some production that we need to put forth now which we are doing to support our larger customers for those ramps. And what we see today just on the outlook and the projection things to be tracking similar more cycle and we'll be prepared to deliver to that?","Operator","Alright. Thank you. And now to line of Harsh Kumar from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Harsh Kumar","Yeah, hey guys. First of all congratulations volatile markets solid results by you guys. At your largest customer, Liam, I was curious if this new generation of phones has a content increase that's built in. And I'm curious if you could talk about maybe generally speaking, if you saw content increase and if you did what kind of category would you put that double digits, single digits just broad color? And then I have a follow up.","Liam Griffin","Yes, I think into too much detail Harsh but obviously it's our mission every cycle to bring a greater level of technology and performance and value to our customers. And I'm confident that that's happening again here now with the burden on mobile technology and the requirements continuing to stretch and become more daunting. It's great for Skyworks. We talked about that. We have such a wide set of technologies from Bluetooth to Wi-Fi to LTE, GPS, DRX all throughout mobile. The ability to create diversification across platforms is a big reason while we're able to raise content every year.","And some of the new technology notes that are upon us now 5G et cetera, they're not in the numbers today, but we're working on it now where we got the blueprints. And in the prototypes and our labs and we'll forward there and be positioned for the '19, '20 and beyond ramps in 5G.","Harsh Kumar","Understood. And then for my follow up. I think you said in the last call that you expected 3Q fiscal, sorry, 3Q calendar, which was the September quarter to be up and then you expect the 4Q calendar which is the March, I'm sorry, the December quarter apologize to be up again. Is that still kind accurately, I mean, you're up again. Is that the way it checks out this year?","Kris Sennesael","Yes, absolutely. That's right. ","Harsh Kumar","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And now to line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question. Maybe first one for Kris on CapEx. I don't recall Kris, whether you gave the number for Q4. And then as part of that is 10% still a good assumption to use for CapEx for the next 1 or 2 years?","Kris Sennesael","Yes, absolutely. So if you look even on LTM basis, we are approximately 10% CapEx to revenue. But there is some seasonality right some quarters are higher, a lot of quarters are lower. But if you look at it on a full year basis this year and even the next couple of years on or above 10% CapEx to revenue is a good number.","Vivek Arya","Got it. And then Liam, as we look at the back half, as I look at your September quarter outlook and maybe assuming December is kind of seasonal. Do you expect mobile sales to be up year-on-year, because if content is up. Is it just that, we\u2019re still working through some of the unit fluctuations? At what point should we start to see your mobile sales start to grow year-on-year?","Kris Sennesael ","Yes. Year ago that\u2019s definitely in the cards for us. We\u2019re not guiding December on this call, right, which is not able to go on another quarter with you. But we are gaining content, we are seeing our reach of technology expand as I mentioned. And we do expect a solid sequential into December. We haven\u2019t finalized exactly what that number is. But we absolutely expect that to be in place. It will be up year-over-year as well if we follow through with the solid sequential. So that\u2019s the best we can do today. But we feel good about making that happen.","Operator","And now to line of Krysten Sciacca from Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Krysten Sciacca","First question I have is a little broader. We\u2019ve seen major North American customers starting to reevaluate their bond and trying to minimize it as much as possible. And just given the history that we\u2019ve seen with other Chinese OEMs almost kind of mimicking what this North American customer does. Do you expect to see this trend flow through at Chinese OEMs or do you think that content is still increasing there?","Kris Sennesael","Yes, so what we are seeing in the Chinese OEMs is today at face value, the content vis-a-vis some of the larger players, the larger global players. The China opportunities are just lower and dollar value, they\u2019ve been increasing. But you may have an LTE product that has $4 to $5 of content that potentially can move to 6 to 7 and we pursue that. If you look at the more significant players that lead the market, the content opportunity is much higher. So if anything, if we could get some of the mid-tier China brands to mimic more of 1 in 2 players in the industry that would be good for us. So it\u2019s a little bit of a back and forth there. So and again in China, they don\u2019t often sell a fully global roaming product. So if it\u2019s roaming just on China Mobile, China Unicom, for example, it doesn\u2019t necessarily need the same frequency bands at a global model would need. So there's differences regionally but we honestly see the need in every case for performance and products are selected and customers decisions are really based on how well the product will perform in their application, not so much on how much does it cost.","Krysten Sciacca","And then for my follow up, speaking on the topic of China, I know the tariffs recently have kind of affected everyone a little bit differently. How do you expect that to affect your business operations if at all? Or do you fear any retaliation from China will affect your business outlook?","Kris Sennesael","No. So we have seen very little impact to or no impact from the trade war on our business with the exception, of course, of the export bandwidth CTE where we lost revenue in Q3, and Q4. The band has been lifted, but it will take some time to recuperate that revenue. If you look at the trade war in the tariff side, we are an exporter of components from the U.S., from Singapore, from Mexico into China and many other countries. There are no new import duties or tariffs on those components. And so that doesn\u2019t impact us at all. It\u2019s definitely something that we will keep evaluating and sees it on any new developments, but for now, we don\u2019t see any impact on our business.","Operator","Thank you. And now to line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS.","Timothy Arcuri","Thanks so much. Kris, it looks like in December -- it looks like your 2018 guidance you're going to grow maybe $15 million sequentially in the third calendar quarter. And if that includes only a few million dollars of ZTE, if I put that back, then it would suggest that the broad markets business is growing in excess of 20% year-over-year. Are there some one-timers in September or is that really the right sort of year-over-year growth rate going forward. Thanks.","Kris Sennesael","We can probably take this offline on the math. What I see here is that broad market in Q3 and in Q4 fiscal calendars is growing at that low to mid-teens year-over-year.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay. And then can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment? Are you seeing Qualcomm be sort of anymore of a player? They now seem to have all the pieces with the TDK JV and Winsemi and stuff. Do you see them there any of your major accounts? Thank you. ","Kris Sennesael","Yes, the Qualcomm mob situation look we respect Qualcomm they're a great technology player than in mobile for a great deal time. But if we look at the landscape today on programs that we've been pursuing and programs that we're already in, we haven't seen a significant effect. And let me also remind you that there is a number of platforms where our assets and our other chipsets will line up right next to the Qualcomm baseband. So we do have an ability to be a part of their system with our product. But their fully integrated solutions, we haven't seen too much of that. And none of that really is impacted our revenue growth.","Operator","Thank you. And now to line of Tristan Gerra from Baird. Please go ahead.","Tristan Gerra","I know you can only comment as much about ramping in North America for the second half. Are you seeing in general a departure of the typical band frequency range that used to be in previous year up to now in small cells with the new design wins that you have for the second half. And also incrementally around potential shift in market share that you see in driving this guidance which is the strongest sequential revenue growth for the past 4 years for the quarter?","Kris Sennesael","Sure. Yes, we continue to see very rich content opportunities put forth with the leading players in the industry, and that's the team that's continued for successful generations. Bands can be added as customers want to get more reach with their customer base so that happens. But the important thing is the more bands you get with technology, the more bands that you bring into with tuning application bringing in downlink opportunities on DRX and uplink opportunities on Sky1, now thinking about getting into 2019 and 2020 where we have unique 5G opportunities that are not yet resolved. It's going to put tremendous amount of pressure on systems performance and a great opportunity for those that can deliver. So that's where we're looking at.","And with respect to this the last quarter here that we just spoke about the guidance to Q4. We're very well prepared for. We certainly have good visibility on the designs that will require to make these numbers happen. And it's about execution right now and that's what we've been doing for years. So we're looking forward to executing to the ramp and also following up over the next several years as we bring 5G to the market.","Tristan Gerra","And then as a quick follow-up outside of North America, do you see any pocket of inventories in the smartphone supply chain? Or would you say that we\u2019re at normal level relative to this time of the year?","Kris Sennesael","Yes, we are absolutely normal levels for this time of the year.","Operator","And now to the line of Atif Malik from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Atif Malik","Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on consistent execution and the dividend hike. First question for Liam on 5G. You guys have a very strong portfolio with Sky5. Can you just talk about when should we expect significant revenue ramp in your 5G products? I think in the past, you guys have talked about double-digit growth in fiscal second half '19. So is there any update on when should we expect the significant ramp in 5G sales?","Kris Sennesael","Sure, sure, great question. Well, I mean, the work is underway right now and I\u2019m really proud of our team\u2019s ability to get in front of this and become one of the first movers in 5G and we\u2019re thrilled to be in that position. So what we\u2019re seeing today is a lot of design activity on both the infrastructure side and also on really kind of a heartbeat of the connectivity within smartphones. We think, again, you can get different answers, but we see revenue really being posted probably by 2020, maybe late '19. But 2020 is where I think kind of we translate around real revenue.","Now, of course, to get there, there\u2019s a lot of development work required in our teams are working with our customers and baseband providers and very close to the infrastructure side and make sure that all of this great technology comes together efficiently. Also notice Kris mentioned, we\u2019re making strategic capital investments that are unique to executing in a 5G world very complex, very, very complex products that we want to make ourselves. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at. And again, we\u2019ve had some trials and some testing with some of our 5G Solutions already. Things look good. We\u2019re going to continue to refine and again, continue to be in position to deliver in that scale when these products come to market.","Atif Malik","Great. And then a follow up, can you provide an update on your in-house bar program and if you\u2019re moving to some manufacturing?","Kris Sennesael","Sure, sure. I actually, I don\u2019t want to share the playbook on that technology right now. I think you know what's pretty well, we have some very crafty designs that will allow us to address all the necessary frequency bands and both LTE and 5G. And the work right now is progressing very, very well. And, we\u2019ll give you more on that soon.","Operator","And now to line of Bill Peterson from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Bill Peterson","I want to ask a question on mobile differently than others. So if you look at the mobile business in the September quarter, it looks like it\u2019s basically flat or slightly down from year-over-year perspective. If you can break out the content gains versus maybe the unit demand weakness amongst the large North American, Korean players in China, where are you see say the content gains versus maybe the unit demand weakness and so forth that brings it to relatively flat to slightly down? Thank you.","Kris Sennesael","Yes, so we try to unravel that the best we can. I mean, certainly, we\u2019re not seeing China is okay, but we\u2019re not seeing it as robust as we would have expected. Okay, this is all in the billion dollar number here. We thought that would be a little bit better. It is in some of that is ZTE, which is real, right. We talked about that $25 million to $30 million a quarter that\u2019s out. Samsung hasn't been a strong as other large accounts if they're okay, but we haven't seen the uptick there that we thought we could enjoy. Some of that is really a choice that we've made in certain cases to not chase commodity business, and I think that serves us well.","And the larger customers in mobile are continuing to advance the technology. And I think all of that kind of plays together. And there was a bit of a unit issue to that jumps around. And as you all know that with any customers' product ramp; it doesn't move 100% to one device. There is a roll in phase in phase out. So you always have a combination of new product prior year model maybe a year back model, so and that's the case of all of our customers. So things don't react in such a binary way. But the content acquisition is what we drive and I'm pleased with the team's ability to make that happen.","Bill Peterson","Okay. Thanks for that color. Switching over to broad markets. I think in the structure it's generally been kind of weaker portion of your business. I know a lot of other people in the markets business. But now you're talking about these MIMO opportunities and you're speaking more about infrastructure been a growth opportunity. I'd like to understand what reasons are seem strength. And maybe if you can help us size these MIMO opportunities that we do talked about a $65 plus content opportunity. If you can help us size these opportunities in the infrastructure market. Thank you.","Kris Sennesael","Yes, a lot of that is in this high performance and tenant arrays and base stations. So these are new functions that required to make 5G work. So you do have kind of a slow roll on infrastructure now with this catalyst to move to 5G and upgrade cycles that will drive 5G. We're also seeing a pretty nice step up in small cell infrastructure, small cell base stations that can happen. And if you look really long into 5G we could get into the millimeter wave technology, which we haven't house and start to see kind of neighborhood level deployments that will incorporate small cell like functionality that use millimeter wave technology. That's out there a bit but all of that is kind of in our strike zone.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Griffin for any closing comments.","Liam Griffin","Thank you all. I appreciate your time this afternoon.

At this time, I will turn the call over to Mitch Haws, Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Haws, please go ahead.","Mitchell J. Haws - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Skyworks' fourth fiscal and year-end 2018 conference call. With me on the call today are Liam Griffin, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kris Sennesael, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our discussion will include statements relating to future results and expectations that are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Please refer to our earnings press release and recent SEC filings, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for information on certain risks that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially and adversely from any forward-looking statements made today.","Additionally, the results and guidance we will discuss include non-GAAP financial measures consistent with our past practice. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Liam.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Mitch, and welcome, everyone. The Skyworks team delivered record Q4 and fiscal 2018 results, demonstrating the resilience of our business model, within a choppy end market environment. Let me begin with a few fourth quarter financial highlights.","We grew our top line by 13% sequentially and exceeded our guidance of $1 billion in revenue. We expanded gross margin by 30 basis points sequentially to 51.2%. And we produced earnings per share of $1.94, up $0.30 or 18% sequentially, and $0.03 better than our guidance. From a fiscal year perspective, we generated revenues of $3.9 billion, up 6% with earnings per share of $7.22, up 12% on a year-over-year basis.","And perhaps most importantly, we returned over $1 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, representing a 55% growth in cash returns, as compared to the prior fiscal year. Notably, the Skyworks team delivered our 9th consecutive year of record revenue and EPS, with strong design win traction across Internet of Things and mobile ecosystems.","Specifically, last quarter, we validated world-class performance of our Sky5 suite of 5G new radio solutions. Powered Samsung's Galaxy flagship phones, launched millimeter wave RF technology at major avionics suppliers and we secured wireless networking sockets at Cisco for high-density enterprise applications.","We supported DOCSIS 3.1 cable TV gateways with 2.4 and 5 gigahertz front-ends, enabled smart audio solutions across Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo gaming consoles. We captured LTE Cat M content within u-blox's machine-to-machine modules. And finally, we demonstrate exceptional momentum in automotive, ramping our connectivity and telematics solutions with BMW, Geely, Hyundai, Tesla and Toyota.","In short, we are capturing large scale design wins across all key segments, spanning industrial, home automation, enterprise, automotive and defense, as well as numerous flagship mobile platforms. At a higher level, Skyworks is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the rapidly approaching 5G upgrade cycle and build upon the strong foundation we've established over the past decade.","Our conviction is based on a number of strategic catalysts. First, we're seeing a significant uptick in demand for our base station and small cell massive MIMO solutions, as carriers around the world require LTE advanced technologies to achieve multi-gigabit speeds, driving network efficiency, higher capacity and greater coverage.","Skyworks' vast experience is at the forefront of these initial deployments, leveraging our complete portfolio, including amplifiers, circulators and switches, as well as system level highly-integrated engines. We are well positioned to support the rapid deployments of the world's leading infrastructure OEMs.","Second, on the other hand of the broadband connection, our smartphone opportunity is poised for a step up in architectural complexity, which in turn drives a dramatic increase in addressable content for us. This expansion is driven by entirely new bands, complementing existing systems, refarmed frequencies and expanded use of multi-channel carrier aggregation.","And keep in mind, Skyworks already offers the industry's broadest portfolio for 4G LTE, proven and selected by the most discerning market leading customers. We've demonstrated technology leadership across a vast set of critical product categories, as our market-tested solutions resolve increasingly complex architectures, preparing us for the performance gains demanded in 5G.","Our solutions uniquely cover the spectrum from low to high and ultra-high-bands, leveraging SkyOne and DRx modules to optimize transmit and receive performance. And beyond cellular, we augment this portfolio with equally innovative Wi-Fi, power management, precision GPS and tuning solutions. Further, we see compelling TAM growth driven by new product functionality, including 4x4 MIMO, antenna multiplexing and new millimeter wave technologies.","At the same time, the broader IoT category continues to accelerate. With expanded 5G network capacity on the horizon, we expect 75 billion devices will be connected by 2025. That's three times today's installed base.","Leveraging our leadership across all major wireless standards including 802.11ac and ax, LoRa, Bluetooth, ZigBee, Thread and Z-Wave, as well as 4G LTE and 5G, we are well positioned to capture a disproportionate share of this growth, particularly with the advent of autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, industrial IoT, and frictionless commerce.","Finally, our complementary and synergistic acquisition of Avnera provides a strategic set of differentiated solutions, as we see voice becoming a critical means of communication across a diverse array of AI and IoT applications. The acquisition of Avnera will enable us to capitalize on the rapid proliferation of cognitive radios and its convergence with our advanced connectivity engines.","With that, I will turn the call over to Kris for a discussion of last quarter's performance and our outlook for Q1.","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Liam. Skyworks' revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018 was $1.008 billion, up 13% sequentially, exceeding our guidance and consensus estimates. Gross profit was $516 million, resulting in a gross margin of 51.2%, up 30 basis points sequentially, following 20 basis points of sequential improvements in the June quarter.","Operating expenses were $136 million or 13.5% of revenue. We generated $380 million of operating income, translating into an operating margin of 37.6%, up 130 basis points from fiscal Q3.","Our effective tax rate was 9%, driving net income of $350 million or $1.94 of diluted earnings per share, up 18% sequentially and exceeding our guidance by $0.03.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, fourth fiscal quarter cash flow from operations was $209 million and capital expenditures were $112 million. We paid $68 million in dividends and repurchased 2.5 million shares of our common stock for a total of $235 million.","As this is the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, let's also review our annual results. We delivered a record $3.9 billion of revenue, up 6% year-over-year. Operating income was $1.5 billion and net income was $1.3 billion, translating into $7.22 of diluted earnings per share, up 12% year-over-year.","In addition to our solid top and bottom line growth, we generated cash from operations of $1.3 billion. We returned over $1 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2018, well over 100% of our free cash flow, with $243 million of dividend payments and $760 million in share buybacks, as we repurchased just under 8 million shares throughout the fiscal year. We ended the fiscal year 2018 with cash and investments of $1.050 billion and we have no debt.","Now, let's move on to our outlook for Q1 of fiscal 2019. Continued strength in broad markets coupled with the launch of a diverse set of new high performance mobile solutions is offsetting unit declines in premium smartphones and overall China softness.","As a result, in the first fiscal quarter of 2019, we anticipate revenue to be between $1 billion and $1.020 billion. We expect gross margin of 51.2%, plus or minus 10 basis points, and operating expenses of approximately $140 million. Below the line, we anticipate roughly $3 million in other income and a tax rate of 10%.","We expect our diluted share count to further reduce to approximately 179 million shares. Accordingly, at the midpoint of these ranges, we intend to deliver diluted earnings per share of $1.91.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Liam.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Kris. Skyworks delivered record results in fiscal 2018. Despite the near-term market weakness, we have a clear path to deliver our 10th consecutive year of revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2019. This outlook is driven by sustained double-digit growth across our broad markets business, a powerful and expanding design win pipeline encompassing a wide range of customers and applications, world-class operational execution and scale, and finally, our unwavering commitment to creating shareholder value.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of Craig Ellis from B. Riley. Please go ahead.","Craig Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Thanks for taking the question, guys, and congratulations on the Avnera deal close. So, just the first question is following up on some of the prepared remarks regarding some of the things that you're seeing on the integrated mobile side. Is it possible to break out the relative impact of the unit issue that you're seeing with high-end smartphones versus the China softness that you're seeing vis-\u00e0-vis a flat headline guide versus what I think would be plus 5% to 6% seasonality?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure, Craig. This is Liam. Yeah. If we look at Q4 and moving into Q1, I mean, what we have here is a great demonstration of content gain and moving up to some very complex engines within premier smartphones and that had been a lot of hard work that we've done over the last six months to nine months to make that happen. So, those devices were ready and rolling and demonstrated strong performance in Q4 and that same set of platforms rolling into Q1 were discounted on a unit basis. So again, a lot of great content and premier Tier 1 smartphones, but a bit of a unit miss here that came in kind of late for us entering Q1.","On the China front, China continues to be an important market for us. We have a very diverse position, strong relationships with Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, great alignment with the media tech platforms as well. So, that market tends to have a little bit of seasonality going into Q1 as the premier Tier 1s tend to occupy and contain most of the share in the December quarter. But the China business is relatively in line with our expectation there.","Craig Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","That's helpful. And then the follow-up, maybe two-part question, one part for you, one part for Kris. Kris, can you specify what the Avnera contribution is in both fiscal fourth quarter and what you baked into your fiscal first quarter guide?","And then longer term, Liam, can you provide some parameters around how we should think about the way this business can scale within your broad markets group and to what extent is it going to gain leverage and fraction from the channels that you have within integrated mobile? Thanks, guys.","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure, Craig. This is Kris here. So, we closed the Avnera acquisition on August 17, so we basically had six weeks of Avnera on our books in the September quarter. Revenue was approximately $6 million, at above average gross margin. So, we are very pleased with the acquisition there. In the guidance for the December quarter, we included $15 million to $16 million of revenue for Avnera.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Right. And alongside that, Craig, just to kind of follow-up on the broad markets piece. The Avnera portfolio lines up very well with the technologies that we've deployed already today. So, if you think about historically the acquisition of SiGe that we made several years ago, how we levered that unique technology, very specific technology and brought that through our channel, not only in smartphones but through a broad set of IoT customers, that same strategy will be deployed with Avnera and early innings look really good there.","Craig Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Thanks, guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just curious, I know in this environment, you probably don't want to venture too far into March, but just kind of curious given its reset and a quarter that's typically stronger, do you have any perspective as to how that translates into March?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure, Blayne. Yeah, I mean, it is a little tough to go into March here, but we feel that the dynamics that we're describing that are imputed in our guidance right now capture most of the pain here into Q1 and we expect \u2013 I would expect normal seasonality going into the March quarter. That's the way we look at it.","You still have a broad markets business that has been able to offset weakness in mobile when that occurs. We typically do have kind of some mobile seasonality in March, but there's nothing that we see today that would give us any kind of concern that there's going to be problems there. So, we feel good about it. We are seeing more and more gains in the broader markets. The Avnera business is going to help. So, we're in better position than we had been in the past to weather the storm in a March quarter.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Then maybe just a question for Kris on gross margins. The Avnera deal is accretive gross margins, obviously you're seeing a unit headwind, so that should hurt some of your absorption. Can you just walk us through the moving pieces there? I mean, if you look year-over-year, margins are down a little bit. I know you've talked about kind of that margin clicking up over a longer horizon, 10 bps, 20 bps a quarter, can you just maybe walk us through the moving pieces there?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. Absolutely. So, first of all, in the September quarter we further improved our gross margins with 30 basis points, in addition to 20 basis points that we added in our second fiscal quarter. So, I'm pleased with that. We will continue to drive further gross margin improvements. Obviously, volume growth always helps with that. And so the guidance for the December quarter is kind of flattish from a revenue point of view and so also flattish from a gross margin point of view, but as we look into the back half of fiscal 2019, we will continue to make further improvements on gross margin towards our target of 53%.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso from Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. Good evening. I guess first question would be with regard to 5G content and I guess Liam, I'm not sure I feel like we have the whole picture here with regard to where your content is going to stand with 5G with some of the new frequency bands. Last quarter, I think the word you used is that you're being crafty. Is it safe to say there's some new technologies that perhaps you're not ready to talk about now, but things that would strengthen your position, allow them to \u2013 allow you to address some of the new frequency bands and some new technologies needed as we go into 5G, more than what's been disclosed so far?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure, Chris. Absolutely. Good question. So, let me just begin with the fact that we are extremely well positioned to lead in 5G. There's a big step-up in technical performance. We're working with customers today. We're sampling. We're getting feedback. We're getting validation on what we're doing and how that's going to work in their system. So, that's for sure. And that will include enhancing and upgrading even the backward compatibility in 4G. Even those devices will need to be altered in some way to work in a 5G world. And then when you move into 5G proper, when you start to really deliver frequencies above 3 gig and above 6 gig, there's some new technologies.","Millimeter wave is an opportunity and a technology that we have some great expertise on and we think that would be compelling and differentiated in our customer solutions and it's a technology that we're being asked to deliver now and asked to sample now. You're going to see more and more work done in our filtering technology. Not only on the low-band that gets enhanced and the mid band, but we're going to start to really step up in high-band. And having said that, actually, we've done a lot of work to develop our filter technology and we've talked a little bit about it, but we didn't fully disclose some of the work that we've been doing.","And today, we're ready in BAW. We're developing BAW in-house. We've made targeted investments. It's part of Kris' CapEx number here and we're working on sampling and we have number of customers that are very interested and we're iterating through the normal process that we have with all of our technologies, but we will be ready when 5G comes for full capability across the whole spectrum.","Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. That's pretty helpful. Thank you. And if I could just return to some of your earlier comments with regard to some of the unit headwinds you were facing now and my interpretation of your comments is that, that was Tier 1 unit headwinds is what you were referring to. As you went to last year, there was some abnormal seasonality with regard to shipments. The timing was a little bit different. Did that have something to do as we're looking at the year-on-year growth that you're looking into December quarter, does that also have something to do with it as well? And if you could help us to do the math there.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, the timing is tricky. I mean, as you know, Chris, our job is to put forth the most compelling content and grow that content and advance our customers' performance and we did all of that. So, it's tricky to see how the dynamics are playing out. I think some of the signals that the Tier 1 players have provided have been helpful, that everybody's understanding and digesting that.","As we get into March, as I mentioned on the last question, it is kind of early to tell, but we don't expect anything out of the ordinary. We still have a solid robust broad markets business. I mean, some of the APAC players don't have the negative cycle in the March quarter. In some cases, that can be offset.","The other thing I would say is just reflecting back on the prepared remarks, we are still modeling growth in 2019. So, we're absolutely committed to delivering top-line and EPS growth through the fiscal 2019 quarter. So, it's only Q1 here that we're talking about, but we're comfortable with that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Please go ahead.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Thank you very much. Liam, just so that we're all on the same page, how would you characterize normal seasonality for the March quarter? I know the business has now it's got a little bit more of the broad-based segment as well. And then I had a follow-up for Kris.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, market seasonality, it tends to be 10% to 15%-ish or so, I'd say, 12% at the midpoint. I mean, we always aspire to do better. It is early to make that call. We're just concluding Q4 and guiding Q1. But, that's the typical range that we see. We certainly do expect some of the things that we do in non-mobile areas to offset potential mobile volatility. But net-net, as I said, we're committed to growth in the year. March, I'm sure, we'll be fine in March, but that quarter's not fully guided.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then on the modeling front, Kris, what is the CapEx and then also the OpEx implications from the acquisition, please? Thank you.","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, so from a CapEx point of view in fiscal 2018, we spent slightly over $400 million in CapEx, which was just over 10% to revenue. We continue to expand the capacity in our filter operation as well in our back-end operation. And as Liam indicated as well, we continue to advance the technology in those factories and make the necessary technology-related CapEx investments as well. So, going forward, I do expect CapEx to stay on or about the same level as a percent to revenue as it was in fiscal 2018. In terms of OpEx, you can see a little bit of a step-up here in the December guidance and that's mainly driven by a full quarter of the Avnera OpEx that will hit us in the December quarter.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya. Please go ahead.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking my question. First, just a clarification. Kris, could you give us the mix of mobile and broad markets for September and what you're expecting for the December quarter?","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure. So, in the September quarter, broad market was approximately 28% of total revenue. It was growing double-digit on a year-over-year basis, as well on a full-year basis, broad market was growing double-digits. So, we're very pleased with the performance there. We have now an annualized run rate of $1.1 billion in our broad market and looking ahead into Q1 of fiscal 2019, we continue to see very strong double-digit year-over-year growth. So on the flip side, of course, we have our mobile business which was 72% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then maybe Liam, one more on the visibility as we look forward, right. You mentioned that December is perhaps the bottom here and that you could get back to seasonal trends in March. I'm curious what is giving you that confidence? If you could perhaps give us some real-time sense of orders, have they stabilized? Just in general, right, give us some more confidence that December is the bottom and things could get back to normal for March. Or is it primarily predicated on your broad market seasonally doing better and China are returning back to growth and offsetting whatever remaining declines are at your larger U.S. customers?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Right, no, that's a great question. As I said, it's really hard to give a full, complete view of the March quarter. What I would say is from where we stand today, we comprehended what we thought were the magnitude of the reductions that we could see and we've contemplated those in our guidance. We look at the March quarter and we expect it to be in the range that I just articulated, somewhere in the 10% to 15% sequential, which is normal. We do have some positive catalysts around broad markets. So, we think a better China environment in that period. And then we'll see what happens with Tier 1 smartphone units. But we should be positioned to outperform and hopefully the market warms up a little bit. But in any case, again, we are committing to a full year, full fiscal year of growth in earnings, top line and bottom line.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you. Liam, just to follow-up on that point, just looking at how the fiscal year could potentially play out. So, December and March would be down roughly 3% or 4% year-over-year and to grow in the full fiscal year, is there anything unique happening right now from an inventory perspective or unique in the back half of next year? You have kind of line of sight from a content just as to get to growth after the first half looks to be a little challenged?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. I think we should expect some recovery going into the second half of the year and then we have a lot of new design wins and platforms and programs that we're ramping mobile, but in many cases, some of the broad market work that we're doing, lots of opportunity with the Avnera channel we're already seeing customers embrace the Skyworks brand and our scale. Quite frankly, what we offer there is more than just a sales and marketing team. We have a tremendous reach operationally to do some high levels of integration where they have a discrete product line, so all of that's going to roll in, in addition to the core organic business. So, those are some of the things that give us a sense of bullishness as we look out into the second half and through the full 2019.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then just a follow-up on Avnera, and you mentioned kind of the SiGe success story. Anything else you can kind of tie into that in terms of the playbook or how you see, because Avnera has been around for a while, but just really your distribution and the ability to kind of ramp that business more strongly on the Skyworks ownership.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. Absolutely. So, a couple of things. There is certainly an element around customer engagement and we have a great opportunity to leverage the years and years of customer work that we've done and the trust that we've built with our accounts to now bring Avnera through that channel. That's one. We also have some amazing ability to create new solutions that would be very difficult for them to do on their own, leveraging our ability to package and test and bundle, kind of think of it as a point product versus an integrated solution, i.e., SkyOne, right, how we've taken fundamental technology and wrapped it up into an engine, a system that made it much easier, much easier for the customers to consume.","So, they're doing some really special work in cognitive radio. So, it's not just the audio portion, but it's also these highly sensitive microphones that listen and discern the voice or the signal to create a connection. So, some incredible things that we can do together and the partnership should really form well. It'll take some time before we see all the revenue build up. But we do think it will be an impact positively in 2019 and in outer years certainly a significant opportunity.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research. Please go ahead.","Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","Thank you. Liam, what do you mean by you're ready today in BAW? Have you sampled duplexers in BAW? If so, what bands? We've heard of single band Rx filter samples. Beyond that, we've not seen anything. So, I'm just curious, you seem to make a much stronger statement about BAW this quarter than I've heard in any of your periods in the past. What's changed?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","What's changed? What's changed is that we've done a lot of hard work, Ed. We've made investments in the technology. Our engineering teams have been working this for a long time and I haven't been talking about it, because we weren't ready. But we're ready now. And we are sampling with key accounts. I don't want to get into all the details there. But we are sampling. We're getting feedback. There's credible iteration around the process and around the end products. And as you know, we do it differently. We're not going to be a discrete filter company. We're going to be a systems level company. We're going to leverage that technology in our Sky5 suite and just stay tuned for more developments.","Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","Is most of this going to be focused then in some of the new products, the future products that you're putting out, especially with regard to Sky5 and attacking \u2013 and now there's going to be higher frequency bands in 5G? Is that what we can expect to see the first samples of this?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, yes. So, we wouldn't \u2013 our role here and our ambition is to move forward into 5G and there may be an opportunity for us to go back in the legacy architectures, but I don't think that's really the sweet spot. It's really the leverage that we have in providing customers a full suite of proven LTE solutions from SkyOne to diversity we see, augmenting that with 5G technology and then bringing some really compelling stuff in the high-band to our customers. And I mean, clearly this is something that's been on our agenda for a long, long time. We haven't talked much about it, but we're ready now. And you're right. This is a lot more than we've said in the past and there's a good reason for it.","Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","Okay. That makes a lot more sense. And then if I could, it seems clear from this standpoint already that next year's premium phones, especially Tier 1 manufacturers, running head-long into this antenna problem. And it looks like they'll be pulling some BAW-based DRx functionality into this. And I know they kind of redesigned the whole thing. Where does that put Skyworks? You've got a huge amount of content in that tear-down show you've got, significant increase year-over-year in content in that section too. I don't expect you to be locked out, giving you the premier supplier. But does that put you at a little bit of a disadvantage for those bands that are looking at lowering insertion loss? Or is it something that you could do with this new technology you're talking about?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. No, we're very solid in the whole DRx family from low to mid to high. And that's been in place for a while and there's obviously iterations and improvements in performance that we make annually. On the antenna multiplexing, I think that's a new opportunity for us that we will also pursue. So, we will certainly protect our core on low-band and high-band and DSM as we go forward. And our filtering technology today is perfect for that and we know how to curate and alter that if we need to.","But some of the other opportunities that are out there are still on the drawing board and we'll have the technology to address. It's not going to all happen in one cycle, but I'm really pleased with the team's performance, their patience, their diligence, the hard work, some of the devices that we're putting forth today. I'm really happy with and I think we'll be able to demonstrate that in the market very soon.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.","Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks. If I look at the overall revenue growth, you guys have sort of barely grown year-over-year, despite all the content growth the past couple quarters and despite broad markets growing kind of like low teens year-over-year. So, if I look into March and I assume sort of a down 10% to 12% normal seasonal, you're going to be, it looks like down again year-over-year in March. So, can you just again highlight why is that the case? Is it really high-end smartphone? Is that why the company's not really growing the last four quarters? Thank you.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, listen, we just grew fiscal 2018. We're going to grow fiscal 2019. We talked about that. The fundamental change here from what would have been a more bullish guidance is really the unit change with some of the premier higher-end players, where the content has been very significant. I mean, that's the fundamental issue. I mean, there's some China softness, but that's not a big surprise for us. I mean, that's something we've contemplated.","And we have a broad set of accounts. We have a broad set of technologies that we're bringing to market. We have new solutions coming out into 5G. We have an IoT landscape that continues to grow at double-digits and a broad markets that continues to grow at double-digits. So, we're not guiding the whole quarter-by-quarter, but we are comfortable with providing an outlook for the year in total, which will be top-line growth and bottom line growth.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Liam, just I want to understand the \u2013 I understand the outlook being a little bit weaker because of the unit weakness, but given your content expansion, I would have expected a little bit more upside to the quarter. You came in line which is pretty decent, but I'm curious, did you \u2013 I mean, have you started seeing the weakness in the quarter itself? Or were there any other puts and takes that impacted the quarter?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","In the Q4 period, not really. A little bit of softness in China. I think it was a fairly strong quarter for us. We exceeded guidance. We grew EPS by $0.30, 18%. The Q1 impact is what we're seeing now and we're talking through. So, I think that's something that we've imputed into the guidance. We think we've taken the right amount of pain in the guidance on that. Our content position is solid. There's no share loss in our leading platforms. So, it's not a case where we fumbled and didn't execute or weren't able to win the sockets that we pursued. But across the most compelling platforms, the larger Tier 1s, there's a bit of an impact there. We'll be able to recover from it. There's other parts of the business that are doing really well. And I think this part of the business will recover as well.","Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. And then just to follow-up on that Liam. As we look out to the next fiscal year, I'm guessing 5G, it's a little bit early, but over the next four quarters, can you talk a little about the competitive environment in 4G? It looks like Qualcomm is definitely making some progress and the market is not growing in terms of units and are you seeing any more pricing dynamics out there and any more intensity in terms of the competitive nature? Thank you.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, what I'm seeing and this has been a theme that's been going on for a while, is that the competitive landscape, honestly, is getting more and more driven by two or three players, right, maybe four. And you have to have a broad set of technologies and you have to have the agility to work with multiple customers and solve their problems.","And the complexity within mobile platforms, especially at the high end, and the high end is where all the money is being made by the way. It's where the money is being made by the OEMs, and they rely upon suppliers that can do the hard work for them. The hard work delivering very, very high performance transmit and receive Wi-Fi, tuning, having the scale and having the techniques to do the filtering that we've talked about in the last few questions, all of that.","So we don't really \u2013 in fact, that environment has been very good for Skyworks. It's given us a chance to outperform and leverage our technical expertise, our manufacturing scale and the investments that we've made in some of these high-performance filters. So, I think the competitive field is going to narrow and the complexity and challenge is going to be very, very high and those that can deliver and meet that challenge will do well. And we'll be among the few that can do that.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Bill Peterson with JPMorgan.","Bill Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking the question. I guess, when we think about the full-year growth that you're talking about next year, and implied it's going to be stronger in the second half. What is this driven by? Is it 5G? Is it more content in China? Increased content in some of the flagships? What type of products? Is it tuning plexing? More diverse to receive? If you can help us understand what's going to drive this growth next year, that'd be helpful.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, there's certainly there's new developments across multiple parts of the business. In the mobile side, we're continuing to drive a content move across all parts of the portfolio. So, we talked a little about the high end, but also in the mid tier. There's an equally important opportunity to take mid-tier players in China and other markets and even some of the Samsung portfolio, to take mid-tier phones up a level to advance their technology in 4G.","And we are starting to see, and we are developing right now, 5G solutions that we know are going to market and they're going to create a meaningful catalyst. We talked about that in the prepared remarks. There will be meaningful new technologies in 5G product. That's an opportunity for everyone in our space to pursue and I certainly like our opportunity, given our experience with customers, the manufacturing assets that we have, the technologies that we have, and the ability \u2013 and I'll use the word crafty again \u2013 the ability to do very, very hard things with very high demand from customers and be able to have the flexibility to make it work for each and every one.","The more you go long in the technology and you move into 5G, people do it differently. Customers do it differently. They select different bands. They have different performance budgets, current budgets, and it makes it more challenging for the suppliers. And having that know-how and that broad breadth of experience with baseband providers and multiple customers puts us in a good position.","So, we'll start to see that in the second half of this calendar year, more and more complex engines. The IoT space continues to move up. The Avnera opportunity, we're getting our first year of that. That's going to be incrementally positive for us as well. So, there's a number of very positive catalysts going on here as we get through the Q1 and Q2 periods.","Bill Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. As my follow-up, maybe sticking on 5G, you talked earlier about millimeter wave. A competitor discussed in their call yesterday that millimeter wave would be required at launch next year. I guess the first question is, do you agree with that? And I guess I would think that sub-6 would be more likely to start in millimeter perhaps later, but if you can expand on your expectations from the market perspective and then as well as expand on your own millimeter wave products both for maybe infrastructure as well as a smartphone.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure. Yeah, we are seeing a kind of a stepped up pace on millimeter wave and we'll be positioned to deliver on that. So, that's something that could be a very positive catalyst for the industry. We are absolutely positioned to execute in that area, certainly on the handheld side and also on the infrastructure side. There's a lot of IP in our company that goes back into the infrastructure days where we have a lot of IP around millimeter wave and some other technologies that we can deploy that typically hadn't been used, quite frankly, in handheld devices.","So, if we're able to deliver that, I think would be exceptional. We are working on it. It's not new for us. It's just about the pace in which our customers want to deploy the technology. We'll be ready on the semiconductor and system side. It's really a matter of when does the market want to see this technology in a commercial use.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, Kris and Liam. It would appear the acquisition of Avnera is a precursor for additional bolt-on M&A. Are voice applications a primary focal point going forward? Or are other areas such as networking infrastructure, more palatable as you build your economic around 5G? And separately, how much cash do you think you need to run the business today? Thank you.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure, I'll start and then I'll pass it over to Kris. Yeah, I think one of the things, Karl, that we like is \u2013 in our deals and obviously we haven't done many and those that we've done have worked out pretty well. We had a very discerning view on these transactions. But one of the things that we like about this technology is that it dovetails so well into the areas that we've already created some real value. So, there's common set of customers in some areas, both in IoT and in somewhat in mobile. There's an opportunity for an integration process to occur, leveraging their core IP more at the chip level and then wrapping that up with our MCM technology and our packaging technology to do something even bigger.","And then we just have kind of a real broad customer scale opportunity across the globe, but we have a big team at Skyworks that's in just about every mobile and IoT customer you could imagine and comparing that with a great organization at Avnera, but just much, much smaller. So, you could see how that leverage plays. And the technology today is really good. We don't have to fix their technology. It works. It's great. It's just a matter of bringing it to market and maybe changing some of the form factors to create more upside and more configurability.","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","And so on the question of the cash to run the business, well, we ended last quarter in the fiscal year with just over $1 billion of cash and investments on the balance sheet. That's definitely a level that's very comfortable. We actually need a little bit less of cash just to run the business. So, we do have still excess cash.","Given also the fact that we generate a ton of cash, we have a very strong cash flow from operations and very strong free cash flow. We continue to target free cash flow margin of 30% and we will also continue with our cash returns to the shareholders. As we indicated in the prepared remarks, we returned more than $1 billion of the cash to the shareholders during fiscal 2018 and we will continue to do so in fiscal 2019 through our dividend program as well as our share buyback program.","Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you, gentlemen.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I had a follow-up on BAW. Congratulations, by the way, on getting BAW done in-house. We are hearing that the 5G handsets, at least some models, will be out in the second half of calendar next year. Liam, do you think your BAW products would be ready commercially around that timeframe?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. It's possible. We're in the middle of our design work and our sampling right now. So, I don't want to hang a date on that, but certainly in the next 12 months to 18 months, as I indicated. So, it's possible. It could be sooner. There's a lot of work to be done to validate and kind of leverage that spectrum. So, we'll wait and see, but we're definitely going to be a player in that segment.","Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. And then for my follow-up, I wanted to ask another question on China. I assume that China is down in December. Did I hear you say correctly that by the March timeframe that China would be back to normal seasonal trend? And maybe you could tell us what that might be. Is China usually ticking up in March or is it usually down for you in March?","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","No, the seasonal trend is a sequential decline into the December quarter, a pretty strong sequential decline into the December quarter; but then typically in March, we see the business coming back with a sequential increase.","Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you guys.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Okay. Well, thank you all for participating on today's call. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences during the quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation.

This call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Steve Ferranti, Vice President of Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Ferranti, please go ahead.","Stephen Ferranti","Thank you, Kathy. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks first fiscal quarter 2016 conference call. Joining me today are Dave Aldrich; Don Palette; and Liam Griffin. Dave will begin today's call with a business overview, followed by Don's financial review and outlook. We will then open the lines for your questions.","Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those noted in our earnings release and those detailed from time to time in our SEC filings.","I would also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we will discuss today are from a non-GAAP income statement, consistent with the format we've used in the past. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations Section of our company website for a complete reconciliation of GAAP.","With that, I will turn over the call to Dave for his comments on the quarter.","David Aldrich","Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. We had a solid first quarter performance with revenue profitability and earnings ahead of expectations in spite of the challenging macro environment.","Specifically, during the quarter we delivered revenue of $927 million, that's up 15% year-over-year. We produced operating income of $367 million, that's up 30% year-over-year, translating into a 39.6% operating margin. And we posted $1.60 in earnings per share, that's up 27% versus the prior year. We also generated more than $345 million in operating cash flow and ended the quarter with just over $1.2 billion in cash on hand and with no debt.","This was another well-executed quarter from the Skyworks team. Our content gains, our diversification and our disciplined operational focus were key factors in achieving these Q1 results.","And as we look ahead, we continue to see tangible opportunities to capitalize on a number of high-level growth trends across the technology landscape. These include growing consumption of wireless data within consumer and enterprise applications, advancements in cloud-based services, the proliferation of connectivity within the emerging markets and increasing adoption to the Internet of Things.","These macro themes are irrefutable and they are far reaching, creating expanding uses for our technology and higher addressable content opportunities with each new product generation. Leveraging our industry-leading integration capabilities, we positioned Skyworks to capitalize on these powerful market tailwinds.","Now, despite these positive long-term drivers, this year the March quarter, which is normally a seasonally soft period, has been impacted by above normal forecast reductions and inventory adjustments at one of our top customers. This dynamic has been well documented across the supply chain over the last few weeks.","After closely analyzing the market environment, we have adopted an appropriately conservative outlook for our Q2 revenue guidance. However, through strong gross margin performance and a disciplined focus on cost, the overall impact to EPS is relatively small and our guidance represents high single-digit earnings growth on a year-over-year basis. Don will provide more specifics later in the call.","It is worth emphasizing that we're well-positioned for a strong second half of calendar '16, based on clear visibility into design wins across our flagship smartphone customers. And from this vantage point we are highly confident in our prospect for gaining dollar content within upcoming generations, putting us on track to continue delivering above market revenue growth with expanding profit margins and earnings leverage.","Before providing a more detailed view of the market, I'll turn it over now to Don for more in-depth review of the financial results.","Donald Palette","Thanks, Dave. Thanks for joining us everyone. Revenue for the first quarter was $926.8 million, in line with our guidance and up 15% versus the year-ago quarter. Gross profit was $476.1 million or 51.4% of revenue, ahead of guidance and up 470 basis points from the quarter of fiscal 2015. Operating expenses were $109.5 million, consisting of R&D expense of $71.9 million and SG&A expense of $37.6 million.","We generated $366.6 million of operating income, up 30% from the year-ago quarter, translating into a 39.6% operating margin. Our cash tax rate was 15%, resulting in net income of $311.2 million or $1.60 of diluted earnings per share, as compared with diluted EPS of $1.26 in the year-ago quarter. That equates to a 27% year-over-year earnings growth.","Turning to our first quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement. We invested $79.5 million in capital expenditures, with depreciation of $51.5 million. We generated $345 million in cash flow from operations, which includes the $88.5 million termination fee from PMC-Sierra, and exited the quarter with over $1.2 billion in cash on hand and no debt.","Moving to product mix. For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, power amplifiers represented 16% of revenue, integrated mobile systems was 64% and broad markets was 20%. We saw a healthy growth in both integrated mobile systems and broad markets. In fact, IMS was up a full 16 points versus a year ago as a percentage of our mix. Power amplifier products continue to decline as a percentage of our revenue, as the market shifts toward higher-value integrated solutions.","Now, for our second quarter business outlook. We expect second quarter revenue to be approximately $775 million. We suggest modeling gross margin in the range of 50.5% to 51%, with operating expenses flat to Q1 at approximately $109.5 million. It's worth noting that the midpoint of our gross margin guidance range implies over a 400 basis point improvement versus the prior year. Our strong gross margin outlook, in the face of current market dynamics, highlights the benefits of our higher-value integrated systems along with our scale and flexible manufacturing operations.","Looking ahead, we see continued opportunity for margin improvement, as we leverage our recent capital investments and ramp our custom integrated solutions and precision analog products. For modeling purposes, we recommend using a 60% incremental gross margin off of the second quarter baseline. We are targeting a goal of at least 53% gross margin for the company and have a number of initiatives in place to accelerate our progress toward achieving this goal.","Below the line, we anticipate $500,000 in interest and other expenses and a cash tax rate around 15%. We project our tax rate to remain at these levels for the remainder of our 2016 fiscal year. We expect share count to be around 194.5 million shares, resulting in second quarter EPS of $1.24, and that's up 8% versus last year.","Finally, we recently entered into an agreement to divest Trans-Tech, a small subsidiary of ours, to Kyocera for roughly $42 million. Trans-Tech produces ceramics substrates and materials for a number of broad market applications and had become non-critical to our corporate strategy. We expect the transaction to close sometime in early April.","For modeling purpose, we recommend assuming around $40 million per quarter of revenue impact, starting in the June quarter, with no impact to EPS. This transaction helps to improve the financial returns of our business, while sharpening focus on our core strategy.","Our Q2 margin and EPS guidance highlights the robustness of our business model within the context of challenging market conditions. For the second half of calendar 2016, we see momentum building off of this baseline. Many of the drivers supporting this are already in place, giving us a high-level of confidence to extend our track record of best-in-class financial results, and we remain on track toward our mid-term goal of $8 in annualized EPS.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over Dave.","David Aldrich","Thank you, Don. Before closing and taking your questions, I wanted to take a moment to reiterate a few market realities that will continue to fuel our growth in the coming years.","First, demand for wireless data continues to skyrocket, with no end in site, driven by the adoption of streaming media and cloud-based services across consumer and enterprise applications. Now, these services are in their infancy and consume a tremendous amount of bandwidth, drastically increasing demands on network and on devices.","Secondly, growing data consumption requires dramatically higher levels of analog performance at the semiconductor level. To improve throughput, our customers are facing mounting technical challenges, including navigating spectrum with limitations, improving signal reliability and mitigating interference, all while extending battery life. The end result is greater addressable content per device and TAM growth well in excess of the semiconductor sector.","Third, as a technology integration leader, we are consolidating market share, and our visibility to new content wins and future architectures is very strong. The solutions we're developing for future generations are tremendously complex, and they require best-in-class core technologies, advanced integration capabilities and deep system-level expertise.","Skyworks is uniquely positioned in all these regards to address these opportunities. This fosters closer engagement with customers and higher-value solutions across the board, with a narrowing field of capable competitors.","And fourth, the Internet of Things is real and it's happening today. Facilitating entirely new growth avenues for us and enhancing our diversification. At this year's Consumer Electronic Show, there was a showcase of groundbreaking new devices, leveraging the power of wireless connectivity.","Much of the excitement at CES this year was around innovations in the connected car in the automated home, wearable technologies and entirely new categories like drones, utilizing enabling technologies like GPS, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, Bluetooth and others. And we participate, as Skyworks, in all of these markets to our suite of connectivity solutions.","And lastly, we've successfully redefined our business model, combining a strategic focus on higher value-added integrated solutions, with unrivalled scale, with advanced manufacturing capabilities and deep operational know-how. The end result is that we are consistently delivering among the best financial returns in the semiconductor sector in a variety of market conditions.","As just one measure of this, our return on invested capital for 2015 was 33% and over the last two years we've averaged 30%. So in closing, looking past the near-term volatility, we've created a unique and robust business model, fueled by the proliferation of connectivity and combining above-market topline growth, healthy cash flow and the financial returns of a best-in-class diversified analog company.","So that concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open the line for questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer.","Rick Schafer","My first question is just really what are your expectations, I guess, for the overall RF content growth for the overall market over the next couple years? And if you guys expect to outgrow the market, where do you have the most leverage there to take share?","Liam Griffin","Well, we think the market for smartphones, for example, is going to grow in mid-single digits. However, if you look at the complexity, analog and RF complexity is driven by increasing band count by a higher adoption rate of AC, carrier aggregation and other complex switching algorithms, looking to improve the signal integrity on the receive side through DRx technologies, high-performance low-noise amplifiers.","We think the market growth rate would be at least double that for our class of products. And of course, we look to a broadening array of vertical markets and IoT to continue to round out the business and become more diversified with higher margins.","Rick Schafer","And then a follow-up to that. Can you discuss content trends that you're seeing with the Chinese handset OEMs? And maybe putting in context, how that growth there compares with what you're seeing with from the Tier-1 guys maybe in Korea, North America, wherever? And maybe part of that answer, I'm curious, what you expect to see in terms of the impact from the move to five mode, the five-mode rollout in China?","Liam Griffin","Well, China is certainly a growth driver for Skyworks. We're in the early innings of a 4G upgrade cycle. And just in the last quarter, December quarter, we're up about 20% year-over-year across China. Now, there has been some choppiness and near-term volatility, and we understand that well. We've been in this market for quite a while.","We are encouraged by the content growth and the move towards these system solutions that we speak of. We're starting to see that with the larger Tier-1s in China and also the white-box players. And we're continuing to go beyond just the trend that receive solutions to start to move into things like Wi-Fi and GPS and power management. So that's all positive.","And as we see this move to five-mode, clearly that's incremental content. So we are seeing that move up. It's really in line with the China subscribers wanting more and more functionality and more capability, and that plays right into our strength. So we're very positive about that and expect China to be a long-term grower for us.","Operator","Our next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya","Dave, beyond the sort of well-advertised slowdown or inventory adjustment at your largest customer, what has been the trends at your Korean and your Chinese customer? I think they're all trying to assess whether this was a one quarter problem for your industry or whether there are any other longer-term impacts. If you could give us some insights into that, I think will be very useful for investors.","David Aldrich","I think, as Liam commented a moment ago, Vivek, the China TAM story and the upgrade to 4G has been very positive for the company. In fact, I think we were something like 20% year-over-year growth in our China revenue in the December quarter. And that's content, that share that's being lined out with the right set of baseband and SoC partners.","And if you look at our customer, Samsung, on our second largest customer, we've seen very high attach rate now with our more complex solutions in the Galaxy 7 and then in their emerging 16 platforms. And the fact, Vivek, is our China customers and Samsung they are all adopting, virtually across the board, a more complex system, RF system that's highly integrated for size, for current consumption, and just to merely handle the complexity and get these designs, these SKUs, out into the market on time. And that's been very, very good for us; very bad for the discrete companies; very, very good for us.","Vivek Arya","And then, one more sort of near-term question. If you could discuss sort of the puts and takes for the June quarter, because your largest customer still has some seasonal headwinds building that quarter. And I think you also mentioned a divestiture. I believe, Don, you mentioned that it could have a $14 million impact. So if you could just run us through the puts and takes to how to think conceptually about the June quarter?","David Aldrich","Obviously, we're monitoring the demand environment in China and elsewhere very closely and the ramp timing of large programs, which are participating in increasing content. Generally, June is up somewhat from March. That's our current expectation, although it's a little early.","However, the visibility in new designs and in new platforms, both in terms of flagship, but also some of our IoT platforms gives us a very keen sense that the second half of calendar '16 will be very strong and the growth rate will be very high, after we work through obviously as you said the well-publicized issue and inventory burn with a large customer. Maybe, Don, you could comment on the TTI transaction.","Donald Palette","Sure, yes. Vivek, so the way to think about it is when we're doing our models, you look of the business as it is today and assign appropriate growth rates throughout the fiscal period. And then off of that, you would just the deduct $14 million a quarter for the June and September quarter and beyond, as you're starting at that point. And there's no earnings impact with that $14 million. So it's a much lower margin business for us. And then that's offset by their OpEx. So there is no earnings associated with that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Burton with Brean Capital.","Mike Burton","Just following up on the China side. We did see the weakness from your top customer. It did seem that the Chinese handset OEMs rebounded pretty nicely in the December quarter and ramping into Chinese New Year, so I'm just wondering if that's affected your customer mix? If you could give us an update on how big China is as a percent? And do you expect that to grow into the March quarter? And then also, we heard a lot about India last night from your partner competitor. I'm curious what your exposure is out there in the outlook?","Liam Griffin","With respect to China, as we've spoken, it's a very diverse set of customers, it's not just mobile. We do a great deal of business in IoT markets, Wi-Fi and even infrastructure. But we are seeing within China names like Huawei really accelerate, Xiaomi to some degree and some of the other white-box players.","And if you take the China mobile businesses as well as our broad market in China, it's about 20% of our revenue at Skyworks. We do see them coming up this quarter again in March, sequentially. So they're going to be one of the drivers for us in the March quarter.","And again, throughout the year, as we mentioned before, there is just a tremendous opportunity with the 2G and 3G customers and subscribers moving up into 4G. So we're encouraged by that. But you're going to see some improvement in China in the March quarter following a strong December.","Mike Burton","And then for Don, if I could, just in the OpEx, great job on the gross margins. But how should we think about puts and takes for OpEx going forward into this next calendar year? And then also just any thoughts on cash, obviously, given the macro environment uncertainty was your plan really to get more aggressive on the buyback or would you still be looking at some fairly large acquisitions?","Donald Palette","Yes, on the OpEx side, we said in the prepared remarks that we see the $109.5 million kind of level for the next several fiscal quarters. After that, modeling up $2 million a quarter as we've talked, $2 million to $3 million, as we've talked about before, I think is a safe bet.","As far as the cash, yes, we continue to generate very strong cash off the earnings. We have that 40% target of free cash flow that we want to distribute to the shareholders through dividend buybacks. We didn't do any buybacks this quarter. I mean, we also balance it about what's going on in potential M&A activity, what we're looking at and those things. And bottomline is that 40% will continue to do. So stay tuned.","Operator","We now have a question from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis","Maybe just kind of following up on the use of cash. Don, if you could talk about what your CapEx was and what your plans are this year? And maybe Dave, you could talk about just update on your filter strategy, as you build that out, as it becomes more and more of these integrated modules?","Donald Palette","We spent $80 million in the first fiscal quarter. We would expect that to come down closer to more like, we don't really guide it, but more like the depreciation level. The depreciation in general is high-40s to 50 kind of a level, so it is coming down. And when we're spending capital to direct results of the volume that we're looking at, sort of the back drop right now, that number is going to be able to come down a little bit. The use of cash, as we said, we like the 40% target for our shareholders, and that will be through dividend and buybacks. We'll continue to focus on doing that.","David Aldrich","And, Blayne, with respect to filters, in the last few quarters, as we've discussed on each call, we've dramatically increased our footprint in Japan and, again, processing in Singapore. We're probably roughly quadruple the capability from a facility standpoint, where we're hiring, we're getting very good performance at the RF level as well as yields.","And so we continue to see advantages in using really the highest performance temperature compensated surface device in the world. And we are starting to see more bands at higher frequencies that are capable of using TC. So of course, we see a real performance and cost advantage, both on the transmit and the receive side. So I think you should look for us to continue to line out modules, SkyOne and other type of products, power duplexers, more and more of our internal devices as well as our receive DRx with temperature compensated SAW for better receive performance.","Blayne Curtis","And then just as follow-up, as you look out this year, you talk about content gains at your large smartphone customers. Could you maybe just talk about what types of products you're seeing the best traction for content gain that would be helpful?","Liam Griffin","With regard to large flagship programs, in general, what you're seeing is, as Dave articulated, more and more adoption of our SkyOne filter-rich multiple bands and power -- multiple power amplifier band switching integrated in a transmit section. Coupled with that, we're doing really good work on the receive chain with these DRx solutions and look at LNAs, again switching, again filtering, integrating into a single engine.","And then to augment that, we are really seeing great traction in our 11AC portfolio, and often MIMO, often two per smartphone. Now, we're seeing power management devices and Bluetooth connectivity, etc. So we're really rounding out this analog content around very rich-filter integrated system. So that's what you will see in the flagship phones. And we're starting to see our value Tier customers even move up into that area.","Operator","We'll go next to Harsh Kumar with Stephens.","Harsh Kumar","A question on your content in the Chinese handset guys versus the Tier 1? And what opportunity do you see as the Chinese handset guys try to move up and match sort of what the Tier-1 guys are offering?","David Aldrich","I think that the upgrade cycle in China is the largest content gain in the history of the company, because the volumes are so very high in the embedded base there of 2G and 3G has relatively low content for us. And now as the world is adopting these more integrated system solutions for all the sort of well-publicized performance, size, cost, just a reality of how do you deal with the complexity, when you're a customer who has other things to worry about than the RF portion.","So we continue to see a great deal of content gain. And in fact, frankly, share consolidation is turning into a big scale advantage to have the breadth of content as well as the cost structure around high volume. So I think you'll continue to see that.","Harsh Kumar","And then as a follow-up. A couple of companies such as Avago and others talk about content growing about 15%. I know you guys are somewhere in there. Most of you guys talk about greater than 10%. I'm curious what the latest greatest standpoint is with respect to how you guys see content growth for smartphones?","David Aldrich","I would echo what you stated. I think the content growth is every bit of kind of a low-mid teens and could be high. We have to decouple the true content growth that's driven by complexity, which everybody talks about. There is more bands, there is more high frequency bands, there is more complexity around delivering.","As Liam mentioned, MIMO-based solutions on the receive side. Powered voltage is becoming an increasing issue. And of course, you remember, we did an acquisition that gives us some unique IP around driving more refined voltage through the transmit path, and that's a real advantage in our system solution, and can't be replicated by an RF-only company. So we continue to see that as a real differential advantage for Skyworks.","Operator","We'll go next to Atif Mailk with Citigroup.","Atif Mailk","Dave, can you just talk about your strategy on filters? Do you need a BAW solution for carrier aggregation opportunity, which is kicking off this year? And then I have a follow-up.","David Aldrich","What we do need, a high performance filter technology, and we're finding that we're able to do very-high frequency, very-tight frequency spacing with our temperature compensated SAW. We also have BAW filter partners and a lot of IP that's giving us the capability to enter in strategic band configurations using a BAW device coupled with a temperature compensated coupled with a SAW.","But you know, you mentioned carrier aggregation, what we're really seeing is we can get the performance, for example, on the transmit path or in a carrier aggregation system. If we can drive the right topology and the right device performance, we find that it's a little bit less dependent than one normally thinks about the actual filter technology and process that it is about the whole link budget, that is from the transceiver to the antenna and back.","And so we're getting -- I mean, some of the power-added efficiency numbers and the current consumption reduction we're getting out of these newest generation SkyOne, SkyLiTE, PAD architectures. It's really, frankly, unheard of in this space. And it's not all about the filters, it's much more about the device performance and the way we architect it.","Atif Mailk","And then how does the TDK Qualcomm JV impact your relationship or arrangement in outsourcing parts at TDK?","David Aldrich","Well, we buy SAW filters from TDK. We have a long-term supply agreement. That deal is not going to close for a while. We're very lucky that we have a big footprint now in filters, so we can build our own SAWs and our own TC SAWs. We'll see how that plays out. But I don't think it has any material impact on supply at all.","And in fact, it's been on our road map, particularly when you look at DRx technology, which is a lot of filters, a lot of passives. It's always been on our road map for margins, frankly, for margin as well as performance to pull that technology more and more in-house. So we can pull it in, if we have to, and it really will play out overtime. But I wouldn't worry about it from a supply constraint.","Operator","Our next question comes from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.","Edward Snyder","Dave, I kind of want to hit on the same point. Just getting a glimpse of your capacity in Panasonic, they used to build their own SAW, then you guys converted them over to TC. But it sounds like you can go back fairly easily, if you had the capacity. And then Qualcomm has been making a lot of this JV. But could you just refresh our memory, before the JV was announced, were you seeing Qualcomm in any of the competitions for any of the RF in any of the major players? I know they've been doing RF360 for like three years now. And so I just want to get kind of a snapshot before we lose our minds on the JV on what was going on with Qualcomm and before then?","And then, Don, the 60% incremental gross margins, what's the primary driver that you're going to need to get there? What's driving it? And the 53% target margin, the primary driver there, is it a higher mix of integrated products or is it just throughput? And then, if you could maybe give us an update on the GaAs capacity, and most importantly your packaging assembly test capacity in Mexico?","David Aldrich","So with respect to the first half of the question, I think you're absolutely right, that TDK and Qualcomm have been working closely together and fielding designs for a long time. We've competed very successfully against those designs. So there hasn't been a lot of traction in the sweet spot of what we do. There have been other RF360 components of that system, in which we don't compete, where they've had success. But these decades of gallium arsenide performance and driving switch technologies, and multichip module technology, and beginning to put our own high-performance filters, has really given us a system-level performance that has not been easy for competition to replicate.","We know TDK very well. We've used them in the past in mostly SAW. They've got some limited capability in BAW. But remember, I think as your question alluded to, our customers are wanting business based purely on performance and on configurability and what it does at the system level. And we have a clear advantage at the system level over anybody. We've not seen the combination of Qualcomm TDK to be any meaningful threat over the last three years. And on the margins?","Donald Palette","Ed, yes, the modeling, we suggested a 60% and the target is 53%. And at 51% for this quarter, we obviously feel good about. We're well on our way. We've had some nice gains on consecutive quarters. And it's really a lot of things, you are right. One of the things is the overall suite of new products we released, because there is more integration, more value for the customer. We're just seeing better margins on that.","So that's a mix, but it's not mix, it's more value-added integrated solutions, and that's really helping. And it's the things we do on CapEx. It's the things we do on driving productivity improvements through the fab, through the assembly and test operation in Mexicali. We've driven filter costs down dramatically. So we're executing as we have for a long time, pretty well across all fonts and they're all contributing to the margin story.","As far as capacity, we're in really good shape. We've got square footage and a new lease facility in Mexicali. So it's short money for equipment. We can expand that very, very quickly. That pays back quickly. Dave already talked about quadrupling the filter capacity as far as square footage in Japan. So with equipment, again, we can do that very quickly. And we've got our outsource partners for our wafers. So we're in a really good shape to be able to expand capacity when it's required.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets.","Tim Long","Just two quick ones, if I could. You covered China pretty well. I was wondering, if you could just talk a little bit about what you're seeing or what your customers are seeing about some of the other emerging markets right now? And then back to Qualcomm, obviously they haven't, as you've talked about, they haven't had a lot of success. They are talking about now a little bit more aggressively about gallium arsenide. So from a competitive landscape, do you think that can change anything? And I guess, while we're on that topic, anything else from anyone in the CMOS camp?","David Aldrich","Maybe I'll do the second half first, and Liam you can talk to the other emerging markets. Tim, it really is the case that there hasn't been a single successful new PA company in many, many years, with PA device technology. And the merchant GaAs foundries are, I would estimate, at least five years behind what Skyworks is able to do today state-of-the-art at the device level. And it's been through decades of experience.","So I think that the merchant GaAs market, the merchant GaAs capability pales in comparison to the stellar device performance that companies like Skyworks, we, specifically are getting. So I am not too worried about any new GaAs entrant. And I am definitely now worried about CMOS technology being able to accomplish the kind of current consumption, the kind of transmit requirements that we're seeing across our markets today.","Every single time there is an advance in a different technology or with a different competitor, what we're finding is that the next-generation system has increased the bar so high that it doesn't matter, that improvement isn't anywhere near capable of delivering the system-level performance that our customers require. Again, we're designing platforms now that are 2018, and in those platforms, I'd tell you, it is the best of the best who are going to compete successfully and we think we've got a unique capability there.","Liam Griffin","And then following up on the emerging markets, and what we do see there is certainly are larger global brands participate across the emerging markets. But more frequently we see some of the China players drive a great deal of their exports through markets like India, Middle East, Latin America. Of those, the India market has actually been consuming probably at the highest level, again buying product typically manufactured by our China OEMs. So we play it through that channel. And there is definitely a lot of room to grow in that geography.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs.","Gabriela Borges","Maybe just one on the near-term environment, if I could. You mentioned the above-normal inventory reductions. I'd love to get your thoughts on where you think we are with that inventory correction and whether inventory is getting more back in line with and to modern sell-through?","Liam Griffin","Clearly, there has been a disruption in the December and March timeframe, as a very large flagship phone model has seen the numbers come down, and we're working through that. And I think that from my standpoint, any inventory correction in the systems should be gone in the June quarter. And we ought to be off to the races in the second half of the year.","Gabriela Borges","And then just on the broad market segment, clearly a number of drivers of that business segment, but maybe could highlight for us one or two applications that you think can contribute the most from a dollar revenue growth perspective, as we look out over the next few quarters?","Liam Griffin","The broad markets business has been doing quite well. It's up about 12% year-over-year in Q1, and will continue to be a teens-level or higher growth rate into the calendar year. So I mean, what we're seeing is really a wide variety of applications in the broad portfolio. We've got some great IoT programs that go into set top box and streaming media, in many cases $10 to $12 per box, Wi-Fi switching, ZigBee technology. There's a connected home opportunity now that's really playing out, got some great content there.","And one of the markets that we're excited about now, it's early innings, but we are seeing some uptick in automotive. We're starting to see high-end LTE telematics applications. We've got design wins in vehicle-to-vehicle communication. We've got customers like GM, like Volkswagen, Continental. So that's a market that we think will do very well for several years, and the opportunity there for us is outstanding. So that's a little color on where we are. But broad has been growing quite well and quite steady","Operator","We now have a question from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig Ellis","I'll start with one that relates to the longer-term financial targets. In the quarter, you were a hair's distance from your operating margin target and it looks like you're making very good progress towards the gross margin target. How should in fact just investors think about the timeframe to the revenue target and the earnings per share target guys?","Donald Palette","But despite the backdrop, right now, when you look at -- the model for us is absolutely intact. And when you look at the drivers, we continue to make progress on the gross margin front. Volume will have some impact on that in the short-term, but we're continuing to drive that. We know disciplined OpEx investments, we know how to measure those to manage that very effectively.","So when you roll all that together, once we get through this pause that we're seeing right now, when you get into the back half of the year and beyond, we see an opportunity to get there in a couple of years. And by the way, what we delivered, we're not at the OpEx target, because the model will be in the low-40s. We're not quite there yet. So we got room to run.","Craig Ellis","And then a follow-up just on gross margins, Don. If I look at the last three quarters, which represents the bulk of calendar 2015, the incrementals were 75% on average, which is amongst the best in semis. And I understand that the 60% incremental target is a nice uptick from where the company had been. But what would cause, given the initiatives that you have in play and the business divestiture, which is low-margin, what would cause a regression back to 60% rather than staying at the levels the business has recently been at?","Donald Palette","That's a fair question, but you got to remember that those are averages to assume over a period. There are events that happen quarter-to-quarter that can move those. And what happened in those quarters, there were multiple things, we were seeing some benefit from the filter asset and driving cost down, we had new product launches, all of those things can create a short-term step function that moves you in a different spot. But sustaining 75%, that's off the charts; 60% is very, very good. So modeling 60%, you'll see you get a very, very good answer.","Operator","We have a question now from Anthony Stoss with Craig-Hallum.","Anthony Stoss","So you talked about China being up, your biggest customer being down in March. Can you talk about Samsung? And also, Don, if you wouldn't mind taking us through kind of what CapEx was in the quarter and what we should expect in 2016?","Liam Griffin","With respect to Samsung, yes, we actually are seeing some improving conditions at Samsung. We should be up in the March quarter. We've got some new design wins that it will be ramping with the GS7 platform. And we're actually -- reiterating what David said about content and SkyOne and filters, we're seeing Samsung really now lost in earnest. Some of these content-rich solutions, not only on the transmit chain, but also on the receive side. So that's a move up for us that will be sustainable. Samsung is our number two customer. We've got a great relationship there. So you should expect some solid results through the year.","David Aldrich","CapEx, Don.","Donald Palette","Yes, CapEx, we've talked about that a little earlier, $79.5 million for the quarter. And we're just recommending there will be a couple of quarters we'll be real closer to the depreciation of around $50 million, and then it might go up a little as we get in the back half with volumes going up. And there may be some more investments that we make. So that's the way to think of it.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Smigie with Raymond James.","Steve Smigie","Just following-up on your comments about the strength in the back half. Would it be fair to argue that, if you say like a September quarter that could be up double-digit year-over-year, excluding the divestiture?","Donald Palette","Yes.","Donald Palette","Yes, it's calendar, just remember that.","Steve Smigie","I was just asking like a September quarter over September quarter?","Donald Palette","Yes.","Steve Smigie","And then as far as BAW filters for yourself, I think you had talked on last call about 2017 getting there. How necessary is that? And as we push into higher frequency stuff in later years, is that the right technology or will we have to see some other technology emerged in filtering to handle that?","David Aldrich","That's a great question. Clearly, for today we're doing low-band and now mid-band, we're well up above 2 gigahertz with great performance using temperature compensated devices. I think BAW technology, what it will do for us in that '17 timeframe will open up the high-band, the very highest band in some of these PAD configurations.","Yes, I think that'll be very good for us. We'll be able to have the enviable trade-off between using SAW, temperature compensated SAW and BAW devices, and using the right application for the function, because if you look across the world today, most world phones, most smartphones don't use BAW technology, they have a different configuration or a different band lineup that doesn't require it.","But for those customers who are looking for sort of a low, mid, high, very-high performance, truly a world phone, what BAW will do will open up high band for us, in which we don't participate, market we do not participate in today. So it will increase our TAM and we'll get there by '17.","Operator","We'll go next to Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton.","Cody Acree","Maybe just following-up on that, Dave, and maybe for Liam as well. With your filter capacity, expanded filter capacity, is there a way to quantify some of the dollar increases that you're able to attack today that maybe you weren't able to get into a couple years ago, knowing that so much of the RF content increases is coming on the filter side?","David Aldrich","I would say that the increase over the last couple of years and for the next couple of years on the RF side in smartphones or mobile is probably equally weighted between filter-enabled devices, receive and transmit and other functionality that we talked about, which is voltage regulation, power management, receive technology and higher-performance Wi-Fi and the like. So I'm going to just draw and brush it, and tell you roughly equal growth within mobile coming about through filter-enabled solutions and coming about through other system-level blocks that we didn't previously address.","Liam Griffin","And to add to that, I think one of the real unique characteristics of what we do here, and we talked about in this call, is our ability to integrate. So it isn't just taking the filter and taking the amplifier and integrating it. There's a lot of unique Skyworks DNA that develops these engines. They're highly customizable. Each baseband partner, each OEM we configure to their needs, we look at their current budget, we look at what they need to do in terms of bands, we look at the filter technology wanted to deploy, and all that comes together and it's worked out great.","And the TC capabilities that we have today are unbelievable, they're world-class manufacturer. In this last calendar year, we manufactured about 1.5 billion TC SAWs, all of which were consumed by our integrated systems. So we're very bullish on that concept, and we'll continue to use the best technologies to win.","Cody Acree","And, Dave, just on a high-level on the M&A approach, after what happened with PMC. What's your interest? Are you looking at ways to expand vertically, I guess? What would you be looking at?","David Aldrich","I think, Cody, similar to what we've done in the past, we're always looking for -- if you think about the power management acquisition that we did through AATI or SiGe or the Panasonic filter capability, they all do two things for us, they gave us a much bigger target and more relevance at the system-performance level for our mobile customers; and they also opened up new target markets and gave us opportunities within IoT.","So we would continue to look at that, whether it's cloud-based computing, whether it's machine-to-machine, whether it's being able to do more at the kind of IoT sensor MCU RF module capability. We see those as being attractive, surgical, strategic, accretive deals.","Operator","Our next question is from Marc Estigarribia with Chardan Capital Markets.","Mark Estigarribia","Just wanted to get into the broad markets a little bit, 20% of the revenue, around $185 million came from IoT in broad markets. If you can just comment a little bit about the incremental growth in 2016, where it's coming from, is it a broad stroke amongst auto, connected home, wearables, drone? And also if you can just comment an outlook for margins in the quarter, if it's about 50% or if it's sort of a different range for the different verticals please?","Liam Griffin","The broad market business, it is actually quite diversified. I would say the strongest elements are around kind of the streaming media, the Wi-Fi integration, connected home. We have just a large roster of design wins in that part of the space. And we're also seeing, and if you look at some of the teardowns with these boxes, we're seeing three-by-three streams, which will triple our content, and so you get $10 to $12 per box. We're in markets like DirecTV, Technicolor, some of the Neatgear routers, those are just examples. So that's a real strong area. And there's a lot of upgrades to go here in the U.S. and in developing markets, so we like that.","Connected home, I mentioned, some of these appliance opportunities, customers like Nest, and lots of names like that. Automotive, relatively new. You have not only the traditional IoT applications like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, but you have a telematics play there. And then the other space that has been a bit quiet, but we do think will turn is wireless infrastructure. There's a great deal of content with companies like Nokia, Siemens, Ericsson, Huawei, and we do see that getting a little stronger, probably back half of 2016, a little bit soft so far, but it's another market, where we have some solid designs.","Donald Palette","And margins, the broad markets category is by far our highest. Margins in those, average 55%-plus on the application market. But those are our highest products. So as that percentage goes up, it's always good for Skyworks.","Mark Estigarribia","And just one follow-up on the question with regards to the June quarter. They industry goes up 5% to 6%, obviously, the next quarter we're looking for a drop of 16% from the $775 million guidance. Is there some sort of makeup we can put in our numbers on the back half of the year or should we stick to sort of the industry averages?","Donald Palette","I think that that's a little difficult to answer right now. I think you should expect that the adjustment that's occurring in the late December through the March quarter and maybe into June a little bit will then be behind us, and that's kind of an unnatural event. And so as I say, as we stated in the prepared comments, we think that the second half of calendar '16 looks very strong and it's not wishful thinking, it's more designs that we're fielding both in the mobile and on the broad market side. And as we fulfill those orders, you'll see an uptick in revenue that's pretty substantial.","Operator","We'll go next to Ian Ing with MKM Partners.","Ian Ing","Don, could you help us with how you got to this appropriately conservative guidance? Did you rely on higher backlog coverage or are you de-rating forecast or do you have other tools in the toolbox?","Donald Palette","No. I mean, it's our normal approach. I think we do an excellent job of forecasting. It starts with our sales marketing team and the information they get from customers, distributors and OEMs, and we always are able to pick and translate that into the right kind of revenue projection. So it's our typical process. There wasn't any new magic involved in that.","Ian Ing","And for my follow-up, reference design partners in China, I mean, you've talked about being working with MediaTek and working with Qualcomm, those are good partners. Looks like Spreadtrum is making a lot of activity in China also. They're trying to double their LTE shipments this year. I mean, do you guys partner with them in terms of SkyOne and things like that?","Liam Griffin","Yes, absolutely. So I mean our roster in China certainly includes Qualcomm; MediaTek, quad-core, opti-core designs, great position there, higher-end 4G LTE; Hisilicon, which is the in-house brand with Huawei; and then Spreadtrum as well, you're right, TDS, CDMA, another opportunity. So they're not the biggest driver for us, but they are important and they are very specific to the China market.","We're seeing improvement out of MediaTek and it's a very high-end content-rich engines that we enjoy. And the Hisilicon-Huawei partnership has been quite strong. So we've got a well-diversified set of products and programs, very different for each one of those partners. But we're engaged with each of them.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Aldrich for closing remarks.","End of Q&A","David Aldrich","Well, thank you everyone for your participation and for listening. And we look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation."],"19670":["Skyworks Solutions, Inc.

This call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Mitch Haws, Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Haws, please go ahead.","Mitch Haws","Thank you, Rob. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Skyworks' first fiscal quarter 2020 conference call. With me on the call today are Liam Griffin, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Kris Sennesael, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our discussion will include statements related to future results and expectations that are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Please refer to our earnings press release and recent SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on certain risks that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially and adversely from any forward-looking statements made today. Additionally, the results and guidance we will discuss include non-GAAP financial measures consistent with our past practice. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our Company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Liam.","Liam Griffin","Thanks, Mitch and welcome everyone. Skyworks exceeded December quarter expectations, driven by a global demand for high-performance connectivity solutions. As our results demonstrate, Skyworks is leveraging decades of experience, scale and vertical integration capabilities along with our highly advanced Sky5 platform, accelerating the adoption of 5G technology across a broadening set of end markets and customers.","Now looking at the first quarter in more detail. We grew revenues by 8% sequentially to $896 million, produced gross margin of 50.1% and operating margin of 35.2%. We posted earnings per share of $1.68, $0.03 ahead of our guidance and up 11% sequentially. And we generated exceptional operating cash flow totaling $398 million in the quarter. At a higher level Skyworks is ushering in an age of truly ubiquitous connectivity, enabling richer, smarter and more convenient ways to live, work, play and educate. Smartphones are leading this early transition with substantial volumes of 5G-enabled devices shipping this quarter. But more importantly over time, we expect an incredible unit uptake outside of mobile where connected devices and things will be measured in tens of billions. And as we've noted in prior calls, 5G catalyzes new markets from IoT, autonomous transport, artificial intelligence, and high definition streaming media. Currently in the US, there are approximately eight networked devices per person, a number that is expected to climb to 14 devices by 2022. That represents a 50% increase. And as a recent example, a higher percentage of US households are now subscribed to a streaming media service rather than traditional pay TV. Clearly our world continues to rely upon seamless, high-speed connectivity and this trend will only accelerate as 5G adoption grows and novel usage cases emerge.","Recall 5G is a technology, not a product, not a brand or a slogan. It offers gigabit speeds, ultra-low latency and greatly enhanced network capacity fueling a wide range of applications, while becoming the universal connector. Skyworks is playing a pivotal role in the deployment of this standard with a rich 20-year heritage in designing and delivering highly integrated and customized system solutions. We have demonstrated technology leadership across a vast set of critical product categories, resolving increasingly complex architectures and preparing our customers for the performance gains demanded in 5G. As we look ahead, the expanding product pipeline at Skyworks is clearly generating strong design win momentum across both mobile and broad market segments.","Specifically in our mobile business traction in 5G is gaining strength with our Sky5 platform powering launches at Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi and Samsung. Our baseband agnostic solutions offer interoperability and are being deployed across leading chipset suppliers, including MediaTek, Samsung and Qualcomm. And with our expanding filter capabilities in TC SAW and bulk acoustic wave, we help our customers navigate complex challenges while extending our reach across a broader spectrum of 4 and 5G bands.","Moving onto broad markets, at CES, Skyworks announced a unique set of 5G-enabled solutions, including Massive MIMO IoT, a suite of connected home devices and high fidelity smart audio products. Specifically we are powering rapidly emerging IoT applications with cellular-based platforms certified by KDDI, NTT DoCoMo SoftBank and Verizon. We're driving growth with the launch of our Wi-Fi 6 platforms, expanding our customer reach with industry leaders including AT&T, Cisco, Netgear, ARRIS and Aruba.","We're advancing automotive content with SkyOne in our emerging V2X portfolio and supplying low power, long range IoT products as [ph] Ring and many others.","In the infrastructure space Skyworks is leveraging its capabilities in silicon germanium SOI, gallium arsenide, bulk acoustic wave and ceramic filters while powering 5G MIMO and small cell base station design wins. In addition, we are gaining momentum in automotive, enabling new wins with leaders like Continental, Nissan and Renault along with industrial players including Honeywell, Bosch and GE.","As these highlights suggest, we remain focused on driving diversification across high value segments and markets with more than 2,000 products, supporting thousands of customers. So in summary Skyworks has decades of connectivity experience across multiple technology transitions. Uniquely positioning us to meet the performance demands of 5G are portfolio of highly integrated customized connectivity engines bolstered by the early strategic investments we have made anticipating both the complexity and the immense opportunity across our end markets and finally, a highly profitable and predictable business model that allows us to invest aggressively while providing consistent returns to our shareholders.","With that, I will turn the call over to Kris for a discussion of Q1 and our outlook for Q2.","Kris Sennesael","Thanks, Liam. Skyworks' revenue for the first fiscal quarter of 2020 was $896 million, up 8% sequentially and $16 million above the midpoint of the outlook we provided in November, driven by the successful launch of flagship phones and the early success of our Sky5 product portfolio as new 5G phones start ramping globally.","Gross profit in the first quarter was $449 million resulting in a gross margin of 50.1% in line with expectations. Operating expenses were $134 million, down 4% year-over-year as we continued to prudently manage OpEx while making the necessary investments to accelerate future growth of the business. We generated $315 million of operating income, translating into an operating margin of 35.2%, up 120 basis points from fiscal Q4.","Other income was $1 million and our effective tax rate was 8.9%, driving net income of $289 million or $1.68 of diluted earnings per share up 11% sequentially.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. First fiscal quarter cash flow from operations was $398 million, capital expenditures were $111 million, resulting in $287 million of free cash flow on $896 million of revenue translating into a strong free cash flow margin of 32%. We paid $75 million in dividends and repurchased 742,000 shares of our common stock for a total of $74 million. During the last 12 months, we have returned 87% of free cash flow back to the shareholders through a combination of our dividends and share buyback program. We ended the first fiscal quarter with cash and investments of $1.2 billion and we have no debt.","Now let's move on to our outlook for Q2 of fiscal 2020. Early momentum from the initial launch of 5G as we ramp design wins in our mobile business matched with solid traction in broad markets are driving better than seasonal performance in the March quarter. For the second fiscal quarter of 2020, we anticipate revenue to be between $800 million and $820 million. At the midpoint of the range, our revenues would be flat to last year's Q2. However including Huawei or excluding Huawei, in the second quarter of fiscal '19 and fiscal '20, revenue is expected to be up mid-teens year-over-year.","We expect gross margin between 50% and 50.5% and operating expenses of approximately $135 million. Below the line, we anticipate roughly $2 million in other income and a tax rate of 9%. We expect our diluted share count to further reduce to approximately $171 million shares. Accordingly at the midpoint of these ranges, we intend to deliver diluted earnings per share of $1.46.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liam.","Liam Griffin","Thanks, Kris. Skyworks delivered strong results to start fiscal 2020. Looking ahead, we are in the early innings of a multiyear technology cycle with 5G gaining momentum and the growth of connected people and things continuing to expand. We have invested aggressively ahead of this transition and we are uniquely positioned with strategic technologies crafted in our own fabs providing sustainable competitive advantage. At the same time through crisp operational execution and a strong business model, we are translating these results into long-term shareholder value.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong results and guidance. Good to see the recovery in the sector after a while. So Liam, I had two questions. First, just on the core business. I'm curious you mentioned the start of the 5G ramp. How much of that ramp are you seeing in the March quarter? And just roughly what is the direction of content that you are seeing in these 5G smartphones? And I think you mentioned integration. Is it kind of a winner-take-all in some of these initial wins or are you still kind of maintaining your share in the specific components that you have expertise in?","Liam Griffin","Sure. Well, the way we're seeing it right now we believe we're absolutely gaining share in 5G and the rollout of these new highly complex phones are exactly what we want to see. We're continuing to gain share with our Sky5 platform. We're doing the very difficult things that we've been talking about in prior calls, really crafting and creating these wonderful devices that are going into 5G-enabled phones. We're seeing that across a number of customers, great position in China with a number of leading players, position at Samsung and then also with some of the larger players in the US that haven't even launched their 5G phone yet. So there's a lot of positive momentum there and we feel very -- very upbeat about where we're going in the second half.","Vivek Arya","Got it. And my follow-up is kind of a strategic question. So you have been developing your internal ball capability for some time, but one of your competitors put up their RF assets for sale. I'm curious if those assets get sold to a potential competitor or a customer, what's the impact or are those assets something that you might be interested in taking a look at? Just how should we think about kind of the impact of this potential consolidation on Skyworks?","Liam Griffin","Sure, sure. Appreciate the question. Well, we really can't get into any specifics around M&A. We're well aware of the opportunity that you just suggested, but at the same time we are really happy with what we're doing in our organic business and we see a tremendous opportunity there with 5G now just starting and the momentum in our demand really accelerating. So we feel good about it, but at the same time we have to look at M&A opportunities and I'm pleased to say that we have the powder and the cash flow to do deals when deals are necessary. But at this point, we really just can't comment on anything specifically.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is open.","Timothy Arcuri","Thanks so much. Kris, can you give us the splits for both businesses for December and how you think about it for the guidance for March?","Kris Sennesael","Yes. So our broad markets business in the December quarter was approximately 27% of total revenue. That is in line with what we saw last year. Keep in mind that December quarter is typically a very strong mobile quarter with obviously a lot of business with our large customer and then the ramp of 5G phones. So mobile was 73% of total revenue. Looking forward into the March quarter, that is where we see a little bit of a flip, right. This is typically a stronger broad markets quarter. We do expect some mid-single digit sequential growth in our broad markets business and we will see some mid-single to -- yes, mid-single year-over-year growth in broad markets in the March quarter and then of course even further stronger growth in the second half of 2020.","Timothy Arcuri","Great, thanks for that. And can you just talk about Huawei and how it ended up playing out? I think you expected about $10 million. And my guess is that it was maybe a little bit better than that. But how did it play out and sort of how do you think -- not just about them as a customer, but how do you think about how the export restrictions might change and how that is impacting what that customer and what's your other Chinese customers are pulling? How hard they might be pulling? Are they perhaps double ordering? Thanks.","Liam Griffin","Sure. Well, obviously, it's an evolving situation and we have a really dynamic business today in China with Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi and even some of the MediaTek ecosystem supported. Huawei, of course, there has been some limitations on what we can do. As we've said in the past, we can't provide a quarter-by-quarter guidance by customer, but I will say that in the Q1 time frame Huawei came in a little bit better than we expected. But I will tell you that we are derisking exposure to Huawei in the business. We're still going after the design wins. We're going to do everything we can to gain share when it's available. But we are derisking that in our financial outlook, as we go forward. So we want to make sure that that's clear to the investors.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Toshiya Hari","Hi guys, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the strong results. Liam, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the infrastructure business within broad markets. A couple of your peers have talked to a pause in activity on the part of your customers. Is that sort of the case with Skyworks? And if so, how much of a drag was it in the quarter? And more importantly, I guess what's the outlook into fiscal Q2 and the back half of the year? Then I have a follow-up. Thank you.","Liam Griffin","Sure. Yes, I mean the infrastructure business has been a little bit slow and I don't think it's changed in terms of its pace, but it's a very necessary element in 5G. And I know some of the players like Ericsson and Nokia are really stepping up right now. Obviously there is Huawei opportunities in there as well. They have some limitations, but it's obviously an opportunity. So I see the infrastructure space still very vital for us. So we do some incredible work there with our MIMO solutions, antenna arrays, some of the filtering that we mentioned, including ceramic filters. So we have a role and we have a necessary role in that area. But I would expect infrastructure to pick up in the second half of the year. It's also a positive margin driver for us across broad markets. We know how to operate in those industries. We have very good relationships with the customers. So we should expect a better climate there in the second half.","Toshiya Hari","Got it. That's great. And then as a follow-up, this one is for Kris. On your last call you guys talked about gross margins potentially hitting your 53% target in the back half of the fiscal year. I just wanted to confirm is it [ph] still the case and if so, what were some of the key drivers on a half-over-half basis? Thank you.","Kris Sennesael","Yes. First of all, I'm pleased with our gross margin execution. So in the December quarter we came in at 50.1%, slightly above what we guided. And so, we are guiding slightly up in the March quarter at 50% to 50.5% despite our normal seasonal decline in revenue going into the March quarter. And then in the back half of 2020, I do expect further gross margin improvements towards our longer-term goal of 53%. And I didn't say last time that we were going to hit 53% at the end of 2020, but continue to make very good progress towards that target, longer-term target of 53%.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey guys, this is Tom [ph] on for Blayne Curtis. I just want to clarify, real quick. Kris, you made a comment about broad markets into March. You originally said that it was going to be up mid-single digits and then you said mid-single digit growth year-over-year. Could you just clarify is it sequential or year-over-year?","Kris Sennesael","So it's both, so sequentially it's mid-single digits as well as year-over-year it's mid-single digits, excluding Huawei, right, because we have some Huawei infrastructure business that was part of that broad markets. Obviously, due to the ban we lost most or almost all of that. And so, if I exclude Huawei, we will be back to mid-single digit year-over-year growth in March and then a potentially even stronger year-over-year growth, excluding Huawei, in the second half of 2020.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, that's helpful. And then just a broader question. When you guys are looking at design wins, particularly in 5G, do you guys have a competitor that also does the modems? Clearly, the competition is pretty fierce there and there's a lot of talk about them being attached with the RF on many early solutions. Just how do you compete there and how do you break down kind of the bundling aspect?","Liam Griffin","Sure. Well, our customers drive that and our customers want solutions from Skyworks, the integration capabilities that we bring, specifically in 5G where the architectures are substantially more complex than they were in 4G. Integration around solutions such as our Sky5 platform are ideal for customers moving into 5G. And I mean the proof is in the pudding. If you look at the devices today, the 5G devices that are going to market right now, you're going to see that kind of integration from Skyworks. It's not being driven by the chipset provider. That may work in small markets where the customer doesn't have a level of sophistication and they want a turnkey solution all in. But that's not what we're seeing right now. We're seeing best-in-class solutions, leveraging integration, looking for companies that have their own facilities like us from filter to gallium arsenide to assembly and test, customizing and crafting a solution, that's how we win. And by the way, we work with every baseband supplier, whether they're a friend or a foe and we take our lead from the customer and that's always work for us.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thanks guys.","Liam Griffin","Sure.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ambrish [ph] from BMO. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, thank you. Liam, you may not -- you may not have to worry about that whether you have to buy that business or not. Looks like a PR hit the tape as soon as your call started that...","Liam Griffin","Oh, we [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, they have signed a multi-year deal with Apple. Let me sort of just focus on you guys. What does your portfolio looks like for 5G for BAW? And then within your portfolio, where do you think you have the most opportunity to gain content in 5G?","Liam Griffin","Sure. Well, I mean just to take a long look, just a little bit of a backdrop here. Understand right now 4G phones are basically driving spectrum from 700 megahertz to about 2.5 to 3 gig, right. So all that action continues in a mobile phone today. And then you add to that with 5G solutions, unique solutions that's drawn that [ph] 5G spectrum, let's say, 3 to 6 gig or 6 gig and higher. That's an incredible opportunity. It's all incremental physical content. And each one of the players in our space looks at it differently. What we want to do is capture the maximum opportunity, work with our customers, give them absolute choice on the kind of componentry they want, the markets that they're going to roam in, their current budget, all of these things and then craft an integrated solution for them. So when we say, Sky5 that's a platform, it's a platform. It could be very different from the largest customer to a customer in Korea to customers in China. And that is the unique Skyworks differentiator and we have the tool sets to do that now. We've added bulk acoustic wave. We have high capacity in TC SAW. We have standard SAW. We have crafted assembly and test with facilities under our watch. Really unique stuff and that makes a big difference for us and it lengthen [ph] -- and it broadens the opportunity reach that we have in any given 5G device.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And my follow-up for Kris is on the operating model as you try to avail the opportunities, what does it do to OpEx and also CapEx as we think through? If you could just remind us what capex was and guidance for this year, so if that changes or not.","Kris Sennesael","Yes, so in terms of operating model, we are driving the business and growing the top line above market. We are driving operational efficiencies and bringing high added value products to the market that will drive the gross margins towards our long-term target of 53% and our operating margins approaching 40%. Currently OpEx is running on or about 15%. And I think we can do a little bit better there so you get to an operating margin that approach 40%. At the same time, we're very much focused on driving free cash flow at 30% or slightly above 30%. And you saw last quarter we had 32% of free cash flow margin. We will continue to invest in the business, there is no question about that. We -- as Liam just explained, one of our strengths is our operational footprint with our gallium arsenide fabs, our filter operation as well as our back-end operation. And we continue to expand the capacity in those fabs and we continue to develop new technology, package technologies and filter technologies. And that of course requires sufficient capex support. Capex is running on or about 10% to revenue and I think in the foreseeable future that's what you have to put into your models.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bill Peterson from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Bill Peterson","Yes, thanks for taking the question. Coming back to broad markets, you spoke to the infrastructure opportunities. Of course, a large portion is your Wi-Fi and IoT. Trying to -- you mentioned the infrastructure is kind of back-half weighted, but trying to get a feel for how you expect the ramp of world Wi-Fi to progress and I guess how that manifests itself into your broad market growth really for the full year -- for the full fiscal year, and especially the back half.","Liam Griffin","Yes -- no, it makes sense, Bill. So I think if you look at broad markets in total, I want to give you a little bit more of a broad view here. So we have, first of all, a wide set of protocols to reach for, right. 5G, Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth, GPS, ZigBee, LoRa, all of those are opportunities for us to connect things with our customer. The Wi-Fi 6 now is really gaining momentum. We've got some new strategic design wins that are just coming about in this last quarter and looking into the second half of the year more ramps with names like AT&T, Cisco and Netgear. And we've also done some great work moving into industrial and automotive spaces; so we're securing wins now with Bosch, Honeywell, Siemens, GE. These were not customers two or three years ago, they were not at all on the playing field for Skyworks. And now we're also moving in automotive. We've got wins with Continental, BMW, Renault, Nissan and others. So lot of really cool things and even some amazing consumer products. We've got some devices now, infant monitoring with Procter & Gamble, of course we're lined up with Ring, we've got a lot of product with Amazon. So it's a really rich portfolio that goes from high end to mid-tier. But the key for us, Bill, is it levers technology and it levers connectivity. And the fact that we have that broad set of protocols, we can pick and choose with our customer what's the right connectivity protocol to lock into their solution. So we feel really good about that. And we think that that momentum is going to carry forward for many, many years.","Bill Peterson","Okay, thanks. And I guess if you think about the 5G phones that are going to be launched here in the first half of this year, of course Samsung already launched 5G phones last year, as you guys call it OVX, can you speak specifically to the 5G wins you have? I guess this is really like ultra-high, and I know that the 4G bands are clearly important LTV -- LTE-Advanced Pro and so forth. But can you speak to the design wins you have in the OVX camp in [ph] Samsung?","Liam Griffin","Yes, absolutely. So the 5G momentum, the early momentum in 5G, a lot of that is actually led by the China names. So, we have great position in 5G solution. So this is again 5G, so we still have great 4G position with these accounts. But we're overlaying incremental content in 5G with names like Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi. So those players were very strong. We're doing some good work partnering with chipset providers. MediaTek is one that's an example in their phase seven designs. We've got great position, design reference position. These are all 5G solutions. And again early moves with China with those players that I named, but also some really significant moves that we expect later in the year with some of the larger customers as well where we will see substantial content gains as well.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Edward Snyder from Charter Equity Research. Your line is open.","Edward Snyder","Thanks a lot. Liam, we talked a lot about 5G. I'd like to clarify if we could, especially regard to your comments about share gains with some of the new products coming out, the smartphone products coming out here. If we divide the world into like 4G, 4G Advanced, 4G Pro and the pure 5G content which is mostly ultra-wideband, are you referring to both, are you referring to one? I know you guys were strong in some of the initial ultra-high band last year, and I know they're wrapping not only that, but also the band, n77 bands into the Chinese phone. Is that where you're seeing most of your share gains?","Liam Griffin","Yes, exactly. So we're continuing to have the 4G placement, which is basically kind of backward compatibility. And then UHP bands, n77, n79, unique products there that are incremental that you wouldn't see in a 4G phone but there'd be incremental dollars that would lay into a 5G phone. And the other point that we've been making here is and as you know, the more complexity that you have, the more devices that we have physically we've got to deal with size, we've got to deal with competition for current consumption, coexistence and all the challenges that you get when you put more and more semiconductors together. So our approach with that is to offer that customer the Sky5 platform and configured in such a way that some of those challenges that one would have in putting together a complex device can be resolved with Skyworks overlaying that into a platform solution. But the incremental content is in it's UHP, it's n77, n79, there's more bands coming out over time, but we're in really good position to capitalize as 5G continues to roll out.","Edward Snyder","Yes. And you've done really well there. So as a separate part of that then, let's talk about the 4G, if we could [ph] for a while. China went the phase six last year. As we all know Qorvo took a lot of that because there's a lot of nervousness on the OEM's part about going to a fully integrated front-end. So they wanted one guy. We've got feedback that that's starting to change now and that Skyworks is starting to carve out the traditional low band part of that platform. Are you seeing that to any material extent? And then and the larger question, how do you -- I know your BAW filter program is coming along very well. You've got -- some received the devices now and they are going to have duplexers, but that seems to be a long way from being able to offer the kind of performance that you have to offer to actually capture the mid and high bands too. Is there path to that, mid high band portion of the 4G section of these phones over the next year or so or is it going to be something further out?","Liam Griffin","Yes, yes. So let me try to capture both. So on the MediaTek side, when you get into the lower band opportunities, there is a tremendous amount of Skyworks opportunities with low band pad, with DSM et cetera. So that's the 4G space. When you go to the ultra-high band or mid and high band solutions, we recognize that's a challenge, but we're on pace right now to address it. We've done some good work with some UHP opportunities. We do recognize the performance merits with some of the leading players in mid and high band and we aspire to get there. We're doing the work internally, but we understand that it is going to be a task, it's going to be a challenge, but we have the expertise -- growing expertise, engagement with customers. The facilities are important. We've got some facilities here and fab position that will help us, but yes we're on the path to achieving the highest grade, but we still have a lot of work to do, quite frankly.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis from B. Riley FBR. Your line is open.","Craig Ellis","Yes, thanks for taking the question. Congratulations on the good execution, guys. Liam, I wanted to follow up on that last question and maybe tied into one that Vivek answered, really focused on longer-term dynamic. So Skyworks is historically working with customers 18 months out of the handset launch on new products. So from the vantage point that you have now what does content gain look like in the funnel for things that we'll be launching in calendar 21 versus the early content gain that you're getting in your one of 5Gs. Is it flat? Is it up? If it's up, to what extent would it be up next year as you continue to try and flex into things like mid-band or high-band pads with your BAW capability?","Liam Griffin","Sure, sure. So let me just be really clear about one thing. The technologies that we have right now -- we don't have everything, but the technologies that we have right now in 4G and the new technology that we have in 5G are going to add substantial content to our opportunities, no question about that. So now we're talking about further out in BAW what else can we do, we've got aspirations to continue to do more, but the things that we're doing now today on leveraging BAW, leveraging Sky5 as a platform, leveraging the incremental content that 5G bands bring all going to be a great, great opportunity for us to step up. And one of the things that's helping us is the complexity. We keep saying this, but it's really important. The technology burden in a 5G device is substantially harder, more difficult to implement, more challenging for the customer and then bring that to market quickly. So there's a lot there. We are the experts in doing that. That's why we talk about decades of experience. We've been through these transitions. This is one of the harder ones and that's great for us and it's great for the top players in the market because we're going to be able to enjoy solving our customers' problems and putting them in a position to win. So we're excited about it. We're going to lever all of our technologies, our TC SAW capability, our packaging technology, our bulk acoustic wave, ceramic, but all of these technologies that we have will play a role. But the content opportunity is absolutely there. We've talked about that before in presentations prepared remarks that we see meaningful dollars of content opportunity and some of that will start in the second half of this year.","Craig Ellis","And with regards to that last point with content kicking in in the second half of the year beyond what we're seeing with momentum in the business here in the quarter that you are just guiding to which is above seasonal. So is it fair to think that with the content that you've got, you've got a year where integrated mobile can drive consistently above seasonal performance in the business or is it just too early to be able to have that kind of visibility from where you are?","Liam Griffin","Yes. Yes, I mean it's difficult to figure out what the natural seasonality is going to be. But we definitely see improving opportunities for us, design wins that have been consummated that haven't yet shipped. And let's also look at where the customers are. One of the largest customers, great customer, hasn't put a 5G phone out yet. So that's another thing to think through. So I think there is plenty on the horizon. We're really excited about it. We just delivered a beat and raise Q1 and Q2. I think the broad markets business is going to accelerate. We talked a little bit about that with Kris. The 5G opportunities are right there in front of us. We're executing fully. We're adding capital and we're really enthused about the opportunities that are in front of us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Caso from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Chris Caso","Yes, thank you. I guess first question is if you could characterize the strength that you're seeing and kind of where the strength is coming from that's driving the better seasonal Q1. I guess, I'm assuming that the new Chinese 5G phones are a large part of that, if you can clarify that. And then as we go through the year, what is going to be the pace of new introductions in your content gains from the Chinese phones? Is that going to be something that steady through the year, is it more kind of front-end loaded, maybe get some clarification on that.","Liam Griffin","Sure. Sure, Chris. Well, a couple of things. This is the first period that we're actually talking about 5G in devices and bring in revenue to the table. So early, early innings and we're already seeing some improvements in our numbers for Q1 and Q2. And that's the early part of 5G. And if I were to look at that, a lot of that is China, it's the Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi names like that. But we're also seeing ramps coming in with Samsung. I think there's going to be some really nice ramps with one of the larger customers, again haven't put a 5G phone out. And the complexity that we see that I've talked about on this call is real and it's a great opportunity for Skyworks and we are the company that knows how to do the complex things very well. We know mobile, we've been doing this for 20 years. So the transition from 2G to 3G to 4G, talked about that. 5G is much harder. And it's calling upon the resources, our people, our know-how, the facilities, the ability to troubleshoot all that really good stuff is coming to bear right now and allowing us to win business and allowing our customers to be successful. So there is a lot going on that end.","And then the broad market business, the numbers bounce around a little bit, but I can tell you that one of the metrics that we look at is customer acquisition. We want to add customers, we want to add high class, high-end players, margin-rich customers and we're doing it. Some of the names that we talked about, Bosch, Raytheon, names like that getting into industrial and automotive, working with companies like BMW and Nissan. I mean that's really cool stuff and it's still plays on the connectivity core and what's really important for Skyworks is connectivity. And we still can lever those technologies and those resources to port into other markets outside of the mobile phone.","Chris Caso","That's helpful. Thank you. As a follow-up to really what you just said, how does that affect your capacity planning, as you go through the year? And your capex has been fairly steady. I guess maybe up a little bit, but as the 5G ramp proceeds, are there scenarios where you need to put in more substantial capex in order to meet that and at what point in time do you need to make some of those decisions?","Kris Sennesael","No, we're making those decisions on a continuous basis. Just look at the December quarter, we put in an additional $100 million of capex and so we will continue to do so every quarter. And again, it's a combination. Some of that is pure capacity related, right, and expanding the capacity so we can handle the higher volumes. But a big part of that is also technology related, different and more complex type of packaging and testing, expanding our reach in filter technologies as well as with our gallium arsenide power amplifiers. So -- again count on or about 10% of capex, and despite that, we will continue to drive a 30%-plus free cash margin.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman from Cowen. Your line is open.","Karl Ackerman","Thank you. I have two if I may -- I have two if I may. First of all, if we just go back to the March quarter outlook, there's a question on inventory. But how would we classify or how would you classify your inventory across the channel given all top six smartphone suppliers are launching flagships in the March and April time frame? It seems to be kind of a fairly tight window. And I have a follow-up.","Kris Sennesael","Yes -- no, the inventory in the channel seems to be very healthy, at least as far as we have visibility, right, on the component level. There is definitely a little bit of a buildup in anticipation of Chinese New Year. But what we see is that the supply chain is actually struggling a little bit to keep up with the launches of those new 5G phones. And so the inventory in the channel is pretty healthy.","Karl Ackerman","Got it, that's helpful. As my follow-up there has been a lot of noise and I guess perhaps overly concerned on the FCC's decision to halt satellite operators from offering private auctions of the C-band for cellular 5G services here in the United States. Do you think that creates a delay in the implementation of 5G enabled phones here? Should we be worried about it at all? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you.","Liam Griffin","Sure. Yes, I don't think that it is going to affect us in any way. In fact, and if they open it up to the public then it may be an opportunity to have more spectrum and create more opportunities for us to roam -- have our devices roam on. But the base case right now doesn't assume any upside from the 3-5 auctions [ph] on our end. But that's a good question. We'd probably learn more over time, but I don't think there is a negative fall -- a negative spin on that on our end. I think we've pretty much positioned 5G and we're very well aligned with the Standards Boards and where the spectrum is going to be. So we're all over that, but will definitely keep our eyes on the opportunity. If there is more spectrum that's added, we will absolutely be able to develop solutions that will support transmission and communication over that spectrum.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Harsh Kumar","Thanks for squeezing me in. Two questions as well. Liam, one for you. There's a lot of debate on whether the first generation of 5G handsets in the US will be millimeter wave capable. Clearly they'll have some sub-6. I was curious where the Skyworks in and you guys stand on that thought process. And then also how is your preparedness for millimeter wave at this point. Then I had a follow-up.","Liam Griffin","Sure, Harsh. Well, millimeter wave, it's an interesting technology, it's an interesting technology and it has some benefits. Theoretically it has tremendous speed and latency opportunities, but at the same time there are some drawbacks. It's expensive. It draws a lot of current. You have line of sight impediments there. So it isn't something that we are seeing today. We're working with all these customers where it's going to be a kind of a standard offer. It may be a great technology for high dense -- high-density areas, whether college campuses or going into a stadium and you need some really high-speed connection in over a short distance that's unimpeded by any objects, it's possible. But there is some challenge. Now over time that could evolve and it may be just a way for the technology to evolve and make it cost-effective and also performance-effective. But right now it's a little bit out of the aperture. A lot of our customers are not looking at it right now. Some are. We do have some small incremental bets on millimeter wave. And as we've talked about, we have our own fab. So we can run some of the technologies that we need to, if that starts to blossom. But we talk to our customers and that's where we get our cues. And we share information about technology [indiscernible] to help them. But at this point, I don't think it's going to be a significant element in 5G, at least for the next year.","Harsh Kumar","Understood, and very helpful. Thank you, Liam. And then I think at the beginning of the call I think Vivek had asked a question on content increases. And I believe you answered a lot of stuff, but I think you might have skipped that part. I was curious what ex Wi-Fi upgrades and other kind of things like Bluetooth upgrades that might be happening on the RF side, just pure cellular content increase in 5G over 4G? What are you guys seeing? Would you put that as in line with historical or greater than that or even if you want to give a number and be generous with us, we will take that.","Liam Griffin","It's going to be more than -- okay. I'll tell you, it's not -- it's going to be higher than the 3G to 4G upgrade, that I definitely believe. And again it's because the content, the physical content and the specific devices that are necessary to build the 5G solution that incremental value is bigger than the incremental value that went from 3G to 4G. That's an absolute fact.","Now, the question is who is best positioned to capitalize. We have an incredibly broad reach. We have engagements with all the customers, we have the unique technologies that we've noted, not just with capacity, but as Kris said, technology. So we love that. So we think there is going to be a meaningful multi-dollar opportunity. We talked about in our presentations, maybe $5 to $7 or more incremental from 4G. And then the capture on that is all about how do you execute, how do you provide the best solution to your customer and how you bring that to market on time. So those are the factors and that's the stuff we love to do; I mean, that's the strength of our Company.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Griffin for any closing remarks.","Liam Griffin","Thank you all for participating on today's call. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming investor conferences during the quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation."],"19599":["Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) Q1 2014 Earnings Call January 16, 2014  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Stephen Ferranti ","David J.

At this time, I will turn the call over to Steve Ferranti, Senior Director of Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Ferranti, please go ahead.","Stephen Ferranti ","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' first fiscal quarter 2014 conference call. Joining me today are Dave Aldrich, Don Palette and Liam Griffin. Dave will begin today's call with a business overview, followed by Don's financial review and outlook. We will then open the lines for your questions.","Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those noted in our earnings release and those detailed from time to time in our SEC filings.","I'd also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we will discuss today are from a non-GAAP income statement consistent with the format we've used in the past. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for complete reconciliation to GAAP.","With that, I'll turn over the call to Dave for his comments on the quarter.","David J. Aldrich","Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. I'm pleased to report that we're off to a great start to fiscal 2014, as reflected by our strong first quarter performance and above-seasonal guidance for the second quarter. Fueling our success is the proliferation of connectivity in all of its forms across a broad array of end markets and applications. This powerful underlying global trend, combined with our growing analog portfolio, expanding broad market opportunities and consistent execution, all translate into superior ongoing financial results for the company.","Skyworks has become an enabler of all things connected, providing custom solutions that help our customers navigate increasingly complex analog design challenges. We leverage a comprehensive portfolio of technologies and leading-edge integration capabilities to create differentiated solutions. And as the world becomes increasingly more connected and analog complexity escalates, we're uniquely positioned to capitalize.","And our strategy is paying off. During the quarter, we delivered revenue of $505 million. That's ahead of our guidance and up more than 11% year-over-year. We produced operating income of $141.8 million. That's up nearly 24% from a year ago. We posted $0.67 in earnings per share. That's up 22% versus a year ago. And we generated $159 million in cash flow from operations, which is a record for the company.","So in short, Q1 was another excellent quarter for us across all key metrics. And looking ahead, we see our momentum continuing. While March is normally a slower seasonal quarter for the industry, our increasing market diversification and new product ramps are enabling Skyworks to largely offset normal mobile seasonality.","More specifically, during the second quarter, we're seeing strength from our expanding portfolio for the networked home, connectivity solutions in the emerging markets, key vertical market opportunities and our ramp of integrated systems solutions like SkyOne. These drivers are helping to mute seasonal trends at some of our OEM customers. This is a clear testament to our diversification.","To put our growth trajectory into perspective, EPS for the first half of 2014, as measured by our first quarter reported results and second quarter guidance, is 2.5x the EPS we reported for the first half of 2010, representing a 25% compounded growth rate over that 4-year period. With our expanding market footprint, the stage is set for continued revenue growth, margin expansion and earnings leverage.","For more in-depth review of our financial results, I'll turn the call over to Don for his commentary and outlook.","Donald W. Palette","Thanks, Dave, and thanks for joining us, everyone. We appreciate it. Revenue for the first quarter was $505.2 million, ahead of our prior guidance and up more than 11% versus the year-ago quarter and nearly 6% sequentially. Gross profit was $224.7 million or 44.5% of revenue, in line with our prior guidance and up 150 basis points from the year-ago quarter.","Operating expenses were $82.9 million, consisting of R&D expense of $50.8 million and SG&A expense of $32.1 million. We generated $141.8 million of operating income and that yields a 28.1% operating margin and that's a 280 basis point increase versus the year-ago quarter. Our cash tax rate for the quarter was 10%. That produced net income of $127.7 million or $0.67 of diluted earnings per share, $0.01 better than our guidance.","Turning to our first quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement, we generated $159 million in cash flow from operations. We invested $16 million in capital expenditures with depreciation of $21 million and we repurchased 670,000 shares of our common stock, representing a $17 million investment. Given our confidence in our business outlook, we continue to believe that repurchasing shares of common stock represents a highly attractive use of our cash. And finally, we exited the quarter with $649 million in cash and no debt.","Now for our second quarter business outlook. With the demand visibility and order backlog we have in place today, we expect second quarter revenue to be $470 million, significantly better than normal seasonality and representing 11% year-over-year top line growth. At this revenue level, we suggest modeling gross margin in the range of 44% to 44.5%, with operating expenses of approximately $83.5 million.","We continue to see opportunities for sustainable margin expansion, as we leverage our capital investments and benefit from growing demand for our margin-enhancing integrated custom solutions and precision analog products. Below the line, we anticipate $200,000 in expenses from interest income and other expenses and a cash tax rate of around 10%. We project our tax rate to remain at these levels for the remainder of our 2014 fiscal year. We expect the share count to be around 191.5 million shares, resulting in second quarter EPS of $0.59. All of the underlying drivers are in place for Skyworks to continue to outperform.","It's worth noting that our second quarter 2014 guidance represents our fourth consecutive quarter of over 20% year-over-year earnings growth, and that highlights the consistency of our execution in placing our financial returns among the best-of-breed in the semiconductor industry. We are within striking distance of achieving our mid-term business model of 30% operating margin, which, as a reminder, generates around $3 in annualized earnings per share.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave for his comments on the market.","David J. Aldrich","Thanks, Don. For the remainder of the call, I'll provide some perspective on the growth trends in the market and how we position the company to capitalize. Skyworks is at the forefront of enabling the connected world by providing high-performance analog solutions for end markets, ranging from communications infrastructure and network access points to mobile platforms and connected devices within the home, as well as within key verticals like automotive, industrial, like medical.","Looking at the high-level drivers of our market opportunity, entering 2014, we see 3 key trends fueling our growth: First, the adoption of higher data rate services across a broader global footprint; second, the rapid proliferation of connectivity into new vertical markets and expanding device categories; and, third, connected devices incorporating more and more network standards. And I'll spend a few minutes going through each of these in a bit more detail.","Starting first with increasing global demand for high data rate services like 802.11ac and like 4G LTE. The uptake of these technologies, as well as the implementation of multi-antenna architectures and carrier aggregation are still in their infancy, accounting for only a fraction of connected devices today. OEM manufacturers and network operators are rapidly rolling out these technologies in their drive to provide users with a premium connected experience, meaning seamless connections, faster download speeds, improved signal range and longer battery life.","Over the next couple of years, we expect the global footprint of devices utilizing these standards to grow substantially, and we see tremendous opportunities ahead within the emerging markets where broadband penetration rates are low. Population density, however, is high. And there is a general lack of wired communications infrastructure. As an example, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse estimates that the number of LTE-enabled smartphones in Asia will grow by over 70% over the next 2 years. These opportunities drive increased content along with more stringent performance requirements and higher complexity.","Second, connectivity is quickly making its way into new vertical markets and its new device categories. A recent report by Morgan Stanley suggests that, by 2020, the total number of connected devices could reach a staggering 75 billion. The billions of connected devices that make up the Internet of Things will be powered by a combination of sensors, microcontrollers and perhaps more importantly for Skyworks connectivity and power management solutions, dramatically expanding our served addressable markets.","Validating this theme is Google's acquisition of Nest's technologies, with whom we have an extremely strong relationship and high content. We spent the last few years positioning the company for this trend, investing significant resources in new growth verticals outside of mobile in markets like automotive, medical and industrial. These remain a strategic area of investment for us and have contributed to our recent outperformance.","On top of this, the 2014 CES, or Consumer Electronic Show, showcased an entirely new generation of connected devices, like wearable technologies, home automation products, fitness gear, health and wellness products and machine-to-machine devices. While these new products are still in the early stages of evolution, we have already developed traction in this exciting new growth avenue.","Our third growth driver is connected devices incorporating more and more network standards. This is happening across our service markets like the smart home, where we have an exciting and diverse pipeline of opportunities. As one current example, we are engaged on a media gateway design for a leading network operator, which provides the functionality of a traditional set-top box with enhanced capabilities to support home networking and streaming on-demand video. This product incorporates Skyworks' ZigBee, Wi-Fi and GPS solutions, along with a number of our power management products. And we have similar opportunities and applications within the home, spanning gaming, entertainment, security and automation. In these examples, Skyworks is providing the complete analog connectivity solution, driving content expansion for us and the opportunity to differentiate through system customization.","These macro trends in our end markets today validate the strategic directions we've set for the company. We've spent the last decade putting in place sustainable differentiators to simplify complex design challenges across a diverse set of end markets. We're experts in analog system design, leveraging a global force of systems and applications engineers within key vertical markets. We offer an unmatched technology portfolio and strategic partnerships with outside foundries, providing deep expertise in SOI, CMOS, gallium arsenide filters, silicon germanium and on and on; and we have leading capabilities in advanced multi-chip module integration.","A prime example of our differentiation in the market is our SkyOne platform, which leverages all of these competitive advantages to provide unprecedented levels of integration and performance. We ramped SkyOne with our 2 first customers this quarter, Samsung and HTC, and we expect to add new customers throughout the year.","We also captured other new design wins during the quarter across a number of diverse applications, including 802.11ac solutions in set-top boxes, Blu-ray players and LED\/4K TVs, RF subsystems for Ericsson for 4G LTE base stations, power management devices within Philips' wearable technologies and health and wellness applications, connectivity ICs supporting Nest's suite of smart home products, switch models in Belkin's wireless home lighting solutions, envelope tracking solutions within multiple 4G LTE platforms and connectivity ICs in Fitbit's smart scale and connected wristband fitness systems.","It's clear that we're riding a wave of powerful underlying market forces. We expect these trends to fuel growth in our addressable markets for years to come. And as our product highlights demonstrated, we're capitalizing today.","In closing, we're quite optimistic about our prospects for the remainder of 2014 and beyond. Our strategy of continuing to diversify and expand into new verticals while maintaining a laser focus on operational execution is clearly working.","Okay. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open the line, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] For our first question, it comes from the line of Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer.","Richard E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just had a couple of questions. The first, I guess, is what is driving, I guess, this near-term strength that you're seeing? I know you talked about seeing an above-seasonal March quarter here. Is it any one particular customer or end market, or is it more broad than that?","David J. Aldrich","Thank you, Rick. The way we see March shaping up is, I think, there'll be fairly normal historical seasonal patterns in mobile. Obviously, we're seeing some OM -- OEMs impacted more than others. I think the difference is our opportunity, or our target, is much broader than others and is basically driven by end market diversification and content gains. I think the specific areas of strength are: We're seeing continuous success and sequential growth in the Connected Home products that I think we talked about a bit in our prepared comments; we're seeing strong demand in emerging markets; we're seeing strong demand in some of the new verticals; and, by the way, we're ramping high ASP and high-margin products like SkyOne. So I think it's a combination of those offsetting seasonality.","Richard E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, just as a follow-up, in TD-LTE -- and correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you've said in the past you're close to about 50% of MediaTek's quad core designs or reference designs. Is that still true? And what does that trend look like this year? I know you -- as you called out Asia, I think, specifically talking about the opportunity there with LTE devices over the next couple of the years, I'm just -- if you could quantify anything there that would be great.","Liam K. Griffin","Sure. Yes. This is Liam on that. MediaTek continues to be a really important customer for us. We are on their latest quad core platforms and their newest LTE platforms. And what that means for us is really a significant upgrade in content versus a traditional 2G or even a 3G phone, so we're seeing content around the power amplifier suite moving into more multi-mode complex systems, but we're also, in addition sweeping an ASM technology with switch, GPS in some cases and even seeing Wi-Fi attached. So it's a meaningful cycle, and we're in the very early innings of that upgrade throughout China.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Gauna with JMP Securities.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","I wonder if you could give us a little bit of color on how China Mobile appears to be factoring into what you just delivered and what you guided to, maybe some indications on how you feel the build-out is going to be and if there's any risk, you think, of a hangover, if we have channel fill and not so much channel sell-through and, I guess, some color on that.","David J. Aldrich","So I think -- let me, kind of, answer it maybe in a broad way. We're actually -- what we're seeing in China today and we're seeing some pretty strong growth here, is that, more than anything, the upgrade cycle -- irrespective of which carrier, the upgrade cycle is sweeping in a lot more analog functionality and connectivity in ac [ph] and some of our products for switching and control. We're seeing strong attach rate with QRD, strong attach rate with MediaTek, including some of their workhorse, smartphone, quad core models. And I think, if you look at the big players in China, think of Lenovo, Huawei, Coolpad, and if you look at some of those teardown reports, we've got a lot of content and very high penetration rates. So I think, if you combine all those, we're just pretty broad there and we're seeing a lot of incremental content.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, you've mentioned the diversification strength across some various areas, most of them still having to do with wireless connectivity. Could you comment on where you are in terms of evolving some of your HPA opportunities that aren't cellular attached? I know you talked about Connected Home, but you briefly mentioned power management. Where are you seeing that? How are things going on the wireless infrastructure side?","Liam K. Griffin","Sure, Alex. Yes. I mean, outside of the core mobile business, we are seeing a lot of diversification and opportunities, home automation, ZigBee-enabled lighting. For example, we have a design win with Philips, where they're using blue light LED inside of a wearable patch for therapeutic purposes. The Fitbit example that Dave mentioned, another outstanding opportunity for us is leveraging Wi-Fi. We're moving into power management with DC-to-DC and voltage regulators. We have LED backlight in automotive applications. Just a broad reach of opportunities, and we feel that our team in the field is picking up more and more opportunities each quarter. We're very excited about where that can go.","David J. Aldrich","And, Alex, we've built out a system engineering and an applications infrastructure throughout the world. We're really getting better and better at identifying sockets where we can penetrate, we can customize, gain some real value and add value to our customers. I think, just if you look at the orders we booked this quarter, and I mentioned a few of them, but -- there was Philips. There was Nest. There was FitBit. There was Belkin. So it's really across the board, everything from the cable modem to the gateway products to all kinds of appliances. So it's really across the board.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Anne Edelstein","This is Anne Edelstein calling in on behalf of Vivek. I guess, the first question is, I look at the way that you are guiding operating expenses in the current quarter, it's coming up somewhat quarter-over-quarter as revenues are declining. Can you just talk -- is that a one-off? Can you talk a little bit more about that and how that factors into your pace [ph] to 30% operating margin?","Donald W. Palette","Sure, Anne. This is Don. We've been pretty consistent about our ongoing investment in some of the key areas in the business. Particularly, if you look at the OpEx increase that we just saw from fiscal Q4 to the December quarter fiscal Q1, all of that increase was in R&D and that's a similar pattern that you'll see in our guide from March, and it's really just reflective of some critical investments that we're making in R&D teams to support our continued focus and ability to grow in some of these new vertical markets. So we feel really good about those investments. We've been consistent about our OpEx slowly increasing this year and -- but there's a tremendous amount of leverage still left in the model, when you look at the revenue growth.","Anne Edelstein","Great. And then, I guess, a little bit more on the China opportunity. How well positioned do you think that you are currently to grow as the TD-LTE market, sort of, takes off this year? And how do you see your opportunity maybe diversifying a bit into some of the lower end phones?","David J. Aldrich","Well -- thanks, Anne. I think that the -- one way to look at it is -- the way we kind of decompose that market and there is going to be some big customer winners or at least high volume drivers within that market. And so, we focused very intently on them. We've done -- as I mentioned, we've done a really good job, we think, with Lenovo, with Huawei, with Coolpad, with some others that are really going to drive a great deal of volume, plus there are hundreds of indigenous OEMs. But we've done really well with, I think, the volume drivers. We've also focused for a long time, as you know, with MediaTek.","And I'm really very pleased with the amount of penetration we've got in all their reference designs, particularly the workhorses we think that are going to drive high dollar content smartphones. We've got everything from ASM-based products. Now we've got some connectivity products, multi-mode PA switches. So again, the whole -- and I guess the third element, is the whole theme of -- as these phones become more -- smartphones become more complex and indeed feature phone transitions to smartphone and then smartphone move more towards 4K, they're having very high penetration rate of some pretty sophisticated analog processing, and that's where we've been excelling is being able to sell more of the system solution by having our applications engineers and system designers hand-in-hand with our chipset marketers in that region, whether it's MediaTek, QRD -- or Qualcomm QRD, and that's where we're gaining volume and we're gaining share.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Richard Sewell with Stephens.","Richard Sewell - Stephens Inc., Research Division","It's Richard calling in for Harsh. So first question, looking out over this year, how are you thinking about the growth opportunity in mobile and specifically in the smartphone end market?","Liam K. Griffin","First of all, we're still very bullish on mobile in general and smartphone specifically. We talked about China as a real theme that we're benefiting from. But even in traditional Tier 1 accounts, we continue to see the need for higher data rates, more advanced protocols and that brings complexity to the table. So as we look out through 2014 and the platforms we're designing now for 2015, the performance of these products is going up and up and our ability to deliver simplicity here is exactly what these customers want. So we're really excited about it -- the content theme is coming together. There's more bands. There's a lot of complexity in filtering and tuning. The analog suite that we bring to the table is another real key driver for us. So we like that. We think it's a great trend. We're seeing it with our Tier 1s. And as we talked about already today, we really like what we're seeing in China.","Richard Sewell - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Great. And for my follow-up, what are some of the remaining levers to get to that 30% up margin you always talked about?","Donald W. Palette","It's pretty consistent, Richard, with what we've talked about. It's -- number one, it's -- we have said consistently that we need to be at about $550 million per quarter in revenue. With that and with the spending profile we're looking for the rest of the year, that gives you the continued leverage on the OpEx expenses, which help. And we're going to continue to drive margin expansion. And that's a long list of items, whether it's leveraging the CapEx investments we're making, it's the improved margin on some of the new system solutions that are rolling out, it's our hybrid manufacturing model, our ability to keep our utilization at a very high rate, it's how we manage the supply chain. It's multiple things. So if you -- we would expect to drop that incremental revenue to about [ph] 48%, which will continue to drive margins. So it's a combination of both.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company.","N. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Dave, I'm just wondering, you've talked a lot about IoT this -- on the conference call. Clearly, you guys are well positioned with high-performance analog, power management and some of your connectivity solutions. But things like microcontrollers and sensors are also pretty key solutions and could align pretty nicely with your product portfolio. Do you guys have a strategy potentially to either partner or potentially look to expand your product portfolio into those types of devices for IoT?","David J. Aldrich","Yes. Thank you, Quinn. That's a great question. The horses we're riding in '14, '15 will continue to be what we were doing in much of '13, which is -- the earlier question that Richard had was about our feeling about smartphones. Irrespective of what the growth rate of smartphone is, one thing is for certain, that customers need to see more analog solutions that sweep in functionality because they're finding it too difficult to meet the constraints of the baud space, current consumption and so on.","So we have been increasingly, even if we don't sell it in an integrated platform like SkyOne -- in as integrated a platform as SkyOne, we're able to bundle those products and guarantee the system global performance by working with our customers at the radio baud level. And recently, that's begun to sweep in more and more high-performance Wi-Fi, ac and the like, multi-mode Wi-Fi, GPS-shielded devices that incorporate filtering. We talked about power, lighting and display. That's a big deal, where you're trying to drive very high-performance camera flash, for example, or display. So there's a lot of power management and voltage regulation that this complexity is driving, and we think we're the only folks out there today who can take a complete suite of products and, from a system standpoint, lay it out for them.","Now when you look at the next click, I am very intrigued by the opportunities for, for example, MEMS-based technology to do things in not only in the microphone space but in gyros and sensors and then taking that product outside. So we are investing, we are creating partnerships that are going to allow us to go to the next click because I think the next big wave is going to be around sensing level functionality and all kinds of motion controls. And we're going to play there, and we're investing now.","N. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then, the second question I had is -- I mean, you guys are obviously very well positioned in Wi-Fi front-end. There has been some talk about 2 x 2 MIMO potentially moving out -- or moving down from the tablet space into some of the higher end smartphone platforms. Do you guys have a view -- is that a real opportunity for you in 2014, or do you think, for power reasons, that you'd most likely stay 1 x 1 in smartphones?","Liam K. Griffin","Yes. It's a great question. We talked a lot about MIMO technology and access points using 3 x 3, even 4 x 4 multiple screens and access points to extend range and performance. We are actually, to your point, seeing this now in smartphones, and we think the benefit provided to the consumer is outstanding. It's, again, higher data rate, greater levels of connectivity, expanded range and the value to the consumer is there. And for us, it actually effectively doubles the content in phones that go 2 x 2 or 3 x 3 would be a triple. So we're excited by it and we like the fact that, again, the relentless demand for connectivity, for data -- for wireless data continues and the kind of solutions that we talked about here are really in high demand now.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James.","Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","You guys obviously discussed and listed in your press release a whole bunch of non-handset-related drivers. And I was hoping you could give us, sort of, your typical breakout, the cellular group versus analog and -- but in addition to that, I guess, typically, you're like 60-40 or something like that. But within that Wi-Fi portion, that's usually -- a lot of it still seems to be going to handset. So could you say how much is handset and non-handset all in? And what I'm trying to get at is, where are you now and where can you go 3 years out on that non-handset portion?","David J. Aldrich","Yes. Steve, I'm glad you asked that question because the -- I think we recognize that the split we have discussed -- we continue to discuss the 6 [ph] which is today around 60-40. That's consistent this last quarter, really kind of hearkens back to a couple of years ago -- a few years ago when we talked about 80-20 with 80% being dominated by PA and transmit module products and 20% mostly infrastructure, some Home, some Smart Energy.","The fact is that business today is very different. So if I look at where the growth is coming from -- maybe this will help answer your question. In mobile, for example, the growth is -- our PA business, for example, is declining as a percentage of sales. It's still growing, but it's declining as a percentage of our revenue. And what's growing fast is these mobile analog solutions we're talking about, GPS, Wi-Fi, power display, as well as highly integrated solutions like power amplifier duplexers, SkyOne and the like. That's where the growth.","And then, the second growth engine has been in non-mobile. We've talked about the Connected Home. We've talked about automotive and medical. So that's really the way we are running the business today. And I think, as we go forward, we'll be looking for ways to kind of articulate better for you what that split is because I think the 60-40 is probably not as useful as it once was.","Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And you guys really helped us out last quarter. You gave some color, an extra quarter out where you sort of gave us some thoughts on March. I was hoping you might be able to give us some color into June. Obviously, more and more, we're seeing some big OEMs drive that but [indiscernible]. How should we think about seasonality for your -- for you in June? And how is it looking right now?","David J. Aldrich","Yes. I think it's a little too early to get very specific. I would say that I don't see any reason to believe that it won't be a normally modest up quarter. That's usually the case in the June quarter. And as we look at our business rolling out in 2014 for Q2, Q3, Q4, we see similar trends as -- in Q3 as we do in Q2 or in June as we do in March, which is these share gains, content gains, diversification gains largely offsetting whatever seasonal mobile business may be thrown at us. We expect to have a good June quarter. We expect the mobile market to be up modestly a few percentage.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Stoss with Craig-Hallum.","Anthony J. Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Dave, can you give us a sense on the analog side for March? In terms of your overall guide [Audio Gap] you expect that business to be up sequentially in March. Also, I know there's a lot of different products and units that you could get [ph] on the Internet of Things. I'd love to hear your view on how you can piggyback multiple chipsets and what your view is on overall content for Skyworks in the Internet of Things.","David J. Aldrich","Yes. Thanks. I think that our March non-mobile business will be roughly flat. And so, most of the seasonality is occurring among those OEMs in our mobile business. And if I think within that roughly flat, which is much better than seasonality, it really is -- as we talked about in the prepared comments, it's a combination of, obviously, traditional Wi-Fi products and more Wi-Fi content where we're looking to have multi-mode Wi-Fi that has more ac content and so on and so forth.","We're also seeing ZigBee content that's meaningful. There's also some real power management and voltage challenges with some of these devices -- these gateway devices we talked about, and we talked at length in the prepared comments about an engagement we have with a service provider today. There's a lot of dollar content and a very cool complex products. And the content there is multiple dollars and it's GPS, it's Wi-Fi, it's cellular.","So I think it's really all of the above in the Home, and we've talked about brand new nascent products for us. I mean, we're just starting to see meaningful revenue coming from medical devices we talked about, in some automotive devices, in the Volkswagen platform we have in the press release. That's kind of a sleek product going into an in-mounted dash entertainment [ph] Volkswagen device.","Anthony J. Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, lastly, on your SkyOne comments, the traction you're seeing there, is that more in the low end, midrange phones [ph] love to hear your view on where it's ending up.","Liam K. Griffin","Sure, Tony. Yes. So as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have 2 customers right now in production, HTC and Samsung. We're making great progress with both. We're in high-volume production on some very sleek smartphones. There's a number of customers right now that are in various stages of sampling, some traditional Tier 1, some players in Asia. But we certainly expect, as we see success with those 2 customers, we expect several more to ramp during the calendar year.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","This holiday season, it seems that the carriers were more aggressive in subsidizing LTE tablets, especially on the Android side. Have you seen a discernible mix shift from WiFi-only tablets to LTE? And is that helping some of your growth drivers into the near term?","Liam K. Griffin","Yes. That's a great question. As you know, we've seen really nice attach with Wi-Fi and tablets, and we're also, by the way, seeing tablet expanding dramatically from some of the real strong U.S.-based Tier 1s to a burgeoning market in China. So there -- that's good. So we see unit increase there that's substantial. All of that's been WiFi-enabled. But it is true we're starting to see more and more LTE -- full cellular LTE engines attaching with Wi-Fi. In the past, it may have been about 25% to 30% penetration. We've seen some companies go 100%. But certainly, the dial is moving up, and that does present a real significant pop in content for us.","David J. Aldrich","Yes. I think, Mike, it wasn't much -- it's not a big driver in this last quarter, but I think the trend is clearly there and I expect it to be meaningful in out quarters.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay. And then, follow-up question -- and that's helpful, Dave. A follow-up question, just going back to some of these interesting design wins and kind of the Internet of Things market, a lot of these early-stage ramps are much smaller than, say, a handset ramp. So how do the gross margins compare now and how can the gross margins in this division maybe improve over time as some of these things, like Nest, could ramp into really big units longer term?","Donald W. Palette","Yes. Mike, as we've said, if you look at the suite of products and systems solutions that we're delivering in the diversified analog space, they are typically accretive to the overall corporate margins. So as we're successful, continuing to gain share and grow that business, it's going to, without question, move our margins forward. But I do want to point out, the margin expansion that you're seeing as well is the value add that we're doing in the complex system solutions that's tied into the mobile space as well. We're having some real good success there, too. So it's both. But clearly, the analog -- that analog piece of business growth margins will expand.","Operator","And next, we go to the line of Mike Burton with Brean Capital.","Michael A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Wanted to follow up on that question -- on the previous one on SkyOne ramping this quarter. Can you remind us the type of dollar content you get there compared to your average and maybe help describe some of those initial platforms you've secured?","Liam K. Griffin","Certainly. Yes. Well, SkyOne is a meaningful increase in content versus even our traditional Tier 1 engagements. So it provides not only a full multi-mode, multi-band power amplifier solutions, we bring in expertly matched and tuned filters. It's configurable. We can make a unique platform for any given customer. And what we also provide is a great deal of the engineering systems benefit. So a customer that has a time-to-market challenge or is spending their R&D budget on look-and-feel industrial design software screens, we can unburden them completely from this cycle engine [ph], so there's a lot of value.","The 2 customers that we named, they're really just the beginning. Very proud to be within Samsung, I mean, they're the market leader in this space across the board. They found a great deal of value in our solution. HTC, another player that does incredible industrial design and really good brand, really good look and feel. We were a perfect solution there. And there's a long list of others that we're in various stages of sampling today, so we're quite bullish on our opportunity there.","Michael A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, also, can you talk a little bit about the wireless infrastructure market? How big is exposure there now for you guys? And have you begun to see any life there? And then, just lastly, any 10% customers?","Liam K. Griffin","Yes. On the infrastructure side, I mean, it's an important market for Skyworks and it's been relatively flat over the last few years. We have strong position with Ericsson, with Huawei, with ZTE, Nokia-Siemens, so all of those players. We're starting now to see, finally, some upside with LTE rollouts. Everything that we've spoken about with respect to China and even the smartphone gains in the U.S. are moving towards 4G and LTE solutions. There needs to be that commensurate network infrastructure to handle the data. So we're finally seeing it. It's not double digit right now, but it's slowly moving in that direction. Fortunately, for us, over the last few years, we've really been doing a nice job expanding our reach, adding a lot of new products there, whether they be power management products or highly customized analog solutions. So we'll be in good shape when that market picks up.","Donald W. Palette","And, Mike, the -- it was -- the 10% were Foxconn and Samsung during the quarter.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A couple of questions. One, I just want to better understand the comments on seasonality. You said the nonmobile would be flat. I guess, everybody has got the old metrics, the 60-40, and I'm assuming that comment assumes some portion of that 40% is also mobile. I know you didn't break out Dave, but if you could just clarify that.","David J. Aldrich","I was -- when I talked about the nonmobile being relatively flat, I just mean everything that's not in the smartphone. That's what I mean.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got you. And then, if you could just talk about seasonality. It's hard, and there's no real -- given the concentration in customers, things like the seasonality changes every year. Last year, you benefited from a new product ramp. Are you seeing any benefits to the upside as far as major products? Or kind of, if you can just talk about what you're seeing from a seasonality in mobile. Are you seeing products platforms ramp down? Are you getting any benefit? You mentioned SkyOne, but I'm assuming that's not a huge number. Is there any sort of ups versus normal seasonality in mobile besides SkyOne?","David J. Aldrich","Yes, we actually do, Blayne. We see a couple of customers -- or some customers being pretty dramatically down. It's just normal the way they've rolled their products out. We see others up. We see some customers within China up.","We -- it's no secret that Samsung tends to take their inventory down and have a soft December. That occurred for us. That's less so in the March quarter, so that's a contributor. We are ramping SkyOne. As Liam mentioned, that has high dollar content. And again, this portion of the business that is nonmobile or outside of a smartphone, we're seeing some nice tablet growth, some nice high dollar content products in these vertical markets. So I think it's really a combination of all those things. But we're certainly not immune from OEMs taking the smartphone volumes down in March. We see some of that.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Edward Snyder with Charter Equity.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","SkyOne. So I think there's some confusion in the investor base when Qualcomm talks about RF360. I think a lot of folks think SkyOne is a similar product, but it's quite a bit different, isn't it, Liam? It looks like maybe MMPA, some amplifiers, but much more focused on the hardened bands [ph], but more utility. Can you just give us a really brief descriptions of, one, what's in it; and, two, how it varies from what a lot of people think is going on with RF360?","Liam K. Griffin","Well, one of the most important parts is that it's made up of proven core building blocks that have been proven in Skyworks for years. We also have the ability to uniquely configure the solution, so it is not a one-shop-fits-all, kind of, solution. A lot of the work, the tuning, the matching, bringing in multiple bands of filters, using different technologies, as Dave pointed out, we have a very strong partnership with filter players [ph].","We can bring in BAW solutions, we can bring in SAW -- temp comp SAW. We can weave in our own power management, ET-based solutions if needed and then deliver unique MMPAs that wrap around it. So the ability to configure -- highly configure customer by customer rather than give a single monolithic solution is very important to us. We found each engagement to end up uniquely with a different design, and we found our benefit to deliver time-to-market. Our systems and tuning expertise from our teams, all to be really differentiators for SkyOne.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","And then, you've mentioned several times that not only just high dollar content but also your margin profile this product is -- is it accretive to mobile, accretive to consolidated margins? Can you give us a feel for that? And does that include any of -- you mentioned the [indiscernible] controller, et cetera or digital controller. Does it include any of the ET products, by that, I mean, amplifiers or modulators?","Donald W. Palette","As Liam said, it's a platform. So case-by-case, the margin profile can swing. But generally, it's at or above our best margins we would see typically in the mobile space. So that's kind of the way to think of it.","David J. Aldrich","And, Ed, with respect to ET, it does not include the ET modulator today. It does include ET PAs tuned and designed from the ground up to be high performance in ET mode.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Suji De Silva with Topeka.","Sujeeva De Silva - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So can you talk about what you're seeing in the marketplace from integrated solutions like Qualcomm's RF360 if you're seeing traction there, perhaps, competitively?","David J. Aldrich","Yes. Thank you. We don't see -- the short answer is, no, we don't see traction competitively from the RF360 today. I will say that, by its nature, that product and to some degree, our SkyOne -- or, at least, elements within our SkyOne family, they're very highly integrated products, lots of bands, lots of filtering. We see certain customers -- while perhaps somewhat limited in scope, that really need somebody to come in and step up and provide more functionality. PA-centric, albeit but more functionality.","And so -- and then, on top of that, we try to bolt and we do bolt around that front-end functionality, that transmit chain functionality, a lot of GPS, power management, tuning devices. So I would say that we don't see competitive threat today, if you will, but we do see an opportunity to compete in the sense that both products provide for that segment of the market a complete solution. I'll also mention that we really are seeing a lot more content attach rate with Qualcomm, whether it's QRD or Qualcomm here with a lot more product. So I'm really delighted with the amount of partnership, the relationship and the fact that we have a lot of dollar content.","Sujeeva De Silva - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","That's helpful color. And then, on the balance sheet, you did a good job buying back shares here, but you're generating a lot of cash and building up a significant amount of cash balance. What's the comfortable level of cash for you guys? And would you contemplate dividend given the strength of your fundamentals?","Donald W. Palette","Yes, Suji. We did -- Thanks. We ended the quarter at $649 million in cash, and we're really happy with our consistent ability and the velocity with which we convert the strong earnings into cash flow. We're always looking at the capital structure. And clearly, when you look at our financial growth opportunities in the model going forward, that we're going to continue to buy back stock. We think it's an excellent way to deliver shareholder value.","And just to frame that for everybody, we -- over the last 5 quarters, we have spent around $190 million on share buybacks. We still have over $200 million approved by the board of share buybacks. So we'll continue to be in the market to do that. You balance that with maintaining the financial flexibility for strategic growth initiatives. So that's one of the things that we do. And then, we absolutely are looking at a dividend as a possibility in the future. There's no question.","Operator","And next, we go to the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Hoping to get a little bit more on your capital spending plans or your capital addition plans for the year.","Donald W. Palette","Hello. Yes, sure, Tom. I would -- we don't really provide guidance going out, but CapEx for us is really volume dependent. So as we're making CapEx investments above our depreciation level around $20 million, that's a positive thing. The payback on the capital we're putting in is generally very, very short, and it's based on our visibility to volumes. I think it's safe to say that you should be thinking about something slightly above our depreciation level for now for the last 3 quarters of the fiscal year. That's a safe starting place.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then, when you look at some of your integrated modules, can you talk more about the potential to get access to BAW filters in the future?","David J. Aldrich","Sure. Well, it's interesting, the integrated modules, whether it be PADs or SkyOne, if you look at the teardown reports, we've got a fairly big footprint now in filters. We are in production today with a host of different SAW devices. We're now shipping temperature-compensated SAW products and designing those into our modules. And we expect, throughout 2014, for there to be some bands. There won't be very many of them, but there'll be some bands because of the tight band spacing and coupled with high frequency, where there will be some BAW devices.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And do your suppliers have access to that yet?","David J. Aldrich","Yes, yes.","Operator","And next, we go to the line of Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I just want to get your thoughts on who your top 10 -- the 3 -- or top 3 major customers in the quarter [indiscernible] how do you see the China market?","Donald W. Palette","Well, Vijay, the top 10 -- the only 10% customers this quarter were Foxconn and Samsung.","David J. Aldrich","And I think the China market, we're expecting to see very robust smartphone growth. We're seeing 4G attach. We've got a good lineup of our products with QRD, Qualcomm and with MediaTek and others, and we're benefiting not only from the increased complexity on the transmit side, but we're sweeping in a lot more high-performance Wi-Fi connectivity power lighting and display and some voltage and power. So we're seeing an increase in content as the shift to smartphone occurs. So we feel very good about China.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got it. And if I may have a follow-up, when you look at the gross margins, you're doing very well on the gross margin side. What are the levers that should go through 2014 on that? Obviously, some are very nicely, but how do you see that going forward?","David J. Aldrich","For '14...","David J. Aldrich","As I said, we want you to continue to model an incremental 48%, which is going to expand margin as we grow. And it's driven by a long list of items, the products -- the new products we're releasing, the design, the system solutions, the value-add that's driving margin. Our focus on the metrics in the factory in driving yield and productivity leveraging the CapEx investment, so it's a long list of things that will continue to enable us to drive that margin expansion forward.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Aldrich for any closing comments.","David J.

At this time, I will turn the call over to Steve Ferranti, Senior Director of Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Ferranti, please go ahead.","Stephen Ferranti ","Thanks, Kathy. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' Third Fiscal Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Joining me today are Dave Aldrich, Don Palette and Liam Griffin. Dave will begin today's call with the business overview, followed by Don's financial review and outlook. We will then open the lines for your questions.","Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those noted in our earnings release and those detailed from time to time in our SEC filings.","I would also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we will discuss today are from our non-GAAP income statement, consistent with the format we've used in the past. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.","With that, I'll turn over the call to Dave for his comments on the quarter.","David J. Aldrich","Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. Well, I'm pleased to report that Skyworks posted another strong performance during our third fiscal quarter, in which we again exceeded prior guidance and we outpaced our addressable markets. Our diversification into new adjacent analog products and in complementary vertical markets, along with an intense focus on operational excellence, have enabled us to produce consistently strong operating results through a variety of market conditions. And from where we stand today, we're well positioned to extend our track record of outperformance.","Turning to the third quarter results. We posted revenue of $389 million, better than our prior guidance of $383 million. We produced third quarter operating income of $91.8 million, and we earned $0.45 in diluted earnings per share. This is $0.01 better than our original guidance.","Globally, consumer appetite for smartphones, for tablets, data cards and an array of other mobile Internet devices remains high, driven by the boom in social networking and driven by an accelerating shift towards cloud-based content, by mobile computing displacing traditional PCs, and the growing popularity of photo-sharing applications like Flickr, Instagram and Picasa, and the explosion in video conferencing and streaming video. These global themes are in the early stages of adoption and should provide a tailwind for our business for years to come.","So while the long-term trends for us are clear, there's no denying that more recently, the macroeconomic climate and other factors have skewed normal demand patterns within the industry. Skyworks' ability to maintain consistently strong growth and operating results in spite of this is the result of key 3 factors -- or 3 key factors. First, new vertical market opportunities. The opportunity for Skyworks is quickly expanding. It's well known that broadband connectivity is proliferating across a growing array of previously unconnected consumer electronics. What's more, the need for high-performance analog solutions is expanding into brand-new markets like medical, automotive, military and industrial.","Second, the rising RF content per device. This is driven by a dramatic increase in the number of LTE-enabled devices and a major smartphone upgrade cycle just beginning in the emerging markets. Average RF dollar content per device continues to move higher. This creates a rising tide for the foreseeable future and translates into TAM growth rate significantly above unit growth. This is playing out real time today across major development platforms on which we're engaged.","And third, expanding our product portfolio between -- beyond traditional served markets. Through a combination of internal developments and targeted acquisitions, we have added an incremental $2 to $3 of addressable content per device to our core RF TAM. Today, we're seeing tremendous traction by cross-selling these new products throughout our existing customer base. It's worth noting that none of these products were in our portfolio just 18 months ago.","So in short, we have strategically positioned the company to outperform our addressable market, independent of underlying market conditions, and we remain quite optimistic about the second half of 2012 and beyond.","Looking ahead, we see our target markets continuing to expand for many years to come. And for example, industry analysts project that over the next 5 years, mobile broadband users will grow at a 38% compound rate. In fact, tablet shipments alone could reach more than 350 million units within the next 3 years according to recent reports by Morgan Stanley.","And wireless connectivity is becoming the critical link to enable access to a growing library of cloud-based content, including music, online media and publications, on-demand video, personal photos, home movies and enterprise data. And the recent introduction of a -- of family data plans from major network operators will allow an increasing number of devices per household to enable shared access to cloud content on an anytime-anywhere basis.","However, one of the greatest challenges facing mobile device OEMs within this landscape is managing escalating RF complexity. And this is resulting from the proliferation of air interface technologies, including 2G, 3G and 4G cellular, dual-band wireless local area networking, Bluetooth, GPS and Near Field Communications.","The number of cellular bands alone is increasing exponentially. In fact, we see upcoming smartphone platforms that will support more than 14 different bands, each requiring distinct amplification, filtering, switching and shielding. All of this is happening in smaller form factors with increased battery life requirements, while trying to manage bond costs.","This increasing complexity plays directly into Skyworks' core strengths and uniquely positions us to address these challenges. Today, we're providing the broadest portfolio of RF and analog solutions right from the transceiver to the antenna. We're offering an unmatched technology portfolio that includes deep expertise in SOI, high power, CMOS, HBT, pHEMT, BiFET and silicon germanium, along with a library of nearly 1,000 patents and supporting intellectual property. We maintain unrivaled scale and world-class facilities for integrating multiple technologies into highly sophisticated multiple chip -- multichip modules.","And finally, we're leveraging a deep heritage in system-level design and a global force of system and applications engineers often deployed within steps of our customers' facilities. These competitive advantages took years to put in place and facilitate the highest level of integration and better system performance, ultimately providing more value to our customers.","A prime example of how we leverage these core competencies to extend our technology leadership is the recent introduction of our SkyOne platform. SkyOne is a revolutionary patented front-end system that incorporates all of the RF and analog content between the transceiver and the antenna into a single ultracompact device. This is a complete system in a package, incorporating multiband amplifiers, supporting global 2G, 3G and 4G coverage, along with all associated filtering, duplexers, switching and control functionality in less than 1\/2 the footprint of even the most advanced approaches in the industry today.","The end result is significant board space savings, ease of implementation, high performance and time-to-market advantages for our customers. In these types of applications, we see a much narrower competitive landscape. Looking ahead, we expect to extend our technology lead as we introduce solutions incorporating sophisticated RF signal processing, more complex switching and even higher levels of integration.","Okay, so turning now to specific third quarter product highlights. Across our mobile customer base, we've seen tremendous traction in cross-selling our portfolio of new analog product lines, alongside our traditional RF front-end components. In some recently launched models, Skyworks has secured a total of 7 or more devices, including multimode power amplifier, Antenna Switch Modules, camera flash, DC-DC converters, high-efficiency LTE amplifiers, backlighting ICs, GPS low-noise amplifiers and wireless LAN front-end modules. This level of content was unheard of for us just a couple of years ago.","Outside of mobile devices, we are also captured new design wins across a number of diverse applications within our high performance analog products group. These include wireless LAN sockets on a recently introduced ultrathin high-end notebook PC, which includes a total of 9 Skyworks parts. This includes a receiver protection module within a heart monitor application with Medtronic, a high sensitivity mixers for an automotive toll tag application and major set-top box win containing multiple Skyworks components, including the switch matrix and low-noise amplifier modules.","And finally, the first 802.11ac router products are now commercially available, containing up to 6 Skyworks devices per router. In total, we've already secured over 20 design wins across a variety of 802.11ac-enabled devices, including routers, set-top boxes, notebook PCs and USB dongles.","So in closing, our third quarter marked another strong performance for Skyworks. We believe that our strategy of continuing to diversify our business, expanding into new verticals and maintaining a laser focus on operational execution is clearly working.","With that, I'll now turn it over to Don for his financial review.","Donald W. Palette","Thanks, Dave, and thanks again for joining us, everyone, today. We appreciate that. Well first I'll provide a summary of our third quarter results and then outline our business outlook for the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2012.","Revenue for the third fiscal quarter was $389 million, which was up 7% sequentially and more than 9% year-over-year. Gross profit was $168.1 million or 43.2% of revenue. Operating expenses were $76.3 million, consisting of R&D expense of $48.6 million and SG&A expense of $27.7 million, yielding $91.7 million of operating income and a 23.6% operating margin.","Cash taxes were $5.7 million, and that translates into a 6.2% tax rate. Net income was $86.1 million or $0.45 of diluted earnings per share, and that's $0.01 better than our guidance.","Turning to our third quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement. We generated $44 million in cash flow from operations, and that brings us year-to-date to a total of $244 million.","We exited the quarter with $327.9 million in cash, and we invested $31 million in capital expenditures during the third quarter, with depreciation of $17 million. The elevated levels of capital expenditures are a result of our continuing capacity expansion across all of our facilities to support second half product ramps. And as a reminder, these investments consist of equipment adds when our existing facilities gave a very quick payback and they enhanced our return on invested capital.","Now for our fourth quarter 2012 business outlook. We are guiding the fourth quarter revenue to be $415 million to $420 million. At this revenue level, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 43% to 43.5%. Looking ahead, we see gross margins continuing to improve as we realize synergies associated with our recent acquisitions and as we capture the margin benefits of some of our recent capital investments.","We expect the fourth quarter operating expense to be approximately $77 million. And below the line, we expect $100,000 in expenses from interest income and other expenses and a cash tax rate around 6.5%. And as a result, we expect EPS of $0.50 to $0.51 using a base of 193.5 million shares.","That concludes our prepared remarks. So, operator, go ahead and open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.","Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","First is a clarification. Looking at the quarter's performance, you were $6 million above your guidance. Don, can you tell us how that broke out between either strength on the cellular part of the business or linear products business or was it strength in both that did the results?","Donald W. Palette","It was really strength in both. We didn't see a significant shift in the percentage revenue slip between the 2, so that increase was really split fairly evenly as we normally would see between those 2 segments.","Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, so you're still at 65-35 per year?","Donald W. Palette","Correct.","Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the question I think on the last call, one of the things you indicated is you expected an above seasonal revenue profile in the back half of the year. Is that still the expectation? And can you just remind us what calendar fourth quarter seasonality would be for you?","David J. Aldrich","Craig, this is Dave. Well, we think there'll be traditional seasonal strength. However, in our space, we're starting to see more and more rather than a simple Q4 growth strength, that being split between the September and the December quarters as we shift into those builds. It's a bit too early to tell what March seasonality might look like a normal seasonality. We have no reason to believe it will be terribly different, but we're feeling good about, again, about those second half ramps.","Operator","Our next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Dave, you mentioned the word diversification many times. I was wondering if you could talk about diversification on 2 sides. Side one, how are you diversifying in your customer base outside of the Apples and Samsungs of the world? And then secondly, diversification in terms of sockets. Is there a way to get -- to size what your addressable content was last year versus what it is now?","David J. Aldrich","Okay, good questions, Vivek. First, with respect to sockets, one of the things, you probably seen some reason Teardown report, so I think that's probably the best testament to what we've been able to accomplish. We -- you may think of us as a traditional kind of a PA supplier -- PA switch supplier, but in the more recent designs, we've been getting increasingly attach rate -- high attach rates with our GPS LNA products, with our Antenna Switch Modules, with some power management devices, camera flash devices and our wireless LAN portfolio. And so we're seeing as much as more than $2 of incremental content per smartphone and tablet, and we're pretty excited about that. So we are leveraging not only recent acquisitions, but some organic development to continue to look to bolt on to what's been our traditional product offering more and more content. It helps our customers in the process, terrific for us.  We're also diversifying into new adjacent markets, and I think we've talked about that fairly extensively. But medical, for example, we talked about medical devices being designed in on the call. We're in infrastructure. We're in various home automation markets that are extremely exciting and growing. And I think from a customer standpoint, there isn't a customer in the cellular smartphone space that isn't a customer of Skyworks. So we're designed into every baseband suppliers, to offering as a reference design partner, and we're also designed into virtually every OEM.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And one follow up on operating expenses and operating margins. What is the progress in integrating your acquisitions? When can we expect to see operating margins get back to your traditional levels of 26%, 27%?","Liam K. Griffin","Sure, this is Liam. Well with respect to the acquisitions, we are making great progress through the integration synergies, improvements in margin and also customer traction. So we're doing the right things there as outlined in the past, and I think we'll see continued performance going forward.","Donald W. Palette","And, Vivek, to follow-up on how that affects the overall Skyworks model, the new product lines are on track. They're still scaling up though, so it has had a little bit of a muting impact on the operating model and the returns. But as you could see, our margins in Q3 was 23.6%. The guidance implies 25%, so we're still very focused on the 30% target. And as we continue to gain share and grow the top line, we're going to be on our way towards that number again. So some of it is the impact of getting the acquisitions up to scale, and that's the top line growth.","Operator",".","We will go next to Alex Gauna with JMP Securities.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you could give a -- could you give us an idea of how far we are, in your opinion, into the LTE upgrade cycle right now? And if you could maybe give us an idea of how you feel positioned in LTE for the second half and maybe what percentage of it is contributing to the mix.","Liam K. Griffin","Sure, Alex. This is Liam. Well, I think overall in the industry, we're very early innings with respect to LTE. We have a very powerful LTE platform in a number of different devices including multimode devices that address the LTE standard. We do see, however, the design win traction going forward and our ability to gain share in LTE to be very bullish. And if you look at the platforms that we've addressed over the last 6 months and platforms that we're going to be addressing now, we're very confident that LTE is going to play a major role in 2013 for us.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","As a follow-up, I was wondering and you might not have all the details because their call is going on concurrently, but Qualcomm guided units down fairly significantly sequentially for the September quarter. How was your exposure there? And how does that fit in with your guidance for the September -- September quarter?","David J. Aldrich","Sure, Alex. Well, our attach rate with Qualcomm is quite high, and so we see the same or similar dynamics obviously that they would in those segments of the market. If you look at our guidance, what's really driving it are very specific programs that are ramping into production, as well as some of these devices that are continuing to ramp. They're relatively early in that ramp. So there really may -- there are some very specific Skyworks reasons why we may be bucking some of the normal market trends as we go into the second half.","Operator",".","We'll go next to Parag Agarwal with UBS.","Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","This is Steven Chin calling on behalf of Parag. Just a throw down on that previous question regarding some of the exposure that you have in platforms where Qualcomm is as well. Can you discuss in terms of your component content introduced that you may be seeing, any kind of rough numbers you can speak to in terms of rough percentage of the bandwidth you have out there where you're seeing content grow? Or is it a mix shift to higher LTE content perhaps that's helping you to see your revenues grow in the -- grow sequentially as opposed to some of the unit-related headwinds that Qualcomm may be seeing?","David J. Aldrich","Well, I think it's difficult to be -- it's hard for me right now to be terribly precise. I will say that the -- if you look at those Teardown reports, we are seeing, for example, the Samsung Galaxy Teardown reports that recently came out. I don't have the [indiscernible] 6 parts of Skyworks, 7 parts. So it had a pretty broad suite of Skyworks products. So what was -- the dynamic, it kind of goes like this. Smartphones continue to displace 2G devices. So we see that little bit of a wind at our back as we always get more dollar content for the traditional products in smartphones and tablets than we did in 2G. Our attach rate continues to improve starting with our top customers where we start to put more of those new products bolted around the existing products. That's growing.  And then we have been gaining quite a bit of leverage and traction from things like home automation, where we're putting our Wi-Fi devices in gaming consoles, or we're putting them in various applications and appliances around the home. So that's an example where those markets really were nascent a couple of years ago. They continue to grow, and I think they're really beginning to explode in the early innings, frankly.","Liam K. Griffin","Right. And if you look at the smartphone, as Dave articulated, you've got the core RF TAM increasing by virtue of multiple bands. But now that'd there be more explicit. We have wireless LAN devices both 2-, 4- and 5-gig. We have powered management, backlighting, DC-DC converters. We have Antenna Switch Modules. We have GPS. The last set of products I mentioned were really not in play for us over the last 2 years. They're new products. Some of those were organic, some came by virtue of deals, but they're absolute drivers now going forward.","Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And just a -- follow-up question is on some of the new products that you highlighted in the prepared remarks, products such as the Antenna Switch Modules, the GPS LNA and also the SkyOne products. Can you give us a little color on the sort of design time for those new products? Like is it comparable to your existing RF components? Or is it a longer or shorter lead time? And what's the sort of revenue ramp that you'd expect from the different product lines later this year or going to 2013?","Donald W. Palette","The SkyOne product is new. It's been in development for a couple of years, but the product has sampled, the feedback has been good and we expect lead customer production sometime later in this year. So there's no revenue contribution right now from the SkyOne products, but I will tell you there's a lot of development activity, and this truly is an unprecedented level of integration. And I don't know if you really listened to the comments when we described it or looked at the press release. It has all the analog and RF functionality between the chipset, the radio, the RF, the antenna and back, filters, amplifier, switches, all of the shielding. So I this is a product that for those customers who really want to have a world phone but looking for ease-of-integration, size, it has great current consumption, we think that's going to be a real winner for us, but it's brand new.","David J. Aldrich","Right. With respect to GPS and the ASM product, I mean, GPS location-based systems and services, you see now in every smartphone, every tablet, even in netbooks and notebooks. So we developed a cutting-edge product internally organically that we believe meets all the needs of leading tier ones. We're fortunate to have a suite of new design wins, and that's looking very good. And again, it's new business for us. The Antenna Switch Module really is built off of our core strength and RF switch. We have great in-house technology in pHEMT. We have SOI capability and then also some filtering capabilities in packages to bring that to bear to the market. So both of those of those products are a combination of organic work and then understanding what our customers need.","Operator","We have a question from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Dave, can you talk about your underlying assumption for market growth in September? It looks like -- I mean, 7% sequential growth into September is well below your historical averages. So I'm just trying to understand how bad of a scenario are you modeling from a market standpoint.","David J. Aldrich","Well, there are a couple of things that I think is going on right now. We do see seasonal strength. We do see customers gearing up for that year-end push with products and, again, in the August, September, October timeframe. I do believe that there's been a bit of a mix shift away from the smartphone sales because there are different phone launches that kind of impact that and create some choppiness to the markets. So I would say in general, the September quarter is been a bit muted. We expect December to be strong. But I would say that, that's probably the biggest impact is simply some -- looking at the big -- looking at program launches and how that kind of changes that dynamic a bit, and it makes it hard to handicap normal seasonality.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And Dave -- Don, I'm sorry, maybe can you talk about the customer concentration? I know you don't give the exact specific percentages of your largest 10% customers, but can you tell us in aggregate your top 3 customers account for what percent of your revenue this quarter and what was it last?","Donald W. Palette","Ittai, I will give you the top 10% customers this quarter. It was Foxconn and Samsung. Nokia dropped out of the top 10%, but they're still high-single digits, but we don't disclose anything besides that on a quarterly basis, so we don't aggregate that, give you a specific number.","Operator","We will go next to Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity.","Matt Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","This is actually Matt Ramsay on for Mike. A couple of questions for me. I guess the first one is have you disclosed, or will you, the 2G to 3G to 4G mix of your wireless business in the quarter?","Donald W. Palette","Sure, Matt. It was roughly the same as it was last quarter, 20% 2G and 80% EDGE and WCDMA.","Matt Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And I guess as a follow-up, no one really brought it up yet, Don, but I wanted to dig into this $5 million -- $5.4 million credit that you guys got on the pro forma SG&A line around contingent liabilities for acquisitions. Maybe you could dig into a little bit more what that was around. And I guess maybe discuss what your pro forma numbers and results would've looked like absent that and discuss where it would have been relative to your guidance.","Donald W. Palette","As far as the $5 million, that $5 million relates to some M&A activity where we consummated some deals with earn-out potential for the people who own the company that we purchased. And that's just shoring up what that liability is going to be for us based on a 12-month period after the acquisition. So that's all it is. And as far as what the numbers would be, you just basically back that out of the numbers. I mean, it's a one-time adjustment.  It's related to  -- it was an earn-out related M&A activity. That's all it is. And just so you understand, you have to make an estimate upfront, and then you just shore it up at the end of the period. That's all.","Matt Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay, great. I think I understand the mechanics of it. But I mean, does it then imply that the numbers would've been a bit lighter on the earnings line than where maybe your guidance was before?","Donald W. Palette","No, absolutely not.","Operator","And we'll go next to Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just maybe a little clarity on the guidance. If you could talk -- clearly doing better than the market. Talk about what the drivers there are. And then I think, Don, you mentioned that the linear and the RF business was roughly the same contributor in Q2. Do you expect that to continue into September?","David J. Aldrich","Yes, Blayne, I would say that the primary driver, our specific programs where we're beginning to ramp production and shipment of those sockets that are second half drivers for us. So that's it. Plus some of the organic and acquired product lines where the attach rate to our traditional OEM customers is getting higher. So as we're launching programs, we're launching them with more dollar content, not just LTE and traditional expansion of PA bands, but also the analog functionality that bolts around it in the system. So I would say that's probably the second largest driver. And I don't expect -- Don, maybe you could comment on this, but I don't expect the September to see any meaningful split -- difference in the split between our high-performance analog business and our mobile business.","Donald W. Palette","No, that's exactly where the forecast was. We don't expect any major change in that percentage.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then maybe just talk about the consolidations of some of these RF blocks. You highlighted SkyOne. You're also shipping a lot more multiband chips. You highlighted the GALAXY S III. Maybe address kind of where you see particularly the SkyOne fitting in the market. I mean, you say it will address all the bands. Is this kind of low end or across all spectrums of phones? And then would tier ones be using this? Or -- and then maybe just talk about how that places you versus the competitors? I mean, clearly, you're the only guys who introduced something now, but how do you see the competitive field?","David J. Aldrich","It's a big question. I would say that whether or not this hits the high end of the market really depends because when you -- the level of integration, to be clear, is we're taking all the bands -- all the popular bands -- of transmitting amplification, we're integrating the amplifiers with the switches using various process techniques. We're adding the duplexers as well as other filters. So it's fully shielded, so it truly is the, by far, by far the most highly integrated device in the world today. Now whether or not -- now inherent in that level of integration is a certain degree of inflexibility. The device is very small, but it is highly integrated. We've developed it as a platform strategy to allow us to reconfigure bands over time and to be able to address OEM customers as they look to either be perhaps more regionally based or add bands that others don't want to add. So we've anticipated that. That will determine in large part whether or not it's broadly applicable among the tier ones. There are different approaches with each different baseband partner, different approaches with the OEM, which will determine how broadly applicable it is. But there is a segment of the market, low end for sure, but I think maybe even some high-end sockets, where this is going to be an opportunity for a customer to get in the market quickly with a product that's fully shielded, where they can drop it in and run.  With respect to the competitive landscape, the problem for many of our competitors is that either they lack the system expertise because there's a lot of system integration thought that goes into how you architect a device like this. So it's difficult for component players. It's also difficult, if not impossible, if you're, for example, a filter company or a switch company or a PA company to be able to deal with this level of integration. So we think that, that kind of rules out some of the point product folks. And finally, the level of manufacturing and packaging integration is really unprecedented for this device. Remember, we are vertically integrated in packaging. That helps us both in the design time-to-market and the cost side. So the ability for us to make high margins on this product is really, we think, somewhat unique to Skyworks. You wouldn't want to source all these components and try to compete with us. So we think the competitive landscape is quite narrow.","Operator","We now have a question from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","A couple of questions. You are a little bit weaker seasonally than we would've expected, which suggests maybe some more upside or shift towards the December period. Dave, how do you see that content would again be -- 35% linear? Or do you expect given some of your new acquisitions and maybe some new slots and the tablets or smartphones to favor more of the linear product once the ramps start picking up?","David J. Aldrich","I think December -- my expectation is the December quarter will be a strong quarter for smartphones, a seasonally strong quarter for smartphones. And within those -- within smartphones, we expect to not only see our traditional PA products, but some, as you mentioned, some of these other products. So there will be a lift to both our traditional PA business, as well as to some of these high performance analog products that are bolted around those PAs. So I still see that split being reasonably constant. Now it's quite -- it is possible you might see a slight shift towards the mobile devices just given there's more seasonality there, but I don't think it will move the dial much beyond that ratio.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","I mean, if we look at both sides in your ATI and we -- as separate for mobile products, and if we believe -- I mean you purchased them for a reason, and part of that would be the traction you can bring to bear with those companies into the smartphone world, one would almost expect to see kind of a shift, I won't say away, but a higher mix of those products than you've seen in the past, given you've acquired these guys since the first holiday season and you're truly running with them full bore. That doesn't sound like that's going to be the case though?","David J. Aldrich","Well, you will see a higher -- certainly higher revenue for those products. I don't know that it's necessary a higher mix, see higher revenue in the traditional products. Don mentioned that we're 65-35. Not that long ago, we were 75-25 and prior...","Liam K. Griffin","And 80-20.","Donald W. Palette","Yes, not that long ago.","David J. Aldrich","So I think that's a relatively new phenomena that we're...","Donald W. Palette","So you're seeing some of that percentages already. I mean, that's the way to think about it.","Liam K. Griffin","Right. Exactly. And the other thing in here is that we are really expanding the design win footprint with those products. So I think you should expect as we go through 2013 to see more evidence of success with both the WLAN portfolio and power management. One of the things we do is certainly cross-sell inside of smartphones, but there's a lot of new markets that were entering by virtue of those products. We're getting into cloud-based sharing, we're getting into infrastructure spaces where we can put in DC-DC converters, and there's going to be collaborative plays where we use power management within our front-end modules to try to create differentiated architectures. So as we move forward, I think we'll continue to hear growth in both sides, but hopefully in some different applications.","Operator","Your next question is from Anthony Stoss with Craig Hallum.","Anthony J. Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Dave, can you -- are you comfortable with your production capabilities or capacity, both internally and externally later on this year and entering 2013? And also let me hear your thoughts on AC, when do you think it's really going to have a role to play in the handset marketplace.","David J. Aldrich","Well, I am comfortable with the capacity. And if you look at this quarter as an example, we spent, I think, just over $30 million against depreciation of $17 million, and that's all addressing any bottleneck that we may see for the second half ramp. So I do feel good about that. We made investments over the last 3 years, 2.5 years for sure, and the big-ticket items like bringing up more HBT capacity, going from 4 to 6 inches and so on. So there are no bricks and mortar requirements. So I feel quite good about not only our internal capacity, but what we've been able to do with our supplier partners to keep that hybrid model so we're able to offload some of that capacity to take some of the volatility out of the seasonality of the volatility. So I feel good about the supply side.","Liam K. Griffin","Right. And with respect to 11ac, I mean, we are right now building product, supporting routers and supporting kind of the first leg in the infrastructure for 802.11ac. Following that today, the handset applications, the smartphones that we're looking at, right now a high percentage of those are looking at 11ac attached. So starts with the routers, we're well positioned there. We have a great deal of content. As you know, it's multiple in, multiple out. You can have up to 8 streams in our router. We typically see 4 to 5, tremendous content. And then following that, we are starting to see leading OEMs now embed 11ac into their handsets.","Anthony J. Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. If I can sneak in one more quick question. Is there a -- can you just comment on the pricing environment if there's any considerable changes from last quarter?","Donald W. Palette","Anthony, this is Don. Nothing from last quarter. I mean, just a reminder, we're-- overall, our current erosion's within historical range. The only place that you might see -- we're seeing some slight change, that's the open 2G segment that's maybe increased slightly from what we'd experienced in prior years. But that's continues to be the only segment where pricing you have a chance to win business on price only. And the majority of our customers are making those decisions based on performance. And with us having the lowest cost structure in the industry, that allows us to continue to deliver strong margins. So we're really not seeing anything different than that, and we've articulated that the past several quarters.","Operator","We'll go next to Suji De Silva with ThinkEquity.","Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","So visibility, what kind of turns do you need for the quarter?","David J. Aldrich","I'm sorry, Suji, could you...","Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","How well booked are you to the guidance for the September quarter?","David J. Aldrich","Typical for us. We've got between hub pulls and actual POs in hand, we're pretty much 100% booked, which is not unusual for us.","Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then for the China low-end smartphone market, I'm imagining that's a more competitive market from a price perspective. How do you expect to compete there? And do you consider that a significant opportunity for yourself?","David J. Aldrich","We do consider it a significant opportunity because we think that there is a great deal of pent-up demand. We think it's not only for the traditional chipset-enabled smaller local players, the indigenous OEMs. We also think that's an opportunity for the major international brands to really address that market using brand recognition and great products. So we think it's going to be a terrific market for us. There will be price pressure on those devices for sure, but we really compare it to what it's really -- what that customer will be upgrading from, which is a 2G device with less -- much less than $1.00 content. So it won't be the -- perhaps some of them won't be high-end world phones, but they will certainly have a great deal more content than a 2G product sold into that market. So we're -- and we're positioned with it with a number of products. We've got multi-converged devices or multimode devices that are low cost that will be tailored for that market. We have hybrid and high-performance devices as well. We've got a whole bunch of content that we're bolting around it in a way that we hope will facilitate ease of entry to market for some of these customers as well as increasing our dollar content. So I'm excited about the market, aware of the price pressures, but I think we're prepared to have a real strong play there.","Operator","We have a question from Aalok Shah with D.A. Davidson.","Aalok K. Shah - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. Liam, just if I could, and I know Dave kind of addressed this a little bit, but I'm just -- I just want to make clear, you guys are winning PA market share now because of the additional solutions that you offer? Or is it the other way around that your PAs are simply better and you're just kind of bringing along all these other things like LNA drivers and LNA switches and other things like that at this point?","Liam K. Griffin","Sure. Well, I mean, I would say that the relationships that we've built over the duration of Skyworks since we started our company, the deep relationships with OEMs and also chipset providers, has put us in great position to win with power amplifiers and we've been doing that for a while. And then one inside the account collaboratively sell power management, WLAN, GPS, whatever is needed. So I think the leadership that we provided over the years in our power amplifier suite has really kind of paved the way for success in these other products. And we're doing a great job of satisfying customer needs and leveraging technologies in-house and through acquisition.","David J. Aldrich","The products have to be competitive. But it's clear that the credibility -- for example, when we acquired a couple of businesses, I think their biggest stumbling block was just having the credibility to sell into these huge companies and satisfy these big ramps. And our balance sheet is quite strong, our customers increasingly look for a profitable supplier partner with a good balance sheet, who can weather the storm. So we think that the viability that we have is critically important. So it's easy for us to get a product evaluated, but it has to be competitive.","Aalok K. Shah - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Then can you guys give us an update on where you are now with the BAW filters?","David J. Aldrich","Sorry, where we are with BAW -- we don't make BAW filters. We source them, and we are in high-volume production in multiple sockets with PA, SAW and BAW devices, mostly SAW, frankly, because that's where the market demand is the highest and where the price is the lowest, or the price is most competitive, I should say. But we are in production with PA duplexers and multiple sockets in high-volume production, have been for sometime, and we're winning some sockets there as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dale Pfau with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Dale Pfau - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Let's talk just a little bit more about the emerging markets and the trend from 2G to 3G. Could you talk about how that's affecting your share out there, what you're seeing the trends are? And then the other question I've got is what do you think your total attach rate and percentage of business is from laptop, I mean, tablets and notebooks are right now?","David J. Aldrich","We think the 2G market continues to not only decline in dollars but decline in units. So the market is becoming -- the 2G market is becoming a smaller percentage. And in fact, our 2G into the local China market, if you will or the open market, is probably in the order of magnitude of mid-single-digit percentage of revenue, so it's pretty small, Dale. Now we do sell more 2G products in that because we have big business with other customers who sell into that market or sell elsewhere. But -- so we're pretty convinced that the 2G market is going to remain in fairly steady decline. It won't go away, but in fairly steady decline.","Liam K. Griffin","Right. And with respect to tablets, Dale, I think we -- we're in very good position there. We have market share in tablets that's at least as good as what we have in smartphones on the RF amplifier side. But tablets is a great opportunity to leverage the highest performance wireless LAN mobile connectivity product. We're doing very well there. We're also bringing in switch and some of the other technologies that we mentioned. So we're very upbeat about the general market outlook for tablets. We think they're going to be rapidly adopted. We have high expectations going forward, and we expect to be a share leader.","Operator","And next, we have Jonathan Goldberg with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Goldberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just wanted to talk a little bit about -- I guess all that's left is the 2G feature phone market in China. That used to be a pretty big opportunity for you guys. It seems like you're still there, you're still active there. Is that true? Is that -- or should we just stop worrying about that market entirely?","David J. Aldrich","We're very active there. We've got a reasonably high market share, and it's been a good market for us, right. It's been kind of a workhorse market. It's been around for a long time. It is declining. It is -- if you think about that, the way we look at that market is a couple of different ways. We do have -- believe we have the lowest cost structure. We address it with a combination of pure CMOS devices as well as very low-cost gallium arsenide devices, and we're sold with partners like MediaTek, for example. The issue with the market is it is declining. The consumers in those markets want smartphones or they want high-end feature phones, and that's just where it's headed. And we like that transition because, frankly, there are more margin dollars there, there are more dollars per phone, so we think that's going to be a growth driver. But we don't shy away from the 2G market. We expect there to be the most price pressure there because frankly, for companies who -- competitors who have been unable to kind of make the leap to multimode designs and now even more integrated devices we're talking about today, that's sort of one of the last frontiers to go at it, and you go at it with price as the primary weapon. So we do see ASP pressure there. But we make money there, and we're going to continue to ride it.","Liam K. Griffin","Yes, and alongside that, as we start to see the 2G market in China trade down, and as you know, that was a market that was less than $1.00 per SKU for us in terms of content, you're seeing local players like ZTE and Huawei really deliver low-end smartphones, in some cases high-end smartphones. We're seeing data cards where you have a couple of bands of WCDMA with GSM. So there's an active market there. And as Dave indicated, there's an appetite for global brands. And I think we're well positioned with some of the premier smartphones globally, and those products will eventually be big drivers in China.","Operator","Your next question is from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Dave, I wanted to follow-up on the SkyOne product. You talked about sort of data more mainstream smartphone product. But wondering if you could talk from the baseband supplier perspective. Was this developed in conjunction with, a, your multiple baseband partners? Or do you anticipate this as really more a sale to sort of leading tier one or high-volume OEMs? And then I've got a quick follow-up on LTE.","David J. Aldrich","Well, Quinn, I would say it was really to address a worldwide OEM market demand for ease of integration as the complexity increases. It really is a challenge with all those filters and all those PAs and switches and shielding it and coexistence or interference between, for example, Wi-Fi and 2-plus gigahertz cellular bands, so it's a real problem. And the more bands you layer in, the size constraint becomes an issue as well as just shielding it and handling all that RF complexity. So we really addressed it to try to figure out a way to make life easier for our customers. It won't be for all, and it wasn't geared towards any specific baseband. It was really more of a world product. It can be baseband independent. The interface was designed that way, so we weren't approaching it with any one specific platform in mind, although we have leading customers who have been sampled and who will be first to production with it.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then just quickly on LTE. You talked about LTE becoming obviously important in 2013. I think there's something like 10 to 14 different bands being used for LTE around the world. Any sort of sense you can give us as to how many bands on average you think you'll see in phones in 2013? I mean, it gets hard to imagine you're going to see full 10- to 14-band LTE phones plus 2G and 3G backward compatibility. So just trying to wonder, do you think it's on average 3 to 4, 4 to 6? Any thoughts you have on kind of the 2013 LTE devices?","David J. Aldrich","Yes, I think it depends on the architecture. Some of the higher-end smartphones really will have, I mean, 8 devices or more. There are multiple bands of LTE. There's multiple bands of WCDMA. And then you have backward compatibility. So we have seen a trend at least today to drive as many bands the carriers will support, and we see those smartphones being designed today going into production next year.","Donald W. Palette","And we're using 2 approaches. One is were looking to continue to integrate at the die level these multimode designs and sweep in more bands and where performance demands it, we're having other -- using other manufacturing and packaging techniques to make it small and relatively low-cost. So that's where the kind of the system expertise of being able to play the ability to integrate upward within IC as well as in the package as well as in the MCM is an advantage for us. And that's where the customers are struggling as they -- LTE was in many ways the straw that broke the camel's back. Layering in those bands sort of made it impossible to go through a traditional discrete model.","Operator","We now have a question from Blaine Carroll with Avian Securities.","Blaine R. Carroll - Avian Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess a couple of questions if I can. First of all, Dave, you talked about the 2G dollar being down, units being down. Don, did you give out the split of what the 2G versus 3G revenue was during the quarter?","Donald W. Palette","Yes, I did. It was roughly the same as last quarter. It was 20% 2G and 80% EDGE and WCDMA.","David J. Aldrich","But even within that -- even within that 2G, most of that is foreign brands sold into the China -- the open market 2G is somewhere below 10%.","Donald W. Palette","Yes.","Blaine R. Carroll - Avian Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, Liam, when you think of those, the LTE bands are the popular right now, I'm assuming that it's 13, 17, maybe some activity up around 26 and 4, are there any other bands that we -- that are sort of bubbling up as far as LTE and LTE capabilities?","Liam K. Griffin","Well, there are a few that will go out further into 2014. But I think if you look at those 4 and then you go and look at typical WCDMA Band I, Band II, Band V, Band VIII. Okay, now you've got 8 bands and you add your GSM or your EDGE. So there you go. That's how you get your 8 or 9, and that is the type of architecture that we're seeing today. We're seeing that type of layout.","Operator","We have a question now from Tom Sepenzis with Northland Securities.","Thomas A. Sepenzis - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","I'm just wondering if you could give us any kind of insight into the geographical strength or weaknesses that you're seeing.","David J. Aldrich","Yes, I mean, it's actually tough because we don't really look at the business that way. I mean we have our key customers, and we do see regionally within the HPA space pretty good traction in the Americas and also in APAC.  The smartphones players are real global brands, and we look at our sales directly to those accounts and we really have to kind of follow the money where they sell.","Thomas A. Sepenzis - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay, great. And in terms of the new markets like medical that you're targeting, are any of these -- I take it none of these are 10% of the business at this point, but are you targeting any of them to be in the next say 12 to 24 months?","David J. Aldrich","Tom, right now, no. The answer is that they're not 10%, but we have our eye on growing a lot of the key vertical markets that we're just seeing some traction in because they're accretive to the margin, the overall return of the business. So our goal will be to continue to grow those to a more meaningful revenue number for the company.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's question-and-answer session.

Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Steve. And welcome, everyone. I'm pleased to report that we delivered a strong close to fiscal 2015 producing fourth quarter financial results that once again significantly outpaced the growth of the broader semiconductor market. During the quarter, we posted revenue of $881 million. That's representing 23% growth from the prior year. We delivered operating income of $335 million. That's up 42% versus last year. We earned $1.52 in diluted earnings per share, which is up 36% year-over-year. We generated over $230 million in cash from operations, and we are guiding for December quarter revenue to be up again sequentially with gross margins of 51% and EPS of $1.60.","Given that Q1 guidance exceeds our previous 50% gross margin target, we're introducing an updated mid-term model, which Don will provide the details of later in the call.","Our fourth quarter performance closed another record year for our company. And for the full year, we posted revenue of $3.26 billion. This represents a 42% annual growth. We expanded our operating margins by 600 basis points, exiting Q4 at over 38%. And we grew earnings per share by 63%, continuing to demonstrate strong financial leverage. And we also generated roughly $1 billion in cash flow from operations, and we returned over $360 million to shareholders through a combination of dividend payments and share repurchases, while increasing investments in R&D, expanding production capability, and extending our technology roadmap.","All in all, this was an outstanding year for Skyworks. And we continue to see numerous opportunities to capitalize on the powerful technology trends that are fueling the long-term growth in our served markets. These include exploding data consumption across the consumer and enterprise landscape; these include soaring adoption of cloud services from the likes of Amazon, Google and others; the proliferation of connectivity throughout the emerging markets; and the rise of the Internet of Things. These global trends are all in the early innings and all rely on seamless connectivity to efficiently and reliably move massive amounts of data anytime and anywhere.","The end result is a boom in connected devices and worldwide data consumption fueling tremendous opportunity, but also creating major technical hurdles within the industry. By virtually every measure, consumer appetite for streaming services is growing dramatically, as traditional broadcasters and new content service providers, like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu, race to gain a foothold in the new online world of content distribution.","In fact, analysts estimate that mobile data usage will increase at nearly 60% compounded through 2019. This places significant strains on network infrastructure and on devices. As an example, consider that an hour of streaming high-definition video consumes roughly one to two gigabytes of network bandwidth, 4K streaming devices consume two times to three times this amount. And further exacerbating the industry's challenges is the limited amount of spectrum and network capability available to address this pending surge in data.","Market forecasts estimate that only around one-third of the spectrum needed to meet bandwidth requirements over the next few years is in service today. And to solve this imbalance, carriers are either deploying new spectrum or finding ways to increase the throughput of existing frequency bands. Finally, this rising data trend directly impacts the battery life of today's devices, as technologies like LTE Advanced, eventually 5G demand, and they demand higher and higher power levels. This comes at a time when our customers are already wrestling with power budgets to implement more capable processors, higher definition screens and other power consuming features.","As customers struggle to adapt to these market realities, we are increasingly being brought into the architectural discussions much earlier in the design cycle. This is the primary reason we are shaping next-generation solutions to implement higher band counts and the use of unlicensed bands, increasing carrier aggregation combinations, tighter and tighter filtering requirements, more complex receive architectures, advanced Wi-Fi configurations and more sophisticated techniques to manage power and increase efficiency.","As customers implement this next level of functionality, they are increasingly demanding more system-level solutions and higher levels of integration and these are playing directly into Skyworks' strengths. We see all of these dynamics increasing our addressable content across the breadth of our service markets for years to come. As I mentioned earlier, this backdrop provides us with a high confidence level in our business trajectory and we're introducing a new mid-term earnings model, which Don will discuss in more detail following his review of our financial results.","With that, I'll turn it over to Don.","Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Dave. And thanks for joining us, everyone. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $880.8 million, ahead of our prior guidance of $875 million and up 23% versus the year ago quarter. Gross profit was $440.1 million or 50% of revenue and that's a 100 basis point sequential increase from the June quarter and a 400 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expenses were $104.9 million, consisting of R&D expense of $70.8 million and SG&A expense of $34.1 million. We generated $335.2 million of operating income, up 42% year-over-year, yielding a 38.1% operating margin.","Below the line, we had expenses of roughly $1.1 million from interest and other expense. Our cash tax rate for the quarter was 11.4%. That's in line with our guidance and resulting in net income of $296.1 million or $1.52 of diluted earnings per share, up 36% year-over-year and $0.01 better than our guidance.","Turning to our fourth quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement, we generated $233 million in cash flow from operations, invested $151 million in capital expenditures with depreciation of $46 million and we exited the quarter with over $1 billion in cash on hand and no debt.","Moving to our product mix for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Power amplifiers represented 20% of revenue, integrated mobile systems was 59% and broad markets was 22%. It is worth noting that integrated mobile systems were up 84% year-over-year during the quarter. In Q4, we distributed $160 million to shareholders through our dividend and stock repurchase plans. Our quarterly dividend and ongoing share repurchase activity remain important components of our commitment to return excess free cash flow to shareholders while continuing to fund internal growth initiatives and seek out accretive M&A targets.","For fiscal 2015, we returned approximately 64% of free cash flow to shareholders, higher than our goal of 40% based on our recent share repurchase activity. Longer term, we continue to view an allocation of roughly 40% of free cash flow as an appropriate balance between internal investment for growth initiatives and shareholder returns.","Turning to our first quarter fiscal 2016 business outlook, we expect revenue to be between $925 million and $930 million, up 5.3% sequentially and 15% year-over-year. At the midpoint of the range, we anticipate gross margin to be 51%, representing a 430-basis-point year-over-year improvement. We expect our operating expenses to be around $108 million, driven by ongoing investments in engineering and development teams as we expand our footprint within new verticals and further enhance our integration capabilities. We expect first quarter operating margins to exceed 39%.","Below the line, we anticipate around $900,000 in expenses from interest and other expense and a cash tax rate around 14.5%. For the remainder of fiscal 2016, we recommend modeling a cash tax rate in the 14.5% range. We expect Q1 share count to be around 195 million shares resulting in EPS of $1.60 at the midpoint of the revenue range.","Our Q1 gross margin guidance exceeds our previous target of 50%, and we are within striking distance of our previously outlined $7.00 EPS target. Given our confidence in our business trajectory, which is driven by visibility into future architectures and our internal gross margin initiatives, we are introducing a new organic midterm model. And that's driven by the following assumptions. First, we continue to see our served market opportunity growing at a mid-teens pace for the foreseeable future based on our ability to address more systems level functionality and expand our footprint.","Second, we are targeting continued gross margin expansion driven by the positive contribution from our latest generation products, which incorporate higher levels of integration and functionality with greater differentiation, the growth of integrated mobile systems in broad markets product areas as a percentage of our revenue, scale benefits associated with increased volume, continuing efficiency gains from our filter business, and our ongoing efforts to optimize cycle times, yields and supply chain efficiencies.","And third, we anticipate ongoing R&D investments in systems, engineering and field applications teams to extend our technology advantages and build out our footprint in adjacent vertical markets. The end result is that within a six-quarter to eight-quarter period, we are targeting organic annualized EPS of $8 at a revenue run rate of around $4.5 billion with gross margins in the 53% range. Longer term, based on our internal margin initiatives, we are driving the business towards gross margins in the 55% range on an organic basis.","So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave.","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Don. As we enter fiscal 2016, our deep customer engagements, visibility into future generation architectures, and internal margin enhancement initiatives provide us with a unique perspective on our future growth opportunities, providing a high confidence level in our organic business trajectory.","Before opening the calls to questions, I'd like to provide a brief update on the acquisition of PMC. On October 30, we announced that we have entered into an amended and restated merger agreement to acquire PMC for $11.60 in cash per share of PMC common stock which we intend to fund through a combination of cash on hand and fully committed debt financing. The agreement has been approved by both boards of directors and is expected to close some time in the first half of calendar 2016. It's worth noting that the acquisition of PMC is additive to the organic $8 midterm model that Don just described and a mid-50%s gross margin goal.","So in closing, we remain poised to continue outperforming the broader semiconductor market and extending our track record of above-market topline growth, enhanced financial returns and earnings leverage. We've created a unique business model tethered to the global wave of connectivity and combining consistent above-market topline growth with the financial returns of a best-in-class diversified analog company.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question will come from Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Go ahead, please.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much and congratulations on the new (14:12).","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. Mike? Hello? We lost you.","Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hello?","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We lost you.","Operator","Yeah, so I apologize. Mike, are you there now?","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Okay. Go ahead.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","I'm sorry, can you hear me now?","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yep.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Sorry about that. Just going to follow-up on the design win activity with marquee customers, you shared this new target which is great to see, the $8 target. One of your competitors today in their press release is talking about securing design activity with marquee smartphones. Is it just that these smartphones are more and more complex and there's more opportunities, or maybe could you just address kind of your comfort and visibility into these marquee customers and design win activity into next year.","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well I think in general, the visibility we have continues to improve because as we mentioned in our prepared comments, we're being invited into the design cycle much, much earlier because we have a bigger footprint, we have a bigger piece of the overall system, and the system requirements are increasingly dependent upon strong analog performance, which is our sweet spot. As a result of that, we are seeing fewer competitors; a definite consolidation of share as we address each customer. So in general, the content is increasing with Wi-Fi functionality, tuning functionality, power management, amplifiers, filters and the like, and we're seeing a narrower competitor base. And so that's why we continue to see \u2013 and teardown reports, for example, will bear this out \u2013 we continue to see increased content with each successive generation of design.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Thanks very much.","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Thanks. Our next question will come from Alex Gauna with JMP Securities. Go ahead please.","Alex D. Gauna - JMP Securities LLC","Afternoon, everybody, and congratulations as well.","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Alex.","Alex D. Gauna - JMP Securities LLC","I was wondering, Dave, and you're setting a mid-teens growth, does that assume an underlying market growth rate in smartphones consistent with what Qualcomm just outlined yesterday in the low-single digits? And is there room for variance around that? What are the puts and takes around the market doing better than or worse than an underlying low-single digits growth rate?","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think when we look at our addressable market, two things are driving it, Alex. One is that we do see \u2013 for example, in China, we're really focused on 4G. We're focused on smartphones and 4G. We've de-emphasized 3G to the extent that it's a standalone product. We don't do any 2G anymore. And so we tend to focus on segments of the market that are at the highest growth that really demand a level of system performance for which we get paid a premium. So we think the growth rate of smartphones and how we address smartphones is a little higher than that.","And clearly we get a multiplier because we are increasingly addressing on the analog side increasing band content, carrier aggregation, more high functionality Wi-Fi and MIMO and 2x2s, more power management and voltage functions, so we are broader than any of our competitors at the system level. So our content continues to grow, driven by complexity of the device and also we continue to add more blocks of functionality in the overall system.","Alex D. Gauna - JMP Securities LLC","But, Dave, that reminds me of an additional question for you. You've done a great job historically of focusing like you are now on 4G or the key customers. And in going after PMC-Sierra here, it's a company that's gotten caught looking at some legacy type of markets before. How far are you willing to take this bidding war you're in now? It's taken you decades to build up a $1 billion war chest. What's the urgency in going after this now?","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, as we stated in our earlier remarks, Alex, we do have a definitive agreement. We have our committed financing. We expect to close sometime in first half of 2016. And given that the transaction hasn't yet closed, that's about all we can say.","The only thing I will add is that, if you look at Skyworks, the sweet spot of what we're very good at, we've been leveraging high-speed data and the consumption in mobility. So it's a natural extension to mobility and connectivity for us to extend into access to the cloud. We think it's just another high-end growth driver that will be both accretive to margin, but also sustainable for a generation.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Cody Acree with Drexel. Go ahead, please.","Cody G. Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Thanks, guys, for taking my questions and congratulations.","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Cody.","Cody G. Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC","You guys went through the summer with a lot of concerns about excess handset inventories. I'd just like to get your view on where the health of inventory is as we head into the holidays.","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Cody. Yeah, we actually see inventory levels right now kind of at normal run rate. We have great visibility into our tier-1 accounts. We have visibility into China and other markets and nothing really unusual there. You're right, there was a little bit of a softness at some point earlier in the year, but we feel good about the position today.","Cody G. Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC","And, Dave, just maybe on a strategic question, with your position in filters and the growth in capacity that you've made, what is your long-term strategic objective in filters? Is it a market that you can address with what you have or do you need to get up into the BAW filter territory to really address the opportunities in that market?","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, that's a great question. If you think about the way we're approaching filter technology, it's very much the way we approach semiconductor technology where we try to be as process agnostic as we possibly can and look for the best process for the function. And we've done that very successfully in Wi-Fi and transmit path and power management and so on.","In the case of filters it's really no different. We don't sell discrete filters. All of our filters are integrated into a higher level system where we're able to leverage our MCM capability, our amplifiers, our switches, our filters to come out with the best overall data handling capability at the lowest current consumption. And we'll continue to do that here. We find that TC SAW has been a wonderful addition in technology for us. We are also extending the advantages of temperature compensated surface acoustic devices to do higher and higher frequency, and frankly picking off bands that were previously only addressable by BAW.","And with respect to bulk acoustic technology, we do see that there are bands that we're going to need and so between partnerships and our own internal development, we expect to be in production with BAW devices by 2017.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Go ahead, please.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the results and strong outlook. The first question is for Dave. Dave, I think it was about 10 months ago or so that you identified that the performance of the business in the fiscal second quarter would behave better than it had historically because of the growth of the broad markets business. Is that still your view?","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You mean our fiscal second quarter? Is that what you're talking about, Craig?","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Yeah, the fiscal second quarter, the calendar March quarter.","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The answer is, yes, it is our view. March normal seasonality in the market is down perhaps 8% to 10%. Some customers will be down more. Other customers will likely do better. But despite that, we have a couple of tailwinds. One is that we are consistently adding content. And that quarter will be no different than prior quarters and the quarter we just completed. And broad markets for us is usually better than normal seasonality in March. So our expectation is that we will outpace that normal seasonality in March.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thank you. And then the follow-up is for Don. Don, very robust gross margin performance the last two quarters in the outlook. The incremental gross margins, I think, on average around 70% for those three quarters. So, given the strength of the new midterm model, are you suggesting that the business can stay on that trajectory? Or are there things happening in the business that would cause some deviation from the recent strength we've seen in the gross margin line?","Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. The way to, Craig, to model that going forward is we still have a high confidence when we take a look at what products we're shipping in the forecast that at a minimum you're going to see a 57%, as we've discussed before, kind of incremental drop-through. What's different as you're looking at our margin profile is that our new product releases in generations as they're shipping, they're tending to have higher margins. And that's based on the integration, based on functionality, based on value to customer. So, you can have some swings in that on the upside, not on the downside, on the upside, as you roll through that.","So, the best way to do that as we've just given you this 53% six quarters out basically in the new midterm model, so as you roll through the trajectory, I would just take a look at what that drop-through would mean during that period of time, and that's how to model it. That's the best way to do that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citigroup. Go ahead please.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on another strong quarter. Dave, a question on the gross margins. If I look at other component makers in smartphone market application processor, I mean, those guys are talking about ASP pressures next year, and you guys are planning to expand your gross margin. So help me understand why the pricing environment or the gross margin profile for RF guys should remain strong into next year in a decelerating year-over-year smartphone unit environment?","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's relatively simple. It isn't a year-over-year, part-to-part comparison. We are increasingly integrating more functionality as these devices get more complex, and we're seeing fewer competitors able to do it. Customers can't handle discrete components any longer, and that level of integration required to have a product that consumes low current, that's small, that is highly integrated requires many, many different functional blocks with process technology know-how pulled together in a low-cost manufacturing platform with great system architectures.","So, we are able to work with our customers to give them a differentiated system performance which is increasingly becoming analog and RF dependent; less digital and more analog and RF dependent, and that's our sweet spot. And so our customers it isn't as if that we're charging our customers more, per se, per function, it's that they're giving us more of the system requirement and they're paying us for it because we've generated we add a great deal of value for them.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. And as a follow-up, on your last call you guys talked about selling one 1 billion plus TC SAW filter units this fiscal year and 1.2 billion end of this calendar year. If you can update us on those numbers and what your expectations are for next year.","Liam K. Griffin - President","Sure, yes, we are actually well on the way to beat our estimate on TC SAW production. We will exit the calendar year over 1.2 billion in TC SAW devices. And as Dave articulated, all of those devices are being consumed internally by these highly complex system architectures. So we're wrapping up multiple bands, very, very high precision devices that allow our customers to put best-in-class solutions into their products. So it's a great opportunity. It's early innings. We continue to invest and fund and CapEx. We expect another very strong year in 2016 for our filter integrated solutions, and it's a great opportunity for us and our customers.","Operator","Thank you. We have a question from Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Go ahead, please.","Rick E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes, thanks. And I'll add my congratulations, guys.","Liam K. Griffin - President","Thanks, Rick.","Rick E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","My first question just was curious if you guys could provide some color or some early color on how you see the March quarter shaping up? Are there any factors at play we should be thinking about that would make it better or worse than what we've seen over the last couple of years?","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, I don't think so. Maybe Liam could chime in. Again, as I mentioned a moment ago, we think the markets down 8% to 10%, I think what you're maybe getting at is we do see the opportunity for OEM share shifts. We've factored that into our forecasts. We understand that. We have a great deal of experience with all of our large OEM customers. So we're able to sort of understand their buying and consumption patterns. So we think we handicapped that in a very conservative fashion. I don't think that's an issue for us. Our broad markets continue to add not only content, but add more new opportunities for us, which are growing sequentially each quarter, and we don't think March will be any different than that.","Liam K. Griffin - President","Yes, exactly. I think that's the real change is that the broad market portfolio continues to grow. It's highly diversified. We go from connected home to broad IoT devices, starting to even move it in markets like automotive. So there's a segment of our company now that really doesn't revolve around that typical seasonality in the March quarter. So we hopefully can do a great deal of work to offset the normal cycle.","Rick E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then just as my follow-up, maybe can you comment on the content trends with some of the China smartphone OEMs? I know Apple's success there is it having any sort of noticeable impact on the RF content complexity plans for sort of the second gen 4G phones from the big China OEMs? And if there's any way you can put numbers to that or give a sense of if you've got sort of in the $4 of content on average now, what that might look like in the next year or two?","Liam K. Griffin - President","Yes. No, that's a great question. And we certainly look at the China opportunity as a long-term secular trend for Skyworks. So we're going to do very well. We've been doing well. And as you've articulated, the 4G cycle is significantly meaningful. We do address that with the global Tier 1s. You named a few, as well as the local brands, and what we've been seeing is that the local providers; names like Huawei, names like Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo have now become much more comfortable with developing the higher-end solutions in 4G. It's a major content gain for us when you compare with the 3G devices where we may have $1 or $1.25 of opportunity. Now we move to $3 to $4.","And it's not just traditional transmit devices. It's receive side technology, there's Wi-Fi technology, there's power, there's GPS. So it's a powerful cycle. There's going be some share shifts in that market. Not everyone is going to win. The local brands are sorting it out. We see three or four companies emerging. The foreign brands, the global players will participate. But one of the things to note about Skyworks is we're highly diversified. We're diversified with the China brands, we're diversified with the global brands, and we'll do well in that market as it grows.","Operator","Thank you. We now have a question from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Vincent D. Celentano - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. This is Vince Celentano in for Steve. Going back to the broad markets, it looks like you guys grew around mid-teens this year. Given the growth in wearables and as you're saying the content growth in networking gear, do you think this mid-teens growth is kind of a sustainable growth rate for 2016? Or are you expecting more growth because of that? And in general, what are the main drivers you see determining what happens?","Liam K. Griffin - President","Yes. No, absolutely. So the broad market, it's getting quite exciting because it's really the sum of many, many different segments. We talked a lot about our Wi-Fi business and access point and connected home, and now you do have the emergence of markets like wearables. And what we're seeing in those markets is early stage it's been relatively light duty with respect to connectivity. They may incorporate Wi-Fi. We have ZigBee, we even have Bluetooth products that are participating through that space.","But we're starting to look further out in architectures with lead customers, and they're bringing in higher levels of complexity even in wearables and IoT devices. We're seeing LTE being embedded in solutions that will launch in the back half of 2016. So it's very early innings for mass adoption with consumers, but it's quite likely that the content trends that we've observed in smartphones could play out in IoT as well and in wearables.","Vincent D. Celentano - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks. And then just a quick line item question. Was there any particular reason for the jump in accounts receivable this quarter?","Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. Our DSO for the quarter was the same as Q2. Q3 and Q4 were around 43 days. It was just the timing of when the revenue shipped in the quarter. That's all it was. It's not a collection or velocity issue.","Operator","Okay, thank you. We have a question from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Go ahead please.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hi, guys. Congratulations on a great quarter and guide.","Liam K. Griffin - President","Thank you.","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Thanks. Couple of questions on the TC SAW side. Obviously it's doing 120%, 140% year-on-year it looks like. How much capacity are you adding in RF as we look into next year?","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we've added about a tripling of capacity with the new factory, Hitachi glass factory we acquired, we've been outfitting. That's why you saw a little bit of increase in the capital. So we're beginning to ship into that new factory and we'll see a good doubling of expansion.","Liam K. Griffin - President","Yeah, and further to that, think of this as a high performance filter site, all topology. So bulk acoustic wave opportunities, temperature compensated surface acoustic wave, standard surface acoustic wave. It is a first-class facility and we're funding it in the right way. We've got great people, qualified proven people. We're upping our game in design engineering. We've got a war chest of IP. So this is going to be a real driver, a competitive driver, for us.","Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, and just to clarify, the new facility is a leased facility. It wasn't a big CapEx investment for us. The equipment we're investing in, but the facility itself is just a lease.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Got it. And just briefly, I know it's been asked before, but as you look at 2016, your comfort at the content growth in the marquee phones? Thanks.","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's very high. We have really quite good visibility and it's really a function of two things. One is that the content in general is going up as more bands are brought to market, more carrier aggregation bands, more sophisticated Wi-Fi, more voltage and power challenges that need to be solved in the analog functionality. So we're able to do that. And we have increasingly been able to put more functional blocks on the table to try to sweep in more, whether it's in our module or at the IC level. So I feel very comfortable that this increasing content generation over generation will continue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity. Go ahead please.","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hello?","Operator","Mr. Snyder, your line is open. Okay. We will move on then to Mike Burton with Brean Capital. Please go ahead.","Mike A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the strong quarter, especially in this environment. First for Don, great execution on the margin front and a nice update there. Sorry I missed it, but did you say that we should be using a 57% contribution margin going forward? And then what are the puts and takes for OpEx as we go through the next fiscal year relative to normal seasonality and planned program ramps?","Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Mike, as far as the drop-through, if you were to look at going from the guide we just gave to December to the target revenue quarter of $1.125 billion and you looked at 51% to 53% and you just did the drop-through on that volume change, it's 62%. Why I'm saying use the 57% is because it's going be a little different than that in that it's based on the timing of shipments. So there may be some quarters it will be a little higher than that. I would just look at that timeframe and then you can smooth that out over that. But if you just did it on a straight-line basis, it would be 62%. There's going be some quarters it could be 57% and 70%. So that's why I'm answering the question I am. But it's all good news, obviously.","Mike A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC","Okay. And then on the OpEx side?","Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I would say to model that the way we've done it and when you look for six quarters out, we're adding about $3.5 million a quarter in OpEx.","Operator","Thank you. We have a question now from Harsh Kumar with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks, guys. This is Richard. Let me echo my congratulations as well.","Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Unknown Speaker","Wanted to talk about the broad markets. Clearly the IoT market is going crazy. Could you quantify kind of the CAGR you're seeing there? And then in terms of your automotive strategy, can you talk about your design wins there? And then when should we start to see the acceleration of revenues?","Liam K. Griffin - President","Sure. So within broad markets, this last year we grew about 20% year-over-year with all segments. The IoT elements and segments have been the fastest growers. So we have IoT growing faster than that 20% and then we have some markets, like infrastructure, that have been a little slower, but net-net you get the 20%. We think that's sustainable. We're adding new customers. There's a roster of names that we participated with this year. We talked about some of the marquee solutions with Google's OnHub and other devices.","Automotive, we're starting to get design wins in a couple of places. We started with some of the infotainment-like solutions with Wi-Fi and power management in-dash. More recently, we've seen customers adopt LTE-based roaming hot spots, if you will, and gobble up a great deal of 4G technology. Those solutions will be shipping later in 2016. It's still very early for us and automotive is still a new market for Skyworks. But, yeah, you should expect a lot more there from each of the segments, the traditional IoT, the connected home and then eventually more on the auto side.","Unknown Speaker","That's very helpful. Thank you for that color. And then in terms of the December quarter guidance, what are the puts and takes to get to your guidance level on revenues?","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Well, this is Dave. December is normally a strong quarter for us. It's a holiday seasonal ramp. We'll continue to grow within emerging market LTE upgrade cycle. We've got some nice content. We've got really good position with the SoC partners. I think we'll see another strong broad markets quarter, particularly in the connected home and in IoT. This will be offset a little bit maybe by some of the markets we address like industrial, as we see a little softness there. But net-net broad markets will be up in December. So we're guiding revenue up to be about 15% year-over-year, margins will expand, and as Don mentioned, strong earnings leverage.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thanks, guys. And congratulations.","Liam K. Griffin - President","Thanks.","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Go ahead please.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking my question. And I'll echo my congratulations. Very good results and guidance despite all the noise and headwinds in the markets. It's good to see that.","Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Vivek.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So maybe as my first one, Dave, I'm trying to understand if let's say for whatever reason growth shifts from your large marquee customer to, let's say, customers in China, how is Skyworks positioned? And is it fair to think that when I look at your absolute content, it may be roughly similar in both situations because at the large marquee customer you probably have less share and a higher bill of materials, whereas at the Chinese customers you may have higher share and a lower bill of materials? So is it possible there is that kind of balancing? So even if growth shifts from one class to the other, you can still continue to do well?","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think, yes, we can continue to do well. I think we continue to do very well because content is going up across our customer base. It's interesting that you commented on it's kind of winner-take-all with some of these indigenous providers or rather OEMs within China and our content is going up among those. So I think it really remains to be seen, but it has been the case that the leaders in the smartphone space have been driving technology that has been later adopted by others. So there's a little bit of a time delay, but I think your thesis is fine.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And as my follow-up, even after you complete the announced PMC acquisition, you'll still have a relatively strong balance sheet and low leverage. How do you think about uses of cash and the debt capacity given where the stock is right now versus what you think is a strong growth trajectory as you look at next year?","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Well, I think with respect to M&A, you're right, we'll have light leverage and we will have an opportunity to pay it down very, very fast because, as you've seen, we're a very strong cash generator. We generate a lot of free cash flow at Skyworks. And so if I look at the long-term, we continue and will continue to look for accretive acquisitions that have a couple of characteristics. One is they have stickiness to the end customers. So there's a technology envelope or market being addressed that is highly valued where we can leverage perhaps customer relationships, manufacturing expertise, process know-how, system capability and create solutions that have a great deal of value.","We're also looking for opportunities to leverage our position in mobile and connectivity for adjacent markets \u2013 vertical markets if you will \u2013 that again have those same characteristics. We're very interested in looking for analog opportunities that are outside of our current target market scope and look for logical extensions where we can continue to increase margins, while having more legs to the stool, if you will.","Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, and, Vivek, just to follow on that. So, as Dave said, if you look at our EBITDA and our strong cash flow, we certainly have the powder to lever up more than the said deals. PMC would be about 1.2 times EBITDA. So we'll have room to grow if we so desired. We like the 40% return to the shareholders, so we'll continue to look at annual dividend increases. That's a smart play for us. And then we'll do opportunistic share buyback. So that's the right formula, because obviously we could take that number up, but we think the best long-term value is to continue to focus on how we're going to grow the top line of the business. So that's the balance that we're trying to strike.","Operator","Thank you. We have a question from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity. Go ahead, please.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","Thank you. Sorry about that. So a couple things. First, Dave, you guys did better on the Phase II MediaTek than I think a lot of people had anticipated here, and first wanted to confirm that that was something like SkyLiTE, correct? And does it represent an increase in RF content both for that platform, the last one and for Skyworks? And is that the trend you're seeing in even the white-box guys at this point?","Liam K. Griffin - President","Ed, yes, this is Liam. That's a great pickup on that. We did win some meaningful share with MediaTek and it is our SkyLiTE product line. And what SkyLiTE is, actually, is think of it as our SkyOne ex-filters. So there's a couple of themes there. The content with MediaTek on those platforms is going be an upgrade from where we were on the prior region, but overtime, if you can envision, if we start to develop our filter strategy and our integration strategy with a company like MediaTek taking the SkyLiTE and now embedding high-performance filters, you could see a real pop in opportunity. And it's something that our chipset partners want to see. So yes, you called that correctly with the technology. We're happy with the position. We love MediaTek. We've worked with them for years. They were a little late to the game in 4G, but as you've seen, they're accelerating gains.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","And then you're talking a lot about BAW here and I know you guys work \u2013 this is an FBAR type process I think it is. Is it not? And did Panasonic have IP in that? Or do you think you'd cross over anything that Avago has got here? How do you feel about the IP situations, given that there's only two other guys doing this right now?","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Panasonic has, as you can imagine, a great deal of fundamental IP around filters in general. And so filters have been around for a long time, bulk acoustic filters have been around a long time as have surface acoustic filters, and so we have a lot of IP in filters. And Panasonic brought us a great deal of expertise and leverage.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's Q&A session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Aldrich for any closing remarks.","David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you very much for listening and we look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call and we thank you for your participation."],"19662":["Skyworks Solutions, Inc.

At this time, I'll turn the call over to Mitch Haws, Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Haws, please go ahead.","Mitchell J. Haws - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Thank you, Paul. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' First Fiscal Quarter 2018 Conference Call. With me on the call today are Liam Griffin, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kris Sennesael, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our discussion will include statements relating to future results and expectations that are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Please refer to our earnings press release and recent SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for information on certain risks that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially and adversely from any forward-looking statements made today. Additionally, the results and guidance we will discuss include non-GAAP financial measures consistent with our past practice. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.","With that, I'll turn the call to Liam.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Mitch, and welcome, everyone. The Skyworks team produced record results in Q1, demonstrating our traction within the increasingly vibrant and profitable mobile and IoT ecosystems. During the quarter, we exceeded $1 billion in revenue and delivered $2 in earnings per share, driven by strong global demand for our high performance connectivity solutions. Let me begin with a few Q1 highlights. We generated revenue of $1.05 billion, up 15% year-over-year. We expanded gross margins to 51.4% and operating margin to 39.4%. We achieved records earnings per share, up 24% year-over-year, and $0.09 ahead of consensus.","And finally, we exceeded our free cash flow margin goal of 30%. In addition to our strong financial performance, we continue expanding our design-win pipeline. Our systems solutions are enabling everything, from industrial robotics to drones, autonomous vehicles, wireless infrastructure, home security, and virtual assistance. Last quarter, we broadened our reach across a number of leading mobile and IoT customers. In mobile, we secured strategic design wins, leveraging our fully-integrated solutions, including SkyOne, SkyBlue, as well as DRx, power management, and precision antenna tuning.","Across broad markets, we enabled telematics in support of a leading automobile manufacturer; delivered LTE capabilities within Amazon's newest Kindle and Alexa-based platforms; deployed connectivity engines for Google's new Home Max wireless speakers; developed feature-rich ZigBee and Bluetooth modules for Nest's new connected home alarm systems; secured multi-user MIMO design wins at Linksys, tripling home data rates; supported Netgear's Orbi Wi-Fi system for outdoor mesh networks; we partnered with Comcast on their premium high-performance XB6 home gateway; and finally, in our infrastructure markets, we secured a number of massive MIMO wins with carriers across Europe and China.","So to summarize, we delivered record financial results, captured strategic design wins across all key markets, and substantially strengthened our balance sheet. At a higher level, the ubiquitous connected economy is gaining significant momentum and enhancing the way we live, work and educate. The Skyworks' vision of connecting everyone and everything all the time is more relevant than ever. This vision is the catalyst behind our recently launched Sky5 platform. Our Sky5 solutions address new 5G spectrum, enhanced carrier aggregation, dual connectivity, and massive MIMO requirements, while delivering unmatched levels of integration and performance.","The deployment of our Sky5 platform accelerates our mission to enable the data-driven world, while alleviating the digital traffic jam created in current 4G networks. 5G is critical to resolving this challenge, opening entirely new lanes of spectrum. 5G will represent a significant boost in speed, up to 100 times that of 4G networks. 5G will offer extremely low latency, a requirement for mission-critical applications such as the driverless car, machine-to-machine, and robotics. 5G will also be a major catalyst to the expansive rollout of IoT, greatly expanding network capacity and improving reliability.","As a leader in unwiring the planet, Skyworks is well positioned with extensive technology depth and breadth, strategic partnerships with all leading smartphone and IoT customers, differentiated system solutions enabling unmatched levels of integration and performance, all of which is underpinned by the formidable investments we've made over the past two decades, expanding our product portfolio, IP, and scale. As a result, we have the profitability, cash flow, and balance sheet to extend our leadership position. Our strategic R&D and CapEx investments will be pivotal as the scale and technology requirements around 5G intensify. Finally, and most importantly, we are committed to delivering premium levels of profitability with above-market growth as we continue to create shareholder value.","I will now turn the call over to Kris for discussion of last quarter's performance and our outlook for Q2.","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Liam. Revenue for the first fiscal quarter of 2018 was a record $1.052 billion, up 7% sequentially and up 15% compared to Q1 of last year, exceeding our guidance and consensus estimates. Gross profit was $541 million or 51.4% of revenue, up 40 basis points sequentially following 30 basis points of sequential improvement in both the September and June quarters of 2017.","Our record gross margin of 51.4% in Q1 was up 20 basis points year-over-year. Operating expenses were $127 million, or 12% of revenue. As a result, we generated $414 million of operating income, translating into an operating margin of 39.4%, up 90 basis points sequentially and 60 basis points year-over-year. This drove record net income of $372 million or $2 of earnings per share, up 24% year-over year, and exceeding our guidance by $0.09.","Before turning to the balance sheet review, let me summarize the impact of the recently enacted U.S. tax reform. In general, the tax implications are positive for Skyworks. Due to the fact that we are on a fiscal calendar ending in September, the financial impact will be phased in over fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019. Based on currently available information and interpretations of the new tax law, we expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 11% for fiscal 2018, down from prior estimates of 14.5%.","In fiscal 2019, the non-GAAP effective rate could potentially drop further to about 10%. This will generate substantial tax savings, benefit our cash flow, and provide increased access to our international cash. In Q1 of fiscal 2018, we booked in our GAAP results a one-time charge of $258 million related to tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and a non-cash charge of $18 million related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The repatriation tax will be paid over the next eight years, more weighted towards the last three years. Those charges were excluded from the non-GAAP results and are provisional amounts that may change as we refine our analysis.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. First, fiscal quarter cash flow from operations was $361 million and capital expenditures were $28 million, resulting in a free cash flow margin of 31.6%. Dividends paid were $59 million, and we repurchased 1.7 million shares of our common stock for a total of $173 million. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.7 billion and no debt. As noted in a separate press release issued today, the Board of Directors has authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase program. This new program reflects the board and management team's confidence in Skyworks' business model.","When coupled with the added flexibility of the recently passed tax legislation, our strong free cash flow generation allows us to leverage stock repurchases, dividends and capital expenditures to drive higher shareholder returns and investment for future growth. As a result, we are increasing our targeted cash return rate to shareholders from the 40% to 50% range historically to a level of 60% to 75% of free cash flow going forward.","Now, let's review our outlook for fiscal Q2. We anticipate revenue to be up 6% to 8% year-over-year, with gross margin at 50.5% to 51%, and operating expenses of $131 million. Below the line, we anticipate roughly $2 million in other income, and a tax rate of 11%. We expect our diluted share count to be approximately 185 million shares. Accordingly at the midpoint of approximately $910 million in revenue, we plan to deliver diluted earnings per share of $1.60, a 10% increase year-over-year. Based on our expanding reach within flagship platforms, and with design win momentum across broad markets, we expect accelerated top-line growth and further margin improvements throughout the balance of the fiscal and calendar year.","With that, let me turn the call back to Liam.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Kris. Skyworks enters 2018 with strong momentum. Our outperformance is being driven by a vibrant, dynamic mobile ecosystem, one that rewards companies who can resolve architectural complexity with simplified integrated solutions. The value inherent in a connected economy is apparent in our results. Over the past 5 years, our revenues have more than doubled, EPS has more than tripled, and our operating cash flow was up 5 times. Our strong cash generation is allowing us the flexibility to continue to invest to win, while substantially increasing our targeted cash return to shareholders.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","First question will come from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.","Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you guys for taking my questions. I guess, Kris you mentioned that obviously you're guiding for 6% to 8% for calendar Q1, and you said you expect an acceleration going forward. Just curious as to what's driving that acceleration in top line growth for the next few quarters.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure, this is Liam. Yeah, I mean, if you look at the business today, we posted $1.050 billion in Q1 with a solid design win signature. That design win signature carries into Q2, albeit some of the units here with some significant flagship accounts were lower. As you start to move into the second half, there's a new set of products and a new set of design wins that we've consummated that will accelerate our business in the second half. So it's really some unique technologies that we brought forth to some leading customers and there's some broad market activity. But the second half is actually quite visible to us right now based on known design wins and then the continued run rate on some of our broad markets business.","Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Great. Just to follow up on that, Liam. Do you still believe that this RF business is a 10% to 15% growth business in, I guess, calendar 2018? And also as you look out to 2019 and 2020, when do you think 5G will start to contribute materially?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. We do think that it's a 10% to 15% opportunity and we're pursuing that with vigor and success quite frankly. And if you look out into 5G, we'll start to see early indications of 5G in the 2019 platforms, and more so in 2020. And as we've articulated in the past what you're going to see which is great for the industry is the 5G platform. Our Sky5 will be an addendum to the 4G engine. So you're going to see new technologies, new frequency bands, new devices addressing the 5G spectrum in addition to having backward compatibility to 4G and even some 3G.","Operator","Before we go to the next question, given time constraints, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. We'll go to the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Maybe Liam, if you could walk us through March, obviously lots of guys in handsets have seen some weakness into the March quarter. Maybe you could just walk through the moving pieces for you in March. And then there was some concerns that maybe there's some customer inventory. I'm just kind of curious your visibility into the customer channel, and whether you had any thoughts on June whether this could be the bottom.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure. Yeah, I mean, as I just mentioned, the design win signature, specifically with the premium flagship models, had been cemented in the December quarter, and imputed in our $1.050 billion. And so what you've got in the March quarter are fewer units for the flagship, which weighed on us. And to some degree we were able to offset that naturally though growth in broad markets which is up year-over-year in March. And also China hasn't been great, but it actually be modestly up for us again in March. So our March quarter, a little bit of recovery in China, broad market steady, taking some weakness from flagship customers, and all that nets out into our guidance.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got you. And then maybe just one more question on just the guidance for March between broad markets and the mobile business. So I'm just curious, broad markets has been growing quite nicely high teens. Trying to still figure out the seasonality there. I'm just kind of curious into March whether you expect broad markets to be up or down.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, it will be up in the March quarter Blayne, and it continues, we think. I know you mentioned something about June, June should be okay there as well for broad.","Operator","Question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the good execution. Liam, you mentioned some new wins in the second half. Is that more shared in existing sockets, such as low-band PAD, or in addition to that is it more content, and in what kind of applications could that be?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, it's both. It's certainly \u2013 one of the things to remember is that the portfolio that we provide evolves year-over-year. It's been happening forever. There really hasn't been any stagnation there. So we are seeing an increasing demand and burden on the technology. There's been performance driven solutions that require really creative elegant differentiated product. It's great for us. It allows us to really kind of flex our muscles in technology, leveraging our Tc-SAW capability, our in-house gallium arsenide, our switching, our packaging in Mexicali, all of that. So we're seeing share gains in an evolving set of products that maybe two or three generations ago have grown up to be more and more rich in content, richer in value. And then we're also expanding into new areas completely. So we're doing more things in antenna tuning. We're expanding in GPS. We're starting to develop higher band solutions in some cases with customers. So it's really all of the above that will put us in great position for the second half.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. And as my follow-up, how sensitive is your pipeline to the supplier of the baseband modem? So, for example, if, let's say, Intel happens to win a lot more share of some of these flagship models from the current incumbent, does that change your content in any way?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","No, that's a great question. And it does not actually. We have great position with both Intel and Qualcomm. And if you go into Asia, you'll see us lined up with HiSilicon at Huawei. You'll see us lined up with MediaTek. So we're able to work with all of the above. And again, we have real diversity there with our partnerships. And certainly, there's going to be some companies that do better on the baseband side, and we're right along on track with that.","Operator","We have a question from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi, thank you very much. I just wanted to go back to the capital allocation and just wanted to understand, A, the timing, and B, the components to that. So, clearly, you guys have a very analogist model in terms of the free cash you generate. So, was this catalyzed by the tax reform that you're raising your capital return? And then within that, what's the right way to think about the mix between buyback and dividend? And then I had a quick follow-up, please.","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, we will continue to evaluate our capital return, but very pleased to announce a $1 billion new share buyback authorization today. In part, of course, that was triggered by the fact that our cash, roughly $1 billion of the $1.7 billion of cash, which was offshore, now becomes available, and we can repatriate that without any further tax consequences and use that for dividend payments and share buyback. It's something, again, we will continue to evaluate, the right mix between dividends and share buybacks, but a combination of both, we target now 60% to 75% of the free cash flow.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, maybe, Kris, you can answer this one as well. Just going back to the last earnings call when I had asked you actually about your CapEx, you had indicated that you are raising your capacity, and then also, as one of the drivers for gross margin, you have talked about increasing the mix between internal versus external. So the increase in capacity, and I just want to understand the dynamics between the two, are you raising capacity because you have some new design wins that are expected to fill that capacity and then help you progress on that path that you talked about increasing internal versus external?","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, absolutely. There is some seasonality to the CapEx as well, and the December quarter is typically our low CapEx quarter. We are going to increase CapEx in the second quarter, the March quarter and the June quarter as we get ready for the ramp-up in the second half of the fiscal or calendar year. This is both related to capacity extensions as well as technology investments that we make along the line there.","And so, in terms of insourcing our filter operation, we continue to make good progress there towards a 75% insource. We're not all the way done with that, so there is still some progression left there, and the teams are working hard on it and putting that in place.","Operator","We have a question from Anthony Stoss with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.","Anthony Joseph Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Hi, guys. Nice job in a tough environment. Liam, can you maybe talk about what you're seeing on the competitive front, either SAW performing as well as BAW, and if Qualcomm 360 is making any inroads? Then, Kris, if you wouldn't mind, give us kind of a view on total CapEx for 2018.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure, I'll start with the competitive landscape. I mean, certainly, what we see in the market today is our customers are facing an incredible opportunity in bringing higher-speed connectivity to the market and moving into 5G. But it's also a more burdensome challenge for them. So they're selecting suppliers that can do more and suppliers that can resolve this challenge. There's so much interference and crowded spectrum and work to be done to make these great products actually execute and perform in the market. So what's been beneficial for us, Tony, is to have the building blocks, have the capability to do very high-performance Tc-SAW stretching all the way to 2.5 gigahertz, covering a lot of spectrum, the ability to bring our crafted gallium arsenide, our assembly and test unique architectures, and filters of any nature to bring that solution. And the configurability that we offer account-by-account has been quite important. So that's something that I don't see across the peer group, it's something that we've been rewarded with. And as Kris mentioned early, we're making the investments. We're investing offensively in our technologies to ensure that we can take care of what's on the table today, and also be with our customers as we move into 5G.","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. So CapEx will be running on or about 10%, might be even slightly above that. But on or about 10% as we prepare for the ramp in the second half.","Anthony Joseph Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Great job, guys. Thank you.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","(23:41) from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks. Liam, just a follow up. You commented on the broad markets in terms of visibility going out into the June quarter up. Any commentary on just mobile, in terms of what you're seeing from the supply chain, and how sequentially you would view the June quarter?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure, Craig. Yeah. So we're going through a March quarter where mobile has been a bit challenged on a unit basis more so I would say. As we get into June, we don't have all of our signals completely aligned on June, but I certainly expect it to be up for the company in total. Broad markets will play a role in that, and I think mobile should also be okay in June, probably up a bit.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then just as a follow up on broad markets, if I look at call it 17%, 18% year-over-year growth in recent quarters, and then in the context of that business grows maybe 10%, 15% longer term, just kind of some of the drivers near term, and just do you think you can continue to sustain at these higher growth rates.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. We do think we can sustain. There's just so many more customers and opportunities that we haven't addressed in that space. And mobile is a great business for us. We see tremendous growth in that market. We know where the dollars are, and we've been very efficient at pursuing those. In broad markets, we're growing mid-teens, but there's a lot of opportunity that we haven't addressed. We continue to pursue it. I'm very pleased with the portfolio that we offer from Wi-Fi to ZigBee to Bluetooth. We're starting to see 11ax (25:14) technologies rolled out in some of these advanced access points in routers. We've mentioned some of the applications in the prepared remarks. Automotive is becoming more and more critical for us, leveraging LTE modules, and will certainly be a driver in the 5G. So the fact that we have this very, very broad spectrum of connectivity solutions really lends itself well to the diverse applications that we see across broad markets. So that's one of the important parts. And there's so much blue sky there that we really should expect to be growing mid-teens for the foreseeable future.","Operator","We have a question from Atif Malik with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, we are not making any changes to our target model. But we're making very good progress towards that target model, which is again growing the top line above market, and we have been making good progress there. We have a gross margin target of 53%, again, three quarter in a row, good progress, good improvements there, 30 basis point in June, 30 basis point in September, 40 basis points in December. Obviously, in March, on a softer revenue margin is coming down a little bit, but we expect to make further good progress in the following quarters. And so we target a 40% operating margins, and we are really close to that in the December quarter, and expect to get there soon in one of the following quarters there. And in addition to that, of course, we focus on free cash flow. The target there is a free cash flow margin of 30%. We beat that number actually in the December quarter. But on a full-year basis, we target 30% free cash flow.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Well, we're still working on a number of technologies and solutions to drive higher frequencies and to address 5G. And that's what our Sky5 platform is going to do. And the filtering technology, we have the opportunity to pursue just about every type of filter that we would need. Some of those will be in-house, some will be through partnerships.","Operator","We have a question from Chris Caso with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yes, thank you. Just to start. Could you provide the split between broad markets and mobile in December quarter? And I think you said you're expecting the broad markets to increase sequentially into the March quarter.","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. So obviously the December quarter was a strong mobile quarter, especially driven by some new platform ramps with our largest customer. That played out as expected. And so as a result of that, mobile was slightly above the 75%, and broad market was slightly below 25%. As Liam pointed out, in the next couple of quarters we expect to continue to see some strong sequential as well as year-over-year growth in broad market. And so on a full-year basis that is going to flip again, and so you can think about roughly 75% mobile, 25% broad market.","Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just as a follow up, with respect to the revised cash return policy, is there anything to read through there with respect to your appetite or your view towards further M&A? Liam, I think you've said in the past, you're pretty happy with your business as it is, you'd be amenable to looking at things they came along, but perhaps in light of this new strategy you could update us on your current thinking.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure, Chris. Well, as you said, we have a discerning view on M&A, certainly if the right opportunity presents itself we're in great position to execute. Our cash balance is strong. Our free cash flow margin is strong. We've got some great attributes in our business model that provides powder. So we're not taking that off the table, but again, we still want to be sure that shareholders understand that the capital allocation that we outlined today is aggressive, but we have 100% capability to deliver that. We announced the $1 billion buyback as well. So there's a lot of good things happening on that end. But M&A is always something that we look at. But day-to-day we're driving this business, and we like the opportunities in front of us.","Operator","We have a question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray","Yeah. Hey, guys, first of all congratulations. Solid execution in what's a tough environment. And Liam, I had a question for you. Every company that's reported has talked about China being tough. I think you mentioned, correct me if I'm wrong, that China would be up modestly for you guys in March. I'm curious what's driving that. And then also, is the Korean customer ramp, or their flagship phone playing a role for you guys in the March quarter?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, sure. So I would say that the Korean customer is up in March. China is just about flat to up a bit. And China had been a faster grower for us in the middle of the year, cooled off a bit in Q1, and right now going into Q2, we've got them roughly flattish. We have the Korean customer up year-over-year in March quarter.","Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray","Got it. And then for my follow up, your incremental fall through at this point in time, and then how do you see that changing as you bring more of the filters in-house as the year progresses?","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. No. That is an ongoing effort, Harsh. And so in part of course driven by the ramp of the new platforms that consume more and more complex filters, and so the team is executing very well on that. And so it's just a matter of couple quarters and we'll get to that 75%.","Operator","We have a question from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Please go ahead.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I think this may be a follow up to a point that Kris made earlier, but I just wanted to make sure I understood it clearly. So what I wanted to do is focus on the full-year growth potential of each of the two main businesses. We clearly have a strong start to the calendar year in broad markets. You're expecting integrated mobile to come back very strongly in the back half of the year. So for the calendar year, Liam and Kris, which of those businesses is going to be the better grower? Is it integrated mobile, given the strength of the second half ramps, or is it broad market, just given the stronger start to the year and growth through the year?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure. Yeah, I'll try to give you a little color on really what we can glean today. I will tell you that the second half of the calendar and more so even the fiscal and calendar both, you're going to see accelerating gains in mobile. We have some really powerful design wins that have been cemented. And it's just a matter of time for those to actually make it into our P&L. So that we know. Broad markets, we see a steady path to mid-teens. So I think if you've modeled that and that level kind of a 15%-ish kind of number through the balance of the year, that's kind of where we see it. And there's a lot of diversification in broad markets. We tend not to see the kind of seasonality that we do see in mobile. And there's a very broad design win footprint across those customers.","So mobile is definitely going to be stronger in the back half of the year with known design wins, broad market with our current business and growing opportunities we see as a mid-teen grower.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","That's really helpful. And then the follow-up is really putting calendar 2018 in perspective and looking longer term. It seems like every indication that we get for 5G is more and more optimistic that we're going to have devices ramping in the first half of the year more materially in the back half of the year. And that really kicks off an era where content is going to go up very significantly it seems given the 10x increase in band combination.","So, is calendar 2018 really a bit of a pause in the integrated mobile business even though we're getting very good year-on-year growth now and stronger in the second half relative to what we could see next year? How do you look at the growth rate that we have this year relative to what you could see coming over the next two to three?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. No, that's a great question. It's certainly our belief that 5G will be yet another catalyst in mobility, and it's clearly it's necessary as for all the reasons that we talked about in the prepared remarks, and you've heard it in our Sky5 presentation. So we know what that needs to happen. We're going to play a pivotal role. We're working with the right thought leaders and customers that are shaping the architectures. We're very much aligned. So we're looking forward to that.","But I still think that what we're seeing in today's model, there's great stuff here, there's great content. And the units are down a little bit, but in the second half, I think we're going to see some catch up, and then going into 2019 and beyond, you're going to start to see 5G become more and more apparent in architectures, and it will be a steady roll over several years before we get the whole market to upgrade.","Operator","We have a question from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research. Please go ahead.","Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research","Thanks a lot. Good work on just every metric here, and I know you've been guiding for improving gross margins. Liam, if you walk us through real quick what the three primary factors you see in the next 12 months, 24 months that will drive gross margins. I know utilization factor (35:35) is one of those. But maybe you could identify those, if you could. And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. (35:42) I'll take that. So, obviously, our gross margin drivers haven't changed, and the first one, of course, is incremental revenue and revenue growth that gives us better utilization and fixed cost absorption. That is one. Second, it's ongoing operational efficiencies that we drive in all our fabs, the front-end fabs, the filter fabs as well as our back-end operation.","And then last but not least, we've talked about that, it's the ongoing filter insourcing where we make some good progress bringing those filters in-house at a much lower cost than we buy them from third parties, while at the same time, of course, improving the performance of those filters as well. And that are the three levers, and that will continue to drive further margin improvement towards our target model of 53%.","Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research","So, I guess, the follow up on that one, if I could, Kris is, I mean, you're already gargantuan in Tc-SAW. Your scale, I think, towards your second closest competitor to the point where they just gave \u2013 I won't say gave up on it, but certainly rather than keep investing trying to catch you, have kind of relinquished that. You've got the largest packaging assembly test facility, I guess, on earth at this point, in Mexicali. So how much \u2013 I mean, a couple of those were about scale, and you've already got monster scale. So it would seem like those gains are going to be relatively limited even if you make your targets.","And then, Liam, if I could real quick, you spoke several times about how solving complexity is one of the keys to gaining share in new content and new slots at some of your largest mobile customers, that seems to be the case. Can you give us a characterization, real something you'll sketch out about (37:21) well, how you see the world because there's been a lot of chatter from everybody from Qualcomm, from the Japanese, and few other guys about filter technologies or new wins or whatever, but the trend seems to be definitely in your camp here on these more complicated modules. Is it amps, is it filters, is it system design? Why are they apparently losing share and you guys are gaining it? Thanks.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. No, that's a great question. And I'm going to dovetail back a bit into the margin element too. I mean, one of the other really critical pieces of the margin fabric is really our integration technology, just as you outlined. So, the complexity and the challenge in mobility requires suppliers to act differently and find opportunities to really help the customer. If we don't help our customer win, no one's going to win. So we do a lot of work on building these crafted integrated solutions. We started with SkyOne. It took a while for that to get airspeed, but it's become our dominant transmit change solution that goes from low-band to mid-band to high-band. We've dovetailed that with resolving another problem on the receive chain, developing our DRx solution, again, leveraging our filters, leveraging L&A technology, and the unique craftsmanship that we can deliver through Mexicali. So we see that continue. That creates also a margin opportunity because it presents tremendous value to the customer, and it creates a lot of competitive barriers with our peers. That's been helpful. As we start to move out along the curve into higher frequency and into the domain of 5G, the landscape gets even more difficult and more challenging. Fewer companies can put these pieces together. So our ability to go from crafted gallium arsenide, partnerships in SOI, filter technology, in-housing growing, and then that ability to configure with our own assembly and test, all of that is really unique. Figure out how to work with every base-band supplier, we do that. We get with the best and the brightest and it comes together. It's not easy, but that's the recipe that's been working for us.","Operator","We have a question from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Congratulations on the nice results. Liam, your largest competitor in low-band PADs has admitted it's likely to lose share in the second half of 2018 as these new flagship phones ramp in the second half. Do you expect to pick up that share or do you see a more competitive market in low-band PADs? And then I've got a follow-up.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Well, yeah, barring any specific customers, we see a robust market share position for low-band PAD. We also see that product really growing and its reach of technology, expanding bands, for example, and delivering higher performance output power to milliamp level performance. So that continues to be an increasingly important product for the industry. We expect to populate that through a number of Tier 1 large scale players.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC","And then a follow up is just, as you look at the premiere flagship phones being announced in 2018, do you expect a significant percentage of those phones to have gigabit modems that require 4x4 receive chains?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","4x4 is increasing. Right now we're in early innings and stepping through that increased performance. We're seeing it with some of the high-performance flagship models. So it's starting to become apparent on kind of the roadmaps for the mid-tier customers, but it's another opportunity. I mean, it greatly expands the RF content for all players. But to the point of integration that we talked about in the last few questions, bringing those solutions together kind of in an intricate size reduced manner that allows the greatest performance without degradation of signal I think is key. So 4x4 isn't just simply putting in more and more radios. It's really about architecting them so that they work in unison at a higher level.","Operator","Final question is from Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Hey, thanks for taking my question. Just following up on the low-band PAD question. So I guess, Liam, how do you expect your mix to look over the next few quarters, low-band versus mid and high? And then, Kris, I guess, if we see an increasing mix of low-band, does that have any implications on your gross margin outlook?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, the low-band PAD is not a new product for us, but we are again raising the performance level each and every year. So what would be launching and being delivered in the second half of 2018 is very different than what you'd see in 2017 or 2016. And it's a product that we see extended reach, as I mentioned. We see this going across multiple customers. There are few critical ones where it's going to be more of a driver. But for our business right now, it's one of our most important architectures. We're delivering now also mid band and high band solutions. If you flip it to the receive side, DRx is kind of following the same chain where we started with a low-band DRx, we're moving to mid and high there. So you've got both sides. You've got transmit and then you have receive side that will benefit from some of these newer architectures. And of course low-band PAD has been mentioned a few times, and that's going to be a key product for us as always.","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. And the low-band PAD is running on or about company average from a gross margin point of view. So it's not a headwind or a tailwind.","Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Okay. Great. And then to my follow up. So last week, Qorvo made some pretty specific comments about their expectation to retake some share at Samsung and Huawei, kind of post this spring portfolio ramp. Sounds like you're pretty confident in the back half of your position as well. Can you maybe help square your confidence versus their comments?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, listen, I look at our outlook and the design wins that I know that we've consummated. We feel really good about the second half. We feel really good. I mean, there's going to be competition. This is a growing market that we play in, and there's opportunities for others. But we feel very confident in what we've won, and a lot of that technology, you're going to start to see here in the second half calendar and fiscal.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Griffin for any closing comments.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Well, thank you all for participating on today's call.

At this time, I will turn the call over to Steve Ferranti, Senior Director of Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Ferranti, please go ahead.","Stephen Ferranti ","Thanks, Michelle. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' first fiscal quarter 2013 conference call. Joining me today are Dave Aldrich; Don Palette; and Liam Griffin. Dave will begin today's call with a business overview, followed by Don's financial review and outlook. We will then open the lines for your questions. Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those noted in our earnings release, and those detailed from time to time in our SEC filings. I would also like to remind everyone that our results and guidance we will discuss today are from [ph] our non-GAAP income statement consistent with the format we have used in the past. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.","With that, I'll turn over the call to Dave for his comments on the quarter.","David J. Aldrich","Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Skyworks is off to a great start to fiscal 2013. Our strong first quarter performance and better-than-seasonal guidance again demonstrate how our diversification and expanding market opportunities enable us to consistently deliver superior financial results. At a high level, we're capitalizing on the proliferation of connectivity in all its forms across the diversified analog landscape. In fact, it's virtually impossible to find a segment today that is not incorporating some form of always-on access. And as the enabler of all things connected, Skyworks is benefiting from, and in some ways facilitating, this market transition.","Today we bring to bear an entire portfolio of leading-edge technologies along with world-class system engineering capabilities to provide differentiated, performance-based solutions, spanning the entire diversified analog market. So as the world at large becomes increasingly more connected, we are uniquely positioned to lead this transition. And our strategy is paying off as reflected by the strength of our financial results and guidance. During the first quarter, we delivered revenue of $454 million. Now that's up more than 15% year-over-year. We achieved an operating margin of 25.3%. We posted [indiscernible] earnings per share and generated $148 million in cash flow from operations. [indiscernible] capital remained very strong at 21.4% [indiscernible]. In short, Q1 was an excellent quarter for us across all our key metrics.  And for our second fiscal quarter, we see continuing momentum as key program ramps and growth in new product categories helped to offset normal seasonality.","The combination of mid-teens revenue growth and mid-20% operating margin that we've demonstrated thus far into Q -- into fiscal 2013 puts our financial returns among the best of breed in the semiconductor industry. With the opportunity pipeline and design win momentum we have in place today, the stage is set for continued revenue growth, continued margin expansion and earnings leverage for the remainder of 2013 and beyond.","Now for a more in-depth review of our financial results, I'll turn the call over to Don for his outlook.","Donald W. Palette","Thanks, Dave, and thanks for joining us, everyone, we appreciate that. Revenue for the first quarter was $453.7 million, up more than 15% versus the year-ago quarter and nearly 8% sequentially. Gross profit was $195 million or 43% of revenue, which is in line with our prior guidance. Operating expenses were $80.2 million, consisting of R&D expense of $50.7 million and SG&A expense of $29.5 million.","We generated $114.8 million of operating income, yielding a 25.3% operating margin, which is a 70-basis-point increase over the prior quarter. Our cash tax rate for the quarter was 7.3%, producing net income of $106.6 million or $0.55 of diluted earnings per share or $0.01 better than our guidance.","Turning to our first quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement, we generated $148 million in cash flow from operations; we invested $26.4 million in capital expenditures with the -- with depreciation of $18.5 million; and we repurchased 1.9 million shares of our common stock, representing a $42 million investment. Given our confidence on our business outlook, we continue to believe that repurchasing shares of our common stock represents a highly attractive use of our cash. And finally, we exited the quarter with $378 million in cash and no debt.","Now for our second quarter business outlook, with the order visibility and specific platform launches we have in place today, we expect Q2 revenue to be $420 million, representing better-than-normal seasonality and a 15% year-over-year growth. At this revenue level, we suggest modeling gross margin in the range of 42.3% to 42.5%, with operating expenses of approximately $80 million.","We continue to see opportunities for sustainable margin expansion in the second half and beyond as we leverage our current capital investments and benefit from the transition to a richer mix of margin-enhancing system solutions. Below the line, we anticipate $100,000 in expenses from interest income and other expenses and a cash tax rate around 7%. We project our tax rate to remain at these levels for the remainder of our 2013 fiscal year. We expect share count to be around 193.5 million shares, resulting in second quarter EPS of $0.47.","All of the underlying drivers are in place for Skyworks to continue to outperform, putting us on a clear path to achieving our mid-term business model of 30% operating margin which, as a remainder, generates around $3 in annualized earnings per share.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave for his comments on the market.","David J. Aldrich","Thank you, Don. For the remainder of the call, I'd like to provide some additional perspective on how we see the trend towards always-on connectivity transforming our analog markets. One of the overriding themes at this year's Consumer Electronics Show was the Internet of Things, which is comprised of sensors and embedded connectivity deployed across a seemingly endless range of devices that touch our everyday lives. We see this trend driving a proliferation of access points from conventional mobile devices, like smartphones, like tablets, to nontraditional devices like home appliances, medical devices, gaming consoles, industrial machinery, home entertainment systems, Smart Energy and security systems, just to name a few. Just compare the number of connected devices in your home today versus just a couple of years ago. The result may surprise you, and I can assure you that the list will only continue to grow over the next few years. In fact, some analysts are projecting over 50 billion connected devices within the next decade. This trend is happening today, and it represents the next major growth stage for the analog industry.","Along with the explosion in access points, complexity is being driven substantially higher. Most network devices span a variety of communications protocols, including some mix of cellular, WiFi, Zigbee, peer-to-peer, Bluetooth, NFC on both licensed and unlicensed spectrum and across multiple operating frequencies. And the design challenges within this environment require competencies across mixed signal, analog and RF, including signal transmission and conditioning, seamless handoffs between disparate air interface technologies, power management, voltage regulation, battery charging, isolation, filtering and tuning, among others. And we have spent, at Skyworks, the last decade putting in place substantial differentiators to simplify these complex design challenges.","Some examples: first, we are the experts in RF and analog system design, we're leveraging a global force of systems and applications engineers; second, we offer an unmatched technology portfolio that includes deep expertise in silicon on insulator or SOI, CMOS, gallium arsenide, BiFET, silicon germanium; and third, we have the leading capability in advanced multichip module integration; and finally, we are the low cost producer. By leveraging these core competencies along with the broad market footprint that we've created through our catalog business, we are rapidly transitioning our product mix towards integrated analog solutions and across diverse end markets.","One interesting example of how this is playing out for us in real time is when -- is within the automotive market where we offer a portfolio of application-specific solutions that include GPS receiver modules, sensors, telematics, electronic transponders, diagnostics monitoring and collision avoidance. The automobile itself is transforming into a networked hub, incorporating in-dash infotainment consoles, navigation, real-time traffic and other demand-based services through a host of communications protocols. And looking ahead, we see substantial opportunity for continued growth as OEMs continue to increase functionality and therefore, analog complexity. And it's clear that these trends in the diversified analog market are moving in Skyworks' direction. As a solution provider with a broad technical footprint, our addressable analog opportunity is exploding. And as an enabler of all things connected, Skyworks is uniquely positioned as a direct beneficiary.","We expect these positive underlying trends to fuel our TAM growth for years to come, and as our product highlights demonstrated, we're capitalizing today. In fact, during the quarter, we captured new design wins across a number of diverse applications that include Comcast's Xfinity home security and surveillance systems, high voltage protection circuits for Boston Scientific heart defibrillators, switch modules for in-dash automotive infotainment applications. Connectivity supporting -- connectivity ICs supporting Nest's energy-efficient intelligent thermostat, a 16-channel LED TV backlighting controller for LG and others, antenna-tuning and control module supporting multiple smartphone OEMs, connectivity solutions within several new set-top box designs across 3 leading OEMs, radiation -- and radiation-tolerant optocouplers supporting new iridium satellites.","So in closing, we're quite optimistic about our prospects for the remainder of 2013 and beyond. Trends in the broader analog market are moving in our favor and our strategy of continuing to diversify and expand into new verticals, while maintaining a laser focus on operational execution is clearly working.","Okay, that concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First, just a clarification, what was the mix between handsets and non-handsets in this quarter and where do you expect that mix to be in the March quarter?","Donald W. Palette","The mix, Vivek, this is Don, this quarter was similar to the mix that we had last quarter. It was 60% -- approximately 60% handsets and 40% HPA. And as far as the March quarter, we don't guide that, but we wouldn't expect that number to change materially in that quarter.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And that's my question, Dave, you are guiding to better-than-seasonal trend. And I think you mentioned share gains in your prepared remarks. Can you give us any more color around that? Is it driven by share gains at one single customer's new model? Is it more broad based? Because we have heard a lot of weakness at one of your larger customers in the March quarter, but you are guiding to better-than-seasonal trends, so I'm trying to understand where that strength is coming from.","David J. Aldrich","Sure, Vivek, thank you. In fact, we see -- you're probably right, March normal seasonality is in the 10% to 12% range. We're going to do better than that. And as you mentioned, some of our customers are doing very well, others not so well. They're challenged. We are seeing new analog opportunities ramping, antenna switch modules, wireless LAN devices, some tuning products. We've also -- as we talked about in the prepared comments, we've expanded into some new verticals. We are seeing sequential growth there in some cases in a seasonally down quarter for mobile. So I think it's just a combination of those identified programs, as well as beginning to ramp into some of these new verticals.","Operator","A question from the line of Craig Ellis of B. Riley& Co.","Brett Piira","This is Brett Piira here for Craig. I guess could you just talk a little bit about your 802.11ac design wins and then once in that, when do you see the ecosystem evolving into the smartphone, tablet, PC-type area? And do you still expect that to be meaningful in 2013?","Liam K. Griffin","Sure, Brett, this is Liam. 802.11ac is a major upgrade opportunity for the WiLAN ecosystem with Skyworks being a direct beneficiary. We are today closely aligned with the leading chipset providers, number one. We have design wins today and access points and routers that are shipping. We have new design wins that just occurred in the last quarter in notebooks and netbooks. And we see Q3, Q4 fiscal significant ramp in 802.11ac and handsets. So it's a story that is building momentum. And we think it's sustainable for a number of years.","Brett Piira","Okay. And then could you just provide me with your mix of 2G in the quarter?","Donald W. Palette","It was roughly 20% 2G and 80% EDGE and WEDGE.","Operator","And the next question from the line of Mike Walkley of Canaccord.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","This is Matt Ramsey on the line today for Mike. Just a couple for me. I wondered if you -- this is kind of building on the last question. I wondered if you might break out your 4G mix in the quarter, just because now, I mean with the 2 big guys kind of ramping 4G phones globally, it seems like that's probably a material portion of sales, and you hadn't broken out before. So I was just wondering if you might today.","David J. Aldrich","Well, our -- it's a little -- Matt, it's a little hard to answer that question specifically because as Don mentioned, it's about 80% 3G, 4G, 20% traditional feature phones and the like. And within those smartphones is a combination of 4G, 3G backward compatibility all the way to 2G. So it's difficult to break it out. But those products in smartphones for us are 3G and 4G PAs, increasingly WiFi enabled, the GPS and LNAs, the analog power management devices. So it's a pretty broad suite. And now antenna-tuning devices, and so on. So it's a pretty broad suite of analog products that make it up, of which 4G is an element. But it's hard to break it out specifically.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay. That's fair. And then I guess as a follow-up and kind of unrelated, Apple talked recently about launching the iPhone LTE-enabled with 36 new carriers. From our work, it seems like LTE network rollouts outside of just the U.S., Korea, Japan are starting to pick up a little bit of steam. Maybe you could talk about what you're seeing on the wireless infrastructure front? Because I know that would be margin accretive for you guys. And anything that you're seeing different from the last several quarters where that market's been pretty weak?","David J. Aldrich","Sure. Yes. The wireless infrastructure space, as we've discussed in the past, has always been a major opportunity for Skyworks, and it had been relatively sluggish through 2012. We are starting to see some design wins pick up and some demand pick up with customers like Ericsson, Huawei in Asia, Nokia-Siemens. So we have a great footprint there. We have a deep portfolio of analog mixed signal technologies and margins. And we agree, we think the LTE rollouts on handsets are going to be a catalyst for a major upgrade cycle.","Operator","And next question from the line of Parag Agarwal of Topeka Capital Markets.","Parag Agarwal - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Don, first question is about gross margin. How should we expect the gross margin to trend as we go forward? And if you could highlight specific margin drivers that we should look for.","Donald W. Palette","Sure, Parag. I mean, it -- this is consistent with what -- when we talked about our goal of a 30% operating margin. The incremental revenue at this point -- what we recommend that you do is on a -- is to drop that through at about 46% to 47% incremental margin. And we've said our goal is to drive that back up into the high 40s or even 50. But at this point in time, the best way to model it for '13 is to use that 46% to 47%. And that improvement from the drop you've seen in the last few quarters, I mean that's really driven by a combination of things. It's more of a -- it's a mix shift from -- going from 2G lower margin products, where we're going more towards high-end smartphones. And also the contribution Liam talked about as far as the overall content we're getting from the non-PA part of the business. And those margins are all accretive to the overall Skyworks. So you get your mix shift towards more and more content that's outside the traditional PA space and it's also a movement away from 2G. Those things, coupled with the extra volume, are going to drive margin enhancement for us in the back half of the year.","Parag Agarwal - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And, Dave, regarding the share gains, should we expect your share gains to accelerate as we head towards the end of the year, maybe driven by LTE and SkyOne and SkyHi? And also if you could talk about the traction you are seeing with SkyOne?","David J. Aldrich","Sure. I think you should see more the -- the trend of high share for Skyworks in smartphones and tablets and related devices, but you should also see more content bolted around the traditional transmit products for us. So as you see from recent Teardown reports, we're finding increasingly that our customers are coming to Skyworks and they're looking for more of a complete-system approach. They're asking us to figure out how to shield the -- how to shield frequency interference or coexistence issues, they're asking us how to figure out how to tune the antenna and work on the power management side, or the the architecture to improve current consumption. There's a lot of switching content, and of course, as you know, we're doing high performance GPS and LNAs and WiFi devices. So you should continue to see more dollar content, more functional content from Skyworks in each successive rollout and design. That's what you should expect.","Operator","A question from the line of Alex Gauna of JMP Securities.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you could -- if I could take another step -- stab at this, Dave, and ask you about LTE exposure disjuncture. Maybe if just limit the question to PA opportunities specifically tuned for LTE. Is that maybe 5% or less of your mix or 10% of your mix or less, ballpark, and what could it go to by the end of the year as your mix improves?","David J. Aldrich","If I understand, Al, among our PA segment of the business, LTE is much higher than 5% or 10%. The only -- my only comment earlier was really meant to point out that we tend to tally the revenue and the content at which LTE may be a functional block or just simply one transmit path. So I don't have the number at my fingertips exactly, what percentage is, but it is increasing rapidly, and it's much higher than single digits.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I was wondering if you could talk about the backlog coverage for the current quarter and maybe what the turns were last quarter and what you need to do to make that into this quarter.","David J. Aldrich","It's quite similar. Our -- we're largely booked. I'll call it 80% to 90%. That, plus our Hub contract, give us a great deal of comfort that we put an appropriately conservative model out there.","Donald W. Palette","Pretty much fully covered when you include the Hub forecast, Alex.","Operator","And the next question from the line of Harsh Kumar of Stephens.","Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Two questions. First of all, I know, Don, you said expect the mix to be 60-40 again. But is there any standout category or any particular end market that's a stand out in the March quarter for you guys?","Liam K. Griffin","Well, I would say -- we talked about it a bit here. You're starting to see more traction outside of mobile. The 802.11ac opportunities, although they will address handsets in the second half, right now we're seeing a nice swing out here with routers. We've got MIMO contents so we could have 2 to 3 streams of devices in a single router. We've got some nice uptick now in our ZigBee portfolio, spanning home automation and security, we mentioned a few of those in the opening comments. So there's a lot of diversification outside of mobile that is moving us above seasonality and then we have some nice design wins that we're putting in place today in handsets that will affect us in the second half.","David J. Aldrich","We're also seeing some lighting in display, power management products that are ramping incrementally for a relatively small base, but those are products that we either acquired or have developed in the last couple of years that have -- that we have been presenting to our mainstream customers where we're starting to gain traction as we provide more of that overall system solution. We're seeing the same thing with more customers for our LNA products, and we continue to take share and ride the growth of WiFi.","Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Great. As I -- I mean, listening to your commentary and again reading the press release, seems like a lot of good things happening in the high-performance analog. And I think you just answered my second question. Seems like you're on a -- would you agree that you feel like you're at an inflection point with respect to that business?","David J. Aldrich","I think we had a -- it's been a long investment. We've been investing in building out the marketing and the design infrastructure and the product building blocks and now the solutions. We've been doing that now going on 6 or 7 years. So -- but we are beginning to see sequential growth as we have more content, and we're able to leverage the existing relationships we have. So these products are becoming more battle hardened. We are becoming more established with a footprint in the designs, and we're starting to see a snowball effect if that's what -- I think that's what you mean.","Operator","A question from the line of Blayne Curtis of Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","You mentioned the antenna tuning wins in your preamble. I was wondering if you could just kind of frame your thoughts on just the overall market there and when you expect to be shipping in phones?","David J. Aldrich","Well, actually, we are shipping antennas tuning solutions today using a number of different architectures and topologies. We think it is an increasingly important part of the architectures when you look at multimode, multiband and LTE. And what antenna tuning does is it effectively -- synthetically lengthens or shortens the antenna to improve matching, and Skyworks have some great IP around this. So what we're doing today is leveraging our switch technology SOI and pHEMT, also some of our developments, integrated solutions and packaging technologies to deliver custom solutions. So we are in production with antenna tuning, quite frankly it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. You have to look at each customer, each OEM, what their antenna is doing what bands they have, manage coexistence and filtering, in some cases. But we think it's going to be a powerful revenue driver for us for many years. It's early days for this, and we're well-positioned at the start.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And maybe if you could address -- you talked about 2G but maybe just address the overall emerging market and low-end 3G market, whether you're seeing any uplift there and kind of what the inventory picture is and how you're positioned?","David J. Aldrich","Sure. This is Dave. We don't see any inventory position there so inventory position is lean and appropriately so, for us. We typically address that market through a combination of distribution and direct. I would say about the 2G market, the beauty of some of these emerging markets is that, at China in particular, is that we are now seeing an inflection point where 2G, 3G, smartphones, high-performance devices are proliferating throughout that market. So there's a great deal of more content. Some of them have -- a lot of these phones have backward compatibility or they may, in fact, have a transmit path on 2G but they are 3G. Smartphones with a lot more contents, a lot more bands, a lot more filtering, a lot more switching, more WiFi connectivity just like the rest of the world. 2G is a standalone product, is -- has declined -- continues to decline perhaps mid-single-digit percentage of our revenue. That market is crowded with competitors. The ASP pressure is high and in fact customers simply don't want -- making -- successful customers making the transition to more high-performance smartphones and devices, simply don't want a discrete 2G PA. They want someone to integrate that solution into entire transmit and receive path. So you won't see much 2G standalone component business at Skyworks, it's simply not an attractive market. We're looking to facilitate the upgrade cycle to the smartphone.","Operator","And the next question from the line of Anthony Stoss of Craig-Hallum.","Anthony J. Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Don, could you talk about your in-house capacity utilization, and maybe start with the percent that you guys manufactured in the December quarter versus subcontracted out, if you will? And then, Dave, could you talk about where you stand on your BAW filter products and how competitive you think you'll be?","David J. Aldrich","Sure, Anthony. As far as utilization, I think it's consistent with the discussions we've had in the past. When you look at that utilization, we really look at it in 2 forms and one is sort of a equipment line utilization and the other is facility, square footage, bricks and mortar utilization. As far as the lines and the equipment again, we're fully utilized. That's been consistent for us for a long period of time. When you look at our ability to ramp production when you look at square footage utilization, we've got, particularly in Mexicali, we have square footage available. So for Shore Capital, we're able to expand capacity and drive incremental margin benefit because there's a fairly significant cost differential for us to do that internally versus externally. As far as internal versus external, how we actually source that, when you look at the last quarter, our HBT -- our GaAs wafer supply was about 20% externally sourced and 80% internally sourced. And then you got a keep in mind that as we've continued to grow in some of these bolt on opportunities that we've talked about, we're sourcing more and more of our products, they're silicon-based, and we're sourcing more and more of those from the outside. But as far as the GaAs goes, it's about 80\/20 on the wafer supply.","David J. Aldrich","This is Dave. I think the second question was around filters. Let me try to clarify. We participate in filters as part of an integrated power amplitude -- tune to a power amplifier in the same of package of PAD. SkyOne has the complete suite of filters for all frequency and band. But we don't sell discrete filters. That's not our business. In these applications, in fact, today we're one of the largest integrators of filters in the world today. And let me kind of give you a sense for it. Below 2 gigahertz or so, we use SAW-based product. Their performance is high, the cost is low. And when then there's narrow spacing, so in other words, when their band's on top of one another at transmit and receive on top of one another in that market, we use temperature-compensated surface acoustic devices, temperature-compensated SAWS. That allows us to eliminate the temperature drift and have real spot-on performance. In very high frequency bands or bands -- AM bands that were -- again the TR is right on top of each other, transmit and receive, while the bands themselves are -- there isn't a lot of adjacent frequency gap. We do use some bulk devices for high frequencies, BAW, primarily Bulk Acoustic Wave, and that's an appropriate technology for high frequency. And so there's always a trade-off between a SAW does well and what a BAW does well and what a temperature-compensated SAW does well.","We have strategic partners aligned for each of these devices today we are in production. And it gives us a great deal of flexibility because those suppliers are different. No one in the world has competencies that will handle all bands and all configuration at high performance. So it's a far better return profile. And we think -- and gives us a great deal more supply flexibility to work with the best process technology for given the existing application and band configuration. And we're doing that across the board today.","Operator","And the next question is from the line of Dale Pfau of Cantor Fitzgerald.","Dale Pfau - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Don, you've sort of danced around this, but maybe you could talk a little bit about the share of your products that are going the outside foundries versus internal, and how that's going to affect our margins. And can we get some margin expansion over the course of the year? Is the mix going to shift or the utilization get better? But how are we going to get some margin expansion here?","Donald W. Palette","No, it's consistent with what we've talked about in the past. First of all, as we continue to grow, we've got a 15% top line growth opportunity. We're going to get a significant benefit both in what we in-source, the manufacturing internally and we manufacture externally, we'll get a margin benefit in that. So that's point number one. Number two is, as we continue to move -- as the margins that we get on this incremental dollar content that we're getting, that both Dave and Liam would talk about, is accretive to the overall Skyworks margins. So as we see the greater and greater attach rate for GPS\/LNAs, for instance, for WiFi devices. All of that within the mobile and outside of the mobile space, that's going to add margin dollars and margin percentage to the company. So that's a real [indiscernible]. Then we're going to see a mix shift in our traditional space where power amplifiers in the handset space were primarily part of the revenue, where we're moving away from 2G to 3G low-end smartphones and high-end smartphones. All of those products have accretive margins. So it's that combination that's going to continue to drive margin expansion. And, yes, we are outsourcing content. When you look at the incremental revenue and capacity we've added through acquisitions, all of that content -- and it's silicon-based, all that's outsourced. So that's been a consistent part of what we've been done in order to drive the margin profile for the last year, 1.5 years. That's not new.","Dale Pfau - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","And then as one follow-up, as your content hits would increase in the system architecture and customer dealing with the system, at what point do your customers get a little twitchy about having so much content with one supplier? Or have we already crossed that bridge?","David J. Aldrich","I think -- Dale, this is Dave. I think we crossed that bridge. If you look at it from a -- as the front-end complexity, if you will. By the front end, I mean analog, analog-mixed signal RF. As that complexity begins to rival the complexity in the applications processor in the modem and the overall system and it has a big, huge impact on the overall performance of the device itself, it is increasingly becoming -- they need a best system solution that is integrated, that's bundled, that's shielded, that's bulletproof. And just as most of our OEM customers have gotten over the fact that they're going to have custom baseband, for example, they're going to have a custom front end, and I think we just need to make sure that we have flawless execution on the supply chain side, high yields, never have reliability hiccups, and we're good at that. So I think they have crossed that bridge. Some more than others. Some like to generate more competition. But the fact is, that is increasingly a custom business, and very few customers are going out and shopping for the best discrete component. So very few, if any. And so we think that, that ability to integrate by keeping a broad technology footprint, by keeping our cost structure low, by being able to integrate both the semiconductor, as well as the module, the laminate and the passive gives us an opportunity to add a lot of value for our customers. And as long as we continue to support them as we have, I don't think there's an issue with that.","Operator","And the next question is from the line of Vijay Rakesh of Sterne Agee.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I had a couple of questions. When you look at your -- when you look at last year, you had good traction, the top couple of question why you did very well. Just wondering as you look at fiscal '13 or we look at 2013 here, how you look at -- how you feel as your top customers, how do you see those guys ramp? How do you guys -- how are you guys doing on the new platforms coming out, the market share there?","David J. Aldrich","I think that we well, in the mobile smartphone portion of our business, you will -- you should think about us having the kind of penetration and concentration that the market, the overall market has. So unlike many, we do participate with all the leading -- all the OEMs, and we participate on all the baseband providers, reference designs and systems. So we will look an awful lot like the market. We'll exceed the growth of the market because we're bolt on more content, and the demands of the market are looking -- customers are looking for more of the kind of solution we provided versus point products. That's good for us.  So I think you should continue to look at it that way. I would expect you to see subsequent design iterations with our customers maintaining the content that we have today in the functional blocks, in which we participate. But seeing us bolt on more content, more shielding, more filtering, and switching, and all the rest.","Liam K. Griffin","Yes. I mean, as a follow-on to that, success for us in 2013 and 2014 and beyond isn't just execution in the front end, where we're we've been successful. But now you're really going to see and you're just starting to see it now. ASM, antenna tuning being bolted on, multiple bands of WiLAN 802.11ac, display devices, LED backlight, camera flash, and a whole suite of power management, so that the opportunity around the center of the plate in multimode, multiband PAs and LTE is there. And we're going to execute, but we can really surround that with some complementary devices in analog and mixed signal and drive not only revenue but margin.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got it. And the 802.11ac that you just mentioned, how big is it now? And how do you expect that growth year-on-year, if you could give us some color on whatever?","Liam K. Griffin","Sure, it is a small percentage of our WiLAN portfolio today. It's going through an upgrade cycle from 11n. We think it's going to accelerate, but we love the opportunity. It's early. We're moving fast. We've got great relationships with the OEM partners in the chipset side, and we like the applications that are being driven by 11ac. It's going to enable quite a bit of interesting new consumer level applications.","Operator","And the next question is from the line of Nitin Kumar of BNP Paribas.","Nitin Kumar - BNP Paribas, Research Division","My quick question on the pricing environment, especially on the handset side. I know content has been increasing and -- but like has been mentioned before, there's been some weakness in the higher and and more momentum in the lower end of the spectrum. Have you guys any seen pricing pressure or anything like that?","David J. Aldrich","We've seen pricing pressure be the most dramatic on the point products in 2G. We've seen increasing content offset any pricing pressure on the mid- to high-tier products or smartphone products, whether they'd be low, mid or high end, and a more normalized pricing pattern with these newer devices. We need to be on a path to continue to add value. We've been able to sweep in more functionality so that our customers pay us more, even though for the individual functional block, they're seeing enough value that they can meet their bill of material cost objectives. And that's our goal.","Donald W. Palette","Yes, and if you look that actual year-over-year price erosion number that we track and monitor very closely, we're tracking pretty much at that same 9% number that we've seen over the last few years. So anything new. The only -- at the low-end, as they said, there's been maybe a little bit more pressure, but overall our percentage is in line with what it's been historically. So that points to the upside in some of the other parts of the market.","Nitin Kumar - BNP Paribas, Research Division","I know linear products has been very strong, and I think, Dave, you mentioned automotives. As you sit here in the cycle, what are your thoughts for the rest of the year in terms of 2013? Do you see an improvement from this point on or any specific thought?","David J. Aldrich","I see the continuing -- a few years ago, we were kind of 80\/20 on the mobile FAS space. FAS being dominated by transmit power. We are now more like 60\/40. I see that trend continuing to be more balanced as we ramp vertical markets and as we add more content within our mobile customer systems than simply the transmit chain, and more system solutions, more functionality. So I think you will see the trend of more dollars and a more balanced portfolio, both in terms of a number of markets we address, the verticals we're penetrating, but also in terms of the amount of content we have, and how diverse it is within a smartphone for example.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Burton of Brean Capital.","Mike Burton - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","I wanted to talk a little bit about the -- if you could give us a little color about ET? When does that really become important to you? Do you have PAs to work with Qualcomm? And maybe to your strategy there, are you developing your own pHEMT or is it as a partner? And do you view ET as an opportunity for Skyworks to differentiate?","David J. Aldrich","Let me clarify that a little bit. That's a good question, Mike. ET is important. And for the big baseband providers out there, and you mentioned one, ET will be integrated as part of the chipset. And the system, the front-end PA system, if you will, is being quite customized around high performance to dovetail into that chipset solution. So it's not an ET PA as much as it is a PA that's optimized to deliver envelope tracking in the overall system architecture. So it is very important. And in fact for the first reference designs -- for the first designs that are hitting the market, we are the reference design with our multimode PA on the largest chipset supplier's ET System. So we are -- it is a growth driver for us. Most chipset suppliers, the large ones, at least, will facilitate ET, and there'll be a partnership between what the PA does. It won't be a separate PMIC for ET that the PA supplier provides. It will be more providing the right PA, maybe antenna tuning and bolting around it. There will be some small percentage of the market in our view that will have a discrete ET device. And we've been working on those devices. We have that capability. We also as you know, we bought a power management company. We've got PMIC capability. And that DC to DC converter technology gives us an advantage to drive the supply voltage and drive the transmit chain. So it's a good opportunity for us. We're leading today on the reference design with the largest, and we're excited about it.","Mike Burton - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And also your view on the CMOS PA market. You guys obviously bought the volume supplier at the time when you bought Axiom. Can you maybe size that market for us now? That market is progressing to some day capture low-end 3G. And if so, what sort of impact would that have on the space and for Skyworks obviously?","David J. Aldrich","The low-end CMOS PA market is tiny, frankly, because the 2G market continues to decline in units and in price. We do CMOS. We do low-end gallium arsenide. We do very cost-effective front-end modules to take that PA and integrate it with switch and control and logic to have it more integrated solution. But we're finding that the market for those discrete 2G products is dwindling. And so it's not frankly not a very attractive market for us. It's maybe 5% or 6% of our revenue, and it will not be accretive to margin. That's just not the way that market's going to play out. It is, however, 2G, you need backward-compatible to 2G in these low-end smartphones. And so that is where we're focused on. Integrated devices, there'll be CMOS content, there'll be gallium arsenic content, there'll be silicon germanium and SOI content in that transmit path. And we're really quite agnostic with respect and indifferent with respect to which technology it is.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Aalok Shah of DA Davidson.","Aalok K. Shah - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Just if I just pick your brain real quick on WiFi, especially on the 802.11ac. A lot of companies tell us there's, of course, the 2 bands. And some companies were in the couple, some were in the high band, some in the low band. How do you guys attack that market? are guys going after both? And how do customers kind of view that opportunity for you guys?","David J. Aldrich","Sure. Well, first of all, we absolutely are attacking both bands, 2, 4 and 5 gig. And we have been, for the most part, the incumbent supplier in 11n. So in many cases, it's continuing to fortify the chipset partnerships that we have with the 2 leading players. And we have very strong positions with both. It's taking our current customers through the upgrade cycle. We were very early in sampling the technology, again provided by the support of our baseband partner. So we look at an absolute upgrade cycle at 2, 4 and 5 gig. We're seeing, as I mentioned before, MIMO, multiple streams and routers and access points that really magnifies the content. And then by and large, the handsets that we see today are going to go 2, 4 and 5 gig as well. So there's a lot of momentum there. I think if you listen to what Broadcom said as an example, how bullish they, we're right by them on those designs. So 2, 4 and 5 gig absolutely. I think if you look out a few years, there's some opportunities for us to integrate that into a single solution. But we are very well positioned in, quite frankly, what customers that we have solid relationships with.","Aalok K. Shah - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Are you guys [ph] preferred vendor or preferred partner with Broadcom? We heard multiple different competitors of yours talk about the market and how they're well positioned with Broadcom. Can you describe how you think your relationship with Broadcom is?","Liam K. Griffin","Well, we think our position is very strong. We've been a partner for quite a while. And if you go back to our partner, SiGe, that we've acquired a year ago, that they had been involved there for years. So the relationship is solid. They're a lead player. There's others. And our position, we believe, is very strong.","Operator","Next question, from the line of Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Dave, can you give us an update on SkyOne, the design activity, the revenue ramp over there?","David J. Aldrich","Sure, Ittai. SkyOne, just as a refresher, SkyOne is a product that moves from the baseband chipset, the output of the baseband chipset through the antenna and back. It has all switching control, logic, filters, all filter bands and PAs. And it's really, Ittai, it's really a platform because we have devices that are going to be for more network-specific customers, who look to be more narrow, geographically. Others for the world phone market. The idea is that it's completely shielded and integrated that we take the analog complexity away for which we get paid for, which is nice. So we have released that product. We have it in various stages of qualification with at least 3 OEMs, and you will see that product ramping throughout 2013. It's just beginning because it's a very different architectural approach, and our customers need to get comfortable with it and go through the qualification of the sourcing, reliability, analysis, and it looks very good. So it's going be a good for us. It's going to  -- it'll take a little while. It'll ramp faster than most because the ASP is very high. But nonetheless, it'll take a little while.","Liam K. Griffin","Yes. And another follow on to that, Ittai, is that if you think about the R&D burden putting out a smartphone, the next-generation smartphone, what our customers need to do in terms of industrial design and display and performance that have nothing to do with RF. There's a tremendous amount of R&D burden, budget and challenge that is moving towards the display and look and feel. The RF budget is getting smaller, so we have an opportunity to come in and really solve that problem with multiple bands, antenna tuning and switching. We can make it configurable. So SkyOne really can be modulated and customized depending on the needs and the bands of the end OEM. So we are seeing that value being delivered and received with our customers, and we think it's great opportunity.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just to follow-up on that now. Correct me if I'm wrong, it was my impression that you have already revenue for that in the March quarter. Is that not true? And as a follow-up question, can you talk about China? Your business activity there sequentially in December, and how do you expect that to be in the March quarter?","David J. Aldrich","Ittai, with respect to SkyOne, I think given the rate of qualification you will see in the spring, if there's anything in March, it will be de minimis, it will be very small. So what was the second half?","Liam K. Griffin","With respect to China, what we've talked about here for a couple of calls is that kind of a smaller 2G business right now. So we have a lot of great relationships with companies like MediaTek and Spreadtrum. But the 2G business for us right now is getting smaller, and that's totally okay. Now to combat that though, on the upside, we're seeing some pickup in 3G. We're seeing better performance our of Huawei and ZTE. We're seeing performance out of Lenovo, for example, on smartphones. So we're seeing that migration from low-end single band GSM 2G to an upgrade cycle in 3G. It's playing out quite nicely.","Operator","And the next question, from the line of Quinn Bolton of Needham.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Steve, just wanted to ask 2 quick questions. You spent a lot of time on the call talking about the bolt-on content around the traditional transmit chain. But as you look forward in 2013, 2014, given the trends toward sort of multimode converged PAs or wider band PAs, do you think that the actual PA content starts to level out or actually declines and your overall content growth comes from this bolt-on analog content?","David J. Aldrich","Well, it's hard for me to distinguish. The content that will grow will be given the band proliferation. There'll be some architectures that we'll use on multimode PA. So while there have been more band that will tend to keep the price of the MMMB up and consistent, but clearly the cost per band needs to drop, right? It's got to scale somehow. It's got to be some semiconductor integration advantage on the MMMB. But where those customers will use an MMMB, there'll be some very -- the [indiscernible] filter is  very, very complicated: complex filtering, switching, logic and control. So it's a great deal more content than the switch and on some of the other bolt-on functionality. So you kind of get to the same place of growing TAM, but in the case of an MMMB, you would see some integration advantage of the PA.","The other bolt-on you're talking about are quite independent, which is the GPS products, the power management products, the antenna tuning, the WiFi, and that will be bolt-on. And we continue -- we think there's going to be growth for us as the system becomes more important than the individual device. That will facilitate growth for us for the next several years.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Great. And just on the ET question. You talked about the tight coupling with the chipsets. Does that mean you end up having to do specific PAs for each reference design, or is the ET PA broad enough that it can interface with multiple chipsets or multiple vendors' ET chipsets?","David J. Aldrich","I think it's quite unique per chipset and oftentimes will be customized by customer platform. Not only the PA, but the power management scheme, the PA device and the antenna tuning.","Liam K. Griffin","And having said that, there's a limited universe of suppliers that have the sophistication to handle that matching. Having power management in our wing is definitely an advantage for us.","Operator","Next question, from the line of Tom Sepenzis of Northland.","Thomas A. Sepenzis - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","I just wanted to -- I had a couple quick housekeeping things. One, can you -- I think your tax rate is going to be 7% for the rest of the year, is that correct?","Donald W. Palette","Yes, that's correct.","Thomas A. Sepenzis - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","And what is driving the low rate?","Donald W. Palette","We had guided to 7.5%. The change from 7.5% to 7% was really just the passing of the recent tax legislation. They confirmed that they were going to extend the R&D tax credit and bonus depreciation. So that's what drove it down from 7.5% to 7%. When you look at our 7.5% and compare it to others in the space, we have a very competitive tax rate. And it's really a result of what we've been doing with some business restructuring initiatives. And that's really helped us drive that rate to a very, very competitive level. But that small changes because of the legislation.","Thomas A. Sepenzis - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","And do you expect that to continue beyond 2013 and into 2014?","Donald W. Palette","Well, we don't guide. Guiding the rate is hard because it's based on the whole elements of earnings and -- but what we've said is that as earnings and revenue grow, it's not linear. So that rate probably is going to roll up a little bit. And I think if you're looking at beyond '13 and '14, I think using a lot [ph] [indiscernible] rate is probably pretty competitive. But again we haven't specifically guided that. But it is going to go up a little bit.","Operator","And next question, from the line of Edward Snyder of Charter Equity.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","Dave, you look at over the landscape a little bit longer term than the next couple of quarters. You've got a lot of excess cash capacity in the industry right now. You got MMPAs, dual-band pads, things that are compressing the overall GaAs ASP per band I would say. And at the same time, as you've mentioned and as some you have pointed out, the filter business is starting to boom, especially in the BAW side of the thing. We've got these new antenna tuners as a new technology out here. Skyworks is very strong in the analog side of the business. Would it be unreasonable expectation to suggest that maybe the business models starts moving more to that direction. I don't want to say away from GaAs, of course, but maybe less of an accent just on the kind of classic historic RF GaAs business? And where does that put Skyworks, given you're likely not going to get into the BAW side or even SAW given the unit volumes? Would you be pushing more into some of the more infrastructure fragmented markets and then maybe away from such a large reliance on RF GaAs?","David J. Aldrich","And I would say that you've already seen a transition where a few years ago, or a couple we were 80\/20, 80 mobile, most of which was gallium arsenide. Today, that number is getting closer to half-and-half. And within the PA space in the transmit side, we've got a mix of technologies. And you're right about too much GaAs capacity. But I'd characterize it this way: For those who are -- who have a good broad footprint and are gaining content with the smartphone leaders and the like, capacity utilization is not an issue, and we don't believe will be an issue for years to come. If you don't have that broad footprint, you have to try to fill vertically integrated capacity, and you do it by dropping prices on 2G PAs, for example, and that's not good from a return standpoint, and that's not our business model. So you should continue to see the diversification go on.","And, Ed, while we don't participate in BAW filters or discrete filters of any type, that's not our business. That's mostly -- our Japanese suppliers are in that business, and they tend to -- they've had decades in that business. We are a leader anytime that filter is tuned with and integrated with a PA: SkyOne, PADs. Look at paradigm reports for customers who use PAD. And we see margin-accretive products where we can gain a lot of content and value by tuning that filter in PA using different technologies depending upon the band configuration. So we're using a combination of SAW -- temperature compensated SAW and BAW devices. We expect to be a leader in filters in the sense that when the filters are tuned on the transmit side to a PA.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","And so to the safe kind of point, you've always been kind of a leader on the cost side of the GaAs business. You got your own assembly test, which is unique in the industry. RF Micro just picked up Amalfi, was formerly the largest 2G supplier. RF Micro's pretty big in 2G enough. They certainly are the largest. And from our check, it sounds like pricing has eased a bit. Skyworks was early in the CMOS. It's not a big part of your business now or I would expect neither is 2G. But if that segment starts to grow and the margin starts to -- or at least ASP start to rise a bit given there's less competition today than it was a year ago, is that an area where Skyworks could possibly grow? You still have the Axiom product lines. I don't know how much they've been updated over the several years that you've had them, but given your cost advantage in testing and assembly, is that something that could be reasonably assumed in outyears if we see growth in the area that Skyworks should move back in?","David J. Aldrich","No, I think you should assume that where 2G is required in backward compatibility for low-end smartphone, for example, Skyworks will be a leader there. And it will be a mix of technologies that will have CMOS but we'll have silicon and insulators, some gallium arsenide for sure. I don't think you should expect growth in margin units or total TAM dollars in the 2G standalone market, whether it's CMOS or gallium arsenide. That market, that ship has sailed. I mean, that market is in a unit volume decline. And the competitors who are in that space, think of the local indigenous suppliers in that part of the world, as well as the silicon guides you talked about, we bought one. The margins in those businesses are just not consistent with the margins that we want to generate in our business model. They're very dilutive. So we just don't think investing any money in that business is good for our investors.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's question-and-answer session. And I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Aldrich for any closing comments.","David J. Aldrich","Okay. Thank you for joining, everyone, and we look forward to seeing you in upcoming conferences.","Operator","Thank you. And, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call.

This call is being recorded. At this time, I'll turn the conference over to Mr. Steve Ferranti, Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Ferranti, please go ahead.","Stephen Ferranti ","Thank you, Jamie. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' Second Fiscal Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Joining me today are Dave Aldrich, Don Palette and Liam Griffin. Dave will begin today's call with the business overview, followed by Don's financial review and outlook. We will then open the lines for your questions. ","Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those noted in our earnings release and those detailed from time to time in our SEC filings. ","I would also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we will discuss today are from our non-GAAP income statement, consistent with the format we've used in the past. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP. ","With that, I'll turn over the call to Dave for his comments on the quarter.","David J. Aldrich","Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. I'm pleased to report another strong performance for our second fiscal quarter 2012, in which we exceeded prior guidance, and we outpaced seasonal trends. Our second quarter results demonstrate how our diversification strategy, our flexible business model and ongoing focus on operational execution contributed to healthy financial returns in the seasonal trough, but more importantly, positioned us to outperform through the remainder of the year. ","Specifically during the second quarter, we posted revenue of $365 million. That's ahead of our guidance of $360 million and is up 12% year-over-year. We maintained best-in-class margins, producing second quarter operating income of $84 million. We earned $0.42 in diluted earnings per share, and that's $0.02 better than our guidance. And we generated cash flow from operations of $117 million. ","And looking back at the first half of our fiscal year, despite a product transition at one of our key customers and despite March quarter seasonality, we maintained strong profitability, producing a cumulative $189 million in operating income, we earned a combined $0.92 in diluted earnings per share, and we produced $194 million in cash flow from operations. These accomplishments demonstrate Skyworks' differentiation and highlight the sustainability of our business model. And we see our momentum strengthening in the current June quarter and accelerating in the September quarter based on strong first half design win activity and a robust opportunity pipeline. ","At a higher level, the global megatrends of mobile computing and ubiquitous connectivity will provide powerful growth engines for Skyworks in the coming years and are fundamentally reshaping the world around us. As an example, wireless is becoming the next strategic pipe for content delivery. Upcoming smartphone and tablet platforms feature multi-core processing, high-definition displays and lightning-fast data speeds, making them the ideal third screen for consumers and blurring the traditional boundaries between televisions, PCs and mobile devices. ","Cloud-based services are expanding at an incredible pace. Content providers like Google, like Microsoft, HBO, Amazon and many others are building out massive libraries of cloud-based on-demand content. And the result is an exploding demand to be connected to the cloud. ","And also, mobile is displacing landline broadband. Today, the capabilities of LTE can exceed equivalent wireless services like DSL to a point where mobile broadband is becoming a viable alternative to wireline. This is especially the case within the emerging markets where virtually all of the growth in new broadband subscriptions is from mobile devices. These megatrends are in the early stages, and they'll play out in the span of the next decade. But there is some very tangible offshoots that were strengthen -- that we see strengthening our business today. ","During 2012, LTE devices will hit critical mass. A recent forecast by Strategy Analytics suggests that LTE shipments could grow by nearly ten-fold in 2012. As demand for global roaming expands, smartphones and tablets that incorporate only 1 or 2 regional LTE bands will begin to adopt additional LTE frequency, along with full backward compatibility to 3G and to 2G. Also during 2012, smartphone adoption will skyrocket in developing countries. According to recent market research, smartphone growth in China and India could nearly double this year and approach 200 million units. The embedded base of 2G subscribers is tremendous, creating a massive upgrade cycle that will play out over the next few years. ","And finally, wireless connectivity will expand into even more consumer devices. By 2016, analysts forecast that there will be over 10 billion connected devices. Wireless attach rates are exploding in traditionally unconnected devices like gaming platforms, like televisions, appliances, set-top boxes and many others. ","So as an enabler of wireless connectivity in all its forms, Skyworks is uniquely positioned to capitalize on these trends. We see all of these driving substantial growth in our TAM, driven primarily by 3 factors. First, the average dollar content will continue to rise within our RF front-end market. As smartphones replace feature phones, our core TAM will grow at around a 15% compounded rate, as band count and complexity rise with the adoption of new LTE bands. Second, on top of all this, we are capturing incremental -- the incremental new dollar content within mobile devices with our growing portfolio of antenna switch modules or ASMs, wireless networking front-end solutions, a GPS low-noise amplifiers, and now power management and display and backlighting solutions. And I think it's worth noting that none of these products were in our portfolio just 18 months ago. In fact, today, we find ourselves pursuing as many as 7 or more addressable sockets per device as compared to 1 or 2 PA sockets just a couple of years ago.","And finally, we're leveraging the core competencies from our mobile segment to expand into entirely new high-margin vertical markets. For example, within our high performance analog products, we're seeing a tremendous amount of activity in wireless networking and wireless networking solutions. Wireless connectivity is becoming a critical link to access content in the cloud or to stream video and other rich media content. And next-generation technologies, like 802.11ac, utilize multiple transmit and receive chains, dramatically ratcheting up RF complexity. Much like the cellular market, performance requirements are becoming more critical, complexity is going up and overall RF dollar content is rising. ","And Skyworks has established a strong early-mover leadership position, and we've already secured over 20 design wins across a variety of 802.11ac-enabled devices including routers, set-top boxes, netbook PCs, USB dongles and others. And we expect to begin high-volume product shipments later this year in support of late 2012 product launches. ","Okay, now, turning to our second quarter in our mobile internet business, we secured new design wins on Samsung's Galaxy S3 platform with an entire suite of Skyworks products. This include multi-mode transmit modules that include high-efficiency LTE amplifiers, wireless LAN front-end, GPS LNAs, antenna switch modules and power management products. In addition, during quarter, we captured new socket wins on a host of new smartphone and tablet platforms from Huawei including the LTE-enabled MediaPad and Ascend smartphone lineup. We ramped our integrated multi-mode engine on the HTC 1 smartphone platform. ","And finally, we entered into high-volume production with our SkyHi family of ultrahigh-efficiency amplifiers in support of several major platform launches for 2012. These are the highest efficiency amplifiers in the market today, and we're seeing tremendous design and activity across our customer base. ","Now within our high-performance analog business, we captured new design wins in the quarter across a number of very diverse applications. These include connectivity sockets in Sony's high-end gaming platform, custom switch modules in a military avionics applications for ITT systems, a 16-channel backlighting controller for high-definition LED televisions from LG and others, a next-generation leadless implantable defibrillators with our portfolio of optocouplers, and remote gas meter reading solutions with Aclara. Increasingly across all of our markets, we see a narrower pool of competitors with the engineering capabilities and the full technology portfolio of Skyworks. Looking ahead, we see this trend accelerating. With the advent of more sophisticated RF signal processing and more complex modulation requirements to support higher and higher data rates. ","So in closing, our second quarter marked another strong performance for Skyworks. We believe that our strategy of continuing to diversify our business, expanding into new vertical markets, while maintaining a laser focus on operational execution, is clearly working. ","And with that, I'll turn it over to Don for his financial review.","Donald W. Palette","Thanks, Dave, and thanks for joining us, everyone, today. I'll first provide a summary of our second quarter results and then outline our business outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2012. ","Revenue for the second fiscal quarter was $364.7 million. That's up 12% year-over-year. Gross profit was $157.5 million or 43.2% of revenue. Operating expenses were $73.7 million, consisting of R&D expense of $45.4 million and SG&A expense of $28.2 million, which yielded $83.9 million of operating income and a 23% operating margin. ","Cash taxes were $3.8 million, translating into a 4.5% tax rate, slightly better than our prior guidance. Net income was $79.8 million or $0.42 of diluted earnings per share, $0.02 better than our guidance, including a $0.01 tax benefit. ","Turning to our second quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement. We generated $117 million in cash flow from operations. We invested $26 million in capital expenditures and had depreciation of $18 million. We expect capital expenditures to remain above depreciation levels through the remainder of fiscal 2012 as we increase capacity across all of our facilities in preparation for second half product ramps. These investments -- these CapEx investments consist of equipment add-ons within our existing facilities which have a very quick payback. That expands our product margins and our return on invested capital. And finally, we exited the quarter with $307.3 million in cash. ","I wanted to briefly highlight for you how the strength of our business model has translated into strong earnings and cash flow, and that's enabled us to significantly improve our balance sheet and capital structure. Since the beginning of fiscal 2011, we've generated a cumulative $560 million in cash flow from operations. We retired the remainder of our convertible debt in favorable terms and without any equity dilution. That makes us debt-free for the first time in Skyworks' history. We completed strategic all-cash acquisitions, which significantly expanded our addressable markets, and we repurchased 3.5 million shares of our common stock at an average price in the low $20 range. ","Now for our third quarter 2012 business outlook. We are guiding third quarter revenue to be a 5% sequentially. So assuming revenue of $383 million, we suggest modeling gross margin in the 43.5% range. Looking ahead, we do see gross margins continue to improve as revenue growth accelerates through the remainder of the year and as we realize synergies associated with our recent acquisitions. We expect third quarter operating expense to be roughly $76 million. Below the line, we expect $300,000 in expenses from interest income and other expenses. And we now expect our cash tax rate to be around 7% for the remainder of fiscal 2012. And as a result, we expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be $0.44, and that's on a base of 192 million shares. ","So that concludes the prepared remarks. So, operator, why don't you go ahead and open up the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Parag Agarwal with UBS.","Parag Agarwal - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","The first question is there has been -- I mean, there had been some shortages of baseband from Qualcomm on 28-nanometer products. Just wondering if that shortage has impacted your results or the outlook for the next quarter, and by how much.","David J. Aldrich","Thanks, Parag. This is Dave. We have seen some demand pushout based on shortages. It's been factored into our June guidance. And I'll just add that diversification in our end markets and diversification among the -- our customer set within our mobile business is helping us -- it always helps us to minimize the impact of these kinds of swings. But it's all been factored into what we talked about in our Q3 guidance.","Parag Agarwal - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay fair enough. And the second question is that you are leaded to a strong second half starting from the September quarter. Just I'm not asking for a specific guidance, but do you think the strengths in your business will be better than seasonality in the second half?","David J. Aldrich","I do, and it's really driven by specific program ramps across both our high-performance analog and our mobile business.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Anne Edelstein","It's Anne Edelstein calling in on Vivek's behalf. We just had some questions about your diversification strategy. It seems like you guys did a good job with that last quarter. We were wondering how exactly your strategy is going to change as the top 2 players, Apple and Samsung, continue to concentrate smartphone handset customers, and as your competitors seem to steadily gain share at those platforms, how you can differentiate yourself?","David J. Aldrich","Okay well, that's a pretty broad question. Let me kind of break it up a little bit. The way we are able to deal with customer concentration is the best way possible, which is to try to be a strategic partner and aligned with all of the customers, with all the major customers. We've done a very good job of being able to do that. Furthermore, we focus on our chipset and baseband partners. And by being lined out with virtually every chipset in the market today, we are able to address those swings. So as OEMs look to bring forth a new platform and they begin with a reference design, we're on that reference design, and we're well positioned with their chipset partners. So I think those 2 things allow us to be as diversified as one can be within the mobile business. It has some inherent concentration. Beyond that, we look to diversify into new markets. Logically, we have a high-end performance analog business. We have a strong, robust catalog business, so we're able to address markets like wireless infrastructure, automotive, we talked today about medical, so we have a diverse set of markets we address, which also gives us an opportunity to have less volatility.","Anne Edelstein","Okay. And then can you just tell us how many, and if so, which ones are your 10% customers, 10% or greater, and if any of them are over 20%?","Donald W. Palette","Sure, Anne. We had 3 10% customers for the quarter, and they were Foxconn, Samsung and Nokia. And -- but we don't break it out beyond who is the top 10% customers in a quarter.","Operator","And we'll take our next question Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Maybe just for reference, if you could just, in the March quarter, breakout RF and linear. And then when you look at the strength you're seeing in June, I mean, clearly, one of your competitors had a customer that was down in June. You seemed to be able to offset that. Any color on where your offsets are coming from would be helpful.","Donald W. Palette","Blayne, I'll just take the housekeeping question first. The -- for the quarter, we were at 35% linear HPA and 65% handset smartphone, which is consistent with the percentage we were at last quarter. There really wasn't a change in it.","David J. Aldrich","And to explain the second part of your question, we're seeing some strength in our Korean customer base, we're seeing strength with some of our Chinese customers like Huawei, our HPA portfolio is performing very well, the catalog business is strong, and we're seeing WiFi and some of the connect rate with gaming and some of the home automation markets doing very well for us. It's a combination of those things.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then maybe just following up on the WiFi, I mean, you highlighted 802.11ac. You talked about late year ramps. I was wondering if you could just frame -- I know it's a high content, maybe just from the unit opportunities this year, and next is sort of the adoption curve there.","David J. Aldrich","Sure. Yes, I think this year, we have right now, just to give you a little bit of a backdrop, we have a very strong position with the leading chipset provider, and by virtue of that, have a fairly strong insight into the OEMs and the ramp that we'll see late 2012 and into 2013. So we believe that's going to be a pretty aggressive phase in. We're bringing ac up in 11, and we'll roll out. You see gigabit speed with 11ac, you see MIMO, we have literally multiple screens, so you'd double or triple your RF content. We see that playing out late 2012 as a ramp and then into 2013 and beyond. We're really excited about it. And as I said, we have very good visibility into the chipset in the OEM side.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Alex Gauna with JMP Securities.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk about your Nokia exposure, that it's greater than 10%, how is that revenue trending for you? I know you can't get into too much detail, but with regard to the upgrade cycles with some of the legacy exposure, how should we think about that as a risk factor for you or an opportunity?","David J. Aldrich","Thank you, Alex. Liam?","Liam K. Griffin","Certainly, Nokia, as Don indicated, are 10% customer for us, and we have a very broad footprint from 3G, very high-end, even LTE-enabled phones, and in this year, down to the lower-end 2G business. We continue to work very hard to gain share. I think one of the things that you should expect from us, as we get into 2013, is to go beyond the power amplifier space. We're currently working with them on GPS products. We have a great opportunity for the antenna switch modules. And quite frankly, the power management IP that we bring forth today could be a real driver for us into 2013.","David J. Aldrich","And I think, just to add onto that, Alex, it really is, again, part of our diversions -- our diversification strategy. Nokia has been a great customer of ours. They build a lot of phones. And as we see, shares move and the strategy has changed. We just always want to make sure that as we see our OEM share shifts, we're there to address the entire base, and we do a pretty good job with that.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Yes and a follow-up on that, could I ask -- you mentioned Huawei earlier. Are there any other players getting close to that 10% mark? I know HTC has been important to you, Huawei, how are those second tranche customers doing? Anybody knocking on the door at 10%?","Liam K. Griffin","Yes. Huawei and ZTE both -- they're not 10% customers, but I think that they are really the big guns that they are in, in China, of course. And what we like is, unlike some of the challenges that you see with 2G business in open-market China, Huawei and ZTE really have been playing up with 3G and LTE ramps. We also like the infrastructure opportunities there. As you start to see subscribers increase in China, more smartphone adoption, and that's predicated now by our ramp in infrastructure. We play there as well, so that's the story we like.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.","Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up on the either 2011 ac activity that you're seeing. Liam, when we look at applications like notebooks or home routers or dongles for TVs, how should we think about the dollar content for Skyworks in those types of applications?","Liam K. Griffin","Sure, Craig, thanks. Well, we actually are seeing a couple of  things. First of all, on a unit-per-unit basis, the 11ac product is much more complex. You're driving 256K QAM versus 64K. The channel bandwidth virtually doubles versus 11n. So on a part-by-part basis, this is a more complex device, higher ASP, higher value. But now when you bring in MIMO, multiple in\/multiple out, you could take 2, 3 or 4 screens. So you have an individual power increase, and then you have the multiplication factor of MIMO. So this is a substantial TAM pop for us.","Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","And can you put any numbers to that, Liam? Is it from $1 to $2 up to mid-single digits or any further quantification there?","Liam K. Griffin","Yes. I mean, it's certainly a multiple of 2x to 3x what you'd see in 11n.","David J. Aldrich","And in the routers -- in the MIMO routers, the dollars are huge.","Liam K. Griffin","Yes the dollars are huge because that's certainly you want a screen, and you also look at extended range. So we're really pleased by it. And I will say that we've had the benefit of early engagement with the leading chipset provider, and that's put us in a great leadership position.","Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then just related to that business, but at a higher level, for Don perhaps, as you look at the deals that you've done, how do you look at the integration progress and any positive or negative surprises now that we've got 2.5 to 3 quarters of SiGe underneath the belt and a fourth quarter of AATI underneath?","Liam K. Griffin","Yes, Craig, this is Liam. With respect to the integration with both of these franchises, we're very pleased with what we've seen. Certainly, SiGe we've had under our wing here for a little more time. And I think what you're seeing now is the benefit of our customer engagements, the Skyworks sales force and the relationships we forged. With AATI, we love the product, we love the technology, and I think you're going to start to see real benefits again as we roll that out to Tier 1 accounts that had not been addressed in the past.","Donald W. Palette","Yes so I think and when you think of it, Craig, it's a timing thing. And as Liam said, SiGe, we've just had to integrate it longer, so we're starting to look [ph] at the benefits curve a little faster. But we fully expect AATI to be there as well. This is just a question of timing, but they're going very, very well. They're very -- going very, very well.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Aalok Shah with D.A. Davidson.","Aalok K. Shah - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. Maybe, Liam, if you could talk about the China market a little bit more in detail. We've been hearing that, of course, the 2G market, there has been a pricing war between all these guys. But trying to get a sense of how you view the 2G market going forward in China. Is that a market you want to continue to play in? And how do you think pricing will look like? Secondly, in terms of 3G, can you give us a sense of how we should think about the 3G market for you guys in China market share-wise and in pricing?","Liam K. Griffin","Sure. Yes, the 2G market in China, as we indicated earlier, it's really a very broad open market portfolio of small OEMs and a number of chipset providers. We have a very good position there. We had been a partner with MediaTek for quite some time. But that portfolio now, in general, as the market is compressed, the ASPs have come in a little bit, and the overall share of China's overall demand is lessened in 2G. Now having said that, we are excited with the 3G ramp. We're starting to see that being led by the 2 main players I mentioned before, Huawei and ZTE. We have a very good position there. They tend to use chipset and baseband providers that we know well. Very often, we lead with a reference design. And those accounts are also more willing to leverage the complexity and the value and add additional components, ASMs, et cetera.","David J. Aldrich","And I'd add to that, that we have -- we've established a product lineup, everything from CMOS devices, an acquisition we did a couple of years ago with ultra low-cost, and it's very high-performance, very low-cost HPT devices for the next tier of that 2G market. And so the way we think about this is, while the ASP pressure has been felt in that part of the market, we are convinced that we have by far the lowest cost structure, we have the scale, and we've got the right -- and positioned on the right reference design. So for us, it's points of market share, and we leveraged that volume to continue to drive down the cost curve in our factories and drive our utilization higher. So we like that business, but we're careful with it to make sure that it continues to have a positive contribution and that we maintain our overall worldwide market share because that's very important to us.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Can you give us -- I want -- Dave, I want to go back into your comments about TAM. Just started going through the 3, 4 opportunities that you see ahead for yourself. And you've talked about, if I'm not mistaken, the opportunity in your core cellular business of 15% CAGR. Correct me if I'm wrong.","David J. Aldrich","Yes, no, you're right. You're right, Ittai.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","If we layer that in, and assuming that we add the other things that you've talked about, which are the antenna switch modules, GPS LNAs, displays, power, and also the 802.11, like the high-margin markets that you've talked about, is that the assumption we need to take, that your business starting 2013 and thereafter will grow north than 15%? Is that the conclusion here?","David J. Aldrich","Well, I'll say it a little bit differently. The market is going to grow for the core RF TAM by more than 15%, and as you know, we've been very clear that we intend to gain share. And so, that 15%, by the way, is looking at the -- looking at multiple bands of amplification, it's looking at the complicated switching and conditioning and filtering that occurs, that needs to occur, and fortunately, for us, all that complexity is creating real problems with size, with shielding, with interference. And so we've spent a great deal of time and effort working with our customers to solve those problems for them. And as a result, we were able to, not only take points in share, but really work through a real issue that they have right now which is hitting the current consumption battery talk time with all of this -- as they try to add more functionality into these devices. And so it's really a great time for us.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","So in short, is that a yes?","David J. Aldrich","Yes.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And, Don, it's been a while since you've kind of -- you've gone through the 2 acquisitions in the last couple of quarters. Clearly, you've been working internally to strengthen those out, as they say. But can you give us a little bit more color now, and have you given some thought on how do you think then longer-term your margin profile needs to look like? And now with the addition of these 2 businesses, what are sort of like the margin profile we need to think about, let's say, 24 months out, that is something aspirational?","Donald W. Palette","Well, clearly that there's been no change in our aspiration to have a 30% operating model. That's still where we're focused. And the best way for you is to step back and look at our businesses. We're still -- and we've talked about this a lot, we're still dropping through our incremental revenue on a gross margin line 48% to 50%. So you start with that. Okay, we are going to be making some targeted investments in OpEx in future opportunities. You see that in our Q3 guidance. Those aren't going to be material, but there will be something there. So you're still going to see leverage. And as you layer in this revenue and drop it to the 50%, you get a real good feel as to when that 30% target is doable. That is really, Ittai, the best way to do it. But that goal is clearly in front of us. We're going to continue to expand product margins, and there's a tremendous amount of leverage in the business. There is no doubt in the short term that the acquisitions have stalled that a little bit because as we -- we're synergizing them and incorporating them into the business, they've had a little bit of a diluting impact on the incremental returns. But we're going to go through that, and as the revenue ramps, you're going to see the leverage in the model. That's for you to do that, just to run those scenarios and you see it.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","A couple of questions, if I could. First off, on the high-efficiency PA, SkyHi, you're one of the very few people that -- companies that have this. Who else are you seeing when you compete for these sockets? Can you give me a rundown of maybe who else you think your competition is on that? And then, Don, the linear business seems to be doing particularly well. Any color on what your aspirations are for growth in the next quarter, and maybe for the full year? But you've added a couple of new companies. That's giving you a lot more traction. I know part of the rationale for that was to port their products into your much larger client base. How is that going, and what can we expect for growth on it? And then I have a couple of questions on pricing.","David J. Aldrich","Okay. Ed, the SkyHi PA, as you said, that's a product line that's really tailored to our ultrahigh-efficiency amplifiers, LTE bands and the like, and the difference in our model over the last couple of years is we see different competitors when we sell PADs, when we sell discretes, multi-mode devices, ASMs, we tend to see a different customer set. To answer your direct question about SkyHi, we'd probably RFMD more than anybody else today.","Liam K. Griffin","Sure. And Ed, with respect to high-performance analog, we certainly expect to be at least growing as fast as our mobile business. But by benefit of some of the new product categories we have and design win traction that we're pursuing right now, we hope to do even better than that getting into 2013.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Cody Acree with Williams Financial.","Cody G. Acree - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","Maybe you can go back to the dollar content question, I think, was asked earlier, and look at it on an incremental PAs as we kind of grow band into 3G and 4G, and then also as you're layering in things like the antenna switch modules and the power management, can you talk about maybe the percentage growth that you expect over the years or just dollar content growth as you get into these new markets that -- and how those might offset just typical ASP decline?","David J. Aldrich","Well, I think that's -- Cody, maybe I misunderstand the question. I think that's the 15% answer. What we -- the way we get to 15% is we increase the number of bands the way we think the market will morph over years. We've -- typically, we take the 2G market, which, of course, has the lowest ASP, and that is now in decline, a fairly rapid decline as a matter of fact. It's not going to go away, but it's in decline. And then we look at the mix of high-end, mid-tier and low-end smartphones, those that may be addressing local or regional content, and therefore, have fewer bands. And when we do that, and then factor in ASP on a phone-to-phone basis over time, we think that 15% for the next few years is a good number. In fact, we've come at that in many ways, we'd seem to come to that -- close to that answer, cut lots of different ways. And then of course, the other products we're talking about that we didn't previously address, that expands beyond that. So -- and you're going to begin to see in 2012, as you look at teardown reports and so on, you're going to start to see it -- lots of examples of Skyworks having a front-end, having a PAD, having filter and PA technology, ASMs, GPS products, multiple modes of WiFi, and you're going to see that being not an atypical lineup for Skyworks in teardown reports.","Cody G. Acree - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","But some of these markets are relatively new for you, so would you expect that wowed [ph] maybe 15% CAGR over a longer term that you actually have an acceleration of that growth in the shorter term as you start to get into some of these new markets?","David J. Aldrich","That's absolutely the intent.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Matt Thornton with Avian Securities.","Matthew Thornton - Avian Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you guys break out, I guess, in the March quarter, 2G versus 3G? And then as we look out too to the June quarter and beyond, if I kind of understood you correctly on some prior comments, should we continue to think about 2G as in continuous decline here, and then the HPA piece, then the 3G, 4G piece kind of growing in step with one another over time here? Is that a fair way to look at that?","Donald W. Palette","Matt, I'll just give you the statistics real quick. The 2G was roughly 25%, and EDGE, WEDGE, with WCDMA was roughly 75% for the quarter.","David J. Aldrich","And I think the answer to the second part of the question is yes. You should see 3G and 4G continuing to displace and become a bigger percentage of our business, as it will become a bigger percentage of the market as well.","Matthew Thornton - Avian Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got you. And then one follow-on, if I could, on the next-gen Samsung Galaxy products, it sounds like -- I think I probably lost count, but there's at least 5 sockets that you rattled off there. Do you care to throw a content -- a dollar number around that? And would that be the global variant? Or is that a CDMA-only variant or any color you have there?","David J. Aldrich","It would be the global variant. And I really rather not get into the specific dollar content. That's a little proprietary. And our customer probably wouldn't appreciate that. But it is high, and I think you're doing the part count right.","Liam K. Griffin","Yes, I mean, it's one that's -- one real good case study of about seeing that diversification. You see our product in their traditional product. You see switch product, wireless LAN, GPS, and even some other technologies, so I think it's a great example of what we're capable of doing now at this full suite in technology.","David J. Aldrich","It's also -- I'll add on to what Liam said. It is also a case, if you look at a lot of products, we've talked over time about their being discrete, high-dollar content, high-performance and then much more highly integrated, and even those sockets where the amplifiers themselves are highly integrated, there's a lot of opportunities. So I think it kind of -- it reverses this notion that when you put lots of bands in a multi-mode device, all of a sudden you TAM-drops it. That's really not the case. We're not seeing that.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Dale Pfau with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Dale Pfau - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Let's talk about your antenna switch modules. As I look at the competitive landscape out there, that seems to be one of the areas where you're really beginning to differentiate yourself from -- there's always been only a handful of guys really good in switches. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing there in the competitive landscape? How many people there that might really be able to address some of these multi-throw switches and even the multi-throw that we're going to see in wireless LAN? And then how fast do you think that TAM could actually grow? I think that could grow much faster than your 15% CAGR?","Liam K. Griffin","Sure, Dale. Yes, I mean, so a couple of things. As you know, Skyworks has been a major, major supplier of switch for many years. I mean, we ship over 0.5 billion devices here, primarily out of Woburn. So we understand that business, but what's been great is, as you move into these multiband phones, you always need to be switching among bands, right? So you need to basically be communicating across bands, you need isolation, you need low insertion loss, and we've been masters of that for quite a while. The beauty now is that the throws are going up. The number of bands that we need to interact with are going up substantially. And our technology and our IP and our R&D team here is well-equipped to do that. We also have the unique advantage of working very closely with the RF amplifier team at Skyworks, so we can build solutions that work in concert. So with having said all that, we're seeing an opportunity now in some of these handsets where the ASM value could be over $1, in some cases $2 dollars, and we're starting to enjoy our first taste of those design wins in the second half of this year.","David J. Aldrich","And, Dale, one of the reasons why we steered away from that market in the past is why we did a lot of switches, mode switches, TR switches and the like. And as the antenna switch module in a simple dual-band phone, for example, it's more about the filter device, and the switching was done in pin diodes, and it really wasn't that complex. The ASPs were low. What's happening with the complexity is it can no longer be done with a pin diode matrix on a hunk of LTCC and some ceramic. It is really now requiring some pretty sophisticated signal processing and multi-throw switches. We do a lot of that SOI, for example. We don't need to do that in gallium arsenide, where we can integrate some logic and functionality. And so it's now become semiconductor-heavy, so it plays into Skyworks' strength.","Dale Pfau - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","And to my question there, is the TAM on that growing at faster than a 15% CAGR?","David J. Aldrich","For us, yes. And I think for the market as well because of the complexity.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jonathan Goldberg with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Goldberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So I wanted to just dig a little bit more in something you said in your opening remarks about your platform wins, the Huawei and the Samsung Galaxy 3 and the HTC 1. Could you just talk a little bit more about which products you're selling into those? Because those are 3 sort of -- aside from Apple, those are probably the 3 leading smartphone platforms out there. I want to get a better sense of what your content there is -- sort of looks like?","David J. Aldrich","It's a little different curve, but it is -- in all cases, it's fairly broad. It has amplifications, so transmit amplification. And in some cases, it's more functionality, where we're sweeping in things like ASMs. So amplifiers in all cases, but ASMs, GPS LNAs, WiFi devices, and I think maybe WiFI [indiscernible].","Liam K. Griffin","And some power management. And I think in some cases, Jay, we have some really customized multi-mode, multi-band engines in our apps, so we noted those as kind of marquee wins that reflected the customer but also some of the newer technology that we're releasing.","Jonathan Goldberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Those are substantive, meaningful dollar contents in each -- in all of those?","David J. Aldrich","In each case, yes.","Liam K. Griffin","Yes, each case.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jaeson Schmidt with Craig-Hallum.","Jaeson Schmidt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Just 2 quick questions for me. Don, what's your backlog coverage to your guide? And then just wanted to get your thoughts on channel inventory.","Donald W. Palette","Yes, our backlog coverage, as we do typically when we provide an outlook, is we're pretty much 100% booked at this point in time, and that's a combination of hard purchase orders and also the humbles [ph]. It's a combination of both forecasts that get us to that level.","Jaeson Schmidt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","And then just kind of your thoughts on current channel inventory?","David J. Aldrich","I think current channel inventory is normal. I don't see any areas where there is excess inventory. So I think it's pretty normal for this time in year.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Sujee De Silva with ThinkEquity.","Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","In terms of -- just under a year ago, you guys pulled up 2 big acquisitions. I want to understand today, sitting here, maybe the conditions that are different in terms of thinking about more acquisitions, or whether there are any holes you still need to plug to do more acquisitions?","David J. Aldrich","Well, our strategy has been pretty clear. We look for acquisitions that are very quickly or immediately accretive, and that have an opportunity for us to add a platform that we can grow from. So this on bolt-on, wedge fillers, we're really looking for growth engines and -- so we don't see any technological -- technology gaps per se today, at least not major ones. So you have -- but you have to think of us looking at it that way. We opportunistically look for a cultural fit, something that we could integrate very quickly, and something that would be immediately accretive.","Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then a follow-up to the Samsung Galaxy 3 questions. Across the variant around world, are you sole source to -- on the PAs for those, or is that shared through the variance?","David J. Aldrich","It's not typically -- we're not sole source on the platform, although on the models, it would be sole source, so the custom per model, but not on the platform. We have company on the platform.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to catch up on the mix in the 3G, what was it? And how did it grow Q-on-Q?","Donald W. Palette","The 3G mix -- well, 2G was 25%. And as I said, our EDGE, WCDMA mix was 75%.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And then what was the -- when you look at this switch side -- switch -- antenna switch module, what was the revenues in the March quarter?","David J. Aldrich","What sort of revenue was this ASM?","Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes.","David J. Aldrich","It was a few million dollars, below $10 million. It's really just beginning. But it ramps pretty -- it ramps solidly in the second half.","Operator","And we'll go next to Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Don, just a quick question. You talked about acceleration in revenue growth based on the new platform ramps. Just wondering if that is a comment you're talking about in calendar year or fiscal year? And then was just wondering, Don, you talked about the -- I'm sorry, Dave, you talked about the customer diversification at prepared comments. Is there a way you can quantify that maybe, say, looking outside of your top customer, what the next, say, numbers 2 to 5, I mean is there some metric you can give us about how you're spreading it out over the customer base?","Donald W. Palette","As far as the growth opportunity, I really -- refers to the fiscal quarters for us through the calendar year as well. We just see what's the design pipeline and the wins that we've had in place earlier in the year. We just see some really nice growth opportunities. For the balance of our fiscal and the calendar year as well.","David J. Aldrich","And I think it's quite -- it's a little tough to answer that question because it really depends upon how the market evolves. In the case of we're about 65% in the mobile space, 35% in our diversified HPA business, and within the high-performance analog. And within that 65%, our goal would to be as diversified as we possibly can be with the products that we address. In which case, a really good strategy would be implemented such that we mirror the customer concentration of the market. And that's as good as we can do it. And we're not exactly there today, but we're pretty close. So when you look at who's beyond the top 2 or 3, it really is a who's who among OEMs. So you'd look at LG, you'd look at ZTE, you'd look at Huawei, Motorola and others, almost stacked as if you would see them in the market.","Liam K. Griffin","Right. And within HPA, you can expand that suite beyond mobile, so you can start looking at gaming opportunities. You can look at the wireless infrastructure space. And there's a lot of things now with our power management suite that we can expand. So you've got customer diversification across the major Tier 1, but there's also a whole another's opportunity base now with newer products coming in through acquisition and organic growth, and also newer verticals that we're penetrating.","Operator","And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to you, Mr. Aldrich, for any additional or closing remarks.","David J. Aldrich","Well, thank you for participating on today's call, and we look forward to seeing all of you in upcoming conferences.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference.

This call is being recorded.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Mitch Haws, Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Haws, please go ahead.","Mitch Haws","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Skyworks' third fiscal quarter 2019 conference call. With me today are Liam Griffin, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kris Sennesael, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our discussion today will include statements relating to future results and expectations that are or may be considered forward-looking. Please refer to our earnings press release and recent SEC filings, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for information on certain risks that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially and adversely from any forward-looking statements made today.","Additionally, the results and guidance we will discuss include non-GAAP financial measures consistent with our past practice. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.","With that, I'll turn the call to Liam.","Liam Griffin","Thanks Mitch, and welcome everyone. Skyworks delivered solid financial results in Q3, as the resiliency of our business model allowed us to maintain strong profitability and cash flow. Looking at the quarter in more detail, we reported revenue of $767 million, slightly above our guidance, drove gross margin of 50.4%, and operating margin of 33%, while delivering earnings per share of $1.35. And our cash generation continues to be strong, with operating cash flow of $950 million year-to-date.","Looking forward, our design win pipeline is expanding as we capitalize on the ramp of 5G in wireless infrastructure, smartphones, and across IoT. For example, in wireless infrastructure, Skyworks is now supporting a number of global 5G deployments. Our solutions address both 5G macro base stations and small cell radios, and we are ramping today with leading European and Japanese infrastructure OEMs.","In addition, Skyworks is enabling 5G massive MIMO base stations for a leading Korean customer. Across the IoT space, we are gaining share in new emerging categories with recent wins at Facebook for their Oculus VR headset, and with Vizio for their sound bars, leveraging our analog SOCs and cognitive wireless radios. We also secured low power LTE CAT M design wins with the leading module providers, including Telit, Gemalto, U-Blox, and Sierra Wireless. And we are expanding our reach in the wearables market where we are populating devices that combine our cellular and Wi-Fi technology.","We've also extended our Wi-Fi leadership with several signature design wins in the last quarter, including Cisco with their WiFi 6 solutions, DirecTV for their over the top streaming devices, as well as design wins with industry leaders such as Amazon, Nest, and Netgear.","Finally, in mobile, for the coming wave of 5G phones, we've deepened our engagements with key customers, leveraging our unique suite of solutions to support launches at Samsung, LG, Oppo, Vivo, and others. As these opportunities demonstrate the demand for advanced connectivity and the expansive nature of 5G are creating real time opportunities for Skyworks. With 5G now launched on four continents, operators are seeing the compelling economics that 5G services can bring, and we expect momentum to continue building into 2020 and beyond.","To be clear, 5G is a technology and not a product. And we expect the performance gains in speed, latency, and network capacity to spawn a much broader ecosystem where 5G becomes the universal connector. With the application scope going far beyond the smartphone, 5G is already driving new usage cases in emerging areas like industrial IoT, autonomous transport, smart cities, and digital health. For Skyworks, this is a tremendous opportunity as our scale and experience across multiple technology generations position us to lead as 5G becomes a reality.","Our capital investments have enabled us to build highly specialized and vertically integrated supply chain capable of meeting the complex demands of the world's most innovative customers. We continue to advance our filter capabilities, creating leadership positions in SAW and TC-SAW, and in Q3, we commenced volume production of BAW-enabled devices. These devices will be shipping this quarter. Incorporating BAW expands our TAM in mobile and positions us to support a wider array of customers, markets, and applications.","And in addition to 5G, our capabilities in broad markets have grown as we now serve an expanded set of global customers, including companies like Ford, Continental, LG, along with factory automation leaders such as Bosch, Honeywell, Siemens, and GE. Today, we generate nearly $1.1 billion in annual revenues from our broad market portfolio. That's a compound growth rate of 16% since 2013.","So in summary, Skyworks is at the forefront of ubiquitous connectivity, leveraging our decades of experience, world-class scale, and customer relationships. We are well positioned to continue executing on our vision of connecting everyone and everything all the time.","With that, I will turn the call over to Kris for a discussion of last quarter\u2019s performance and our outlook for Q4.","Kris Sennesael","Thanks, Liam. Skyworks' revenue for the third fiscal quarter of 2019 was $767 million, that is $2 million above the midpoint of our June 4 updated guidance. Our third quarter revenue reflects the impact of the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Securities of the U.S. Department of Commerce, placing Huawei Technologies and certain of its affiliates on the entity list. Skyworks ceased all shipments to Huawei as of the date Huawei was added to the entity list.","After an in-depth review of the export administration regulations and the scope of the entity list restrictions, we ultimately determine that we could lawfully resume shipping certain products, which we did start in early July. However, we expect the business with Huawei to remain well below historical levels into the current quarter.","Third fiscal quarter non-GAAP gross profit was $386 million resulting in a non-GAAP gross margin of 50.4%. As noted in the financial statements attached to our earnings release, we incurred a GAAP only nonrecurring charge of $67 million, primarily consisting of inventory related write-downs due to the addition of Huawei to the BIS entity list. ","Operating expenses were $134 million better than our guidance and down slightly sequentially, as we continue to effectively manage our operating expenses. We generated $252 million of operating income, translating into an operating margin of 33%. Third quarter effective tax rate was 8.2%. This drove net income of $234 million or $1.35 of diluted earnings per share.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, third fiscal quarter cash flow from operations was $209 million, and for the first nine months of fiscal year operating cash flow was $950 million. Third fiscal quarter capital expenditures were $88 million, we distributed $66 million in dividends and repurchased 1.2 million shares of our common stock for a total of $86 million. ","During the first nine months of the fiscal year, we have returned approximately $710 million to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends, and this represents 112% of the free cash flow we\u2019ve generated this year. We ended the quarter with the cash and investment balance of just under $1 billion with no debt.","Now looking ahead to fiscal Q4, we are on track to deliver sequential revenue and earnings growth in the September quarter as we execute on strategic product ramps. Specifically, we anticipate revenue in the range of $815 million to $835 million or $825 million at the midpoint. The revenue outlook assumes Huawei revenue remains at nominal levels given the uncertainty associated with ongoing trade related issues. ","At the midpoint of the range, revenue is expected to increase 8% sequentially despite significantly lower revenue to Huawei compared to the June quarter. Excluding Huawei in the June and September quarters, we expect our revenue to increase 20% sequentially, reflecting strong seasonal ramps at our large customers as we demonstrate our expanding reach and ability to deliver complex and highly integrated solutions.","We expect gross margin in the range of 50% to 50.5%, approximately flat compared to the June quarter, despite the lower factory utilization associated with the reduced demand from Huawei. We expect opening expenses of approximately $135 million, as we continue to adjust our spending levels. Below the line, we anticipate roughly $3.5 million in other income and an effective tax rate of approximately 8.5%. We expect our diluted share count to be 172.5 million shares. At the midpoint of $825 million in revenue we plan to deliver diluted earnings per share of $1.50.","Finally, today we also announced a 16% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.44 per share, reflecting our confidence in Skyworks business model and sustainable cash generation capabilities.","And with that, let me turn the call back to Liam.","Liam Griffin","Thanks, Chris. As a proven technology leader, we are leveraging our Sky5 platforms and systems expertise to enable the billions of connections between devices and the cloud, providing the underlying foundation for an entirely new ecosystem in today's connected world. Looking forward, Skyworks is uniquely positioned with established leadership and growing markets and expansive and innovative set of 5G solutions, global scale and the deep customer relationships that are facilitating the mobile economy of tomorrow. ","That concludes our prepared remarks, operator let's open the line for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] You have a question from line of Vivek Arya. Please go ahead.","Vivek Arya","Thank you for taking my question. I actually had two of them, if I could. First, Liam I'm curious, how do you expect your largest customer to do in September, both on a sequential and on a year-on-year basis? I realized everyone in the industry is conservative on units, but I was hoping you could give us your insights on content growth that can perhaps help offset some of that unit conservatism. So to whatever extent you can if you could help us give us some color on sequential and year-on-year growth at your largest customer?","Liam Griffin","Sure. Well, I mean, it certainly comes down to units, but I will say that the Skyworks team continues to work with all the most significant flagship phones and customers, and we continue to do that this year. And a number of very exciting design wins have been consummated with leading customers, we're really proud of what we've done. We're continuing to expand the scope and the reach of the device count, and the complexity of what we offer.","So, we really can't predict how the unit curve will look, but I can tell you that our ability to grow and gain content, especially in highly complex, high margin areas is something that we\u2019ll demonstrate and we will be very proud to show.","Vivek Arya","And as a follow-up, Liam, as you start fiscal 2020, I realized that last year was a tough year for the industry with all the weakness in premium units and then the Huawei ban. But as you start fiscal 2020, how should we just conceptually think about growth, there's definitely benefits from the onset of 5G, but how material can it be? And if you could just give us an overall look at how you are looking at Skyworks\u2019 overall growth prospects for fiscal 2020? Thank you.","Liam Griffin","Yes, I think 2019 as you mentioned has been a difficult year for a number of reasons. There was some volatility early in our fiscal year that was kind of a macro issue. And then we've had the effects of this Huawei ban, which has been pretty significant but we\u2019ll manage. But I do think there's tremendous momentum and excitement around mobile today and around 5G at a higher level.","So we're starting to see the rollouts on the infrastructure side, we talked about that in prepared remarks. We're certainly working with all the customers that matter in helping them develop 5G capabilities in their smartphone devices, and we expect this to be an incredible catalyst for the industry. ","As I said in the prepared remarks, 5G is really a universal connector. It is a technology, it's not a product, it will populate multi-market opportunities for us. We have great, great solutions to make that happen. So, we're really excited about 2020 and beyond. We also feel good in the near-term right now. We just guided a 20% sequential quarter if we net out the effects of Huawei, which we really can't control today. As we look into our Q1, the December quarter, we see sequential growth coming again. So we feel bullish about that and the prospects of 5G ahead.","Operator","Next question comes from line of Craig Ellis with Riley FBR. Please go ahead.","Craig Ellis","Yes, that's B. Riley FBR. Thanks for taking the question guys. Liam, let me just follow-up on the last comment. As we look at the December quarter, how should we think about normal seasonality for that business and is the profile that you see right now, one quarter out trending favorable versus that seasonality or to macro cross currents that probably [ph] mean that you would expect to be below normal seasonality?","Liam Griffin","Well, I think we will be able to deliver a solid seasonal ramp, Craig, coming into our Q1 here in the back half of the calendar year. And again, it is a number of customers involved here, not just one, but we feel good about the outlook during that time frame. We have very good visibility, by the way, with respect to that timing. And we also have very good visibility on what we've consummated from a design perspective in the devices that we put forth in leading smart phones. So we feel good about coming through.","And then the balance of the year, we'll see how things go. I think broad markets continues to be a strategic vector for us. And despite some of the challenges that we're enduring right now, with Huawei, we think a lot of that demand and time is going to get redistributed and we'll be able to take advantage of that.","Craig Ellis","Okay. And then for the follow-up, let me just get to really clarification cleanups for Kris. Kris can you give us the segment splits and then just on the inventory, days moved up pretty materially on hand was up about 5% despite the write-down. So, how should we think about the company's ability to work down inventory and get it back into a normal level? Thanks guys.","Kris Sennesael","Yes, let me first give you the splits. So broad markets in Q3 was 37% of total revenue, which was up low-single digits sequentially as well as year-over-year. And you have to, of course, keep in mind that in broad markets, business was also impacted by the Huawei ban, some of the Huawei revenue is accounted for in broad markets, the infrastructure part, as well as some non-mobile wireless connectivity solutions that we provide to Huawei.","Again, broad markets, it\u2019s running at more than $1.1 billion in annualized revenue. And I think, Liam talked in the prepared remarks about a lot of the strength that we see in that market segment with the launch of WiFi 6, some of the wearable products, automotive, and IoT in general. And so, broad market was 37%, on the flip side mobile was 63%, which was down approximately 10% sequentially and our slowest seasonal quarter of the year. And of course, that segment was impacted even more by the Huawei shipment ban. So that's the split.","And then maybe on inventory. Inventory in the June quarter, which again is our slowest seasonal quarter of the year, was up $25 million, days of inventory were up 13 days to 139 days. And so, during our seasonal slowest quarter of the year here, we definitely have been level loading our factories in order to drive efficient usage of our capital equipment. And all of it of course in support of the new product ramps that we have with our key customers and where we talked about it, we see a 20% sequential growth into the September quarter, excluding Huawei and then even further growth into the December quarter.","And so, we -- in the September and December quarter, we do expect the days of inventory to come down as we will consume some of that inventory. And going forward, I do expect inventory to fluctuate between 110 days to 140 days, depending on where we are in the seasonal cycle. And so that is slightly higher than historical levels. But you have to keep in mind that what was a four or five years ago, none of the filters we were making in house. We were all purchase them from third parties and maybe two years ago, we got to roughly 50% of the filters in house. By now, we are getting close to 95% of the filters in house.","And so that's obviously is driving some higher levels of inventory. But again inventory is fully in line with what we expected and days of inventory will come down in the September and December quarter.","Operator","Next question comes from line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes, thank you. Liam, as we think about 5G from a design perspective, any color in terms of the traction you're seeing on the smartphone side? And then also just a rough estimate of how that's playing out in dollar content and the initial wave?","Liam Griffin","Sure, Craig, absolutely. Well, we see an expanding opportunity in 5G in a number of areas, there's just a great deal of complexity that needs to be resolved in the system. Our customers are looking for integration and kind of cohesive solution. So platforms like Sky5 that we developed are perfect solutions for these customers they are configurable, we can resolve a lot of that complexity. And we also have to deal with the challenge of backward compatibility into 4G and 3G.","So if you look at a 5G enabled phone, you're going to have 5G bands and 5G technology, but you're also going to need to be interoperable with 4G and 3G. There's a physical device -- there is a physical challenge in the design of the phones, there's a battle for current consumption and coexistence within the device, a lot of complexity that we're working on today with our customers. We're lining up with the critical base band providers as well. So our solutions can be somewhat agnostic around the baseband ecosystem. ","And adding some of the technologies that we've developed in house, the DRX technologies will be even more vital in 5G. We've got ultra-high band devices that we're shipping, we've got BAW technology that we just commenced shipping now that we spoke about. So we're in very good position. But I will tell you that 5G is difficult, it's challenging and our customers are reaching out the partners that they trust and partners that have been here. And that's what we want to be one of those partners that help our customers be successful.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. And then just in the follow-up update on Avnera. I know when you bought them, I mean, in terms of the context of Skyworks having a much larger platform, bigger customers. How you think that pay through in terms of design work that they're doing? Are you able to leverage that in terms of some of the momentum for new designs at Avnera?","Liam Griffin","Sure, Craig, that's a great question. And that portfolio is doing very well for us. So one of the designs that we mentioned in the opening remarks was powered by Avnera, they've got some very slick SOC technology that we're leveraging, certainly some great performance in audio. But overall, right now, we're very pleased with what we've seen from that acquisition. It's fully integrated with Skyworks. So we're able to take advantage of a larger sales and marketing organization and a little more strength on the operational side, but so far, it's looking very good. Appreciate that.","Operator","The next question comes from line of Chris Caso with Raymond James. Please go ahead. ","Chris Caso","Yes, thank you. Good evening. Just a question on Huawei and just trying to get a little more color on what you had said from the pre-announcement earlier in the quarter, it seems that you took out about $60 million out of what you said was a 12% customer in the quarter, which would kind of work out to maybe sort of $40 million of remaining shipments to Huawei in the June quarter. I guess, were to understand that that those shipments are minimal as you go into the September quarter and therefore, that's the sequential headwind that you're facing.","And then maybe to follow on that, others, it seems like every company has had some difference in terms of what they can and can't ship to Huawei. Some folks are also applying for some licenses for additional shipments. Just some more color on what you can and can't ship and the potential for being able to ship more?","Kris Sennesael","Yes, Chris. So maybe I'll provide some more color on Huawei. So in Q3, Huawei's revenue was slightly above 10% of the total revenue and that was all shipped prior to the ban being effective. We didn't ship after the ban was effective. And as you know, we did adjust our guidance, and we took out roughly $60 million of revenue when we updated the guidance. So definitely in Q3, it's the stronger seasonal quarter, typically for Huawei. And so we did expect actually more revenue than what we've seen in the first half of the fiscal year.","And so looking forward to Q4, we do expect very minimal revenue with them. We are -- we can legally ship certain products, but the demand signal that we get from Huawei is actually very low. We expect revenue to be probably below $10 million in Q4. And I mean Liam you want to add something? ","Liam Griffin ","Yes, I mean, just to be clear. So, Chris, I mean, when the ban came out, we stopped shipping immediately and we did not ship again, for the balance of Q3. As we entered Q4, doing a little homework with our legal team reaching out to SIA and some other associations to get guidance we felt comfortable with certain products being shipped and we've been commencing shipments, but it's been at a very low level. ","So that's kind of the difference between what we've done. I know other competitors may have played it differently, but that's how we played it. We still feel very good about the business we have today net of Huawei. If Huawei comes back, that's great. But the guidance that we provided with a 20% sequential netting out Huawei in Q3, Q4, I think says a lot about the organic business and our read into what we can do.","Chris Caso","All right, that's very helpful color. Thank you for that. Just as a follow-up, what are the longer term implications here? And I guess for one, do you feel like as 5G comes out next year, you'll be able to ship components to Huawei 5G phones under the current rules. And if there are still restrictions, we've been hearing for some time that the highly integrated solutions by yourselves and other U.S. manufacturers really necessary to enable 5G phones. Are there alternatives, in other words are there potential for it, if this situation doesn't get resolved, some of these opportunities will just disappear for the long-term?","Liam Griffin","Yes, that's a great question. The way I look at it is, and you're right, I mean, the technologies that we provide, and I know you understand it\u2019s very, very complex. We're not a discrete component player. We haven't been that company for years. So the kind of things that we offer to companies like Huawei are very, very complex and very hard to displace.","Having said all that, I don't think this is going to stop 5G, I think there could be certainly some challenges in China, specifically around 5G and access to technologies. But I think from a global perspective, the power of the 5G catalyst here, and the investments and the opportunities for connectivity are just so powerful that that's going to continue. Could there be a bit of a pause, levered with the China issue? Sure, but I don't think it's going to stop the industry globally, from executing on this vision of moving up into 5G and the latency and speed and benefits that it provide. So -- and we'll stay with that. ","And the other thing here is, the demand can move around. If some companies or regions are impaired, yes, it'll hurt in the short-term. But overall, I think that that revenue and that opportunity can get redistributed. And we'll be right there for that as well.","Operator","Next question comes from a line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead. ","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, guys, this is Tom Elion [ph] for Blayne Curtis. My first one is around the China handset business outside of Huawei. Some of the industry through this earnings period have talked about how Huawei is looking internally in China, and maybe taking some share there and that could affect you guys. How do you guys view that market right now? And are you seeing that trend play out where, other Tier 1 players in Tier 2 players are exceeding some market share? ","Liam Griffin","Yes, that's a great question. We've had we had a good position with Huawei, but we've also had a very strong position with Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi, and so far the business there has been -- it's been promising and been kind of on track, still developing some interesting new solutions for those customers as well. And, we've been able to build those partnerships over a year. So that part of the China ecosystem at this point looks pretty good. ","Unidentified Analyst","Great. And then my second one is more maintenance. Can you guys give us the percentage of your largest customer in June? You guys have been pretty helpful about that in the past.","Kris Sennesael","Yes. So in June, the largest customer was well over 40% of total revenue. Again, the June quarter is somewhat of the slower seasonal quarter there. And as we ramp with the large customer in Q4, obviously, that that will go up.","Liam Griffin","Yes, and obviously with some of the Huawei revenue out of the pie, the ratios get skewed a little bit as well, Tom.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen. Please go ahead. ","Karl Ackerman","Good afternoon, gentlemen. If I may, I'd like to follow back up on the previous question. So your China based smartphone customer is seeing very strong domestic growth through the June quarter, given nationalistic support? So I'm curious, does your outlook for the September quarter and beyond contemplate ramifications of that proceed nationalism to your mobile opportunity at other smartphone OEMs where you have higher content? Then I have a follow-up.","Liam Griffin","Yes, to the extent that we can, yes, we feel we've talked about some of the other players in China and demand network there look steady. We talked about Huawei and the issues that we have right here, and that could get resolved. And if it gets resolved, we're right back in. But we're still very aggressive and gaining success and design wins globally across the board. The only exception right now is the Huawei situation where we're kind of stuck. But beyond that we're active. We're developing solutions, we're gaining design wins.","And as we mentioned in some of the prior questions, the products that we make are not commodities, they're not interchangeable, they're very complex custom commodities or custom devices that are necessary for 5G and even higher end 4G networks.","Karl Ackerman","That's helpful. As my follow-up in your prepared comments, you discussed early shipments of 11AX products. What's your view on the competitive landscape on 11AX given recent M&A in the space? And how do you see the adoption of 11AX within enterprise access points and consumer applications over the next few quarters? Thank you.","Liam Griffin","Sure. Well, 11AX right now is probably it's an early stage, but it's definitely the technology that you want to be in for WiFi for higher speed WiFi. So the 11AX engines that we have today are doing quite well, we named some of the design wins that we had Cisco is one for example. And what we do is we have great partnerships with some of the SoC players. So we're able to basically calibrate our solutions with the SoC providers and together kind of take advantage of the overall market and lever leverage those solutions broadly with SoC partnerships similar to what we do with base net partnerships.","We also have really good technology and WiFi. We've been a market leader from the beginning in WiFi and have been able to take the solutions up over the last several years. So at the higher and higher performance levels. The customer reach that we mentioned continues to expand and WiFi has been a pretty big catalyst in our broad market portfolio. And that's a portfolio as we mentioned it's been growing at about 15% CAGR.","So there's a lot of strength in that outlook in that portfolio. And we're seeing more and more customers and applications adopt 11AX still early innings for 11AX. But I think, we're very well positioned for that.","Operator","And next question comes from the line of Edward Snyder with Charter Equity. Please go ahead. ","Edward Snyder","Thanks a lot. Liam, just want to talk about 5G. But I'd like to get more specific, especially with regard handsets other than the ultra-high band pad and maybe band 41, at this stage, maybe we could throw in if you want band 71. Other than those three areas, are you seeing any 5G content in phones today, I know it's going to expand, you don't do millimeter wave today, and are you working on that with your largest OEMs? Thanks.","Liam Griffin","Well, there are elements of 5G in certain company launches at this fall, but you're right, I mean, 5G is really going to be more of a 2020, release, I think in the market, there will be some phones that will have some capabilities. But the real upside to 5G is more of a 2020 and beyond opportunity, and we're well positioned for that with our Sky5 platform. We've got a really unique portfolio of devices that can be harmonized and customized depending on the bands, and depending on the carrier, and depending on the needs of the OEM. So I think we look good there.","But you're right, I mean, the 5G opportunity is more of a 2020 play. We are working now on the design wins that will support that 2020 and beyond launch, of course.","Edward Snyder","So -- and then, just to be clear, do you see yourself participate in the millimeter wave set, I know Qualcomm is the only game in town, and that part atrocious in terms of performance wise. And so if you're a large OEM, your largest customers, where they want to feel the phone using that product, they don't want to suffer the battery life problems or the heat problems, we're already seeing now. We're going to have to do something other than CMOS. Are you working on something now and do you think Qualcomm's control of the base band would impede you from winning a slot if you were?","Liam Griffin","Well, I mean, we certainly see millimeter wave as another opportunity in mobile here, as we go to 5G, there's opportunity on the infrastructure side, an opportunity on the handheld side, so we're looking at both. I don't believe we're going to be impeded by any base band, I mean, we've been interoperable across the board here for years and years with all customers, including our largest one. So we\u2019ll ensure that we're able to be flexible there. ","But those technologies, I don't think they're going to be widespread early on, but over time, millimeter wave could be a catalyst in the industry. Again, infrastructure and within the handset and we\u2019ll continue to work on those opportunities. ","Operator","Next question comes from line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. ","Harsh Kumar","Yeah. Hey, guys. First of all, congratulations on commercial BAW shipments, Liam, I had a quick one on that for you. I think your largest customer is widely speculated to have their 5G phone out next year. How would you rate the readiness of your BAW portfolio? And then as a follow-up to that, for example, in like a Sky5 solution that you mentioned in your press release, how much of the BAW is internal versus externally sourced?","Liam Griffin","Yes, so great questions. And I think what you're going to see is kind of a blending in of the technology over time. When you look at Sky5 and the incorporation of BAW, we're going to start to see that really roll up, as we move out. We're delivering solutions now, this quarter that I mentioned. And what you're going to see now is the BAW technology that we're delivering is organic, the technologies that we mentioned in the prepared remarks about shipping this quarter, those are organic solutions, they\u2019re BAW enabled devices in a system level solution of Sky5 level solution. They're not discrete filters, they're integrated with other elements.","And its Skyworks organic stuff, we've been working on this for years. And just to do a quick commercial on our filter business, we're doing 10 billion temperature compensated SAW filters a year, we're doing hundreds of millions of devices in our Mexicali site, we've got a Singapore location, that's also driving some very sophisticated package and test.","So we have all of the critical supply chain elements to make it work. We've been very conservative about talking about BAW. But now we're there and we're delivering and we expect it to be the beginning of some real significant opportunities as 5G moves along and the complexity of mobile phone continues to go up.","Harsh Kumar","Thanks for the color, Liam. And then for my follow-up a West Coast competitor namely Qualcomm effectively talks about there being some kind of a benefit and them having a 5G base band and tying their RF to it. First of all, do you see any validity in that statement? And then secondly, do you run into them as far as design wins or competition is concerned in 5G?","Liam Griffin","Well, we all -- we compete with lots of companies, lots of companies. So -- and we're used to that, and I think it's healthy. And we've done our best to garner the lion share of design win in the areas that we can play. So we're not at all concerned about that that's a normal thing. But I will say that in most cases, we've got very collaborative base man providers that work with us and understand that ultimately, the work that we're doing as semiconductor providers is to try and make our customers products the best. So that's the way we look at it.","So, we're working shoulder to shoulder with bass band partners, endeavoring to produce tremendous phones for our customers and tremendous technology, we're going to continue to do that. And it's made us who we are at Skyworks. There's a lot of really interesting things happening in 5G, a lot of very, very difficult challenges to resolve. We got great people on our side, we got great partnerships with most of the base main players and ecosystems there. And we'll be able to deliver the products that our customers want.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Sean Harrison with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. ","Sean Harrison","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Mainly a focus for Kris here, capital intensity is running about 12% of sales here today. How do you see that tracking in the fourth quarter and then in the next year, considering all the 5G launches that will be coming up?","Kris Sennesael","Yes, you're right. So campuses running in the 12% range to revenue right now and of course, we will have to take into account reduced demand signal from Huawei as we look at factory utilizations and CapEx into that. Now on the flip side, of course, we will continue to make the necessary investments to advance the technology, and to increase our capabilities in part in our back end operation. But also, as Liam just talked about, especially in our filter operation, not necessarily expanding capacity, but upgrading and making our technology more robust in TCSAW. And then of course, as we execute on our BAW ramp, and get more and more BAW integrated products out there, we will have to expand our BAW filter technology and capacity as well.","Going forward, I expect CapEx to maybe trend below 10% of revenue. But there's a lot of elements that play into that.","Sean Harrison","And then second as a follow up, I think you mentioned there's some under the underutilization drag because of the Huawei weakness. I was hoping you could maybe qualify what the impact is at least here in the near-term from that drag on gross margin?","Kris Sennesael","Yes, so gross margin in Q3 came in as 15.4%, and we guided Q4 now the September quarter to 50% to 50.5%. So flat, maybe slightly down. And so first of all, I think we continue to execute very well on driving higher value added and higher complex products into the market. And that typically translates into higher gross margin. And we continue to execute really well on cost reductions and operational efficiencies as well. And we do have a little bit of a mixed benefit.","Having said that the addition of Huawei to the entity list and a strongly reduced demand signal from Huawei is becoming somewhat of a headwind for gross margins and gross margin expansion. Just I mean, Huawei was running on about 15% of total revenue. And most of that product was running to our fabs. ","The front end fabs, the back ends fabs and some of our filter fabs as well. And so, that underutilization is becoming a little bit of a headwind, we of course, will see how the whole Huawei situation plays out and what the future demand will be. And of course, we will not hesitate in the near-term to take the necessary actions to take out as much cost as we can.","Having said that, of course, I mean, we continue to produce very strong operating margins well above 30% and very strong EBITDA margins on or about 45%. And that will definitely remain one of our main focus items.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call over back to Mr. Griffin for any closing comments. Please go ahead.","Liam Griffin","Thank you, and thank you all for participating on today's call. We look forward to seeing you and upcoming investor conferences and other events during the quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call.

This call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Mitch Haws, Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Haws, please go ahead.","Mitch Haws","Thank you, Carrie. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Skyworks' second fiscal quarter 2019 conference call. With me on the call today are Liam Griffin, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kris Sennesael, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our discussion will include statements relating to future results and expectations that are or may be considered forward-looking. Please refer to our earnings press release and recent SEC filings, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for information on certain risks that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially and adversely from any forward-looking statements made today.","Additionally, the results and guidance that we will discuss include non-GAAP financial measures consistent with our prior practice. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Liam.","Liam Griffin","Thanks, Mitch and welcome everyone. Skyworks delivered another quarter of solid financial performance leveraging the strength of our business model and momentum across our high growth broad markets and IoT portfolio. Specifically, in Q2, we generated a revenue of $810 million, drove gross margin of 50.7% and operating margin of 34.1% while posting an earnings per share of $1.47.","Our March quarter results were impacted by unit weakness in mobile, particularly across China. In contrast, our broad markets business continues to outperform and is on path for double-digit growth again in fiscal \u201919.","During the quarter, our design win execution accelerated, building a growing pipeline of new opportunities while positioning us for continued traction across a diverse set of end markets, applications, and customers.","For example, in the quarter, we led the transition to the latest WiFi 6 standard with platform wins at Aruba, Asus, Cisco, and Netgear. We gained content with our SkyOne platform and DRx engines in Samsung's Galaxy S10 smartphones.","We leveraged our portfolio of audio SOCs supporting high fidelity stereo headsets, premium sound bars, and gaming applications. We enabled long range machine-to-machine communication in smart meters and street lighting. And we captured the first commercially available 5G indoor access point.","We also secured massive MIMO infrastructure wins with Ericsson and Nokia, as they roll out 5G. We expanded our automotive footprint with LTE devices supporting eCall, remote entry, in cabin entertainment, and additional features.","And we extended our reach across new categories in both aerospace and defense, leveraging our c-band filtering solutions. As these achievements demonstrate, Skyworks is capitalizing on powerful macro trends, diversifying across new customers, and segments while advancing our market leadership.","Our solutions empower everything from data center to cloud, media to entertainment, to e-commerce to ride hailing services.","Moving forward, the transformational technology of tomorrow is being built on a new generation of connectivity solutions enabled by the rollout of 5G.","The applications driving this revolutionary change require a step function leap in performance, supporting the continuous interaction between client and cloud, while delivering high speed data, near zero latency, and perfect reliability.","Skyworks\u2019 unique systems expertise, strategic partnerships, and global scale are critical to the success of 5G deployments. Our strengths underpin a broad array of capabilities, including an expanding set of MIMO devices, SkyOne and Sky5 systems solutions, addressing low to ultra-high bands and a family of diversity receive modules as well as emerging technologies in millimeter wave.","Our portfolio is further bolstered by the strategic investments we've made in advanced filtering, spanning SAW, TCSAW, and BAW while addressing spectrum from 700 megahertz to six gigahertz.","And as 5G traction takes hold, we expect to benefit from new product categories targeting higher frequency spectrum in the future. As these technological demands intensify, Skyworks competitive position is strengthened with growing content reach across a wide array of customers and applications.","Strong momentum in broad markets, world class operational execution and scale, and decades of experience in developing breakthrough solutions over multiple technology generations, and importantly, superior cash flow allowing us to out-invest our competition while providing premium returns to shareholders.","With that, I will turn the call over to Kris for discussion of last quarter\u2019s performance and our outlook for Q3.","Kris Sennesael","Thanks, Liam. Revenue for the second fiscal quarter of 2019 was 810 million. As expected, continued strengthen in our high growth markets business allowed us to partially offset unit declines across mobile and overall weakness in the Chinese end markets.","Gross profit was 411 million, resulting in a gross margin of 50.7%, flat compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018.","Operating expenses were 135 million, in line with our guidance and down 3% sequentially, as we continue to effectively manage our operating expenses. We generated 276 million of operating income, translating into an operating margin of 34.1%. Second quarter effective tax rate was 8.3%. This drove net income of 257 million or $1.47 of diluted earnings per share.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, second fiscal quarter cash flow from operations was 192 million and for the first six months of the fiscal year, operating cash flow was 741 million. Second fiscal quarter capital expenditures were 97 million and we distributed 66 million in dividends and repurchased 1.7 million shares of our common stock for a total of 142 million. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of just under 1 billion with no debt.","Now looking ahead to the June quarter, we expect sequential revenue and earnings growth driven by strategic wins and content gains in mobile as well as traction across our broad market portfolio. Specifically, we anticipate revenue in the range of 815 million to 835 million, gross margin between 50.5% and 51%, and operating expenses to be up slightly to approximately 137 million.","Below the line, we anticipate roughly 3.5 million in other income and an effective tax rate in the range of 9% to 9.5%. We expect our diluted share count to be approximately 173 million shares. Assuming a revenue midpoint of approximately 825 million, we plan to deliver diluted earnings per share of $1.50.","With that, let me turn the call back to Liam.","Liam Griffin","Thanks, Chris. As our results illustrate, we continue to deliver strong levels of profitability, allowing us to make the pivotal investments that drive market leadership. In parallel, we are advancing our technological reach, positioning us to win in the connected economy of tomorrow, an unprecedented opportunity for Skyworks.","In summary, we are firmly committed to increasing shareholder value while executing on our ambitious vision of connecting everyone and everything all the time.","Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Let's open the lines for questions.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","Thank you for taking the question. My first one is a housekeeping question. Can you provide the revenue split between mobile and broad markets for the March quarter and what your expectations into June? For both, please?","Kris Sennesael","Sure. So, in the March quarter, our broad market business was approximately 33% of total revenue. So, we continue to run that business up more than $1 billion annualized revenue run rate. We continue to see as we said in the prepared remarks, continuous strength there with both sequential as well as year over year growth. And we are well on track to see double-digit year over year growth in that broad markets business. Of course, on the flip side, we have our mobile business, which was 67% of total revenue.","Toshiya Hari","And my follow up is on inventory. And hopefully, Kris, you can provide some color here. It was up I think around 13% sequentially, close to 20% year over year. What drove the uptick? And yeah, what drove the uptick there and what are their expectations into June and do you expect inventory to be down or flat, any color there would be helpful. Thank you.","Kris Sennesael","So, in the March quarter, which is our seasonally slowest quarter of the year, we did increase inventory levels both in absolute dollars as in days of inventory, fully in line with our expectation and driven by the fact that this year even more so than ever before, we took advantage of the softness in the business to level load our factories, mainly in support of new programs, known design wins with content gains with multiple large customers that are ramping in the second half of the calendar year.","And so we are doing that to minimize future capital expenditures and to drive efficient usage of our capital equipment. In addition to that, as you know, we continue to execute on our filter in-sourcing strategy that gives us a cost advantage, quality advantage, better performance of our filters, but as you know, when you produce your filters in house compared to buying them from third parties, you have to carry a little bit more inventory in terms of raw materials, work in process, and some buffer stocks.","Having said that, we expect inventory to be kind of flattish into the June quarter, but then, we expect improvement in terms of days of inventory in the second half of the year -- of the calendar year as we execute on those product ramps. I just want to point out that if you look at the first six months of the fiscal calendar, we have a free cash flow of 29% and so we are well on track to deliver a full-year free cash flow of 30%.","Liam Griffin","Yeah, let me add, Toshi, to that -- to Kris's comments is that the products that we're working on right now and the inventory that is being built now is targeted directly for known design wins that we have in the second half, very complex, compelling solutions that we\u2019ll be delivering in the second half of the calendar year. So we know exactly where this material is going.","Operator","And now to the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava","Liam, maybe a question on medium to longer term implications for your business with Qualcomm and Apple settling and Intel exiting the business. So, one assumption and I'm not saying it's the right assumption would be that you would lose the Intel business and then also Qualcomm would be able to bundle more and hence really have a negative impact on your business. So just kind of help us understand how we should be thinking about it, at least, I get this question, number one from investors and then I had a follow up as well please.","Liam Griffin","Sure, Ambrish. No problem. Well, let me kind of go back in time a little bit and take a long view at this thought. First of all, Skyworks as you know is baseband agnostic. Our products are interoperable with Qualcomm, with Intel, with MediaTeK, Samsung LSI, Huawei, et cetera. So, we've been able to navigate the baseband ecosystem and operate very effectively with all of those players. I would also say with the largest customers, we've had tremendous amount of volatility in baseband, but we've always grown our share. ","So if you look back in the early days of the largest customer and where their baseband position was, and there was a transition at one point, and then there was at times where we had two players going at once, all of that had no impact on our business. We continue to grow share, work with our customers, engineer to engineer, shoulder to shoulder design in work to grow our content in our position. And if we look out, one of the things that allows us to do that, Ambrish, is that we have made the investments in the technologies. We have in-house custom gallium arsenide technology, we have an array of filtering technology now that goes from SATA, TC SATA, bulk acoustic wave. ","We've made the investments to bring the scale to a market, which is also important. And one of the things that makes us really comfortable right now and really excited is this move to 5G. The 2G and 3G world, there was a lot of opportunity for players to expand from baseband and try to integrate RF, maybe use CMOS, maybe use another technology, but it never really happened. When you go to 5G, the complexity curve goes way up. It is daunting, it is challenging. We're thrilled by the opportunity. But it is by no stretch easy. So the leap from baseband to RF is challenging enough. But when you start moving into 4G and now 5G, it's really in the sweet spot of Skyworks. And we've invested a lot of time and energy and we have the people in our company ready to execute on that agenda.","Ambrish Srivastava","Okay, that's helpful prospectively. And for my follow-up, Kris, maybe back to you on the inventory days, 123. I run back and I can\u2019t see a day closer to that, I think in 2016. So just please help us understand and there is no such thing as normal seasonality, but how should we be thinking taking inventory comments you made earlier to an earlier question with kind of how should we be thinking about normal seasonality? And also, is there a higher level of inventory days that we should be thinking as a normalized level, given that the broadband, the broad based business is much bigger business, and that naturally carries more inventory?","Kris Sennesael","Yeah, I mean, I've listed the reasons why inventory is at least temporarily somewhat higher, right? We took advantage of the capacity we have in our factories, due to the softness in the business. And so we did more than ever before level loading. And so over time, as the businesses start ramping in the second half, we will see a decline in inventory days. There's a couple of other elements, one I mentioned as well is the filtering sourcing, that will be on a permanent basis result in some higher levels of inventory. And then as you pointed out as well, I didn't put it out. But you're absolutely right about that. The broad market business by its nature being a lot more diversified, multiple skews for multiple customers in multiple end markets, resulting in some higher level of inventory as well. Having said that, I think for the June quarter, we expect inventory to be on or about the same level. And then in the second half of the calendar year, we will see inventory levels coming down, but they will more than likely stay higher than where they were historically.","Operator","Thank you. And now to the line of Bill Peterson from JP Morgan.","Bill Peterson","Yeah, I first had a question actually on your broad markets in the CV, design wins with Wi-Fi 6 and massive MIMOs and so forth. I guess I was wondering, I guess first on massive MIMO, do we expect this to ramp this year, are these in field trials or would these be more in mass production next year. And same for Wi-Fi 6, it's kind of had a slow start. But when do you see this really starting to move the needle, and if you can quantify the growth for these, I guess, bigger segments within broad markets for us, as far as the growth rates this year and into next?","Liam Griffin","Sure, Bill. Sure. So I would say on the infrastructure side, we noted in the prepared remarks that we are seeing build outs right now with Nokia, with Ericsson, also with Huawei. So we're delivering some of our MIMO solutions, or some of our really complex architectures that we have in switching and filtering and building out the 5G infrastructure. That's ongoing right now. It's still early innings, but that infrastructure is rapidly being deployed and we think there's a very long tail of opportunity here with 5G just starting to roll, so that's on the infrastructure side.","If you look at the position in Wi-Fi, we've had a really strong position within broad markets, leveraging Wi-Fi from 11N to AX to now the newest standard in Wi-Fi 6. There's again, tremendous opportunity that we named just a few design wins in today's call, but a number of our customers that are upgrading from 11AX to Wi-Fi 6 are coming to us. There's a lot of opportunity there and the product reach that we have and the customer reach that we have continues to expand its home security, its access points and routers, ring doorbell type application, just a myriad of really slick applications that are empowered by our connectivity solution. So it's early innings for Wi-Fi 6, but we're a proven player there and we expect a gain.","Bill Peterson","I guess second, your guidance, obviously growth at the midpoint for the June quarter, I'm curious about China, specifically China smartphone. Sure, it's been weakened in the first quarter as the first calendar quarter you spoke to, do you see this directionally improving and I guess what's driving that, I mean, we've also seen some sort of share shift in China where Huawei appears to be doing very well and other ones not so well. How do you see your business in China?","Liam Griffin","Sure. Well, we were seeing quite a bit of softness in China in the March quarter and that I read through in the numbers here. And within that, there was also some dynamics of market share shifts with Huawei picking up a little bit more and the Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi ecosystem being softer. So that's something that we did experience in the March quarter. As we start to look out, we continue to see Huawei being strong, not only in mobile, but also in the infrastructure side, and obviously a, much more significant player than some of the smaller smartphone folks. But we are starting to see some gradual pick up in the second tier players in China in mobile. ","And if you actually think long, the opportunity with the smaller players is quite impressive because today the content in those accounts is pretty light. But when you move to 5G, there will be unique technologies that are necessary, that are absolute must in a mobile device to basically operate on a 5G network. Therefore, the content gains and the smaller accounts could actually be on a ratio basis, even more impactful than what we have in a customer like Huawei today. So, there's a lot to look forward to there, but certainly the March quarter, China was very tough, very challenging. I think it impacted some of the -- even the US customers that sold into China. But, we\u2019re getting through that now and should start to see improving conditions in Q3 and also into the second half.","Operator","And now to the line of Edward Snyder from Charter Equity Research.","Edward Snyder","Liam, I hate to burn my first question on Qualcomm's RF, but a claims, but Cristiano on Qualcomm's call yesterday made a big deal of RF wins, he didn't mention what they were like the CMOS millimeter wave mimic that\u2019s burning through phones. Just as a reality check, are you seeing Qualcomm, some of the Qualcomm\u2019s toeholds that they got last year in RF being reversed on phones this year, like the pixel 4 and then I have a follow up.","Liam Griffin","Yeah, they have been working to expand their baseband position, and they have a great baseband. So no question about that, but trying to move forward in the RF section. There have been a couple of spots where they popped up, but they really haven't really impeded our opportunities. So, we continue to do very, very well in the mid to high end. As you know well, as a technologist, the complexity in 4G and into 5G now with some of the networks that we're seeing and some of the burdens that we see in the technology builds that we have, it's just very difficult unless this is your bread and butter and we've been working on this for years. ","We have a great position, we can interoperate with Qualcomm all day long, but in terms of their own RF, and trying to move the needle here, I think it's going to be very difficult. We have years and years of experience here working with this. We have the in-house assets and technology, we're building out our arsenal in filtering and then our ability to integrate with SkyOne and SkyFive and create highly customized configurable offerings to each one of our customers. And the shoulder-to-shoulder engineering work that I mentioned as we go to market, I think is quite compelling and it's in some of the main reasons why we do win. So, we recognize Qualcomm has an ambition to compete in RF, we're comfortable with where we are, but we\u2019ll continue to raise our game and raise our strength to ensure that we lead. ","Edward Snyder","And then if I could, you mentioned in sourcing soft filters. I last checked was just some time ago now, I thought we were generally in source on all the soft, over 75% of your modules have been pulled in, I was a little surprised to see it was one of your quintessential drivers to inventory and while we're on soft, while we\u2019re on filters, Liam, if I could, there's a lot of talk of BAW in the last couple of quarters. I know you guys have been diligently working on a part now. We've heard that you sampled it in RX device. Have you gotten to the point where you're sampling duplexes yet and die this play any role in your big module and with your largest customer, BAW at all in the fall of this year. Thanks.","Kris Sennesael","Right. So I'll start first on the inventory. So maybe a year and a year and a half ago, roughly 50% of the filters were in house. We made a big move to the 75%, 80% in house in the last couple of quarters, and now as we ramp the new products, for the next cycle, we will get closer to 90%, 95%.","Liam Griffin","Sure. And following up on the BAW opportunity and now that we've kind of communicated that more broadly, we are in production right now, supporting our BAW capabilities. And we have known design wins that will be similar to -- think of it as a SkyFive like module with BAW technologies. It's not going to be, it's a discrete filter, it\u2019s going to be a solution. We continue to expand the opportunity set, we're sampling a number of customers across the board, we\u2019re continuing to try to expand the reach of our BAW filtering capability. We've made quite a few investments and spent quite a bit of money investing not only in capacity, but also the technology that we need. And we're ready, we're ready. And, we're really excited about delivering product in the second half. And we have some really slick opportunities that we're looking at in 2020. So we will be well positioned and there should be some evidence of our success here coming soon. ","Operator","And now to the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays.","Unidentified Analyst","This is [indiscernible]. In the prepared remarks, you guys highlighted some massive MIMO wins with Nokia and Ericsson. Can you talk about where you're winning there? And as a percentage basis, how much can that contribute to your business over the next couple years?","Liam Griffin","Yeah, it's a meaningful part of our business in broad market. We've always been a pretty strong infrastructure player, but that market had been slow in the last few years as 4G kind of just lulled along and there wasn't an inflection point. So what we can do, there's a lot of things that we can do, we do high power amplifiers, we have some antenna arrays and switch arrays that go into the infrastructure space, there's even going to be some opportunity down the road here for millimeter wave technology, which is new, very complex. And we'll participate across the board, we've been a supplier to all the tier 1s, the Nokia, and even Samsung and Huawei, there. So, there's a large set of players that we have relationships with, and 5G is going to stimulate absolutely stimulate some new revenue opportunities.","Unidentified Analyst","And then my second one is just on the moving pieces in March here, you guys highlighted some weakness across China, and normally that business is up double digits in March, when you guys are talking about weakness, do you still -- did you still see growth in that business in March or is the entire Android down in March? I just want to get a little more color on the vector of that weakness.","Liam Griffin","Yeah, sure. Well, I will tell you in Q2, you're right, oftentimes, you have a holiday season, a holiday effect in December, a lot of growth. And then, some of the US names come down a bit in March. In China, typically China can go sideways, maybe even up in the March quarter, that's kind of a historical signature. This year, we had a different, we had a different experience. We had some pretty marked weakness in China broadly. It hit all of the tier 1s there, and also the smaller players. And it also, I think the China economy\u2019s weakness also impacted some of the larger US companies. So it was an unusual period where there was weakness across the board in that market. We are seeing the business improve in China as we look out into Q3. And we're hopeful we get back to a normal cycle in the second half. And again, the 5G opportunities and some of the things we talked about already on the call should really stimulate some new demand for us.","Operator","And now to the line of Craig Ellis from B. Riley.","Craig Ellis","Guys, I wanted to follow up on some of the inventory comments, but moved to a different line. So if we bounce up to the income statement with inventory, where it is after the level loading and what are the implications Kris for gross margin expansion in the back half of the year, can we still expect to see typical incremental gross margins or would they be reduced, given higher inventory?","Kris Sennesael","Oh, no, not at all. I mean, we continue to execute very well on our operational efficiency improvements. We will be bringing new, more complex products to the market in the second half. And so combination of those two, we will see further gross margin improvements in the second half. And we will continue to work towards our target model of 53% gross margin.","Liam Griffin","Yeah, and Craig, let me just also add that if you go a little bit deeper here and look at some of the challenges that we mentioned with inventory, we're still committed to delivering and we're right on, a free cash flow margin of 29% to 30%. So even with some of the bumpiness here that we endured in Q2, we\u2019ll still be able to deliver, we have expectation to deliver a 30% free cash flow margin for the full year.","Craig Ellis","Thanks for that, Liam. And then I'll just follow up on a comment that you just made in response to the last question, I think you were speaking about a hope to return to normal seasonality in the back half of the year. At times, you give us a glimpse of what you think the business can do, not guidance, but give us a sense for what's possible in the business in the back half, any sense for that at this time?","Liam Griffin","Yeah, I mean, well, we're really not positioned to guide the Q4 and Q1 second half, but we do expect to see the market improve for us. We do know that we have a very strong pipeline of design wins that support some incredible product for our customers. We're very comfortable with that. We see that it's coming. It's one of the reasons why the inventory position is where it is. And so we certainly expect the second half to be better than the first half here.","Operator","And now to the line of it Srini Pajjuri from Macquarie.","Srini Pajjuri","Liam, just a couple of questions on 5G, given your enthusiasm, I'm just curious how your design win pipeline is looking? And then, and also, if you could give us some color as to where -- what kind of products historically you have down there to low band pad and the DRX modules, et cetera. So just wondering if you could provide us some color as to where you're winning these designs?","Liam Griffin","Sure. Yeah. We think of 5G as a technology and then that technology is ported into different applications. So obviously, the smartphone is going to be one of the most compelling 5G delivering that speed, that data rate, that performance in a smartphone. And there, it's very clear for us to see the incremental content, the necessary building blocks that are required to make that 5G phone work. And then you have the new markets that are being enabled by 5G, things like AR and VI, AI and VR, machine to machine applications where you're using a 5G signal to operate factories and robots, really cool stuff that hasn't happened yet. ","So we're starting to see that occur first in the smartphone. We do believe that this is a little bit more of a 2020 to 2021 dynamic. I don't expect the market to see any significant 5G smartphone growth in 2019. But we're really excited about the design wins that we're working on and working with the right customers and seeing their product roadmaps and how we fit in. So there will be a lot of content, a lot of complexity. It's important to have the building blocks. I will say that, the fact that we have the technology and filtering from 700 mg to 6 gig and even now into the millimeter wave spectrum will be well positioned. ","That decades of experience that we talked about is going to be necessary, this is hard stuff. And then having the scale, having the factory assets, the scale and the technology in house is going to be a differentiator for us. So we look forward to all of that. And I think it's going to be incredible to see the number of applications that are really going to be propelled and powered by 5G technology.","Srini Pajjuri","Got it? And then more of a strategic question. Liam, so obviously, you made an acquisition that seems to be working out well, but you still have plenty of cash and generating a lot of free cash flow. Just wondering how you're thinking about M&A going forward. I mean, obviously, the smartphone market is longer, even with 5G, you have a big customer concentration. I'm just curious, what your thoughts, latest thoughts on M&A are?","Liam Griffin","Sure. Yeah, we're still very excited about the opportunity that we have organically and we're heading down that path. But at the same time, you're right. I mean, I'm really pleased with the cash flow generation that we're putting forth as a company, the power that we have available. But so we're going to be very discerning when it comes to M&A. I mean, that's been a signature of Skyworks for years and it will continue to be, both the right opportunity comes along, we\u2019ll be ready to take advantage.","Operator","And now to the line of Chris Caso from Raymond James.","Chris Caso","Just a question on inventory levels. And last quarter, you talked about some caution on the part of customers with inventory amid the weakness. What do you feel is the situation right now with customer inventory? And perhaps you could address Huawei more directly? I guess there's, some fears about some Huawei potentially building some inventory. So if you could address that as well, please.","Kris Sennesael","Yeah. So in general, when we talk about inventory levels in the channel, we made some remarks last earnings call where we saw some cautious behavior by our distributors. And as I told you last quarter, we are not fighting that tape. It's okay for now to have some lower levels of inventory or healthy levels of inventory in the channel that sets us up for strong and stronger sequential growth in the second half. As it relates to Huawei, I know there is a lot of speculation about their inventory levels. We don't have great visibility because we are in a hub arrangement. ","And so once they -- so we don't keep inventory in the channel for them. And we only recognize revenue once they pulled their product out of their hub. And then, we don't have any visibility. As Liam said before, our business with Huawei is relatively strong, given some of the overall weakness in the China market. But we believe that Huawei themselves are gaining share in the Chinese market as well in mobile. They have strong infrastructure business and we are very well positioned with them, both in mobile and infrastructure.","Liam Griffin","Right and Chris, that's the key point. If you really look at the Q2 numbers for us, we saw the Huawei numbers do okay, but the other smaller players in China really come down. So some of that was share shift. We do know that Huawei is the most capable from a technology perspective, if you look at Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi and the others. So they're starting -- as the market starts to move towards complexity, they're likely going to outperform their peer group. So that that was part of the read through in Q2.","Chris Caso","As a follow up on the broad market business, the business has been decelerating for a couple of quarters now and I suppose that\u2019s amid the market weakness as well. I guess I want to be clear what you guys are saying, are you still expecting double digit growth of the year on that and as we go into the second half of the year, are you expecting some reacceleration in the year-on-year growth from the broad markets business and perhaps give some reasons behind that.","Kris Sennesael","Yeah, so if you look at the first half of the fiscal year, we rolled out about 10% year-over-year growth in broad markets. And so we expect, on a full year basis on or about 10, maybe slightly above 10% year-over-year growth. So, so as a result of that, of course, in the second half, we see some on or about 10% or continuous 10% year-over-year growth.","Operator","Thank you. And now to the line of Harsh Kumar from Piper Jaffray.","Harsh Kumar","I was wondering, since you're somewhat new to the BAW technology, are there any gating factors that you can see that allow you to ramp in a very significant manner, particularly, let's say next year when your largest customer is now expected to come out with 5G phones?","Kris Sennesael","So Harsh, the question is if there are any gating factor?","Harsh Kumar","Yeah. Technologically, is there any technology you\u2019re missing? Or is there a ramp factor that is unknown to you guys at this point?","Liam Griffin","Yeah. Harsh, this is Liam. Yeah, I feel very good about our position in 5G. And there are a lot of challenges. There are a lot of gating factors and gaps and opportunities. And that's what makes it great. It's going to be very, very complex. It's going to call for a set of technologies that's never been put together in the same device before. That's all new and all of the cross talk and noise and battle for current will occur in the device. So companies like Skyworks, we're in there now. We're under the hood working with the leaders in the industry to put all this technology together. And I think we've talked about this before, but remember, 5G is an incremental opportunity that overlays 4G, and even 3G in a smartphone device. So we've got to bring all of that technology into a single form factor and manage the interoperability of that. So there's a great, great deal of complexity. ","What helps us is the in house technologies, we talked about it, we have our own gallium arsenide, our assembly and test in house in Mexicali and our ability to span filtering from low bands all the way up to ultra-high bands, and select what is needed customer by customer, depending on what band they're going to roam in, what carriers they want to support and what geographies they're going to live in. So a lot to that. And there'll be plenty of challenges, but that turns out -- that translates into opportunity for us.","Harsh Kumar","And then as one follow-up, if I can ask you your thoughts on this year for 2019 content versus units. How do you guys see those things, those two factors playing out for your business in mobile?","Liam Griffin","Yeah, I would say, content is going to be a big driver. And that's something that we control. So, our focus is on executing on the controllables and that's bringing the content up and executing on these new technologies that we see in 5G and some other areas. But again, units also have the potential now to move. I don't know if we're going to see a big spike in the second half of this year in units. But I think when 5G starts to pick up, there's going to be a reacceleration and replacement rate. And then you have the double effect of a unit pop and then the unit pop that that's going to carry more and more value and content. So well, that'll eventually come together, may not happen in sync, but that'll eventually start to come together for us in the industry.","Operator","And now to the line of Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho.","Vijay Rakesh","Just wondering back on the competitive landscape on the handset side, especially, there has been some talk about Murata being, getting starting company from the low band side, just wondering what you guys are seeing, especially as you look at the back half.","Liam Griffin","Yeah, well, Murata has always been in the game. They focus more on mid to low end stuff in our space. We compete with them all the time, we like our playbook, we like our position. We have not seen them encroach on our low band pad and we're moving up now anyway, so our low band pad is solid, but we're also moving into new categories. Murata has always been around and they're a good competitor. But we feel very strongly about our position and our ability to defend and grow in the categories we\u2019re existing in today.","Vijay Rakesh","And on the millimeter wave side, I know, on broad markets, it looks like you talked about some nice design wins there with some of the bigger carriers, but looks like initially, at least on the European carrier side, it has been a little bit slower, especially the ramp versus some of the Chinese carriers or some of the guys like Huawei, but -- so are you seeing any change in that ramp, especially in the European guys, it looks like some of the millimeter wave rollouts got delayed.","Liam Griffin","Yeah, those are good questions. So kind of two parts to that. So, we are seeing, we are actually seeing some nice growth with the European carriers, we are, the European infrastructure players, the Ericsson, the Nokias, for example. And that's been incrementally positive. If we look at millimeter wave as a category, a great deal of complexity, it is new technology, it\u2019s new spectrum that requires different types of devices to execute. And so that's a bit of a game changer where I think a number of players are working on it. But everybody comes to market with a different type of solution. It's not, I don't think, it's a case where the blueprint is the same for every carrier. ","So I think there's still a lot of work being done competitively to see what's the right implementation of millimeter wave. There's an infrastructure piece. There is kind of almost a, what we would call, a wide area network type of deployment as well that could be, think of it as street lights in the neighborhood delivering millimeter wave technology. And that eventually, I think further along, there will be some implementations in the smartphone itself. So that's another opportunity for the space that we're in here to see some real TAM growth. The millimeter wave part I think is out a bit. But we are working on it. And it's an element of 5G and could be a pretty, pretty significant driver over the next three to five years.","Operator","And our final question today comes from Christopher Rolland from Susquehanna.","Christopher Rolland","Perhaps tying into that that last response as we move into higher frequencies, I understand that new materials might be used here, more ceramics, for example, or lump element. Can you guys talk about your capabilities here and what you have, what you might be deficient in? And what you might be looking to perhaps acquire out there?","Liam Griffin","Sure, that's a great question. In fact, we do have lump element in ceramics by the way, we noted some of that technology in the aerospace and defense comments earlier. But you're right, I mean, so in order to deliver across the entire spectrum, we go from 700 megahertz. Today, our technology gets up to about 2.5, we can push it to 6-gig and then you start to deal with millimeter wave, which is new technology in development. We don't have that in production. We have it in development. So there's going to be quite a bit of research and development and execution to make that millimeter wave spectrum work. It's, again, there's a lot of great benefits to that technology, but it's new. ","So each supplier is working on in a different way. We've been a leader in integration on the Skyworks side. So one of the things that's really important is the customers, they have a full solution, not just a piece of silicon. They want an integrated system solution that works for them in their infrastructure side, and also in the handheld side. Our ability to reach into our filter portfolio, again, all the way from low bands to ultra-high bands, leverage our gallium arsenide technology and then the in house packaging, there's a great deal of complexity in packaging as well in millimeter wave. We can put all of that together. But we're not going to do that in a mass market approach. ","We're going to work with each customer and each carrier to make sure that we work in their fashion and hit their schedule, their timelines and their technology notes. Because they're very different across the space. So there's a lot to learn in millimeter wave in the industry right now. It's going to be a big opportunity for the space. We've been making investments. Over time, we're accelerating our work. We're sampling and we're continuing to get feedback from the customers that matter. And we look forward again, as I noted, as an opportunity for us over the next few years.","Christopher Rolland","And then you guys talked about being baseband, I'm not agnostic on that. But totally makes sense, I guess that, but Qualcomm is out saying they plan on tuning their RF to work optimally with their modem \u2013 their baseband particularly when it comes to power, for example, as we move into some of these higher frequencies. So I guess, the story sounds really good. But in your opinion, why is there no competitive advantage that can be gained from designing both the modem and the RF in the same system?","Liam Griffin","Well, they're totally different devices, different technologies. It's completely different. The RF technologies that we have, the gallium arsenide technology that we have are very different than silicon and CMOS. When you look at the complexity today, and 4G moving to 5G, it is incredible. And companies that have done nothing but RF, okay, are having a hard, hard time executing in the 5G world. So I think it's going to be challenging for Qualcomm that comes out of a digital baseband side, great company, but for them to take that leap into 5G I think is really going to be a challenge. The market has been around for a long time. Qualcomm has been around for a long time, we've had 2G, we had 3G, we had 4G, and we really have not been threatened from them as we've moved along. There's a lot of competition in this space. But we haven't seen the Qualcomm RF threat be significant for us. We respect the company. They have great technology, we've lined up with them. And a number of handsets interoperated with their baseband, and delivered compelling end solutions for our customers. But on the RF side, given the complexity that we're seeing right now and the challenges in bringing all this stuff to market in a 5G world, very, very hard, very, very hard for companies that haven't spent time and energy and years working on that implementation.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Griffin for any closing comments.","Liam Griffin","Well, thank you all for participating on today's call. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

This call is being recorded.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Mitch Haws, Vice President of Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Haws, please go ahead.","Mitchell J. Haws - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' second fiscal quarter 2017 conference call. With me on the call today are Liam Griffin, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kris Sennesael, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our discussion will include statements relating to future results and expectations that are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Please refer to our earnings press release and recent SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for information on certain risks that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially and adversely from any forward-looking statements made today.","Additionally, the results and guidance discussed today include non-GAAP financial measures, consistent with our past practice. Please refer to our press release at the Investor Relations section of our website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Liam.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Mitch, and welcome, everyone. The Skyworks team produced another quarter of strong results in fiscal Q2. Let me begin with a few highlights.","We delivered revenue of $852 million, up 10% year-over-year and above consensus, with gross margin of 50.4% and operating margin of 36.7%. We achieved earnings per share of $1.45, up 16% year-over-year and $0.05 better than consensus. And we continue to generate strong cash flow. Our operating cash flow in the first half of fiscal 2017 reached $732 million, up 46% as compared to the same period last year.","In addition to our financial performance, we are aggressively expanding our design win pipeline. In mobile, we are extending our reach across all premier smartphone OEMs. Specifically, we enabled Huawei's P10 and P10+ models with low, mid and high-band SkyOne solutions, along with antenna tuner, carrier aggregation switching and power management devices.","We powered Samsung's Galaxy S8 platform with proprietary DRx and SkyOne solutions, as well as GPS and DC\/DC converters. And we secured reference design sockets across MediaTek's next generation architectures.","In IoT, we supported Cisco's enterprise-grade MIMO gateways, delivered analog control ICs across Nintendo's gaming platforms, including the recently introduced Switch console, ramped audio solutions for Sonos' high-fidelity wireless speakers, captured Wi-Fi mesh networking wins at Google and Plume, deployed high-power smart meter devices for Itron, and we launched custom solutions for Fitbit, Garmin and LG.","Finally, we secured strategic design wins at three leading automotive manufacturers, leveraging our advanced LTE modules supporting high-reliability connectivity, GPS and data transport capabilities. As our results demonstrate, Skyworks is capitalizing on powerful macro trends, diversifying across new markets and advancing our technology leadership. We support fast-growing mobile and IoT ecosystems, which are becoming increasingly more profitable.","The stakeholders in these ecosystems are monetizing vast flows of data, while fostering entirely new wireless-centric business models. This dynamic is creating a new trillion-dollar economy, underpinned by e-commerce, mobile advertising, social media, and cloud-based services.","High-speed, reliable, always-on connectivity is at the heart of this secular trend. With connected platforms requiring scores of complex devices working across dozens of frequency bands in an increasingly crowded spectrum. Skyworks addresses this complexity with a collaborative, systems-level approach, working closely with customers to create streamlined architectures.","This demands technology breadth and depth, along with flexibility and configurability and showing the highest levels of performance. Our scale, innovative designs, robust quality and world-class supply chain provide us with significant competitive advantages.","Within the mobile market, we facilitate the data creation and storage that allow today's smartphones to transmit and receive immense amounts of content, supporting multimedia streaming, social networking, gaming and virtual reality. We create highly integrated solution, leveraging our skills in amplification, filtering, tuning, power management and packaging, to continuously drive better performance.","For example, our SkyOne and DRx platforms are gaining significant design traction, seamlessly delivering uplink and downlink carrier aggregation and global roaming capabilities. In addition to mobile, connectivity is proliferating into an adjacent set of IoT markets.","Industry projections model IoT volumes to expand five-fold, reaching 75 billion units by 2025, with significant growth in areas such as connected home, smart grid, factory automation, wearables and virtual assistants. Skyworks' broad capabilities, spanning all major wireless protocols including Wi-Fi, GPS, LTE, Bluetooth and ZigBee, uniquely position us to capitalize on this immense opportunity.","Looking ahead, we continue to address a growing set of vibrant end markets across developed and emerging economies, covering both mobile and IoT. At the same time, we are preparing for a significant 5G upgrade cycle, yet another catalyst fueling our business while leveraging our technology depth and systems expertise.","As these powerful market forces accelerate, we are playing a leadership role in unwiring the planet, extending our reach across new markets and enabling billions of connected devices.","With that, I will turn the call over to Kris for an overview of our Q2 financials and outlook for Q3.","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Liam. Revenue for the second fiscal quarter was $852 million, exceeding our guidance and consensus estimates. Revenue grew 10% compared to Q2 of last year. Gross profit was $429 million or 50.4% of revenue, with operating expenses of $116 million. As a result, we generated $313 million of operating income, translating into an operating margin of 36.7%. Our tax rate was 13%, driving net income of $272 million or $1.45 of diluted earnings per share, exceeding our guidance by $0.05.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash flow from operations was $236 million, an increase of 53% year-over-year. Capital expenditures were $55 million, roughly 6% of sales. Dividends paid in the quarter were $52 million, and we repurchased 1 million shares of our common stock for a total of $95 million. And, finally, we ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $1.4 billion and no debt.","Now, moving to our outlook for fiscal Q3. For the third fiscal quarter of 2017, we anticipate our revenue to be $890 million. At this revenue level, we expect gross margin expansion within a range of 50.5% to 51%; with operating expenses of $122 million, as we continue to invest in grow initiatives, including our IoT business. Below the line, we anticipate roughly $0.5 million in other expense and a tax rate of 14%. We expect our share count do be approximately 186 million shares. Accordingly, at the midpoint of our gross margin guidance, we plan to generate earnings per share of $1.52.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liam.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Kris. In summary, as our second quarter results and guidance illustrate, Skyworks is gaining momentum. Our outlook for Q3 reflects accelerating performance, with 18% revenue growth and 23% earnings per share growth on a year-over-year basis. We are clearly capitalizing on the highly profitable wireless ecosystem, underpinned by explosive growth in the new connected economy. Skyworks is leveraging these powerful macro trends, pushing the technology envelope and extending our product reach to enable the world's most exciting communications platform.","In closing, we are well-positioned to create shareholder value while executing on our ambitious vision of connecting everyone and everything all the time.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question will come from Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Go ahead, please.","Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. And congratulations on a nice quarter, guys. I guess my first question, maybe I'll just go right to China, what trends are you guys seeing there with the handset guys? Is there any sense of maybe any impact that you guys are or are not seeing from any excess inventory there? And then maybe part of that answer, if you could talk about sort of what you're looking for in terms of the content gains there, sort of in aggregate with your Chinese OEM customers?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. I mean, in the Q2 period, we did see the market demonstrate some weakness, specifically \u2013 again, in China \u2013 specifically in the Tier 2, Tier 3 guys. So we did see some of that. We had forecasted much of that in our plan. And at the same time, with the second and third tier guys falling down a bit, we saw some real strength with higher end players. Huawei being at the top of the pack with some great content, where we're now adding multiple bands of SkyOne, DRx technology, DC\/DC technology, and platforms that are approaching $8 to $10 in value.","And then the mid-tier players like Oppo and Vivo did okay as well. So the lower end of China was weak, the higher end was strong. Little bit of a correction there that we were able to model and come through, and we see that market getting better here as we go into the second half.","Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then, maybe as a follow-up, if we could talk just a minute about Mexicali, sort of what the level of revenue that Mexicali can support for you guys today. Basically, what capacity I guess is today. And what kind of investments you guys have planned there to stay ahead of your top line growth? Thanks.","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. We're running our back end operation pretty much at full capacity, but we have an ongoing CapEx investment to extend the capacity there in that facility. As you know, our CapEx is running on or about 7%, 8% of total revenue. And the vast majority of that CapEx goes into that back end facility.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. And one other thing to add, Rick, is that what we are seeing here and our strategy is driving is that we're selling more and more and building more and more integrated solutions. So what was a unit in Mexicali five years ago may have been a discrete PA, and now we're dealing with very complex integrated devices, whether it's SkyOne or DRx. It's actually, net-net, more favorable for us. We can control that production. We can control the actual build of those complex devices. It changes the dynamic a little bit on CapEx, but it's been definitely favorable for us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Go ahead, please.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thank you for taking the question. The first question is just a clarification on the quarter. Nice to see the upside strength in revenues. Guys, where was the business a little bit stronger than you expected? And, Kris, can you give us the typical breakdown in segment revenues across the three businesses?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure, Craig. I'll start with the Q2 puts and takes. Generally, a strong quarter for us, seasonal down period, but we're happy with our ability to upside our results. We saw some really good strength in our broad markets; let me start there. The broad market business on a year-over-year basis is up about 18%. That portfolio now is getting near a $1 billion run rate annually. So we're real pleased with that.","We saw some nice uptake in some of our other mobile customers, specifically Samsung and Huawei, very good. China, we talked about. Open Market China, a little bit soft. And the balance of the business in good shape. So the big drivers really were broad markets, and then Samsung and Huawei as primaries.","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. So the breakout was, broad market was slightly above 25%. As Liam just said, we continue to see nice sequential growth in the high-single digits, as well as really nice year-over-year growth in the high-double digits. And so, on the flip side, of course, mobile, which include integrated mobile in our PA business, was slightly below 75% of total revenue.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","All right. That's helpful. And then the second question is more of a longer term question, Liam. It's nice to see the business essentially back to double-digit top line growth. Can you talk about the visibility you have into sustainable levels of double-digit growth which was the company's hallmark for many years. And as we look at the longer term potential, can you just frame for us how you look at seasonality in the calendar third and calendar fourth quarter for the business, as it now runs? Thank you.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Well, I'll start with the high-level theme and then we'll hit the second half of the year. So we are absolutely convinced and have great deal of visibility into the trends around mobile and IoT and where the markets are going. I think it starts with this ecosystem that we've talked about with a tremendous cast of major, major players that thrive on a mobile economy, right? You look at the results from Amazon today, as an example.","So we continue to see rich content, very complex architectures, road maps from our leading accounts that require more and more the kind of stuff that Skyworks does well. More integration, more creative designs, all about performance, all about performance. So we see that continuing. It's not a 2017 or 2018. This is a secular theme.","At the same time, we're seeing IoT proliferate and we're seeing a Wi-Fi portfolio, our Bluetooth portfolio, our ZigBee portfolio move into more and more end markets and expand our customer set. So that is all real good, and it's all macro and we're looking forward to continuing to capitalize.","More to the near term, in terms of the calendar year and the seasonality. We just went through our low point of the quarter in Q2 with good results. We guided up here in Q3. But the real big part of our year is the second half of the calendar, right?","So Q4, Q1, we expect those numbers to continue to be up meaningfully, double-digits, into the mid-teens on both quarters. And getting into Q1, should be again a really strong quarter for us. So we're well-positioned for that. Our Q3 guidance reflects some of that. But as you start to look out over the next couple of quarters, we see accelerating growth.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Harsh Kumar with Stephens. Go ahead, please.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah. Hey. Thanks, guys. Congratulations on tremendous results. Liam, with your Japanese filter sort of fab and factory completed and now you're generating tremendous amount of cash flow, have your goals for drop-through margins changed at all? And I think you guys had a $8 long-term earnings goal. Is that something you guys are willing to talk about or up it?","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure, Harsh, and I'll take that. First of all, when looking at the gross margin, I'm very pleased with the Q2 operational results. Gross margin came in at 50.4%. That was 20 basis points higher than what we expected and guided to. And so, looking ahead, as Liam just indicated, we are looking and expecting three quarters of strong sequential top line growth here in the June, September and December quarter.","And we also expect three quarters of sequential gross margin improvements, as we benefit from the revenue growth, as we, of course, continue to drive further operational efficiencies, and as we continue to benefit from the filter in-sourcing. And so, all that will help us to make further progress towards our target model of 53% gross margin and 40% operating margin. And so, we continue to make good progress there.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.","Great. And then as my follow-up perhaps, may I ask you, Liam, you talked a lot about the IoT business. I was wondering if you could size it for us. Perhaps, maybe give us some color on what it's growing at and maybe what your margins are at in this business?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. So within our \u2013 our broad market business is on a run rate, as I indicated, of close to $1 billion. So we're not quite $250 million a quarter, but we're getting near there. IoT is about 70% of that revenue, roughly. So it's been a double-digit grower. It continues to be the leading catalyst for us in broad market. The customer set, as I noted, has expanded.","The other thing that's a real benefit, and it's early now, but IoT is starting to move up in complexity. It's no longer just drop in a couple of Wi-Fi devices. We're starting to see filtering needs in IoT. We're starting to see LTEs with real cellular engines introduced into IoT. Our GPS technology is proliferating through IoT applications. So it's modeling content much like cell phone content was in 2002 or 2003, very basic, kind of lower connectivity. But then, as data needs increased, the performance needs within the phone expanded and we're starting to see that in IoT.","So, today, it's a very long list of customers, provides a great deal of diversification and the content is continuing to creep up. And we're fortunate that our breadth in IoT, with all the different wireless protocols and some of the leverage that we have in our mobile business, we're in a great position to address and capitalize.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Go ahead, please.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hi, guys. Hi, Liam. Just a great quarter here despite all the worries on the China handset. So as you look at the second half, I know you guys mentioned high-teens growth and accelerating. Is that sequential growth that you are looking at for the September-December quarter?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. We're looking for sequential growth. On a year-over-year basis, we're looking at the mid-teen numbers.","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. It's on a year-over-year basis.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Got it, got it. And as you look at Sony's marquee phones in the back half, do you expect your content share to go up, not just units, there's also a content gain story there?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. Our content story is really at the heart of our business right now. And as I mentioned, the requirements that are being driven by the leaders in the market continue to increase, and the demands are more and more challenging, the complexity is daunting. And very few companies can resolve it. We're one of them.","We also have an advantage of being an incumbent with the leaders and understanding the nuances of calibration and tuning and working shoulder to shoulder with the engineering teams. So our position in the leading phones continues to be very strong. It will be, again, a tailwind for us in the second half of this year and even into the future.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Great. And the last question, who are the 10% customers on the quarter?","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","So, during Q2, we had three greater than 10% customers. Obviously, our largest customer, which was slightly below 40% of total revenue, and then Huawei and Samsung, each of them which were slightly above 10% of total revenue. As Liam already indicated before, great traction with Huawei, expanding our product reach within multiple of their platforms. And as well with Samsung, Q2 was a great quarter, rebounding from somewhat a disappointing or a low Q1 quarter. But we really saw really nice sequential growth as well as year-over-year growth within that account.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research. Please go ahead. Mr. Snyder, is your phone on mute?","Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research","Sorry about that. Thanks. Last year, at your largest customer, you were pretty much exclusive on the Qualcomm platform. Do you see that as reoccurring again this year? (22:42) action with Intel? And then, if I could, how much of the revenue that you reported this quarter or you guided for next quarter was inorganic? I understand you probably picked up ANADIGICS product line from II-VI when they divested that. So just curious how much was organic versus an acquisition? Thanks.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure, Ed. With respect to baseband, this isn't the first time we've seen share shifts here or any kind of diversification within the ecosystem; no surprises. And at the same time, we continue to gain great traction with both Intel and Qualcomm within our largest customer and globally.","So, for Skyworks, baseband partnerships are really important and we are agnostic to that. The parts may change a little bit. Your calibration tuning and alignment with the chipset could be different phone to phone and baseband to baseband. But we're in very good position there, and we have excellent visibility on where that's going to play out over the next year or so. So we're in good shape. Yeah. The ANADIGICS opportunity, really it's minimal in terms of its impact on the business. So there's nothing significant there. Didn't have much of an effect on our overall performance at all.","Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research","Okay. And then, it's clear you're growing really well across a variety of different technologies. You can see it in some of the tear-downs sitting up here. Can you help us understand which of them are making the largest contributions, say, year-over-year of revenue growth, especially with regard to second half, but also this half. If you had to choose between DRx pads, LNAs, Wi-Fi, which of those are going to lead in terms of your year-on-year performance and growth? I understand DRx's are starting to move into more the mid and low-end phones, and you've got \u2013 dominate there. But then LNAs are showing up too. So can you help us with the breakdown?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, yeah. Well, I'll answer it and I'll kind of give you a little more color on it. So the SkyOne portfolio is really important, although on a year-over-year basis it doesn't have as much of a pop as a DRx, because SkyOne has been there. But I will tell you what we're doing in that product line is continuing to extend the reach of our frequency band. So we're getting into high-band. We've been in mid-band and we've been leading in low-band.","And now, SkyOne is being adopted by more and more accounts. Accounts that a year ago may have done a multi-mode PA and had filters on the side, they're integrating. Companies like MediaTek that are going to create chipsets for Skyworks, we're starting to move those into SkyOne like architectures rather than multi-mode PAs and filters on the side. So that's a theme.","DRx category is very powerful. We have premium technology that's defensible, that's market-leading. We've proven it in the most challenging architectures on the planet. And the compares on a year-over-year basis are very strong, because the DRX really hasn't been around too long. However, the way we do it, the way we craft it with our custom solutions, our ability to bring our own filters in-house, what we even do to craft our LNA technology and Mexicali as an integrator of all this in unique custom packages, is really special.","So that product line has a great deal of upside. It has been lightly introduced. Every account that we've worked with, for the most part, we've been able to win, but there's a lot out there that haven't yet adopted the technology. So there is quite a bit of upside on the DRx family, and that will continue to evolve as that product gets upgraded year by year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Peterson with JPMorgan. Go ahead, please.","Bill Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. and congrats on the good results and outlook. Maybe piggybacking that question, with these newer products like LNAs and DRx, GPS, can you help frame the dollar content opportunities for, say, premium, mid and, I guess, the lower end, at least what your served addressable market is in terms of dollar content per device?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure. Yes. So when we think about \u2013 just to frame it \u2013 the DRx category, we kind of created the name DRx and that whole segment, it really is \u2013 it's focused on downlink performance. So what we're trying to do is enhance the download speed of a device, whether it's a phone or eventually it could be an IoT device. So the traditional architectures may have been discrete with a single-chip LNA and maybe a few discrete filters and a few discrete switches. And you'd have quite a bit of lock in your system and you really wouldn't be able to harness or pull through that data fast enough.","So we created a new category where we integrated \u2013 although similar to what we did with SkyOne moving from PA and filter and switch and brining it in with a single calibrated engine. Similar to what we did in SkyOne, we were able to craft that with our DRx product on the downlink side.","So for us, at DRx is a $3, $4, could be $5 worth of content in certain phones. A competitor that may want to play in that area could attempt to work a discrete solution with lower content, but it just wouldn't get you the performance. And what we're been able to see and really test and measure is that our customers really value that efficiency that high efficient solution that brings in higher data rate, doesn't have the losses that you have in a discrete system. And Skyworks' doing all that calibration and harmonization work to deliver that in a simple solution. So that's kind of how it works out. And we have realized content and flagship products that's over $5 in value.","Bill Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And maybe switching to broad markets. I guess if you were to exclude Wi-Fi, gateways or routers and consider design pipeline, how would you rank the next, let's say, fastest-growing segments in terms of content and revenue growth opportunities over the next year or so?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. There's a real wide list \u2013 a long list of proliferation across connected home applications. We mentioned a few things like Sonos, things like Nintendo, we've got Nest product, Google Nest portfolio with their Dropcam, with high-speed Wi-Fi. It may have Wi-Fi device, but it's a unique product. Whole series of opportunities there, factory automation, end-to-end with our ZigBee portfolio.","So there's quite a few. And then if you want to move that into automotive as an adjacent market to IoT, we're starting to see really rich LTE systems that are driving all of what I said, but doing it at a bulked up level of performance to capture the kind of the needs that we see in automotive.","Operator","Thank you. We now have a question from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks. This is Vivien on behalf of Tim. So my first question is a follow-up on China. I'm just wondering for CQ1, how much of the revenue is from China? And what is assumed for CQ2? Thanks.","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","So it was approximately 25%.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","For both quarters? And...","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, yeah. Pretty much.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then my second question is that, for BAW, how much will it cost to fully develop or commercialize your captive IP? Should we think probably a few hundred million dollars?","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","For BAW? For BAW, could you ask that question one more time?","Operator","Just a moment now, we'll reopen her line.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","I am sorry.","Operator","That's fine. Okay, your line is open again.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. So I'm wondering for BAW, how much will it cost to fully develop or commercialize your own captive IP? Should we think in the range of a few hundred million dollars?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","So bulk acoustic wave filter technology, it's an area that we understand completely. And what we've been doing to address the frequencies that today have been the domain of BAW, it's really about how do we address higher frequency. So we can do some of that with our TC-SAW, we can do some of that by enhancing our TC-SAW, and we could also work with partners to deliver bulk acoustic wave technology. And, certainly, the ability to do it organically is within our capability, as a company. It's difficult to assess what the value would be.","One of the things I want to make clear to all of you is that we can address high-band solutions today in many ways. There's still a number of phones where we deliver high-band PAs and there's filters outside of the module, and there's plenty of opportunities. We've outlined a few today where we have a SkyOne solution that has fully integrated filter PA system that we're able to sell, and we use some of our foundry partners. So we're not excluded from that. But, yeah, I mean the opportunity to invest in organically is always out there on the table. We assess that all the time.","Operator","Thank you. We now have a question from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you. Just a follow-up question on China. You mentioned it was weak, you had kind of expected that. Any signals or signs you're looking for from customers in terms of when that might inflect positively again for the China smartphone market?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. Well, we're actually seeing it already, Craig. When we talk \u2013 or actually we probably didn't talk about it \u2013 but our coverage right now in the quarter is over 90%. We've got our China backlog where we want it to be for the quarter. We are continuing, as I said, to lead with the higher end players. Huawei being the top, and then go to Oppo and Vivo. That's becoming a bigger part of our revenue. The second and third tier white box market, less significant. So we're very confident in the recovery because we're already seeing it in our orders.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then a question for Kris on kind of inventory levels and how you think you're positioned given the expectation for strong growth into the back half of the year. Do you think you'd be in a position to be building inventory or you work off inventory? How are you managing that?","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. So we did build a little bit of inventory in the second quarter. Inventory was up $22 million, but that's clearly in anticipation of the strong sequential revenue growth that we see in the next three quarters \u2013 the June quarter, the September quarter and the December quarter. And so, we expect to continue to build some further inventory in the current quarter in Q3, all in anticipation, of course, to the peak, which is in the December quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton","Thanks for taking my questions, and congratulations on the progress. Liam, back to maybe BAW filters or maybe your TC-SAW products. With some of the high-band wins you've been getting, are you addressing most of those wins with TC-SAW or are these BAW-based products? I guess just what's the trend and what's your expectation?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. No, that's a great question. There's a lot of detail behind that. Well, there's a couple of ways to go. I mean, on one hand, we have an ability to deliver high-frequency products that don't have filters at all. There's still a market where we're selling multi-mode, multi-band PAs that are high-frequency, up to 5 gigs. So to be clear, that continues to be available. And filters could be outside of that.","Then we have our integrated solutions, our SkyOne solutions. We can deliver our SkyOne to some customers by taking TC-SAW and enhancing that a little bit with tuning and getting to performance levels with good filtering and good PA technology, which again we have in-house. We have our own gallium arsenide fabs in-house. We can craft our recipe device by device. We're able to deliver that to certain parts of the market.","Higher end or higher performing needs with certain OEMs we'll have to bring in BAW potentially from a third-party, a foundry partner that we've already engaged with and have a relationship with. So we've been that in some of our solutions. There's a number of ways to go.","But another thing to think about here, as we move out into 5G, we talked about this in the last call, there are some technical changes in the way mobile systems will work. And in 5G, we see it move to time division duplexing from currently frequency division, FDD, frequency division duplexing. FDD, which is more or less the standard today, does require BAW duplexes at the higher frequencies.","If you go to TDD, time division, you can actually deliver that performance with high-end TC-SAW; you don't necessarily need a duplexer. So a TC-SAW filter can be effective. So there's some changes there that will move in the favor of our current portfolio. But at the same time, we are not precluded from addressing high-band. We're doing it today. We have a number of paths to do it. And we're selling systems, not just filters. So that's really our story.","Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton","Thanks for that, Liam. And, Kris, your guidance for OpEx may be a little higher than I would've expected. You mentioned IoT investment. Is that the kind of the new base to work for forward, or just what are your thoughts for the next few quarters?","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. So OpEx for Q2 came in at $116 million, which was 13.7% to revenue. And we are continuing to make the necessary investments to grow the business; grow the business in mobile, grow the business in IoT. Especially in IoT, we are adding some resources from an R&D point of view, as well as a sales and marketing point of view to address that diverse market segment.","But the way to think about OpEx is that we target 13% of OpEx to revenue on a full-year basis. There will always be some seasonal situations where it's slightly higher and slightly lower. But on a full-year basis, the OpEx envelope is on or about 13% to revenue. And we are tracking very well within that envelope.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Burton with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Mike A. Burton - Longbow Research","Hey, guys. And congrats on a great quarter and guide, especially relative to some of the China headwinds. Just wanted to drill into a little bit on the June guide. Your Korean customer obviously was a big ramp for you in Q1. They talked about some weaker unit trends in their June quarter in the low and mid-end and then stronger high-end. I'm just wondering if you're expecting that ramp in the high-end to continue for you, or are we still looking for more sequential growth out of that customer?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure, Mike. Yeah, we actually, for us, the content gains that we're able to drive with Samsung are still sustainable and we still see some room here, and they will be up in Q3. Huawei is another one that we see nice sequential momentum here going into Q3, and broad markets again will be up. So those will be some of the major drivers.","And, obviously, our largest customer is in a \u2013 we're in a period now with our largest customer where we're really readying for a pretty powerful second half ramp with their units in our content position. So those are kind of the puts and takes here. I think the big impacts here for Q3 and the upside on guidance is really relative to the big content moves that we have with Huawei and Samsung.","Mike A. Burton - Longbow Research","Great. Thanks. That's helpful. And then also, Kris, how should we be thinking about gross margins versus revenue growth in the second half of the calendar year? Any puts and takes on mix, or how should we think about that from a contribution margin basis? Thanks, and congrats again.","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","So as I stated before, we do expect three quarters of strong sequential revenue growth. And we also expect three quarters of gross margin improvements benefiting from that revenue growth as well, of course, as all the other operational efficiency that we continue to drive there.","From a mix point of view, there's always some minor changes that works against us or in favor of us. Obviously, we continue to add more value, add more complexity. We continue to grow our IoT business, which had slightly above-average gross margin. And so, from a mix point of view, there is not a lot of movement there.","Operator","Thank you, again, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Griffin for any closing remarks.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Thank you all for participating today.

This call is being recorded.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Steve Ferranti, Vice President of Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Ferranti, please go ahead.","Stephen Ferranti ","Thank you, Greg. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks Second Fiscal Quarter 2015 Conference Call. Joining me today are Dave Eldritch, Don Palette and Liam Griffin. Dave will begin today's call with a business overview followed by Don's financial review and outlook. We will then open the lines for your questions.","Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those noted in our earnings release and those detailed from time to time in our SEC filings. I would also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we will discuss today are from a non-GAAP income statement, consistent with the format we've used in the past. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave for his comments on the quarter.","David J. Aldrich","Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. I'm very pleased to announce Skyworks strong financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2015, with revenue and EPS exceeding our guidance, and significantly, outpacing normal seasonal patterns. Our outperformance underscores the success of our diversification strategy, as broad-based contributions across our customer base, end markets and product lines drives growth well in excess of the market. Our business continues to perform at a very high level, as we capitalize on powerful drivers, fueled by the global proliferation of connectivity.","At the same time, by leveraging our architectural and integration leadership, we are enhancing our competitive differentiation, expanding profitability, while creating greater value for our customers. This combination of strong industry tailwinds and an enriched value proposition enables us to consistently provide above-market growth and to deliver best-in-class financial returns with robust cash flow.","Specifically, during the quarter, we produced revenue of $762 million, representing a 58% year-over-year top line growth. We maintained gross margins of 46.7%, offsetting quarterly seasonal patterns, and up 200 basis points year-over-year. We also generated operating income of $259 million, that's up 99% year-over-year. We posted a $1.15 earnings per share. And we guided revenue in June to be up to $800 million, that's 36% up year-over-year, along with a 130 basis point sequential improvement in gross margins and $1.28 in EPS.","We are reaping the benefits of our dual H strategy of providing leadership and custom integrated solutions, while continuing to diversify into high-margin verticals. And as a measure of our progress, in 2011, around 60% of our revenue came from single-function devices for mobile applications. Today, more than 2\/3 of our revenue is comprised of integrated mobile systems and broad markets, which are our fastest growth areas, driving improved financial returns, and putting us on a clear path towards 50% gross margins and above. And as the leader in complex RF and analog integration, we're the primary beneficiary of the ongoing industry shift towards systems solutions. And as the communications architectures continue to advance in complexity, we're becoming an integral part of our customers' development roadmaps, providing more value in the overall supply chain. This is creating a fundamental shift in our business model; simply put, more complex systems drive increased profitability.","Now our Q2 design wins highlight some examples of the success we've had in capturing new high-value system-level opportunities. In our broad markets business, we've recently won a complete Wi-Fi system module, integrating a third-party SOC and supporting Skyworks analog content for video monitoring solutions for Google. We've won a suite of Skyworks products in Machine-to-Machine modules for industrial applications from CR wireless, and over $20 of content powering a new small cell base station platform.","We also have multiple design wins for OnStar telematics platforms in GM's global fleet. In Mobile, we're now enabling Samsung's Galaxy S6 platform with SkyOne Ultra as well as our switching and Wi-Fi connectivity products. We've ramped our SkyOne mini-platform with a numerous Chinese smartphone OEMs, expanding our SkyOne family. And we launched switching and connectivity modules in Google's Nexus 6 smartphone platform. These design wins highlight our competitive edge in complex integration, and we'll positively contribute to our growth trajectory for the next few years.","Now, I'll turn it over to Don for a more in-depth review of our financial results.","Donald W. Palette","Thanks, Dave. And thanks for joining us, everyone. We appreciate that. Revenue for the second quarter was $762.1 million, ahead of our prior guidance of $750 million, and up more than 58% versus the year-ago quarter. Gross profit was $356 million or 46.7% of revenue, ahead of our guidance, and up 200 basis points from the second quarter of fiscal 2014. We maintained gross margins on a sequential basis in spite of the seasonal revenue impact, highlighting the strength of our underlying business fundamentals.","Operating expenses were $97 million consisting of R&D expense of $63 million and SG&A expense of $34 million. We generated $258.9 million of operating income, roughly twice that of the year-ago quarter, yielding a 34% operating margin. Our cash tax rate for the quarter was 13.5%, resulting in net income of $224.6 million or $1.15 of diluted earnings per share as compared with diluted EPS of $0.62 in the year-ago quarter.","Turning to our second quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement. We generated $155 million in cash flow from operations, putting our first half total at $538 million. We also invested $84 million in capital expenditures with depreciation of $39 million. We distributed $73 million to shareholders through our dividend and stock repurchase activity, and exited the quarter with just over $1 billion in cash on hand and no debt.","Moving to our product mix for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Power amplifiers represented 31% of revenue. Integrated mobile systems was 47%. And broad markets was 22%. Once again, integrated mobile systems was our fastest-growing category, up 139% year-over-year, highlighting the ongoing shift towards higher-margin systems solutions, which is taking place across our customer base. Our broad market product lines which serve the Connected Home, networking, media, automotive, and medical markets have grown at 27% year-to-date, and that's well ahead of the [indiscernible] analog market, helping to mitigate some of the seasonal trends in the mobile business.","Turning to our third quarter business outlook. We expect revenue to be $800 million, and that's up 36% year-over-year. At this revenue level, we anticipate gross margin to be 48%, representing a 130 basis point sequential increase, and that's driven by a combination of growing adoption of our custom integrated solutions and precision analog products, increasing global scale, and enhanced vertical integration and our ongoing operational initiatives. These factors have created new baseline for our business model, and we now recommend more than 55% incremental gross margin from the new Q3 level, providing a path to continued margin improvement ahead. And all of this puts us on a firm path towards our target of at least 50% gross margin for the company. We expect operating expenses to be approximately $99.5 million; for other line, we anticipate around $100,000 in income from interest income and other expenses; and a cash tax rate around 12%. We project our tax rate to stay at this level for the remainder of 2015 fiscal year.","Looking forward, we continue to see a tax -- cash tax rate in a 14% to 15% range for fiscal 2016. We expect our share count to be around 195.9 million shares, and that results in a third quarter EPS of $1.28. The stage has been set for a strong 2015, giving us a high level of confidence in our near-term trajectory and accelerating our progress towards $7 in annualized EPS.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave.","David J. Aldrich","Thank you, Don. For the remainder of the call, I would like to provide some added perspective on the underlying trends that we see fueling our growth in the coming years. At the highest level, the world is rapidly becoming more interconnected, fueling an explosion of network devices along with massive growth in wireless data traffic. According to recent report, mobile data usage grew by 69% last year, driven by proliferation of smartphones and other interconnected devices within the Internet of Things, along with the adoption of high data rate services like 4G, LTE and 802.11ac. Now for service providers, this growing ecosystem of connected devices provides a vital gateway for new revenue streams, linking millions of subscribers with lucrative services like on-demand music and video content, over-the-top programming, security and cloud-based enterprise services.","At the same time, consumers are recognizing that the quality of the connectivity pipe is a key factor in their overall user experience and are upgrading to more powerful devices, bigger data plans and faster connections. The end result is a raise by OEMs across our served markets to provide leading-edge performance, creating a market opportunity that is growing at a mid-teens pace for the foreseeable future. And an addressable market for Skyworks, it's growing even faster. I'd like to highlight 3 key trends that fuel this: First, there's an explosion in RF and analog complexity, and it's driving robust growth in our served markets and a consolidation of market share. Skyworks' mission is to simplify this increasingly more challenging technical environment for our customers. Across the board, we see more content opportunities in each successive generation of device and integrated solutions displacing conventional discrete components. As this happens, a host of component providers, who lack our technology brand, our integration capabilities and system expertise, are simply unable to keep pace.","Second, we are rapidly expanding our footprint within existing customers and existing markets, increasing our serviceable opportunity. Our systems solutions enable us to sweep in an unprecedented amount of new Skyworks content, like filtering, like tuning and power management. And a prime example is our high-performance filter portfolio, where our unique technology edge is enabling higher levels of system performance through tighter band spacing, less interference and a more efficient signal path.","On top of this, we're launching entirely new product categories like we serve -- like we see diversity modules, which support enhance download speeds and represent a substantial expansion of our addressable opportunities.","Third and finally, we're leveraging our decades of experience in mobile. We are enabling a growing array of devices in adjacent markets to become seamlessly interconnected, like wearable technologies, home automation and the connected car, utilizing enabling technologies like 4G, like GPS, local area networking standards and low-energy near-field protocols like ZigBee and Bluetooth.","So in closing, we remain quite optimistic about our prospects for the remainder of 2015 and beyond. And we created a unique business model, tether to the global wave of connectivity and combining consistent above-market top line growth, with the financial returns of a best-in-class, diversified analog company. This concludes our prepared remarks.","Operator, let's open the lines please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mike Walkley from Canaccord.","Thomas Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Just want to talk about the smartphone market. There's been some concern of inventory in China. I was wondering if you could comment on your China business, if you saw any impact from inventories related to March results or June guidance. And also, there's been some concern of some Android OEMs, pausing the higher-end smartphones to avoid competition with the strong Apple and Samsung's new launch? I'm just wondering if you had seen any push outs from your Android customers? And how that might affect your September quarter's seasonal outlook?","David J. Aldrich","Sure, Michael. With respect to China, as you know, I mean, that is a very large multi-year growth opportunity for Skyworks. We're actually quite encouraged by the print with China mobile with 50 million LTE ads in the March quarter, that's real bullish for us. And we see that's trending to the mid-250 level or higher, going into the balance of the year. Now on the near-term, there was some choppiness in the March quarter as noted, some of the 2G and 3G players lost some share, has some declines, 4G continued to ramp. And we also saw some real strong performance with global Tier 1's participating in the China region. So net-net, it's a great cycle for us. It's an opportunity. We love the 4G upgrade. And we are well-positioned.","Thomas Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Right. And just a follow-up in the -- with the ramp in LTE, any comments on September quarter seasonality as it relates to China and maybe your overall market trends?","Donald W. Palette","Well, like I said Dave, it's a little too early to be specific about September. As you know, the second half is the strongest part of the year in much of our business, and it's usually up sequentially high single-digit. I think that the traction we have in China and the position we have with our SOC partners or our baseband partners will allow us to continue to ride that 4G wave, and we expect to have a very strong second half in China. But as Liam mentioned, there's also a competition from foreign brands, an fortunately, we are well-positioned there as well. So I think we'll have a less volatility given OEM share shifts. But I do expect in the second half, the LTE upgrade cycle to continue to march towards, I don't know, call it, conservatively 250 -- 225 to 250 number for 2015.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Schafer from Oppenheimer.","Richard E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just maybe first question is -- maybe just a quick update on the competitive landscape that you see, any changes there? And maybe specifically, what are you making some of the speculation out there that Murata had secured some content -- some bad content with your largest customer in the coming refresh later this year?","David J. Aldrich","We haven't seen much of change in the competitive landscape. But specifically, with respect to Murata, they are not a new competitor. They've been around for a long time. And their strength has traditionally been in passive, in SAW filters and in some modules, particularly on the receive side. We do come across them in a limited number of fairly niche segments. And we've been quite successful competing head-to-head. We haven't seen any change in the competitive landscape. And our confidence that we continue to leverage more content and benefit from increasing complexity with more TAM is very solid for us.","Richard E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","May be a follow-up to that, Dave. You guys obviously had nice content with the latest Samsung, the G S6 refresh. What are your expectation or can you give us any color on what your expectations are later this year with your largest customer on their refresh?","David J. Aldrich","Sure. Obviously, we can't comment on that specific customer. But in general, the architectures are getting much more complex. And we're very fortunate to have visibility out, 2; in some cases 3 years in terms of the overall architectures that are being deployed to deal with all this complexity. We see nothing slowing that down, so it's obviously a tailwind for us. We're seeing more addressable content in those kinds of functions you typically think about for us, power amplifiers, duplexers, Wi-Fi, switching and control. But we're seeing awful lot now in what we're able to produce in terms of complex, antenna tuning, devices on the receive path, lighting, power management. And I will say that, as an incumbent, we've been very successful and quite proud of it in maintaining and growing our footprint with each successive design with all our major customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Dave, my question is, is there a way to contrast either the amount of content or the number of sockets that were addressable by you guys last year versus this year? I'm trying to get a sense for what is the diversity of the kind of content that you are going after versus, say, the last one or 2 years?","David J. Aldrich","Yes, it has been a steady March, Vivek, I mean, it's hard to talk about in one year cycles. But if you went back 3 years, we were very strong in multimode and discrete power amplifiers. We had a lot -- strong switch portfolio. And we were entering connectivity in our Wi-Fi portfolio. And we did an acquisition, in fact. There, we also bought a power management company. And over the last couple of years, we've seen a huge increase in Wi-Fi connectivity, starting with our lead customers in flagship phones and now populating across the entire smartphone landscapes. That's been a huge upside for us. I think we've got about 51% or more of that market. We just have the best overall solution. We can shield it. We can integrate it. We can lessen some of the interference impact of having more and more Wi-Fi, sitting side-by-side and next to more and more cellular bands. We've seen -- our power devices both at the display, at the camera flash, particularly dual-mode, that's been adding content for us. So an AC upgrade cycle is very important to us, power amplifier duplexers. And we've seen -- we introduced SkyOne as an opportunity to fully leverage the breadth of products and the system capability of the company. And while that's become a diversified set of products within that family, it's really taking off in terms of being able to enable more filters, less filters, more switching. I would say, it's all of the same. As we commented on earlier, I think 15% is a good marker for existing TAM growth. I think we can do much better than that, because we're not only riding that wave of existing TAM growth, but more functionality.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And then, Dave, how do look at the right mix of handsets versus the non-handset opportunity for Skyworks? Obviously, you are growing very well in both. But is there a target mix as you look out the next few years? And do you think M&A, sort of, fits somewhere in getting towards that target mix?","David J. Aldrich","Yes, I think the -- I would look at it this way. It's not a mix of mobile, nonmobile. It's really a mix of integrated devices and nonintegrated devices. So we see, kind of, if you look at broad-markets business, plus our integrated mobile business, that's where we are very sticky, where our customers see a great deal of value, where there's more and more content for us and far fewer competitors versus for example, a discrete PA. So we look at that business, we like that mix of business growing to the vast majority of our company. And that's what's happening today, our PA business continues to get smaller, smaller and smaller. Our discrete business get smaller and smaller. And we're overwhelmingly becoming a systems solution provider. And M&A continues to be and has been a central element of that. If you think about it, last few years, we bought a Wi-Fi business, connectivity business, we bought a power and lighting business, we also bought a high performance filter business. And those have all been part of a vertical market strategy, where we can add more value. But an effort -- a concerted effort to be more sticky and to compete on the basis of system performance, where we have few, if any competitors, unless how good is our component.","Donald W. Palette","And just one point I'd like to add. The exciting point of what Dave said to is, if you look at the way we've now split the revenues, that broad market pace is up 27% for the first half of this year versus last year. And there aren't any diversified analog companies growing like that. So I mean it's really, really got a lot of momentum behind it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cody Acree from Ascendiant.","Cody Grant Acree - Ascendiant Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Maybe follow-up on that question, just for the next quarter when you look at handsets versus the broad-based, when you look at your growth expectations, can you just, kind of, maybe talk about the contribution of each?","Liam K. Griffin","Yes, sure. Well, we certainly expect growth in both segments, and we will deliver growth in both segments. You have a great opportunity in smartphones in our core markets and mobile, as we've outlined with our global Tier 1's and also the China cycle. And as Dave mentioned, it really is about a growing TAM and our ability to capture more and more of this with sticky system solutions. On the broad market side, we are seeing a vast majority of the opportunities in new markets, automotive, wearable technology, and then, our core business in broad includes infrastructure and access points. All those segments are moving up and will continue to be upside into the second half.","David J. Aldrich","Yes, in the last quarter, we were up nearly 30% in the broad markets' business. And of course, if you track the diversified airline companies, their growth is nowhere as near to that. So you can see that we're really focused on the right device categories, leveraging what we're good at it, mobile with some of these markets becoming interconnected in a wireless way or in a mobile way for the first time.","Liam K. Griffin","And just specifically to those segments that we split out, you've got broad markets and integrated mobile systems growing. And our standalone paid business is down -- flat to down slightly. So again, the growth is coming from those 2 areas when you look at the guidance.","Cody Grant Acree - Ascendiant Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","All right. And Don, obviously, the gross margin expectations are getting very attractive. Can you talk about operating margin leverage? Are you seeing, maybe a similar, I guess, delta from where you are today to what your expectations might eventually be?","Donald W. Palette","Well, there's a tremendous amount of leverage still in the model, and the best way to handle that is that we've now given you new guidance on a baseline of what we've just guided 48% margin, and you're going to drop that through on whatever, how you handicap the top line growth at 55%, the incremental margin. And so that's going to trend very quickly to 50% and beyond. We're going to continue to see leverage on our OpEx base, I think we got a proven track record of being able to do that. So when you add those 2 things together, you're going to see some very attractive returns as you go forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Suji Desilva from Topeka.","Sujeeva Desilva - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Can you tell us where we are in the [indiscernible] option of diversely received modules versus just a switch for diversity received? How far long are we in that cycle? And then what's the content [indiscernible] as that takes off?","Liam K. Griffin","Sure, Suji. We're actually in the very early innings. So on deployment of that technology, we have a great opportunity to advance data rates with this technology. Our customers love it. It's a significant content boost to our mobile portfolio. But in terms of what we're doing right now, we have couple of meaningful design wins, but there's a whole slate of opportunities that we're pursuing right now. We're in sampling stage and development stage, high degree of customization, also bringing in technologies like filters and SOI switch and really interesting things being brought together. And so you should look forward to more commentary on this as we go through the year.","Sujeeva Desilva - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then on the switch business, can you upgrade us on whether the supplies caught up the demand, yet? And how the demand has been in that business?","Liam K. Griffin","In the switch business?","Sujeeva Desilva - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Liam K. Griffin","Yes, yes. No, I think we are certainly seeing a lot of appetite for switching. As you see, more and more of these bands and in traditional phones, where you don't have the diversity architecture, you're dealing with SOI or PM switching. It's been a robust run in that technology. Supply and demand are about in balance right now, and we still continue to do quite a bit of business in that segment.","Operator","Your next question comes the line of Edward Snyder from Charter Equity.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","Several questions, if I could. On the filter business, now that it's mostly internal here, is this -- would you say this is what your larger drivers for the margin, given you don't have to buy them in the open market anymore or is it mostly just integrated modules? And then to your DRx, receive diversity modules, are those active parts or those are mostly passive, and if they are passive, wouldn't you be competing with someone like Murata for those? And I have a follow-up for this.","David J. Aldrich","Yes, just on the margin piece of that. We've got a lot of things that are driving that continued strong top line growth, because volume matters, clearly, in our business, this favorable mix towards integrated mobile systems growth, which have very nice attractive incremental margins, operational execution and the filters are part of it. So there's multiple facets of the margin expansion, but filters are part of it.","Liam K. Griffin","And with respect to the receives or the DRx. The interesting part there is, obviously, you have complex, low-loss switching, a lot of filtering. And the filtering's becoming very tricky, and the need for very tight spacing and high-performance. The other thing is, there are architectures that I think will begin to look for in that receive path, the amplification of very low noise amplifier that could be segmented around frequency band. So I think the content there is, if I have to ask you a question, I think it's very understated in most peoples model, I think it's going to be a big growth driver. And the competitive nature is going to be very tough, because it's going to be a combination of active compound semiconductors, passive devices. And it's going to be an MCM, I don't think it's going to be a slug of ceramic, I think it's going to be a complex, multi-layered MCM that pulls all that together. And as you know, we're quite strong there.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","And then, if I could, in terms of filter capacity, I know it's been tough, and you've got the Panasonic asset now, which is a stellar asset, especially TC. Dave, how do you -- you set a billion filters last last quarter, how is that, is your capacity keeping up or you're going to have to spend more to stay upon that given what you just said DRx is and a bunch of the other products now are going to be pulling through those filters and you are one of only 2 who can even make those products? So how should capacity look in that regard? And doesn't what you just said in terms of [indiscernible] eliminate many of your competitors, only maybe 2, maybe 3 people can do that part?","David J. Aldrich","Yes, that's right, Ed. And the capacity has been a little tight, because we've just ramped it so fast. [indiscernible] having, but we've really been able to hire some terrific folks. We've put a lot of capital in place. The yields have come way up from when it was an asset owned by Panasonic. And so I'm actually thrilled with the performance of that team. But if you look at our capital expenditures and Don's comment on what to expect going forward, that's really in 2 areas: It's in filters; and it's in modules. So you should expect us to continue to ramp that up, I think it will be more than a $1 billion this year in high-performance SAW filters. And I think next year, it's going to be where we hold on your hat, I think the filter demand is going to be really high. And temp comp is really starting to tackle some pretty thorny system systems. We think we can deploy it in lieu of certainly a SAW filter; and in some cases, a bulk device.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Stoss from Craig-Hallum.","Anthony Joseph Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Two part. I would love to hear your views on carrier aggregation and how you see that continue to play out going forward? I don't know if I missed this, Don, your CapEx spend last quarter and what to expect for the remainder of the year?","Liam K. Griffin","Sure, Tony. I mean, certainly carrier aggregation is becoming more and more critical now as you go into these highly complex 4G phones, data rates are really in high demand, and the complexity in a system goes up. So we have tremendous solutions, some of our SkyOne Ultra technology is actually building a carrier aggregation capability inside of this complex PAD module, that's one of the kind of nuances of our architecture, how we take this complexity and not only manage the amplification, but also, the switching and the treading together these bands that you see in carrier aggregation. And that's another market where we've got some design wins, with a leading industry players, but we're starting to see more and more folks in China and other markets pick up the technology.","Donald W. Palette","On the CapEx, we've spent $87 million in Q1, $84 million in the past quarter, so what we're seeing in the second half and that split we are making those investments both for filter and module capacity, that's typically where you are seeing the spending. And based on our outlook, we believe that we could see second half levels probably somewhere what we've seen in the first half. The thing with the CapEx investments for us, it's clearly one that enables you, we've just said -- we've just made a step function change in the margin, both new starting point and the incremental. And part of the benefit you're seeing is from these CapEx investments that we are making. So it's a very positive leading indicator for us and we're spending that money, we've got very good visibility in the volume and it's going to generate shareholder returns and benefits. So it's a positive thing for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long from BMO Capital Markets.","Timothy Long - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research","Two questions, if I could. First, you mentioned the SkyOne and SkyOne Ultra traction, I'm just curious if you could give us a sense, do you think these wins are coming for new sockets for you or do you think it's just kind of upgrades from people that were using some of your more discrete products? So is it resulting in a market share by new wins? And then, secondly, if you could just talk a little bit about the Wi-Fi market, a lot of interactions there as well. Do you think that wave 2 could potentially be kind of step function increase there with all the different radios? I'm just curious on your take on that and timing.","Liam K. Griffin","Sure. No problem. With respect to SkyOne, it's been a combination of upgrading existing customers and in many cases forging our initial engagement with SkyOne and new accounts. We're seeing the platform count go up. We've got about 8 products in production right now, and by the time, we exit the calendar year, we'll probably have 10 more platforms in production. And again, the ability to customize and put the specific bands, leveraging our filters in many cases, has been one of the differentiators. So that portfolio is doing quite well. And this is really a turning point in our SkyOne architecture and our SkyOne traction. With respect to Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi continues to be a leadership portfolio for us at Skyworks, it hits the IoT space, it's been hitting mobile, we're seeing opportunities in media over the top boxes, we're guessing opportunities in automotive that we've mentioned. And we see 11ac strength that we bring to market as one of our differentiators, and it will be a portfolio that grows well in the second half through 2016 and beyond.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Burton with Brean Capital.","Michael A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to talk a little bit about pricing, it looks like the low and mid-tier smartphone segments have been hurting us at the expense of the high end, where you guys have been clearly gaining content. Just wondering if you are seeing any change in any of the pricing dynamics?","David J. Aldrich","Nothing, in particular, as we have -- as we've migrated our portfolio into the devices, we've been describing in this entire call, whether it's SkyOne, Ultra SkyOne any for the open market in China, and so on, so forth. They're really not products that are subject to the same kind of pricing dynamics. So we see kind of gentle low- to mid-single digit pricing on a year-over-year basis for most of our devices. And I don't see anything changing there at all.","Michael A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","And then, also, on follow-up on previous comments on China. Obviously, Liam mentioned that there's been some pockets there. I'm just curious as to how Q1 performed for you guys versus your expectation for Q2, and if you're seeing growth in Q2, is it really -- are you starting to see more of a mix up from 3 mode to 5 mode devices in that segment?","Liam K. Griffin","Yes, sure. In fiscal Q2 at the March quarter, we were flattish, may be down 1 point or 2, but in the current quarter, in the June quarter, we are seeing growth, and it's coming across a number of platforms. We do a really good job of working with all the chipset providers, Mediatek's, [indiscernible] Qualcomm, we're seeing some success with names like Xiaomi and Lenovo and even Huawei and ZTE. So while we feel really good about the second half in China, a little bit of a bumpy start, we were able to navigate through that with our heavy allocation towards 4G, but we start to see the momentum come back into that market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie from Raymond James.","Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","It seems like one of the big drivers here is the shift to LTE. And -- so something you could talk a little bit about how you see LTE rolling out regionally over the next couple of years, I'll see China hopeful this year. How does that expand -- extend over the next couple of years?","Liam K. Griffin","Sure, yes. We speak a lot about China with some of the developed nations, United States and Europe, et cetera. LTE has been rolling for a while, and china is a great opportunity because you have nearly 1 billion subscribers, and less than 20% are carrying an LTE product. So there's a huge upgrade cycle, and that upgrade cycle will then create additional turnover in years to come, so that's why we make such an important distinction around the China market. And if you think about, you've got a band count increase for sure, you have a filter count increase that we can leverage in the modules. You also have more switching arms, you have the carrier application technology we talked about, the ability to deliver high-performance receive technology with DRX, power management, and when you build this kind of an engine, invariably there's a Wi-Fi attached. And so we're trading that opportunity against what we were 2, 3 years ago, 2G and 3G phones in China that may have had 150 to 250 of content. So that's really where you see that opportunity.","David J. Aldrich","I think you should think about is being, something that will sweep into all territories over time, throughout the world, and it's really the same dynamic that will drive an N from an ac implementation, 802.11, I think there's 5G behind it by the way. We're doing architectures today that are sweeping millimeter wave functionality, as the world kind of looks for allocation of more frequency, the problem is bandwidth at high speed. And bandwidth at high speed is only going to be solved as consumers demand it more and more and more, and carriers find it as a way to follow the money, that you're going to see it sweep across the entire world. And there will be a generation of technology right behind it because it's all about bandwidth.","Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. That's very helpful. And then, the numbers were good I am just trying to think another way, but I was just curious, is there any FX impacts that you guys had as well with numbers have been. Maybe you know a little bit better, without any FX headwinds?","Donald W. Palette","No. I mean, all of our top lines in dollars, so the only impact we have is dollar-peso for Mexicali expenses and a little bit now at the end with filter acquisition as they are actually -- because they are liability positions with a strong dollar that was actually favorable, so it\u2019s not material, but we haven't had any analysis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar from Stephens.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Dave, I was wondering, if I can get some put and takes around your U.S.-based customer, you're large Korean customer in China, as you look into the June guidance?","David J. Aldrich","As you know, June is typically kind of the transitional quarter. We're going to be up because as we've mentioned we see some growth in China, we see some portion of reasonable growth going into June, in China. We see quite a bit in abroad markets continuing to chuckle along, so a sequential growth and year-over-year growth. I believe that we're in the enviable position of not needing to worry too much about OEM share shifts, because if you look at the content and teardown reports, whether they're MediaTek enabled, indigenous OEM [indiscernible] or if it's Samsung or others. We just continue to look to drive that content higher. We're very well positioned and I just don't worry too much, in terms of Skyworks overall financial performance about the overall OEM share shifts, but we are well positioned among the flagship models that I think you're referring to.","Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","That was helpful. And as a follow up, if I can ask you, you're clearly diversifying into non-handset markets. What is the most exciting non-handset market, by end market that you see for yourself and Skyworks?","David J. Aldrich","It's been really around the home, so if you think about it, if you look at the devices, thermostats, it really kind of started with smart meters, and it moved into all kinds of categories from gaming, now lighting the 802.11ac space with these really complex home routers, it's a huge opportunity for us, these media gateways that are being provided by the various cable and wireless service providers have many dollars of content for us. So that's exciting. I like variables a lot, because the consumer content there is high, and we've got a good entree with our low-power Wi-Fi and switching products. And automotive has been a bit of a sleeper. We've had high dollar content with high margin, but only recently if we start to see with the advent of smart automobile, that kind of connected hub environment that exists in the car. We're seeing a lot of design activity there, and a lot of very high margin win. So it's not -- it's no longer a trivial amount of our revenues, it's becoming rather meaningful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis from B. Riley.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","Don, I want to go back to your guidance on incremental gross margin switches, very robust and at a level that I think a lot of us thought was possible, and you're giving a nice run way there. As you look at the underlying drivers to those incrementals going forward, integrated solutions mix, the scale, and operational advantages that you have, it seems like one is more related to pricing for functional value, and other related to driving your unit costs lower. How should we think about the relative contribution of those different factors over time?","Donald W. Palette","I mean, everything that we've talked about is important, our volume hubs in the strong top line is always going to allow us to improve the incremental returns. The favorable product mix is probably right now with the value-add proposition you described, that's probably slightly ahead of some of the operational execution, they're both critical and important, and when you add filters and they're all driving, but I would say the number one driver is, this going to system solution and the value add for the customer. Because that's in our ability to package solutions, which really drives the cost down for us. So I mean, that -- at the end of the day that's probably the number one, but they are all important. You need the model to move the incremental 55%.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","That's very helpful. And the follow-up is somewhat related to that. It\u2019s more of a philosophical question. I'll direct it to you Dave. The company has done a very good job moving the mix of business towards integrated over time. There's still quite a ways to go. Are there any discontinuities either with capital intensity or with R&D intensity? Is the portfolio shifts that you see on the horizon?","David J. Aldrich","Yes, a philosophical question. Okay. Well, the discontinuities have been kind of -- may be ongoing for the last several years, we are seeing the need to have more direct engagement with our customers, with feel folks and business unit people, who have a much broader set of experiences around how to optimize the overall system performance right from the SOC to the antenna and back. So that's been new for us, so we have been kind of upgrading our capability, hiring a lot of folks. So that's a discontinuity, I think we got it. I think we got it under control, I think capital really isn't the issue because fortunately for us the investments we've made in these complex multi-chip modules, really are allowing us to kind of dove tail into a nice mix of internal production versus external production, keep that flexible model, but we're really able to leverage what our customers want and use in MCM-type approach for a much of it. And I guess, in terms of the skills, so the skill upgrade cycle we've been going through has been ongoing for a while. Probably the biggest discontinuity for us that we needed to solve and we are well on our way to hopefully doing that is we really needed to have more of filter passive offerings within our active portfolio. And that was a change for us, that hasn't been traditionally our skill, we've avoided those discrete markets because they tended to be very gross margin challenge, but now it's part of an overall system solutions, they become an intricate set of capabilities for us. And that was a discontinuity that we're continuing to work through.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Ing from MKM Partners.","Ian Lee Ing - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","And -- that question, not the most exciting parts of smartphones, but there's trend towards thinner flagship smartphones, perhaps, do you have any advantages in your shielding and packaging solutions you might be able to exploit. I mean, it seems heat dissipation is a big issue, especially for these big chipsets on the digital side?","David J. Aldrich","Yes, that's right, and it's such a good question actually, because while at the same time you've got heat dissipation, you've got more bands, you've got more things amplifying that want to interfere one another. There's a tremendous amount of pressure on size, both the x and y-axis. So it is a challenge, it's kind of a fun challenge for our engineers, and so you -- but you need to have an arsenal of capabilities that allow you as you say to shield, to mold, and overmold, to thin, and so on. And so -- yes, it is a challenge, it is an opportunity because it's really hard, if not impossible to architect using a set of components, no matter how good those components are. You need to find a way to create a module or set of modules and ICs that interplay well together, they can drop on that PCB and not add a lot of multilayers and we can do it in-house, which is unique.","Ian Lee Ing - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Great. And for my follow-up, I know your integrated mobile business is doing really well here. Can discrete PAs, at one time, you set a target of maybe growing modestly up say 5%, is that still the case, and perhaps, could you remind us where discrete PAs are still doing very well, like in future phones and perhaps, nonmobile applications?","David J. Aldrich","Yes. The discrete PAs will continue to grow through this year, and foreseeable future. It's got -- Sony got the lowest growth rate and -- so the dollars are going to grow year-over-year, it's going to become a smaller and smaller percentage of our total revenue mix. That's clearly going to -- that's been happening every quarter. But they will grow, there's still growth there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton from Needham & Company.","N. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Dave, I wanted just to come back, you guys now for a couple of quarters have highlighted the opportunities you see in the diversity receipt modules. I just sort have of a question for you, I mean, the receive diversity has been around for a while. I think it's been pretty common on Qualcomm chipsets for a number of years. What's really driving the opportunity? Are you seeing greater attach with received diversity and other chipsets, is it really just a greater percentage of phones now shipping with LTE, where received diversity is more common place?","David J. Aldrich","I think it's even simpler than that in a sense, Quinn. It's really all about the capability of streaming, and being able to do it with multiple high-performance, high-speed bands, high-speed paths to that antenna. So first of all, the filtering, as more bands to filter on the received side and those filters have to have -- be able to accommodate tighter spacing, which we think, really tight skirt, if you will, in using filter lingo. That means you're going to have a very high performance filter even on the receive side, which is a lot higher dollar content. In the past, you could take it off a passive duplex or it was good enough, it's nowhere as near good enough. And the other thing is because of the performance is starting to the de-embed or disintegrate, the low noise amplifier that receive power boost that you need, because it needs to be narrow band -- narrower band around the desired frequency and to introduce less loss that you could do on a typical bulk CMOS. So that adds a lot more device category capability for us. So that's really what it is, it gets itself to [ph] -- think of it as just you've going to stream video in that phone over multiple bands, you can't do it through a sloppy duplex or in lossy switch.","Liam K. Griffin","Yes, I mean, I think the application of the real lot benefit here is substantial increase in data, right. Think of it as MIMO architecture for receive, and it has a radical improvement in performance, now it\u2019s not cheap, there's a lot of complexity, there's a lot of value, but we are seeing the high-end customer adapt this quickly and we're also seeing a lot of opportunity in mid-tier. So that's essentially the benefit that we see.","N. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","So just a follow-on question. It sounds like it\u2019s really team expansion on a diversity receive, but wondering if you also think there's a share gain opportunity as part of your strong outlook on the diversity received market.","Donald W. Palette","Yes. It is a share gain opportunity. First and foremost because it's not part of the SOC. It's not part of the SOC, so it is in the domain of the analog module combination of the compound semiconductor passive, and integration of multilayered things like PCBs and LTCC. So it is not the domain of the SOC. And there aren't many companies around. You've got companies that do duplex or a company who could do a passive or could do a switch. Aren't very many companies who can have pull together at the right price point, and that's kind of performance sensitivity that we can.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Alex Gauna from JMP Securities.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","You were talking a little bit earlier about the Internet of Things, the Wi-Fi opportunity, I'm curious of interop tradeshow, and seeing exactly what you're talking about, we now have a\/a on the table, and multi-user MIMO coming. I'm just curious back in a previous day, you used to break it out by analog, which kind of captured some of the Wi-Fi attach and it seems to be growing as fast as cellular, is that still the case when I think about this Wi-Fi opportunity, the Internet of Things opportunity, is that commensurate with your cellular growth and any chance you give us ballpark about what kind of that percentage contribution it is to the business model?","David J. Aldrich","Well, maybe if we can do this with Liam. We said, in the last quarter, it was up 27% year-over-year. So it's been growing very rapidly, much of that is connectivity, it\u2019s the upgrade cycle to ac, it's new device category to outperform on the factory floor and automobile, it's kind of all of that.","Liam K. Griffin","And it's in the market, so if you think about that from a product perspective, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, switching, creating connectivity, and the applications that it's serving now is proliferation of IoT, whether it's media devices, automotive machine to machine variable, energy management and we're seeing that roster expand each and every quarter. So it's a combination of great technologies and then, also hitting a market that's on a growth curve.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, the follow-up on that. I'm kind of curious, obviously, people have already noted the spectacular gross margin with profitability you're putting out. Is the Internet of Things, the Wi-Fi opportunity, is that commensurate with your gross margin profile or is that a negative way difference what you're achieving globally?","Liam K. Griffin","No. Is accretive to the -- it's in line with the incremental returns at a minimum. It's depend upon a specific application, but it certainly doesn't bring that number down.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions.","David J. Aldrich","Okay.

Aldrich","Thanks Steve and welcome everyone. Well we are off to a great start to fiscal 2015 with first quarter revenue, profitability, and earnings all exceeding our guidance driven by strong demand across our served markets and increasing adoption of our integrated systems solutions. We increased revenue by 59% year-over-year. We grew EPS by nearly 90% and we posted record cash flow as we continued to efficiently convert our strong earnings growth into cash returns. ","These financial results reflect our success in capitalizing on a number of powerful industry dynamics while expanding our addressable opportunities and enhancing our value add in the marketplace. In particular we are benefitting from the proliferation of many forms of wireless data as more and more applications leverage the power of connectivity. Along with this we are seeing a dramatic increase in analog complexity driven by higher performance requirements and these market dynamics have created greater content opportunities, closer engagements with our customers, and higher value solutions across the board with a narrowing field of capable competitors. ","Skyworks is uniquely positioned to capitalize in this environment by providing integrated RF and analog solutions which enable our customers to navigate increasingly more complex design challenges resulting in above market growth and superior financial returns for our shareholders. This is playing out across our served markets today as evidenced by our first quarter results. ","Specifically during the quarter we delivered revenue of $806 million that's ahead of our guidance and up more than 59% year-over-year. We produced operating income of $282 million, that's roughly double that over a year ago translating into a 35% operating margin. We posted $1.26 in earnings per share that is up 88% versus a year ago. We generated $383 million in cash flow from operations and we ended the quarter with over a billion dollars of cash on hand with no debt. ","Looking ahead we see our momentum continuing and while March is normally a seasonal slower quarter in the mobile industry, our broadening market footprint, our new product ramps, and an expanding solutions portfolio enable us to mitigate these seasonal patterns, a clear testament to our diversification. Our Q1 design wins highlights some of these diverse opportunities. In mobile or more notable -- our more notable wins include diversity received modules in Smartphone platforms at several OEM customers including Samsung. Now this is a new product category for us representing a compelling growth avenue for Skyworks. ","We also launched SkyLiTE. These are highly integrated systems supporting MediaTek's latest SoC reference design across multiple Smartphone platforms. Switching and connectivity modules across Xiaomi\u2019s leading Smartphone platforms as well. And in the broad markets we\u2019ve successfully captured a suite of 10 Skyworks products for Cisco\u2019s latest home gateway solution supporting multiple cable operators. ","Multiple analog devices in a leading telematics platform for GM vehicles, high reliability analog ICs and avionics systems for Talus, Zigbee connectivity modules for smart light bulbs with Philips LG and others, local area connectivity solutions for Echo and Fire TV streaming media devices at the leading -- and streaming media devices at the leading online retailer. And we captured more than $10 of analog content supporting Technicolor's latest set top box platform for DirecTV. ","So in total 2015 is shaping up to be another great year for Skyworks. With the design momentum we have in place today, we\u2019re poised to continue our track record of above market revenue growth, expanding profit margins, and earnings leverage. Before providing a more detailed view of our market position I\u2019ll turn the call over to Don for a more in-depth review of the financials. ","Donald W. Palette","Thanks Dave and thanks for joining us everyone, we appreciate that. Revenue for the first quarter was $805.5 million ahead of our prior guidance of $770 million and up more than 59% versus the year ago quarter. Gross profit was $376.4 million, a 46.7% of revenue ahead of our guidance and up 220 basis points from the first quarter of fiscal 2014. ","Operating expenses were $94.4 million consisting of R&D expense of $58.7 million and SG&A expense of $35.7 million. We generated $282 million of operating income, roughly twice that the year ago quarter yielding a 35% operating margin. Our cash tax rate for the quarter was 13.5% resulting in net income of $244.8 million or $1.26 of diluted earnings per share as compared with diluted EPS of $0.67 in the year ago quarter, that's $0.08 ahead of our guidance surpassing $5 in annualized EPS. ","Turning to our first quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement, we generated $383 million in cash flow from operations, invested $87 million in capital expenditures with depreciation of $36 million, and we exited the quarter with just over $1 billion in cash on hand and no debt. Moving to our product mix, for the first quarter of fiscal 2015, power amplifiers represented 31% of revenue, integrated mobile systems was 48%, and broad markets was 21%. We saw healthy growth across all product categories with the strongest being integrated mobile systems which benefits from strong December quarter seasonal patterns. ","As a reminder this product category includes SkyOne, SkyLiTE, and our power amplifier duplexers as well as analog products like power management, WiFi, and GPS. It\u2019s also worth noting that our broad markets product lines will serve the connected home, networking, media, automotive, and medical markets grew to 26% year-over-year significantly outpacing the broader semiconductor industry. ","Now for our second quarter business outlook, we expect second quarter revenue to be $750 million representing 56% year-over-year top line growth and significantly better than normal seasonality. At this revenue level we suggest modeling gross margin in the range of 46% to 46.5% with operating expenses of approximately $95.5 million. Online we anticipate 100,000 in expenses of interest income and other expenses and a cash tax rate around 13.5%. We project our tax rate to remain at these levels for the remainder of our 2015 fiscal year. We expect the share count to be around 194.5 million shares resulting in second quarter EPS of $1.12. ","Many of the drivers that support a strong 2015 are already in place, giving us a high level of confidence in our road trajectory. We continue to see opportunities for sustainable margin expansion as we leverage our ongoing capital investments and benefits from growing demand for our custom integrated solutions and precision analog products. We recommend modeling 52% incremental gross margin providing a path to continued margin improvement. ","Longer term we are targeting a growth of 50% gross margin for the company and we have a number of initiatives in place to accelerate our progress towards achieving this goal. All of this gives us a high confidence level on our abilities to extend our track record of investment class financial results putting us on a path towards our goal of $7 in annualized EPS over the long term. With that I will turn the call back over to Dave for his comments on our market trends and growth strategy. ","David J. Aldrich","Thank you Don. Well it is clear that our business is performing at a high level as we execute on our strategy and maintain a clear focus on operational excellence. For the remainder of the call I would like to provide some additional perspective on the positive trends in our end markets and how we are positioned and how we position the company to capitalize. By all measures wireless connectivity is exploding as an enabling technology. In fact this year's CES was a showcase of groundbreaking new devices leveraging the power of wireless connectivity to enhance our daily lives. ","Much of the excitement in CES was around innovations in the connected car, the automated home, wearable technologies and previously unimagined new categories like drones all utilizing enabling technologies like 4G, like TPS, local area networking, and near field protocols like ZigBee and Bluetooth. Our overarching mission is to make it effortless for customers to embrace these forms of connectivity leveraging our decades of experience in mobile to enable more and more devices in adjacent markets to become seamlessly connected. ","Powering these will be a combination of sensors, micro controllers, and most importantly for Skyworks connectivity and power management solutions with a high proportion of analog content and comparatively low digital processing needs. These products require high levels of integration and will need customized solutions produced in massive scale and attractive cost points. All of these attributes play directly into Skyworks core strengths. In this way Skyworks is a conduit into the Internet of Things. This is an exciting opportunity but just one of many tailwinds we are capitalizing on today. More broadly as we enter the calendar 2015 we see four major trends driving our growth. ","First, leverage of our leadership and high performance integrated systems. In high-end connected devices performance is paramount for our customers to enable seamless any time access to on demand content, social media, streaming services, and cloud data. At the same time technical challenges like band proliferation, like the adoption of advanced uplink architectures, and the implementation of 802.11AC and precision location services are resulting in an explosion in analog complexity. And the net result for Skyworks is an expanding addressable market significantly outpacing unit growth. ","Second, enabling connectivity in emerging markets. We see tremendous opportunities for 4G devices in markets like China, India, Latin America, Eastern Europe where broadband penetration rates are low and population densities are high. Strategy analytics estimates that Smartphone shipments into India alone will grow at 40% compounded rate through the year 2020. This new generation of devices is replacing a global installed base of billions of 2G voice only phones where we have minimal addressable content. Over the next few years we see significantly increased content opportunities in these markets driven by more stringent performance requirements and much higher complexity. ","Third, cultivating the Internet of Things. Market analysts estimate that the number of connected devices is poised to explode over the next five years. Analysts project that the machine-to-machine connections alone will increase fourfold through 2020 accounting for nearly 800 million connections, adding to our other opportunities in the connected home in wearable and other markets. These applications all rely heavily on efficient connectivity solutions providing incremental new growth opportunities to Skyworks and enhancing our diversification while dramatically expanding our served addressable markets. ","And finally aggressively expanding into new vertical markets. We are investing heavily to increase our market footprint in traditional analog segments like automotive, like medical, and industrial. These are highly attractive markets for us characterized by longer product life cycles, fewer competitors, and higher margins. These new growth verticals outside of mobile remain a strategic priority for us and we are investing significant resources in building out our presence in these markets. These elements of our strategy have enabled us to consistently expand our served markets and to significantly outpace the growth of the semiconductor industry while offsetting the seasonal trends to mobile markets. ","So in closing we are quite optimistic about our prospects for the remainder of 2015 and beyond. We\u2019ve created a unique business model combining strong consistent top line growth with the financial returns by best in class diversified analog company. And we\u2019ve established a solid track record of delivering on that vision to produce superior financial returns. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator lets open the lines please. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. First question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar of Stephens. Please go ahead. ","Harsh Kumar","Hey guys, first of all congratulations, stellar quarter, stellar guide, and special congratulations on hitting that 35% mark. That\u2019s like the go standard in the semi business. ","David J. Aldrich","Thank you.","Donald W. Palette","Thanks.","Harsh Kumar","I just wanted to say, your numbers in March, your guidance in March is better than seasonal I guess if there was any overarching reason why that is so if you would just give us some color around that?","David J. Aldrich","Yes, thank you very much. Some of these assumptions in our Q2 guidance that allow us to offset seasonality at first, our broad markets products and the aggregate of all of our vertical markets are much less than seasonal. So that\u2019s helping. We\u2019re seeing new opportunities that were ramping and specifically in the connected home, significant wearable products in fact. We also have some customers that are starting to ramp with new mobile platforms for 2015 and they are doing so in the March quarter. So we are seeing content gains, we are seeing more high value added analog systems both in the mobile and in non mobile, and that\u2019s helping Q2. ","Harsh Kumar","Great and then as a follow-up, if you look beyond March I think one of your customers had a pretty substantial ramp. As you look beyond March, just I am not asking you to give color but just maybe some I am not asking to give numbers but just some color, what would be the puts and takes on growth let\u2019s say in the June and the September quarter and the rest of the year?","David J. Aldrich","Well, that\u2019s a good question. Obviously we don\u2019t provide guidance for the year but if you look at our Q1 results and add our Q2 guidance, we are well over 50% top line growth through the first half. If one would take just normal seasonal patterns for the rest of the year and our track record of growing faster in the market we are looking at a very attractive we think another high growth 2015. And plus we got strong visibility today because we are actually ramping programs now. So I think the positive dynamics that are going to continue to fuel this above market performance for us, we are continuing to see big content gains in mobile and connectivity particularly 4G and 11ac by the way. ","We continue to see a small number of competitors and consolidation of share favoring those companies led by Skyworks that can do a complete overall solution. And our broad markets and vertical segments continue to outperform. I think all of these will play out not only Q1 and Q2 but over the long haul. ","Operator","Okay, thank you. Next question is from the line of Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. ","Rick Schafer","Great, thanks and I\u2019ll add my congratulations guys, nice job on the quarter. I had a quick follow up question just kind of talking about the or looking at what you guys sort of expect to see or what\u2019s your expectations are for content increases this year with your two top wireless customers as well as China and emerging markets. I mean is it too early to have a sense of what kind of content increase you could see at particularly your two largest OEMs?","David J. Aldrich","Okay, well thanks Rick. So obviously we can\u2019t comment specifically on customers. However, in general these analog architectures are getting much more complex and that\u2019s across our entire customer base in mobile and non mobile by the way. But in terms of our largest customers this provides a tailwind for us. We have consistently more addressable content with each successive design. And in fact we continue to look out two to three years as we become more of a system producer or engaging very early in architectural selection. So we have very good visibility in terms of how the architectures are going. And so I guess I would say our clearly stated goal has been for a long time is to gain content with each model and as an incumbent we have been very successful in maintaining and in fact growing our footprint and that's aided of course by complexity that all of our customers need help in solving particularly on the analog side and that's our strength. Maybe Liam could comment on China. ","Liam K. Griffin","Sure Rick, this is Liam on China. So if you look at the China dynamic we are very excited about the LTE opportunities. This year we were seeing an LTE number in China that was probably about 92 million or so. We think that number could go up 2X maybe 3X over the next 12 months. Here we have an opportunity to bring in our multimode systems solutions. Invariably there is WiFi, there is GPS, there is power management, very content rich opportunities. And then adjacent to that you mentioned emerging markets, so yet another set of developing markets that are looking for their first wave of connectivity. We support that and often times that could be $2 to $3 of incremental content in markets where there really was no subscriber. So we are excited about both of those opportunities and it is early for that cycle to evolve. ","Rick Schafer","Great, and then just kind of switching gears onto auto, I know Dave mentioned auto in his prepared remarks, can you give us an idea I guess maybe what you are targeting and what you have kind of -- how you look at growth in that business whether it is this year or the next couple of years however you are comfortable talking about it in terms of are you going to outgrow the auto unit market by 2X to 3X or just some kind of target on what kind of growth rates we could see there and actually what's primarily driving growth there for you guys?","Liam K. Griffin","Sure, sure. As we have outlined with CES and as you have seen with some of the new models that have been released, the connectivity, infotainment all are big part of the auto story. So what we have been doing so far is really leveraging our strength in SOI switching and GPS technology and in WiFi technology, and leveraging some of the great products that we have built through our mobile portfolio. And we are growing that business quite well. We have initiatives to further increase content. We are looking at unique solutions, even some cellular based solutions are entering into automotive. So we look at that as a key part of the IOT portfolio. We have design wins with companies that we named here in the call and we think that is going to continue to proliferate and we are excited about it. We have dedicated teams working that market as well and we will report more to you as the quarters transpire. ","Operator","Thank you and the next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. ","Vivek Arya ","Thank you for taking my question. Dave, when you look at the high end of the market and mobile phones I think there is a perception that perhaps overall content might have saturated because these phones already have so many LTE bands and it is just not possible to grow any more bands. What are you seeing on the ground, what do you think can help to drive content up even in the high end phones so even if that's a unit decelerator or flattish you can still see growth even in the high end of the market?","David J. Aldrich ","Yes, thank you Vivek. It is a little bit of complicated question. I would say from a band standpoint into the foreseeable future and I am talking a few years out, we don\u2019t see any trend that is narrowing the number of bands. In fact we see the opposite and if you pay attention to some of the auctions that are occurring right now for spectrum, I mean, they are moving higher and higher in frequency on narrow band. So I think that is going to drive a lot of complexity. And the higher in frequency you go by the way, the more differentiated the kinds of technologies we can produce. So, that is a very good trend for us, that implies complex switching, complex amplification, filtering and so on. ","On the receive side by the way, now it is becoming equally important to have it more and more streaming. So we are starting to see downlink architectures get very, very complicated. That is adding a lot of content in the next five years we think because it isn\u2019t just that you are transmitting all the time, you are actually streaming. So the performance of the battery, the bandwidth and so on is very, very important, how the antenna plays in that environment. And remember Vivek Skyworks is unique because as for example, as connectivity moves to AC and multiple modes of these battery compatibility and WiFi that is the real strength of ours. ","We are the leader in that space. Power management and the voltage of these devices you see is important so we have suite of power management devices. We are in the camera flash particularly in dual and high performance and so on. So our systems capability is serving us very well but I think it would be a mistake to interpret the current suite of phones as being some kind of the high point in band proliferation. I don\u2019t think there is anything that can stop that for the next several years. ","Vivek Arya","Got it, very useful. And then as my follow up more on the operational and the supply chain side, you are growing at this 50% rate probably seven to eight times in the broader semiconductor industry and I am wondering do you see any supply constraints on that growth, how are your frontend and backend facilities holding up and supporting this kind of growth? Thank you.","David J. Aldrich","Well if you look at our CAPEX for the last couple of years you could see that we\u2019ve had to grow our capacity. We\u2019ve done that significantly. We\u2019ve maintained our flexible model where we have outsourced partners for all of our critical processes and -- assembly and test and so on. We\u2019ve made provisions for that, we have the capacity, our on-time delivery remains very high. I think we are all set but we have had to make a significant investment over the last several quarters. ","Donald W. Palette","Yes, Vivek look we spend over 200 million last year and we had 87 million Q1, so it's as Dave said it's spending the CAPEX to maintain that right ratio and those products that we do both internally and externally. And then remember we outsource a significant percentage of our products, the SOI products for power management were fabulous so it\u2019s a nice balance and we feel very comfortable about our ability to get products. ","David J. Aldrich","Yes Vivek I\u2019ll make one final comment, the other piece in last couple of quarters you have seen a significant investment in filter capacity. Our high performance temp comp duplexers were on track now to ship a billion in 2015, a billion. And we are in good shape to do that as well. So we know how to do this but it\u2019s a lot of capacity I will admit. ","Operator","Thank you and next question from the line of Sid Sinha of Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead. ","Siddharth Sinha","Great, thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on the strong results. Dave one of your leading Korean customers is trying to introduce a number of SKUs or handset models it produces by roughly a third and focus perhaps more on super regional phones. I interpret this as more out of dollar content for Skyworks as these ones should not support more regional bands and frequencies, is that a fair assessment?","David J. Aldrich","Yes, I\u2019ll let Liam address that. ","Liam K. Griffin","Sure, I understand what you\u2019re alluding to there and so what we are seeing with one of our larger customers is a move towards fewer SKUs but the SKUs that are being provided are much more complex and will handle more of a broader geography. That\u2019s actually a great trend for us. I mean that\u2019s what we do best, we integrate solutions, we are able to provide the breadth of not only the amplification but the filtering, the power management, switching, and WiFi. So we see an opportunity uniquely with this customer now to gain significant content platform over platform and enable what we think to be a step up in functionality and performance on their end. So we are excited about it. You were on to that by your question and we are seeing that coming to fruition this year. ","Siddharth Sinha","Great, thanks and just a follow up to that question, the very same OEM is of course facing competitive market dynamics from the Chinese Smartphone OEM base. I guess simple way to ask is if the Chinese Smartphone makers gain share from some of your existing non Chinese android customers would that in totality be a net positive or negative or a neutral for Skyworks?","David J. Aldrich","Well actually I think it\u2019s a net positive. We are starting to see a tremendous growth here in China. We talked about that in the prior question. You are seeing names like Xiaomi and Oppo and TCL and Lenovo that are executing very, very well in China which is a huge market. But they are also delivering some compelling solutions into another set of emerging markets outside of China. So we are benefitting from that and we think that the unit volume opportunity there coupled with content gains is a real compelling driver for us and that will be around here for many, many years. ","Operator","Thank you. Next question from the line of Anthony Stoss of Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead. ","Anthony J. Stoss","Hi guys, my congrats as well to all Skyworks employees.","David J. Aldrich","Thank you.","Anthony J. Stoss","Two parts if you guys could talk a little bit more on what you are seeing on the infrastructure side, what you saw in December and what you might think infrastructure related business up down or flat in the March quarter? And then we have a bigger picture Dave, now let it seems like the handful of the RF players in this space are all playing within their sub segments. Are you seeing less pricing pressure overall now than you did say a couple of years ago since everybody seems to be doing well and focused on their niches, thanks? ","David J. Aldrich","I\u2019ll answer that and then Liam can talk about infrastructure. I will say that we continue to see dramatic changes in the competitive dynamics in the market for a couple of reasons one is that the simple reality is that our customers don\u2019t want, in fact in many cases don\u2019t know what to do with these key component. So even the best in breed companies with whom we used to compete are unable to compete many of them in these advanced system architecture. And so that\u2019s allowing us to capture content simply because we have a solution of direct [ph] product and we have scale in the solution dynamic. We understand it, we approach it as a system not as a bag of chips if you will that\u2019s helping us. ","So we see consolidation of share with or without consolidation of companies. Where we have seen consolidation that you alluded to, it is actually I think healthy long-term for the market because we are really encouraged to see a reduction in underutilized manufacturing assets where we are seeing some of these RF companies come together. That seems to be the trend which is to shut our underutilized assets in the form of foundries and so on, consolidate design centers. So we are finding it, making it easier for us to hire the absolute best inbred engineers and we are certainly seeing less, more rational environment from a pricing standpoint I would put it that way. ","Liam K. Griffin","Sure and with respect to infrastructure we are seeing that market slowly improve, commencing with the increases in LTE developments and increasing data rates and demand for screening and services. Some of the beneficiaries that we see, that we also supply to companies like Nokia, Siemens, Huawei, Ericsson, DTV all now are starting to show brighter signs of demand going into 2015 and even into 2016, a long-term forecast. So that market as we have outlined in the past is a margin rich portfolio for Skyworks. It is a big part of our story and broad market and we are looking forward to rolling out some new design wins here this year. ","Operator","Thank you. Next question from the line of Tim Long of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Tim Long your line is open. ","David J. Aldrich ","Let's will move on, right. ","Operator","Okay, thank you. Next question is from the line of Cody Acree of Ascendiant Capital. Please go ahead. ","Cody Acree","Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations guys. Maybe if we can look at a split of revenue to the best you can, the details that you can give us on handset versus non-handset, obviously the March quarter is much better than seasonal and to the extent maybe you can give us a mix split that is helping to drive that?","David J. Aldrich ","Well, I think clearly December marked a high point in terms of the amount of mobile revenue you see because obviously that is where you see the big programs ramping. Our March guidance is to be much less than seasonal so we expect a strong March quarter and that will be driven by a lot of broad market activity. There will be some mobile phones launching but in general the outperformance there is broad market based. You will see a reduction in mobile volume and an increase in broad market vertical markets. Within mobile, where we are seeing by far the greatest strength is in these integrated system solutions, the power amplified duplexers, SkyOne, WiFi based products, power management and the like so I hope that answers your question. ","Cody Acree","Well Dave and I guess as you look into Q relative to the first half are you seeing the non-handset markets grow as quickly as you are seeing opportunities of the handsets in units or are you just seeing numerous new applications coming in and driving that. I would also like to get maybe your view on the inventory health as we have kind of wrapped up the year both China and non-China handsets?","David J. Aldrich ","Well Cody I think if you looked at our last quarter, our year-over-year growth in broad markets was about 26% and so we have been growing that business 25% to 30% which is far greater than anybody's estimation of what broad market semiconductor content is growing. We are doing it with connectivity, we are doing it in the home, we are doing it in the automobile. And I expect that to continue. Now, over time we see our mix shifting less discreet power amplifier like products, more integrated mobile systems within our mobile products in more and more vertical market, broad market. But we are performing pretty darn well in our mobile business so we don\u2019t see dramatic shifts in that overall split. ","Operator","Okay, thank you. Next question is from the line of Craig Ellis of B. Riley. Please go ahead. ","Craig Ellis","Thank you for taking the questions and congratulation on the very strong execution. Dave I wanted to follow up on the helpful color you have provided around calendar 2015 growth drivers. When talking about Internet of Things and machine-to-machine you mentioned a number of technologies. Clearly Skyworks is very, very strong in connectivity but there are other areas like MCU and sensing where you can go down different paths either developing or acquiring that technology or partnering up, what makes the most sense for Skyworks longer term?","David J. Aldrich ","Well, that is great question, a complex one again. If you look at some applications, -- the hottest selling thermostats for example like Next [ph] you will see a module that has a combination of controllers and codes that has been provided by a partner where we have added connectivity, switching, filtering to create a module that is really easy for the system to use. We like that model, it leverages our strength. We are doing more than yes, its connectivity but it\u2019s also the switching, the antenna, tuning the filtering and all of the logic that drives that -- the adoption of these connected devices in markets you describe. The long-term strategy is not to be a microcontroller company. We think that the relative level of processing horse power required is nominal and so we think that we can partner, acquire, and license frankly MCU technology. ","We are looking in investing in various forms of sensors [ph] so we could -- you could picture that we have connectivity analog system wrapped into an MCM that we produce perhaps in our Mexicali factory with all the requisite componentary. We license in MCU and the piece of the puzzle that we are working very hard on right now is how to do the sensing and control and we are on track to use a couple of different approaches but they\u2019ll likely be with partners. ","Craig Ellis","That\u2019s helpful and then I just wanted to clarify a related comment that you had, you indicated that broad market strength is helping to offset seasonality, was that pointedly at the current quarters outlook or is that longer term should we expect to see a year from now relative to historic patterns, a little less seasonality from the December quarter into the March quarter?","David J. Aldrich","Yes, I think it\u2019s both. It is clearly the case that the shift from mobile to broad market in Q2 was helping moderate some seasonality. If your company was focused purely on mobile, purely on high-end mobile you\u2019d see far more seasonality that we are able to see. And if you go back and look last year, the year before that, and I would expect you to think this way in years to come we will be far less seasonal as a result of the diversification of our business model both within mobile but outside mobile.","Operator","Okay, thank you. Next question from the line of Edward Snyder of Charter Equity. Please go ahead. ","Edward Snyder","Just needed a clarification have you or are you adding premium filter capacity right now and will you offer discreet filters in the open market or are you planning on just consuming all that you built for your own use?","David J. Aldrich","We are -- in fact we are significantly more than doubling our filter capacity. I think we\u2019ll probably ship our plan is if not a billion very close to a billion in 2015 and these are all high performance TC duplexers, high frequency narrow band. We\u2019re expanding into new bands that previously weren\u2019t addressable by SAW, by temperature compensating was some really slick processes. We are doing it across multiple customers and multiple applications both on the transmit and the receive side. And no I don\u2019t think for the time being we will offer merchant discreet filters. ","Operator","Okay, thank you. Next question from the line of Vijay Rakesh of Sterne Agee. Please go ahead. ","Vijay Rakesh","Hi guys, congratulations on a strong quarter here and a good guide. Looking at your content as you go into 2015 you talked about filters here going to 1 billion, is that also doubling year-on-year into 2015 and how have you been able to improve the opportunity or improve the performance on SAW, TC-SAW versus let\u2019s say -- as you go into the high frequency modes? Thanks.","Liam K. Griffin","Sure, well yes, I mean I think when you do a comparison year-over-year of course we didn\u2019t have that joint venture in house the prior year. But it is true that we are ramping our production substantially. We have customers lined up that consume that capacity as Dave mentioned. We are going to continue to add capital and that\u2019s going to be a great driver for us. And I think we have an opportunity now to leverage a proprietary temp comp process that will move us up from some of the traditional frequency bands that would be to remain to SAW or TC-SAW and move into areas that allow us to address an even greater set of end devices. And when we talk about less devices going discreetly or today really no device discreetly, what we are saying is these billion filters are enabling systems level solutions, PAD like solutions, SkyOne like solutions that have very rich ASPs and a tremendous amount of systems level knowledge and know how that comes in through our team at Skyworks. So it\u2019s not just a filter but it\u2019s our ability to leverage our gallium arsenate technology or switching technology, the Mexicali configurability of custom assembly and test house. Bringing all of that together is really special and we are starting to see the benefits of that today.","Vijay Rakesh","Got it and just moving on to the capital allocation side, obviously very strong cash flow and you have a big vault just of cash now. What do you see in terms of dividends or share repurchase or M&A, thanks?","David J. Aldrich","Yes, thanks Vijay. Our allocation strategy I think we have been pretty clear that and we are going to continue to focus on trying to distribute about 40% of the free cash flow to shareholders. We returned over 35% in 2014. We initiated a dividend in 2014, we have actually increased that in two quarters in 2014, and we have repurchased a significant amount of shares. We are going to continue evoke those. And as far as the dividend, the model looks really good, earnings look good, we added a minimum, we are going to look adjustments to that on an annual basis that's at a minimum. So we like that having a strong cash balance gives us a competitive advantage. We like being in that position. ","Operator","Okay, and then next question is from the line of Steve Smigie of Raymond James. Please go ahead. ","Steve Smigie","Great, thanks a lot. I was hoping you guys could talk a little bit about market share in terms of units of handsets that you are on and some dynamics around that such as LTE increases as a percentage of the mix, does that suggest you might gain shares, you are typically providing some higher performance solutions or is it as you say maybe a proliferation of more customers like more Chinese handset guys, is it difficult to have the resources to keep up with all the new players there, so assuming you could talk about your market share potential from a unit basis, thanks?","David J. Aldrich ","I think it is a little hard to answer because if you look at our product portfolio within Smartphones, there aren\u2019t very many Smartphone, there are no Smartphone manufacturers where we don\u2019t have a position. And in fact there aren\u2019t very many Smartphone platforms in the world today where we don\u2019t have something. The real -- so they are so complex. It isn\u2019t like you have 30% PA share or whatever, that's not case. We are participating with virtually everybody and on every base band platform. So some cases like MediaTek where we will go to a broad market, we are on that platform and we gain lot of content and pull through by working together with for example the indigenous subset of China customers. ","So for us it is more about more content. Now the tailwind is that there is more content period to given complexity. There is more WiFi, more modes of WiFi, there is more bands, there is more filtering, there is more downlink architectures, there is more need for power and voltage management. So that trend is going to happen anyways. And what's helping us in addition to that tailwind is that we see consolidation of share benefitting us because our customers simply aren\u2019t going to the traditional discreet customer base any longer. They are looking for a system solution that maybe a complicated set of integrated circuits integrated in a multitude module with filtering and passive and that is what we think we do better than anybody in the world. So it is those two things, it is share capture by virtue of our system solution, our strong customer relationships. And it is the tailwind of content continuing to increase. ","Steve Smigie","Okay, thanks. And just a question on fully integrated solutions, could you talk about what 2015 SkyOne solution might incorporate. I realize you had multiple wins but they are not all the same but is it, you are putting three power amplifiers, two filters switch or something in there, just give a sense of at least when you have had in terms of just to get some sense of the complexity of what you are building for 2015?","Liam K. Griffin","Sure Steve, absolutely. Well in SkyOne it has really become the mainstream part of our portfolio and as you have outlined and what we have learned is that one size does not fit all and our ability to customize and configure account by account has been critical to our success. So we have SkyOne solutions that could be six or seven bands with multiple filters, with power management, some switching of course all integrated with a very, very rich ASP. We could find some customers that want very specific regional SKUs where you might have three or four filters and three or four frequency bands of amplification with maybe some receive side technology and some power. It is really a unique development for each account. What makes it special for us again is our ability to do that systems work, knowledge of multiple base band partners. Now this is a base band agnostic set of solutions. And now with our filtering technology in house we can be much more agile on how we pick and place and manage and select the right frequencies, the right technologies for that customer. ","Operator","Okay, thank you. Next question is from the line of Mike Burton of Brean Capital. Please go ahead. ","Mike Burton","Hey guys and congrats on the great results and guidance. Don, first for you, just wondered if you could help us understand how we should be looking at OPEX going forward this fiscal year especially as you have to support the broad markets ramp of many products across a bunch of diverse customer set?","Donald W. Palette","Sure Mike. We just spent 94.5 for our Q1 results and guided up million dollars from that. I would expect we have a merit increase midyear in our fiscal year so I would expect to add a 1.5 million to 2 million a quarter to remodel out to the balance of the year. That\u2019s a safe thing to do as we continue to grow when you add the model. When you look at the revenue, the top line revenue opportunities that we have you\u2019ll see there is still tremendous amount of leverage. ","Mike Burton","Okay, great and then for Dave and Liam, a very impressive guidance relative to seasonality. I was hoping you can help us understand how the China market has done for you in December and the outlook for that important region in the March quarter as in the Chinese New Year, thanks again?","Liam K. Griffin","Sure with respect to China, actually we are seeing China as a grower here in the March quarter where there are some interesting dynamics now with LTE really picking up. We mentioned some of our lead customers Xiaomi, TCL, Lenovo, etc. So we are seeing that pick up and we are also seeing as Dave outlined in the content opportunity in each one of these phones increase. And of course our ability to grow one of that content has been important as well. So China looks good. Last quarter was about flat so we go into the December quarter it wasn\u2019t a big part of our growth story. We continue to work on design wins and we\u2019re much more of the 4G play and as you know in China the 2G and 3G market is sort of robust with the uptake of LTE which is very good for us. And it is early stages. I mean this is a long term growth cycle while we\u2019re well positioned. We have talked about some of our relationships with players like MediaTek and [indiscernible] and of course Qualcomm. So we\u2019re real fortunate to be in that position and we will look forward to a long term growth cycle there. ","Operator","Thank you and the next question is from the line of Suji De Silva of Topeka please go ahead. ","Suji De Silva","Hi guys, congratulations on the quarter. In terms of the overall filter capacity for the industry not just for you guys, would you say it\u2019s tight and the people are chasing demand or you\u2019re taking share versus other guys?","David J. Aldrich","I think it's tight across the board. In the case of high performance filters which is where we are producing our own that is something where we are servicing our customers with very specific proprietary designs but in general it\u2019s the filter capacity industry wide is quite tight. ","Suji De Silva","Okay great and then on SkyOne it occurs to me I mean you guys are providing a lot of value with integration and helping to it will get to market quickly I know if you talked about the relative margins of SkyOne versus your core margins but are they I mean 10 points higher or something like that and you can walk people up the price curve with that and I mean is that is that something that SkyOne growth that could leave a \u2013 tailwind for your margin for several quarters?","Donald W. Palette","Yes, we haven\u2019t given a specific number as high as 10 points but they are meaningfully above our standalone power amplifiers and they are accretive to where the business is typically today. So it is a value add proposition for sure. ","Operator","Okay, thank you. And next question from the line of Alex Gauna of JMP Securities. Please go ahead. ","Alex Gauna","Good afternoon guys. Just wondering has the favorable exchange rates specifically for the yen improved or changed the way people are thinking about the value proposition of TC-SAW versus F-BAR [ph] alternative?","David J. Aldrich","No, I would say it has a minimal impact. It\u2019s a minimal impact on our results. ","Alex Gauna","Okay, you guys have had a great track record of exceeding your guidance like you absolutely crushed it now a couple quarters in a row. I am wondering is there something that has materially exceeded your calculus that\u2019s led to such upside, where were you off in terms of how you set guidance over the past couple of quarters, is it a single customer, or is it a certain platform ramp, can you give us some color on that?","David J. Aldrich","I think we are capturing more of the \u2013 we were probably more successful in the last few quarters relative to our expectations it would have to be in the amount of content we\u2019re sweeping in. So if we capture let\u2019s suppose we engage with a kind of not a full op but a SkyLiTE, kind of a light version of our SkyOne product for regional phone. And then of course we\u2019re competing to try to then capture the receive side, we are trying to capture the antenna switching and tuning, we are trying to capture both WiFi bands or if there are more than one. And so we\u2019re continuing to do a better and better job of making the argument that it's easier for you to engage with Skyworks as a customer for the complete solution. Fewer moving parts, you let us handle more of the complexity, we can help you solve the overall analog system solution that\u2019s such a benefit that when we are surprised we are being surprised with more content within an existing win I would say. ","Operator","Okay, thank you. And next question from the line of Ian Ing of MKM Partners. Please go ahead. ","Ian Ing","Yes, thanks and sharing my congratulations. In mobile you got top reference design exposure to the merchant base band partners but how are your relationships with the internal base band teams and OEMs that are trying to in source and what do you think their prospects are for a success?","David J. Aldrich","Yes, that\u2019s a good question. We certainly our engage with every potential developer on the chipset side and we have seen in some cases specifically in Korea there\u2019s been some success with a in-house solution and will be lined up with our product as well. We do still see couple of real big players out there who you know. I mean Qualcomm and MediaTek are very powerful. We have a great position with both and there is just a lot happening in the space right now. As Dave mentioned lot of complexity, our customers are having to do much, much more with this technology in addition to things outside of mobile. If your look at the processing speed display so we are finding for the most part our job is to enable connectivity, enable solutions, be customer friendly, be flexible, we are doing that and our products will work with just about very base now. ","Ian Ing","Great, and for my follow up the China 4G opportunity potentially doubling or tripling this year, what\u2019s your reliance on the two smaller carriers in China. To the best of my knowledge they currently have trial 4G licenses in FTD but not full commercial at this point?","David J. Aldrich","Yes, I mean we are still believing that we\u2019re going to see a number here if you go off of a 90 million or so LTE shipment in 2014. And if your look at the estimates the estimates are as high 250 million or 300 million. We think the number even if it's below that is going to be very explosive for us. We worked directly with the carriers but we also work closely with all the OEMs that we mentioned and the chipset partners that we mentioned. We just had a special note here with MediaTek and our SkyLiTE reference design with close collaboration and that\u2019s tied closely to their OEM suite. ","Donald W. Palette","We are not seeing any particular advantage or disadvantage from one carrier to the next if that\u2019s your question. We really don\u2019t see a particular difference one way or another. ","Operator","Okay, thank you. And next question from the line of Tom Diffely of D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. ","Thomas Diffely","Yes, good afternoon. Then maybe one question on the Chinese market then, do you see the relative pricing or margin trends dealing with either the large or the smaller Chinese customers versus your traditional customers. ","David J. Aldrich","No, not really and again we\u2019re going in and selling systems based solutions. We think the market there has been great. We don\u2019t have any pricing issues there. ","Donald W. Palette","And Tom they are often different but not often. They are usually very different products designed for that price point and designed for perhaps that regional approach or whether it\u2019s a three mode design versus a five mode design. So the products are different, so the margins there are very good but the products are usually quite different. Tailored that product, we know what the market can bear. So we are able to sort of tailor our design around that price point. ","Operator","Okay, thank you. Question from the line of JoAnne Feeney of ABR Investment please go ahead.","JoAnne Feeney","Yes, congrats everybody, great execution. I wanted to get into a longer term question. I think we all understand the content increase is driven by entire bands and carrier aggregation. We\u2019re clearly in a situation where carrier aggregation is just being implemented first for uploads and then as you pointed out to speed download streaming. One question that I think is important is what happens after a couple of years, do you think the second level of carrier aggregation is complete in a couple of years and do you have your sight on other technology changes and complexities that might come after we get through that download improvement from the secondly league of carrier aggregation, what is that\u2019s going to drive content higher once we are through that stage?","David J. Aldrich","Well, I think the content I think downlink you\u2019re right there will be successive future generations of downlink because they are going to be increasingly important. You could see what\u2019s being driven by the carrier or user models and simply what the user appetite is for streaming and streaming of video and streaming of 4K video and so you can just imagine that there will be constant demand from all bandwidth. So we think complexity is downlink. We think complexity is in the transmit side and I will tell you our experience in our design activity today is very much around solving more and more complexity with more high frequency bands, crowded on top of one another. Co-existence issues across the board. I don\u2019t see anything turning the tables on this natural tendency towards complexity for the next five years. I mean there really isn\u2019t any elegant solution that somehow says we got it, you can do this a lot easier. It\u2019s going to be more of this kind of approach to analog design and our ability to integrate more functionality into a system. ","Operator","Okay, thank you. And you have a question from the line of Quinn Bolton of Needham. Please go ahead. ","Quinn Bolton","Hey, guys nice job on the results. Just wanted to ask, you talked about the received diversity opportunity in your prepared comments, wondered if you could shed a little bit more light on that, what number of bands are you seeing being aggregated and those received your first few modules? And then a second question, you talked about emerging markets specifically India as a future opportunity, it sounds like India 4G has been pretty quiet today, when do you think India starts to see a ramp on the 4G handset side, thank you?","Liam K. Griffin","Sure, sure on the diversity received solution that really varies customer by customer we have seen some of that. The carrier aggregation bands account could be quite small but it is still incrementally beneficial. But as Dave has mentioned, if we look out at the road map and some of the designs that we are cementing today, we see very rich diversity received technologies on downlink that have up to six or seven filters, multiple L&A, load amplifiers and their functions to receive that signal and amplify it back through the chipset. So we are seeing that happening, SOI switching is embedded there, and it is a content rich opportunity that we are seeing today just in the few leading OEMs but if you look out through 2015 and 2016 roadmaps, more and more customers will adopt this technology. ","Operator","Okay, thank you. And ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Aldrich for closing comments. ","David J. Aldrich","Hey, well thank you so much everyone for participating and we look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences. ","Operator","Okay, thank you. And ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. "],"19607":["Skyworks Solutions, Inc.

This call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Mitch Haws, Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Haws, please go ahead.","Mitch Haws","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to the Skyworks third fiscal quarter 2016 conference call. With me on the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Liam Griffin and Chief Financial Officer, Don Palette.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our discussion will include statements relating to future results and expectations that are or maybe considered forward-looking statements. Please refer to our earnings press release and other SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-Q, for information on certain risks that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially and adversely from any forward-looking statements made today. Additionally, the results and guidance we will discuss today are from our non-GAAP income statement, consistent with the format we have used in the past. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.","With that, let me turn the call over to Liam.","Liam Griffin","Thanks, Mitch and welcome everyone. Q3 marked another quarter of solid execution on the part of the Skyworks team. We exceeded our guidance, returned over $240 million in cash to our shareholders, and importantly, continued to broaden our design win pipeline, setting the stage for sustained market outperformance.","Looking at the results in more detail, we delivered revenue of $752 million ahead of our guidance; expanded gross margins to 50.9%, up 190 basis points year-over-year; produced operating income of $275 million, with operating margins over 36%. Finally, we generated $1.24 in earnings per share, $0.03 above consensus. Execution on revenue and margins, along with operating cost discipline were all key elements of this performance. In addition to the strong financial results, we continued to gain broad market traction. Specifically during the quarter, we powered Huawei\u2019s P9 phone, incorporating 10 unique devices, including our SkyOne systems across low, mid and high bands; launched advanced carrier aggregation capabilities across a suite of premium and value tier accounts, including Samsung, Motorola as well as Oppo, Vivo and ZTE. We secured design wins for Continental\u2019s 4G LTE automotive systems, captured digital attenuator and multimode repeater designs at Audi, and enabled enterprise radio for Google\u2019s 3.5 gigahertz band ecosystem.","We also achieved several other milestones, including surpassing production of 2 billion filters cumulatively from our joint venture with Panasonic; ramping SkyBlue innovative technology for enhanced power management in LED flash drivers; commencing volume production of proprietary diversity received solutions and supporting the world\u2019s first headcam with LTE connectivity in 4k video streaming. These major wins and others demonstrate our expanding customer and end market reach across both mobile platforms and the Internet of Things.","At this point, I will turn the call over to Don for a more in depth review of our financial results.","Don Palette","Thanks, Liam and thanks again for joining us, everyone. We appreciate it. Revenue for the third quarter was $751.7 million and that\u2019s ahead of our guidance. Gross profit was $382.3 million or 50.9% of revenue and that\u2019s in line with our guidance and up 190 basis points from the third quarter last year. Operating expenses were $107.6 million. That consists of R&D expense of $70.2 million and SG&A expense of $37.4 million. We generated $274.7 million of operating income, translating into a 36.5% operating margin.","Our cash tax rate was 12.7%, resulting in net income of $238.1 million or $1.24 diluted earnings per share, $0.03 ahead of our guidance. Our cash tax rate is now projected lower for fiscal 2016 at 14%. The Q3 rate was favorably impacted by a year-to-date adjustment from the prior 14% \u2013 14.7% annual rate.","Turning to a summary of our third fiscal quarter cash flow metrics, we invested $57 million in capital expenditures with depreciation of $54.6 million, generated $141 million in cash flow from operations. We returned over $240 million to shareholders via dividends and the repurchase of 3 million shares during the quarter. Looking at product mix for the third quarter of fiscal 2016, integrated mobile systems was 55% of revenue, broad markets was 29% and power amplifiers was 16%.","Now, moving on to our fourth fiscal quarter business outlook. Based on the broad market traction, our new program ramps as well as the content gains Liam has outlined, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be up 10% to 11% sequentially to $831 million at the midpoint. The double-digit revenue growth we expect in Q4 followed by continued growth into our first fiscal quarter will reduce inventory. We have level loaded our factories and positioned ourselves well to address a series of new filter-rich program ramps with leading customers. For fiscal Q4, we suggest modeling gross margin at 51%. It\u2019s worth noting that our Q4 gross margin guidance implies a 100 basis point improvement versus the prior year fourth quarter even with a lower revenue base.","Looking at OpEx, we expect R&D and SG&A expenses to be flat with Q3, reflecting continued cost structure discipline. Below the line, we anticipate around $1 million in interest and other expenses, a cash tax rate of 14%. We expect share count to be roughly 190 million shares, driving fourth fiscal quarter fully diluted EPS of $1.43. Lastly, we also announced today that our Board has authorized an 8% dividend increase and a new 400 million stock repurchase program, underscoring the confidence we have in our business model and our ability to deliver superior returns to our shareholders.","And with that, I will turn the call back over to Liam.","Liam Griffin","Thanks, Don. Our third quarter execution highlights our differentiated competitive positioning and the strength of our business model. We are levered to powerful secular technology forces and we have spent the last decade aligning the company to capitalize on these strategic macro trends, propelling our mobile IoT and broad market opportunity. First is the explosive growth of mobile data across the vast set of applications and usage cases, driving performance from device to cloud and beyond. Next, we are seeing an ever-increasing expansion of connected things, with tens of billions of newly connected devices brought to market over the next 5 years. And finally, we address a tremendous ecosystem and new economy that thrives on the ability to leverage high-speed and secure connectivity at the heart of their business. Enabling these connections is the sweet spot of our franchise.","In mobile, we have growing content positions across all of the world\u2019s premier OEMs, leveraging our unique capabilities to meet our customers\u2019 increasing need for higher performance solutions. We are also building momentum in broad markets, particularly in IoT, with engagements at leading players, including Amazon, ARRIS, Cisco, Fitbit, GE, Google Nest, Honeywell, Itron, LG and others. Our success here has been brought about by a broad and growing list of wins in adjacent markets like industrial, energy management, security, health and fitness and the smart home. Today, we participate in all of these verticals through our suite of diverse technologies, including support for WiFi, ZigBee, Bluetooth, GPS, small cell and LTE standards. At the same time, we are building presence in key verticals like automotive, with leaders such as Continental, Audi, Ford, Kia, GM and Volkswagen.","Underpinning all of our solutions is the skyrocketing demand for wireless data. Whether it\u2019s Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google or Tesla, there is a powerful and expanding ecosystem, monetizing and relying upon efficient, high speed, low latency, seamless and secure connections. This ecosystem spans across enterprise to e-commerce to social media and a burgeoning set of entirely new applications fueled by connectivity. In an effort to facilitate this massive and growing wave of data delivery, creation and movement in storage, our customers are implementing methods to improve performance with carrier aggregation, received diversity, MIMO and ultimately 5G capabilities. This dynamic requires a continuous increase in the levels of analog and mixed signal performance, enhanced power efficiency, high-precision filtering as well as configurable systems integration capabilities. Skyworks\u2019 suite of products and system solutions are squarely aimed at resolving the intense performance demands facing our customers.","So to summarize, we delivered above guidance results in the quarter, driven by increasing global demand for high speed connectivity coupled with strong operational execution. And as our guidance reflects, we are planning for sustained market outperformance with operating leverage and strong cash flow generation. Clearly, we remain well positioned to realize our vision of connecting everyone and everything all the time.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let\u2019s open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Charles on for Toshiya Hari. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering with inventory at these levels, can you kind of walk through some of the content and unit assumptions that underpin your confidence in being able to get inventories down going into Q1?","Liam Griffin","Sure. Well, as we discussed in the prepared remarks, lot of that inventory is filter driven and really filters that are designed into known programs with known ramps in the second half, not only transmit solutions, but also receipt side technologies, some GPS technologies and an expanding set of customers now that will be taking those filters and those solutions into their applications. So the lion\u2019s share of that material, that inventory, largely filters is really lined up relative to second half ramps with known customers so and a very clear demand curve.","Don Palette","And just to follow-up generically on the inventory and just keep in mind that that inventory growth that you are seeing in the Q3 is it supports the second half. Volumes were up about 11% quarter-over-quarter and then there is growth as we continue in the fiscal Q1 of \u201817. There were multiple things that Liam was talking about burning the inventory down. I am just going to give you the summary of why the level is where it\u2019s at. The level, we were level loading factories to meet that second half demand. The share gains in filters especially silicon is driven by new programs. There is specific growth assigned to some ramps and there is essentially no risk with any of \u2013 risk with this inventory. We also had a new hub arrangement for a large customer in Asia. That\u2019s a one-time stocking bump in inventory. And some of the projected product mix into Q4 just has longer lead times for some of the outsourced materials and it\u2019s primarily silicon wafer. So the bottom line, we are very confident in the decline going forward and getting the turns back towards historical levels. So this is a short-term issue that we are working through based on those dynamics.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then as a follow-up, I guess with the \u2013 given the buyback, could you just maybe run through some of your thoughts on M&A and your strategy on diversification via M&A?","Liam Griffin","Sure. Well, I mean we first and foremost are committed to running our core business. And we think there is great opportunity to leverage not only our strength in mobile, but now you are hearing more and more about our opportunities in broad market, specifically IoT. So we are committed to that. Now in parallel, we have a disciplined view on M&A, but we certainly are looking at potential opportunities. We will share more with you as they come about. But we are focused on our core, but have the powder, the balance sheet and the opportunity to certainly augment that with M&A as needed.","Operator","Okay, thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question. For the first one, Liam I was wondering if you could just give us a sense of the overall demand environment, obviously the industry has come through an inventory correction at your largest customer, are we past all those problems, so now we should start to expect more normalized growth, if you could address that. And also if you could take it more broadly to the trends you are seeing at your Korean and Chinese customers, I think basically, I think investors want to understand, are we past some of the issues we saw in the first half and it\u2019s a more normalized growth environment going forward or is the industry still struggling with a little bit of the inventory issues that came about in the first half?","Liam Griffin","Sure, Vivek. I will take both of those questions. Well yes, I mean we have been through a challenging first half of the calendar year, for sure. And I think that\u2019s been well publicized and reflected in our numbers in the past. We are seeing improving conditions right now. We are seeing all of our Tier 1s grow. And more importantly, we are seeing our content position expand and their need for the content expand. So the dynamic around performance and our ability to resolve performance with systems level solutions is coming together quite well. And you can see in this guide 10% to 11%, pretty solid guide up into Q4. We feel that that\u2019s sustainable. We expect \u2013 so early for Q1, but we do expect to be up again into Q1, so that\u2019s kind of a broad statement. And if you look at China and Samsung, both of those opportunities, China being more of a broad opportunity with some of the flagship names like Huawei doing very, very well for us and China will be one of our faster growing areas. Samsung, we got content gains on the GS7. That\u2019s looking good this year. Samsung will be probably a 15%-plus account for us year-over-year. We are lining out for the GS8. So what you can look at here at a high level is this continuous need for performance and Skyworks\u2019 ability to address not only our core positions in SkyOne and some of the transmit chain, but also an increasing position in analog and increasing position in the receive side, WiFi and other technologies that will allow us to grow our share.","Operator","Okay, thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Atif Malik of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Atif Malik","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. A question on the gross margins, I mean your gross margin were a smidge below the 51% guidance you gave, even with the higher revenue level and broad markets doing better and your guidance of 51% is flat on higher revenue, can you just talk about incremental gross margins, we have not seen these lower committed gross margins in the last like six quarters, so can you talk about the puts and takes on your gross margin line and should we be thinking about 60% incremental gross margins moving forward and also a 53% mid-term model that you have shared in the past? And I have a follow-up.","Don Palette","Yes, sure. We will talk about the incremental contribution margin that we saw in Q3, being that that was a down revenue quarter, was actually a number that was very good in the high 40s. And when you are in down revenue, you want the number to be below which you are normally posting, so that\u2019s good. When you do look at the guidance, we are at about 52.5% on an incremental basis and that\u2019s simply reflective of the backdrop, the unique elements that we highlighted in the Q4 inventory. Going forward when you are looking at our earnings model opportunity, the 53% is absolutely still our target. And we expect these incremental margins very, very quickly to get back to the 58% kind of level, which is what we have communicated consistently externally. So there is no issues there. We are just working through this the inventory issues and the tough backdrop issues that Liam mentioned, but nothing else specific.","Atif Malik","Great. And then you mentioned in your prepared remarks about the low, mid and high socket wins in the Huawei phone, can you just talk about why we don\u2019t see you in mid and high band in some of the other flagship models in India and Korea and in the U.S. and if you guys are planning to get to those sockets or maybe the specifications of the Huawei phones are different than those other devices? Thanks.","Liam Griffin","Yes. No, that\u2019s a great question. So first off, I will tell you we are encroaching some of the mid and high bands organically with enhanced performance in our TC SAW factory. And as noted in the prepared remarks, we have shipped over 2.5 billion filters, all of which were consumed by our systems solution. So we are not a discrete filter company. Having said that, our performance levels not only with the filter, but the entirety of the system, so if you think about what customers want from us is they want solutions that resolve this tremendous complexity. And those solutions from Skyworks are really system level. They include our own gallium arsenide HBT process that we have in-house, our SOI process, our deep IP and switching, our ability to craft MCMs for very, very low loss and high efficiency, delivering a complete module. So our modules can often include our own TC SAW. We have been able to move the TC frequency up to mid-band. And in some cases, if the frequencies are not applicable for TC SAW we can address by our foundry partners for bulk. So that\u2019s what you are seeing now in the Huawei phone. I think you will continue to see us extend our reach in frequencies and continue to do what customers want, really simplify their solutions, give them the best end-to-end efficiency and the best systems level performance.","Operator","Okay, thank you. And the next question, it comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Timothy Arcuri","Thanks a lot. I guess I am still trying to understand the inventory. You said that you are building ahead of the ramp, but the revenue is guided down like $50 million year-over-year at the midpoint. So, I would have thought that if you are building for more content gains that you would think that the revenue guidance would have been a little bit better year-over-year. So, is the answer really that it\u2019s going to sell through more in the fourth calendar quarter? Because I guess if you could commit to a big up fourth calendar quarter, then the inventory build would make a little more sense. I am wondering if you can comment on that? Thanks.","Don Palette","Part of the sell-through, you will see both the Q4 and then into Q1 as well. You will see both of those, so that\u2019s clearly part of it.","Liam Griffin","Yes. And then also just recall that we have 3x the size of our filter franchise so to speak. When we get the deal with Panasonic, we had one site in Kadoma. We have added a large site in Osaka. We have many more customers now that are engaged with us with filter-based solutions. So, we are running that larger factory, running that larger footprint in high-performance filters, there is more WIP, there is more inventory, and there is more programs by which we are going to sell into. So, that\u2019s the difference when you look at year-over-year. The size of our filter franchise is quite a bit bigger. The number of customers that we address is quite a bit larger. And specifically in the second half calendar year, you are going to see that action come to bear and we are going to see the inventories come down as well.","Don Palette","I am sorry, one thing that I wanted to add to is that when you look at the build that we had this quarter it\u2019s all raw materials and WIP. There is literally no finished goods build, very little. So, that just supports that future growth opportunity.","Operator","Okay, thank you. And the next question is from the line of Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Blayne Curtis","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just when you look at the September guidance, just trying to better understand what you are embedding in there, if you can talk about what you think broad markets will do into September? And then assuming that\u2019s not down a ton, it looks like the integrated mobile is down year-over-year. Obviously, your largest customer has a got unit headwind to deal with. You have content gains offsetting. Is there any other headwinds that you are dealing with in integrated mobile?","Liam Griffin","Well, I mean I think for the most part if you look at the quarter here, we are speaking Q4 guide, we are still \u2013 there is some headwind in some ways of mix, legacy mix SAW that it really hasn\u2019t come to bear. But we have factored that in. We are seeing overall growth. If you were to exclude our largest customer, we are up 10% to 12% year-over-year in the quarter. So, I mean, some of the headwinds with our larger customers still are reflected in our numbers. We are growing the non-core PAB business quite well and that\u2019s IoT. That\u2019s diverse and you received technologies that are quite new for us. Our WiFi business is strong. All those portfolios look very good on a year-over-year basis. And we are starting to get out of the inventory hold that we mentioned with some of our larger customers. And things definitely look better in the second half with respect to that.","Blayne Curtis","Liam, just on broad markets, you had a very strong quarter in June despite the divestiture was up. Could you just talk about the trajectory down into September?","Liam Griffin","Yes, will be up a little bit in September, probably 5% to 8%. I will tell you this though within broad market, IoT is it will be up 10% to 15%. And year-over-year, IoT is probably headed for high-teens. So within the broad market space, what you have there, Blayne, is some markets that are doing quite well IoT. We also have some legacy markets like infrastructure that are great markets and have super margin, but just have been flattish in terms of top line. So, the blend together looks good, but IoT is the sweet spot within broad. It\u2019s really special for us right now.","Operator","Okay, thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Steve Smigie","Great. Thanks a lot. You introduced a whole bunch of new products here such as the digital attenuators and antenna tuning, etcetera. Can you talk a little bit about how much of your content on the phone now comes from outside of pad type device? I know there is lots of SKUs out there, but just trying to get a sense of how broad you are getting now across the phone outside of just some more classic parts?","Liam Griffin","Yes, no, that\u2019s a great \u2013 I don\u2019t have an exact stat for you, but I will tell you, it\u2019s definitely increased over the last year and it will increase in the second half of this year. Some examples you have mentioned us talk about diversity you received. I mean, this is some real elegant proprietary technology that Skyworks has created. It levers our filter technology. It levers our LNA, low noise amplifier expertise, our switching and again that configurability with our own MCM. Great technology and what it does is just tremendous, tremendous improvements in the downlinks portion of the phone. And if you think about the way typical usage cases that broke on phone, downlink is critical. So, we provided great enhancement to downlink speed. That\u2019s one area that is relatively new for us and it should be a big growth driver. Some of the SkyBlue technology that we mentioned before is unique for us, driving power efficiency through the system. We have had WiFi for quite a while, but now what we are starting to see is MIMO WiFi in some of the leading flagship phones. Our content virtually can double with MIMO. There is a lot of great things happening, antenna tuning and other points, GPS for location-based services. If you think about we have talked about the ecosystem with some of the big tech players now engaged in mobile, a lot of these folks are involved in payment. They want to know exactly where people are, precise location. We have a GPS portfolio now that is really emerging and increasing attach rate with some of our customers. So, all those things blend in. And you are seeing definitely a larger increase in kind of the nontraditional pad business, although that remains core, but a bigger swing now to some of these newer devices.","Steve Smigie","Okay, great. Thanks. And I was just wondering, I mean obviously as other folks mentioned, it\u2019s been a little tough with some big customers out there being challenged, but do you have some sense of when you think you may \u2013 what quarter you might return to year-over-year growth rates?","Liam Griffin","Yes, year-over-year \u2013 okay, so \u201816 to \u201815?","Steve Smigie","Right, yes. So, I mean, is it possible to say like March of \u201817, would that be a quarter where we would expect to start to see sort of year-over-year growth rates resuming?","Liam Griffin","Yes, yes absolutely. Okay, I got your question now. Yes. I mean, certainly, we get through the second half year. Obviously, we are coming off of a $752 million, 10% up. We expect to be up again in Q1. We don\u2019t have a full guide yet for that quarter. But I think when we get into the March quarter we should be back on track with year-over-year growth. And then just also just to remind you, I think we mentioned it before, but even in the September quarter, we are looking at comparable levels of operating income percentage, so comparable levels of profitability even at lower revenue. So, it has been a challenging period for us, the last couple of quarters. But I think you can see some financial discipline here at least in the P&L.","Don Palette","Yes. And you will see sort of normal sequential growth pattern starting again, but the year-over-year, as Liam says, is going to be in the second quarter when we see that.","Operator","Okay, thank you. And the next question is from the line of Edward Snyder at Charter Equity. Please go ahead.","Edward Snyder","Thanks a lot. Filters, you mentioned over 200 \u2013 or 2 billion of those filters, but probably like 37 are TC SAW. Is the big expansion in Panasonic facility all for TC SAW, Liam or would you get into SAW manufacturing? And if you do, how is that going to impact the GM, because I know think you are finding those on the outside world now? And then the second question, on the competitive environment when you are done, please?","Liam Griffin","Okay. No, a great question. So, yes, certainly the filters that we produce thus far have largely been TC SAW. And as you know well, I mean that as a flavor of high-performance filters that\u2019s in high demand and it\u2019s allowed us to lever that up into SkyOne systems for low and in some cases, mid-band. And it\u2019s been served us very well. Now, going back to standard SAW filters is actually quite easy. It\u2019s fewer process steps. You will eliminate the silicon dioxide plating. It\u2019s a cheaper process for us. And you are correct that we do still spend quite a bit of money outside for a third-party SAW. So, there is potential opportunity for us to bring that in-house. And then finally that site in Osaka has the ability. It\u2019s a phenomenal site, class 10 clean-room, beautiful facility and we do have the opportunity to expand further and higher frequencies if needed.","Edward Snyder","Okay. And then you are clearly number one in TC SAW, but by a distant margin here. So, it sounds like your expansion plans are going to be even further. Now, in the competitive environment, I mean it seems like it\u2019s shifting pretty dramatically here. Marotta has already stated this losing share to largest customer this year. And it looks like that\u2019s all to you, but then you are also splitting the little [indiscernible] with Qorvo. You didn\u2019t do that last year. Qorvo has also entered the DRx section at Samsung where they weren\u2019t last year. So, how do you see, Liam, the competitive environment shaking out in say, calendar year 2017? Are the Japanese firm which are disappearing, I mean, you guys got Panasonic [indiscernible] \u2013 are they going to disappear faster than say Qorvo shows up at some of these sockets? And is all this going to be kind of a footnote to overall TAM growth in the RF section in \u201817? I am just trying to get your view of the bigger picture. Thanks.","Liam Griffin","Yes, yes, that\u2019s a lot. Let me try to help you with that. So, I will tell you what we see. We see the performance nodes going up and up and up, with each successive generation whether it be our largest customer over the next two or three down, we really see that happening. And that\u2019s actually \u2013 that\u2019s propelled our growth more than anything, our ability to hit the more challenging architectures and do it with profitable solutions and integrated solutions that served us very, very well. We are confident that you will be able to see content gains with all of the leading accounts, regardless of baseband partitioning. We are agnostic to baseband. We work with Qualcomm. We work with Intel. We work with MediaTek, Hisilicon, all of those players. And so we don\u2019t expect any issue with that. But yes, competitively the companies that can hit the performance and the companies that can do that elegantly and unburden our customers with these daunting challenges that they are facing, those are the ones that are going to win and we will be at the top of that list. I mean that\u2019s the whole essence of Skyworks to try to drive a strategy around performance, integrate as much as we can, work with our customers, listen to what they need, it may be different. Every account wants something different, but be flexible enough, leveraging our internal capabilities, leveraging [indiscernible] for highly configurable devices, picking the right flavor of filter, but really looking at systems performance from input to output. If we do that well, our business will follow.","Operator","Okay, thank you. And the next question is from the line of Cody Acree of Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","Cody Acree","Thanks for taking my question. And maybe just continuing on that theme with your expansion in capacity and really seeing significant expansion at Qorvo and at Broadcom as well, are you concerned at all about the supply-demand balance of this industry as we get that over the next few quarters?","Liam Griffin","Yes. Cody, its funny if you look at what is happening in these devices now, it is incredible. The filter count that is absolutely required by our customers and just by virtue of the crowded spectrum that we see. So there is going to be I think a shake on who is going to wind and who isn\u2019t going to win based on how we put those filters into a complete system. Our customers really are less interested in buying discrete components today and more interested on those highly efficient engines that we spoke of. So we are very confident with our ability to address and as you know from history with Skyworks, we are very disciplined on our CapEx and we are careful with where we invest. So we certainly know where our filter strategy is going and our ability to win. And with respect our competition, we have competed with Avago and Qorvo and others for years and years and we certainly like our outlook here at Skyworks.","Cody Acree","And just trying to get maybe a little clearer picture on the September guide, I know you have been asked and answered these questions about inventory, but do you believe that you are still dealing with anything that\u2019s either causing you to be conservative or weighing a bit on that 10% to 11% guide, you got obviously there a major customer build that you are prepping for, you got some seasonality happening, you got what appears to be a relatively healthy market in China, maybe I think I am just a bit surprised that this wasn\u2019t a bit stronger guide?","Liam Griffin","Sure. Yes. I mean 10% to 11% is I think is a pretty healthy move up for us. Yes. There has been of course some lingering effects of legacy platforms that we have had to manage through and that is be managed through, so all of that is reflected in the numbers. I will tell you one thing that we really need to highlight here again is absent our largest customer, we are up 10% to 12% year-over-year. And also across mobile, we are specifically expanding our content reach. It was a question that was asked earlier on the call. But the percentage of revenue we derive in mobile with technologies that are really more like analog mix signal, that percentage is going up. Our IoT business looks very strong right now, our broad market business looks very strong. It\u2019s been a tough opening two quarters of the calendar year, quite frankly. And we are coming out of that now. Is there some lingering headwinds that are reflected in the number, yes possibly so, but that\u2019s in the guide.","Operator","Okay, thank you. And the next question, it comes from the line of Anthony Stoss of Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.","Anthony Stoss","Hi guys. Just drilling down with further Liam on China, can you talk about how much it was up in June, do you expect it to be up also in the September quarter, what percent in China currently makes for your business overall total revenues and what you think the inventory in the channel looks like in the China? Thanks.","Liam Griffin","Sure Tony. Well at a high level, China is about 25% of our company revenue. And they were up sequentially more than 10%. They look good in the second half calendar year. I think one of the accounts that we highlighted in the prepared remarks was Huawei. We have got a great position there, not only with the P9 phone that we mentioned, but with the Honor series and others. There is also another opportunity in China I think most of you know. But China is a tremendous export player to the rest of the world and there are still 2 billion to 3 billion people out there that have no connectivity. And so we are able to speed that through our partnerships with MediaTek and Spreadtrum and even Hisilicon that often make models that will go to India, the Middle East, Africa and some of the other emerging markets. So we look good there. The recent numbers in China have been strong. We are also seeing, I think some of these came through some of our peer group\u2019s calls as well. We are seeing a move more towards five modes from three modes, so that increases our content. The recent carrier data shows some better pickup in 4G, LTE. That\u2019s good. So for the most part, China has been actually really an improving story here in the last few months.","Operator","Okay, thank you. And the next question, it comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava of BMO Capital. Please go ahead.","Kulin Patel","Hi, it\u2019s Kulin Patel for Ambrish. Thanks for taking my question. On China, we also heard from others talk about strength in China recently, are you concerned about overbuilding there, given the strength in China?","Liam Griffin","No, we are not concerned about overbuilding. We have \u2013 one of the larger accounts we have in China now we have moved to a hub arrangement, which is again part of the inventory issue. But it\u2019s fully lined up, you can\u2019t overbuild in that environment, so you basically just meet your customers\u2019 hub needs. They pull the open market, broad customers in China. We work very closely with MediaTek and some of the other baseband partners to get a broad forecast. Some of the solutions that we sell into that ecosystem are fungible. So they can be sold to multiple customers. That will net out the puts and takes of kind of broader market within China. But no, we feel very, very solid about the inventory dynamics and revenue dynamics with respect to China. We have been in that market for a long time. We were a 2G player, a 3G player. And now actually with 4G and our ability to expand reach, the market for us now is probably the best it\u2019s ever been.","Kulin Patel","Thanks. And a quick follow-up, earlier in the year you talked about divesting Trans-Tech I think with a ceramic filter company and I think in your last 10-Q, it looks like you are no longer divesting this asset, can you talk about what would maybe changed your mind on that?","Don Palette","To answer your question specifically, they continue to be part of a business. We haven\u2019t gone ahead with that sale. And it\u2019s just the business that at this point, we are comfortable keeping. And we think that there is some growth opportunity going forward associated with it.","Operator","Okay, thank you. And the next question, it comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes, thank you. Just going back to the inventory build, do you think this will be kind of a one quarter issue or is it something that it takes kind of into the December quarter to work down. And then any kind of sense of just for the gross margin impact that you are seeing as you have to throttle back a bit?","Don Palette","Yes. As far as where we think it\u2019s going to be, it\u2019s going to be flat to slightly down going into this quarter. But remember, that\u2019s also supporting higher revenue growth going forward, so some of that is the impact of the revenue growth. The turns are going to begin to move back to historical levels. So as far as the velocity of the inventory, you are going to see us get back there very, very quickly.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. And then just going back from a dollar content perspective as you look into the fall and upcoming launches, just a general sense as to how you feel about the growth in dollar content?","Liam Griffin","No, we feel very positive about the growth in dollar content. And I know I have said it a couple of times already in the call, it\u2019s really twofold. It\u2019s continuing to do well in our core business and our core opportunities in mobile, but also getting a larger region to some of these other opportunities within a handset. And you will see that going out by leading customers.","Operator","Okay, thank you. The next question is from the line of Harsh Kumar of Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead.","Harsh Kumar","Hi, Liam. First of all, congratulations on your new position. One of the questions we get a lot from investors is about your bar strategy or lack of it, how many of the upper end slots and filters can TC SAW address and eventually what would you guys have to do to be able to get to that upper level of filters?","Liam Griffin","Sure, thanks Harsh. Well, as I outlined earlier, we can address the upper level of filters today. We just we do it with foundry partners, for example. We would love to be able to build it in-house and that\u2019s something that\u2019s not out of our reach. It just isn\u2019t there today. Our TC SAW capability has moved up in frequency where it was largely just a low band play, maybe 600 meg and 900 meg. We now have technology well over 1 gig, getting close to 2 gig and 2.5 gig. And again, back to what I was mentioning before, we don\u2019t have an appetite for selling discrete filters. So, when we sell a filter, it is wrapped within a complete system. So, the filter contributes some level of performance. But you also have your HBT, your switch, your MCM and your ability to minimize losses within your layout. So, a lot \u2013 and that \u2013 with Skyworks, virtually all of that I mentioned is controlled in-house. So, think about us as a system solutions player. Filters play a role in that system. But the entirety of the architecture is what matters. So, we have won programs with Huawei. We are close with some other customers. There maybe a few opportunities where optimal filter performance is the number one requirement. That maybe the case for some of the discrete applications or maybe some super high performance, high-band sockets. Today, perhaps we can\u2019t address that. But we have the engineering talent, the filter assets and the people and the processes in place to continue to push that envelope and grow them.","Harsh Kumar","Great. And for my follow-up, Liam, what is the \u2013 what are the one or two major focus areas for you in the first 12 months of your CEOhood?","Liam Griffin","Yes, yes, sure, thanks. Well, number one, we definitely want to continue this push by leveraging our core in mobile and taking advantage of this expanding opportunity that we mentioned, receive side technology, WiFi technology, GPS, power management and others and try to create the same systems level approach in that section that has worked so well for us in SkyOne and in transmit. That\u2019s one. The second is stepping up in IoT. I mean, this is the market we talked about for the last few years. We talked about broad market. But within that, the IoT landscape and the class of customers that we engage with today is phenomenal. And we have a unique opportunity, because most of the players in IoT feature one or two connectivity topologies. We have WiFi. We have Bluetooth. We have ZigBee. We have low-power technology. We have power management. And we have tremendous know-how on how to make connected things work and make them work wirelessly. So, we are excited about that. We are going to put more resources around that part of our business. Some other opportunities that have really come along nicely, albeit still quite small, are markets like automotive. We are being pulled into some of the premier players that we mentioned in the opening remarks bringing in full LTE modules and automotive very high performance, high-reliability modules that\u2019s looking good. So we are going to fire on all of those cylinders and then from there continue to drive with the best people and the best execution in our space.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from the line of Craig Ellis of B. Riley. Please go ahead.","Craig Ellis","Thanks for taking the question. I will start with a question for Don. Don, if I approach the gross margin issue in a different way. As you look at getting from where you are back to those 58% incremental gross margins and prioritizing the improvement drivers that can close that gap, what\u2019s on the list? It sounds like getting inventory down is one item. I think I heard you mentioned that filter in-sourcing is another, but what else is on the list? And how quickly did those different factors come into play and really provide tailwinds for the margin structure of the business?","Don Palette","Yes, they come in very, very quickly. Part of it when we talked about the inventory issue and the level loading that\u2019s been going on, I mean even though the hybrid model serves us really well, we were able to pull in a down quarter as we are able to pull production capacity and externally. You are still not, during this period, we weren\u2019t running completely full. So, that\u2019s going to be something that\u2019s very quickly going to get us back up into the incremental margin track. And that\u2019s a big driver of this. And then the other thing is the new product launches as we move forward. We have said we are very focused on every new generation of products going to provide incremental margins. So, that will all be in the mix as we move forward. We are excited about some of the IoT opportunity, as Liam talked about. So, those are the things, Craig, that \u2013 and we have a lot of confidence in the visibility to get down the road to the 53% target. That\u2019s still in front of us, for sure.","Craig Ellis","Okay. And then the follow-up is for Liam. Liam, Skyworks I think has been well-known for an above industry average grower. It doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s playing out that way this year, but we understand the challenges that exist with the large customer. The question is, how patient will you be with the business in getting back to above industry average growth organically? And at what point, will you feel like you have to press for M&A to diversify the business and get back to some of the growth rates and relative growth rates that we are used to seeing from the company?","Liam Griffin","Sure, Craig. That\u2019s a great question. Well, first of all, I am committed and have great confidence that the organic business, the organic franchise will be an outperformer in terms of growth. Now, we are a bigger company than we were a couple of years ago. There is some level of maturity in unit growth and mobile, which has been the biggest market for us, but we are able to augment that with the share moves that we have talked about. And think again about the usage case that the entities that use mobile technology and what they want and it\u2019s daunting. So, I think it will be solid in core mobile. And I am very comfortable with the opportunity with TAM given some of the new architectures and roadmaps that we have visibility into. Broad market needs to become much more of an IoT play for us. I think that\u2019s really what broad markets means now. And we have great solutions for it. I think we need to put more people behind it, more engineering and help folks behind that. That should work. Now, in parallel, M&A is absolutely an opportunity for Skyworks. We have a tremendous balance sheet. We generated a ton of cash. And I think we will be able to do the right deal when it comes about. But having said all of that, day to day, we are running the franchise, optimizing the franchise, doing everything we can to continue to put the growth up, the margins up, and satisfy our customers. M&A is another area that we will continue to pursue.","Operator","Okay, thank you. Next question is from the line of Mike Burton of Brean Capital. Please go ahead.","Mike Burton","Hey, guys. Thanks for letting me in. So, obviously we are a little early to be talking about the December quarter. But given your visibility into product ramps and kind of inventory levels, how do you think we should be thinking about the December quarter relative to kind of normal seasonality? I think it\u2019s been bouncing around quite a bit, but kind of in the mid-single digits historically?","Don Palette","Yes, Mike. I think at this point, again we can provide some color on it. We are not in the guiding the numbers, but I think if you look at sort of the historical growth opportunity of high single-digits. That\u2019s a number that I think is reasonable for your modeling right now when you think about that opportunity.","Mike Burton","Great. Thanks. And then Don also your thoughts on OpEx going forward, anything relative to BAW development or anything else that we should think about as we frame out our models? Thanks.","Don Palette","No, I mean, the BAW OpEx, the engineers that we have and the joint venture or the operations in Japan are already in the run rates. And then the investments we make will continue to be the headcount, which is primarily going to be engineering focused. That\u2019s tended to be where we have done it. And I would go ahead and model after the December quarter, if you are adding about 2 million a quarter from that level I think that\u2019s a reasonable assumption as we move forward. You can see during these last three quarters that with the backdrop we have been dealing with, we have done a good job of managing that number fairly flat during that timeframe. But going forward, we will be making investments and that will be primarily headcount.","Operator","Okay, thank you. And the next question is from the line of Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Vijay Rakesh","Hi, guys. Just on the filter capacity, how much capacity are you adding this year, and is the TDK completely in-sourced now?","Don Palette","Could you repeat that?","Vijay Rakesh","In terms of filter capacity, how much capacity are you adding this year? And I know you are sourcing some filters from TDK, is that completely insourced now?","Liam Griffin","Yes, I mean the filter capacity right now we are in pretty good shape. There is a possibility as we try to move into certain specialty filters and perhaps move up in frequency. There could be additional CapEx. But we have \u2013 we made a very robust move in capital, expanding our line that we talked about. We now have about 3x the capacity that we had a couple of years ago. Again, with a number of platforms and customers lined up to consume that. So, that\u2019s where we are in filters. And yes, we do continue to buy standard devices, standard filters from third-parties, TDK one of those and that\u2019s potentially something that could change over time, but right now that they are a supplier for some of our filters, that\u2019s correct.","Vijay Rakesh","Got it. And on the BAW side, you guys have talked about building out your own BAW filters, you have licensed it, where are you in that roadmap? Thanks.","Liam Griffin","Yes. I mean, we are still looking into that as what is the right path to continue on that pace. And we absolutely plan to play in high-band. We are playing in it now. I talked about the Huawei platform and there are a few others. So, that\u2019s something we will give you a little bit more color on perhaps in the next call, but it\u2019s an area that we absolutely understand what\u2019s needed to win. We are winning today with our current strategy and we will look at enhancing our strategy as we go forward.","Vijay Rakesh","Thank you.","Operator","Okay, thank you. And the next question is from the line of Quinn Bolton of Needham & Company. Please go ahead.","Quinn Bolton","Thanks for taking my questions. Liam, just wanted to ask as you look back over the last year given some of the inventory problems, especially with large customers, to the extent, you had more of your products flowing through consignment hubs? Do you think that would have limited some of the volatility you had seen in the business? And if so, is there a push to try and bring more customers into consignment hubs going forward? And then I have got a follow-up for Don.","Liam Griffin","Yes. Quinn, well hindsight, you never know how it would look, right. So consignment hubs, some of our customers demand it. And we work with them on it and its fine. Others, they don\u2019t operate with that model and it works out fine, too. I think we have unique situation here in the early part of the year. I think all of us in tech, at least in mobile ecosystem in our peer group felt the wrinkles on that. We have learned from it to some degree. But I don\u2019t know if that would have been mitigated or altered with a different supply chain model. Ultimately, the products that we build go into end products that get sold through the channels. So I think that ultimately that\u2019s all going to level out at some point, so we are not too concerned about it. Again we have one of our larger customers now in Asia that is requiring a hub arrangement with us. So we have work through that and that was actually part of our inventory here that Don mentioned.","Don Palette","One-time build there, yes.","Liam Griffin","But there isn\u2019t anything significant around being in or out of the hub consignment play.","Quinn Bolton","Got it. Okay. And then for Don now with the higher dividend and new share repurchase is 40% of free cash flow to shareholders still a good target, are you thinking of moving that up to a higher level?","Don Palette","We have been running a little higher than that. I think you use 50%, that\u2019s kind of a good \u2013 that\u2019s just as we are trying to model, I think that\u2019s fair.","Quinn Bolton","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Okay, thank you. And our final questions come from the line of Chris Caso of CLSA. Please go ahead.","Chris Caso","Yes. Thank you. Just some clarification from some of the earlier comments, particularly with regard to utilization plans in the second half of the year, as the inventory comes down, are you expecting the utilization levels in the facilities to remain constant and I guess according to the answer to that question, what impact on gross margins\u2026?","Don Palette","No, as we go forward, we actually we would expect them to go up slightly. We have kept those factories fairly full with the hybrid. But if anything, as you look into the earnings growth we go forward, we expect that to come up little bit. So that\u2019s a positive impact to the margins as we move forward obviously, whenever we can maximize the internal capacity.","Chris Caso","Great, that\u2019s clear. Thanks. And just the follow-up with the comments on China, you understand it sounds like you feel comfortable with what you are shipping against demand levels in China right now, just to be clear, are you expecting growth from your China customers in the second half versus the first half?","Liam Griffin","Yes. Chris, we are. We are expecting. And I think what we are seeing saying is kind of a nice bundle of higher performing players that are adopting some of that real rich content that we spoke about. That\u2019s one area. And then the second area and kind of the value tier, we are seeing a nice move here in customers that become exporters into emerging market, so it\u2019s twofold. Performance is going up in China. We are starting to see some real richness, Huawei\u2019s one example. There is few others, Xiaomi is one. And then we are also seeing this great emerging market play that allows us to MediaTek and Spreadtrum and others to participate in an opportunity to connect that 3 billion unconnected. So it\u2019s twofold, and second half will be stronger in China.","Chris Caso","Very helpful. Thank you.","Liam Griffin","Thanks.","Operator","Okay, thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Griffin for closing comments.","Liam Griffin","Thank you, operator and thank you all for participating on today\u2019s call. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences and events. Thank you.","Operator","Okay, thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now hang up."],"19601":["Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) Q3 2014 Earnings Call July 17, 2014  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Stephen Ferranti - ","David J.

This call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Stephen Ferranti, Senior Director of Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Ferranti, please go ahead.","Stephen Ferranti ","Thank you, Kathy. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' Third Fiscal Quarter 2014 Conference Call. Joining me today are Dave Aldrich, Don Palette and Liam Griffin. Dave will begin today's call with a business overview, followed by Don's financial review and outlook. We will then open the lines for your questions.","Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those noted in our earnings release and those detailed from time to time in our SEC filings.","I'd also like to remind everyone that the resulting guidance we will discuss today are from a non-GAAP income statement consistent with the format we've used in the past. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation with GAAP.","With that, I'll turn over the call to Dave for his comments on the quarter.","David J. Aldrich","Thank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone. Skyworks delivered very strong financial results again in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, exceeding our upwardly revised guidance. I'm proud of our achievements during the quarter and particularly pleased with the broad-based strength in demand. Our continuing outperformance reflects the sound underlying industry trends in our served markets and underscores the effectiveness of our diversification strategy and our execution.","At a high level, our business results are being fueled by a surge in global adoption of connectivity in all its forms across a diverse set of end markets. We are riding a wave of powerful underlying market forces, all enabled by the availability of efficient, high-performance connectivity solutions.","Among these are: The enabling of billions of unconnected users with the first time Internet access in the emerging economies; advancing new forms of content delivery, such as streaming music services, on-demand media and over-the-content distribution; supporting cloud services and mobile e-commerce; and fueling the growth of the Internet of Things.","All of these megatrends are in their early stages, and Skyworks is uniquely positioned to capitalize, leveraging a broad portfolio of specialized technologies, advanced system integration capabilities and unmatched operational efficiency. These core competencies enable us to deliver differentiated, customized solutions translating directly into superior financial returns for the company.","During the quarter, we generated revenue of $587 million. That's up 35% year-over-year and ahead of our updated guidance of $570 million. We produced operating income of $179 million, that's up 60% from a year ago.","We posted operating margins of 30.5%, surpassing the mid-term target profitability model we set in fiscal 2013. We produced EPS of $0.83, that's up 54% versus a year ago, and we repurchased 1 million shares of our common stock and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.11 per share. And finally, we guided to $1 of earnings per share for the fourth quarter.","By all measures, Q3 was an outstanding quarter, and we see our momentum continuing. I'll provide more color on some of our specific growth opportunities later in the call. But now I'll turn it over to Don for a more in-depth review of our financial results and our outlook.","Donald W. Palette","Thanks, Dave, and thanks again for joining us, everyone. Revenue for the third quarter was $587 million, ahead of our upwardly revised outlook, and up 34.6% versus the year-ago quarter. Gross profit was $266.6 million or 45.4% of revenue, and that's 140 basis point increase from the year-ago quarter. The upside to guidance was driven by the better-than-expected top line contribution, coupled with strength in our integrated systems solutions portfolio.","Operating expenses were $87.5 million, consisting of R&D expense of $53.8 million and SG&A expense of $33.7 million. We generated $179.1 million of operating income, yielding a 30.5% operating margin. That represents a 480 basis point increase versus the year-ago quarter.","Operating profits were up 60% year-on-year as we leveraged operating expenses, reaped the benefits of recent capital investments and continued to expand our margin-enhancing custom integrated solutions and precision analog products.","Cash tax rate for the third quarter was 10.2%, producing net income of $160.8 million or $0.83 of diluted earnings per share, and that's $0.03 better than our updated guidance.","Now let's turn to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Generated $199 million in cash flow from operations, invested $68 million in capital expenditures in support of upcoming demand forecast, and the majority of that was deployed to expand our assembly and test capabilities. Depreciation was $24 million.","We repurchased 1 million shares of our common stock during the quarter, representing a $41 million investment. Our share repurchases reflect the confidence we have in our business outlook, which we believe represents a highly attractive use of cash. And finally, we exited the quarter with $893 million in cash and no debt.","For the third quarter of fiscal 2014, power amplifiers represented 41% of revenue; integrated mobile systems was 33%; and broad markets was 26%, and that's roughly in line with the percentages from the first half of 2014. It's worth noting that these percentages can fluctuate on a quarterly basis. And as a result, we believe it's more important to focus on longer-term directional trends in these categories.","Turning to our fourth quarter business outlook. Based on our backlog, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be between $670 million and $900 million, reflecting broad-based strength driven by new product ramps, content gains, growth across the emerging markets, ongoing 802.11ac deployments and expanding set of opportunities within the Internet of Things. At the midpoint of $680 million, we suggest modeling gross margin in the 45.5% to 46% range with operating expenses of approximately $92 million.","It's worth pointing out that our guidance for the September quarter includes an extra week of operating expenses this year, which is a normal occurrence for us approximately every sixth year on the fiscal calendar. We estimated around $3 million of our fourth quarter operating expense will be attributable to the extra week. Below the line, we anticipate $100,000 in expenses from interest income and other expenses, and a cash tax rate of around 11%.","Looking ahead to fiscal 2015, we suggest modeling a cash tax rate of around 13%. We expect share counts to be around 194.5 million shares, resulting in fourth quarter EPS of $1 at the mid-point of the revenue range.","Our EPS guidance represents a 56% year-over-year increase and the sixth consecutive quarter above 20% year-over-year earnings growth, reflecting sustained strength and demand for our products, our differentiation in the marketplace and the consistency of our execution.","We remain on track to close our joint venture with Panasonic before the end of the fiscal year. Post-close, Skyworks will own a controlling interest in the performance leader and TC SAW filters with cumulative shipments approaching 0.25 billion units. We expect the venture to broaden our technology portfolio, further enrich our systems capabilities and enhance our financial returns. And just as a reminder, we anticipate the transaction will provide at least 100 basis points of gross margin accretion in fiscal 2015.","We continue to see tremendous earnings potential ahead. We expect the combination of above-market top line growth, gross margin expansion and earnings leverage to fuel continued outperformance in our financials, putting us on a path of $5 in annualized EPS over the next couple of years. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave for his comments on the market.","David J. Aldrich","Thanks, Don. So to put the strength of our recent results into a broader context, I'd like to spend just a few minutes addressing one of the key questions that we often hear from investors: What are the specific factors powering our accelerating growth and expanding profitability, and more importantly, can they continue? Well, at a high level, we see a powerful combination of content gains, new market penetration and share consolidation fueling our performance. In fact, we're actively engaged right now in architecting platforms for deployment in 2015 and '16, which provide us with a unique vantage point into the market dynamics that will fuel our growth over the years to come.","To be more specific, starting with the mobile market, we see 3 key drivers. First, the number of operating frequencies is trending higher. In support of improved service coverage and higher data rates, we see band content continuing to rise across high-end mid-tier and entry level 4G LTE devices. This drives greater addressable content throughout our entire product lines. Second, system complexity continues to rise. The combined impact of band proliferation and the adoption of sophisticated new techniques, including advanced antenna architectures, carrier aggregation, tuning and filtering, is resulted -- resulting in a rapid shift away from discrete components and is towards more customized and integrated solutions, which sweep in adjacent analog content, and Skyworks is absolutely at the forefront of this transition.","Third, our addressable content continues to expand. OEMs are increasingly focused on new ways to improve signal quality and download speeds to support seamless access to on-demand content, streaming media and cloud-based services. And this is driving more complex downlink architectures and creating entirely new growth avenues for us in the receive path. In addition, we're continuing to broaden our portfolio of mobile analog products in areas like power management, backlighting and GPS, and are seeing increasing customer contract -- customer traction here.","Outside of mobile, we also see a number of positive trends. First, data capacity requirements are growing dramatically. Next-generation connectivity standards like 802.11ac with multiple transmit and receive channels drive even higher performance levels, resulting in significant content for Skyworks, not only in routers but also in set-top boxes. We see it in media gateways, network storage devices and other high-performance networking applications.","Second, connectivity is expanding into brand-new device categories. These include wearable electronics, fitness and wellness applications, and new opportunities within the Connected Home like lighting, like security and automation. These all serve to enhance our diversification by providing new incremental growth avenues for Skyworks.","And finally, our vertical market penetration is increasing. We've spent the last decade investing significant resources and leveraging our technology to expand our presence in traditional analog markets like automotive, medical and industrial. We have established significant traction in these higher-margin growth avenues, and we see tremendous opportunity ahead.","It's worth noting that the growing -- the growth of our precision analog business has kept pace with the strong growth in our mobile segment over the last few years. And I think equally important is our ability to convert these strong top line growth trends into superior financial returns. Over the last few years, we've established a solid track record of doing so, significantly outperforming the analog semiconductor market by all measures.","Since 2010, we've more than doubled our revenue. We've expanded profit margins by over 600 basis points, and we've surpassed our 30% operating margin. We've grown earnings per share at a 25% compounded rate, and we've consistently posted over 20% returns on invested capital. These metrics are a testament not only to our execution and the inherent operational efficiency of our flexible business model, but also to our growing statue within the overall value chain as customers recognized that connectivity has become a key factor in defining the overall user experience.","We see all of these drivers creating an addressable market that is growing at least at the mid-teens pace which, when combined with the earnings leverage in our business model, result in significant earnings power over the next 2 to 3 years.","Hopefully, our call today and these comments has provided a better sense of the positive underlying drivers for our business and why we have such high confidence in our prospects for 2015 and beyond.","Okay. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open the line for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer.","Richard E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I just had a couple of questions. First, I guess, is you're coming off of a very big June quarter. Now we're looking at a another great big September quarter. I know it's broad based, but can you just highlight the top 2 or 3, 1 or 2 upside drivers there? And part of that question, too, is should we assume, as we look into the December quarter, that we revert to sort of a more normal seasonal pattern for you guys? Or some of those mega trends that you mentioned, Dave, and something changed fundamentally? Have we kind of shifted to the sort of a higher growth pattern for the foreseeable? That's my first question.","David J. Aldrich","Thank you very -- great question. Well, first of all, I am delighted to see that this strength is very broad based. We're seeing it in all of our business segments today. Probably the biggest driver is an uptake in the content-rich integrated mobile systems. We provided that split for you a couple of quarters ago. We're seeing a lot of growth there, and it's a direct result of architectures getting much more complex. We've also seen strong growth in our broad markets business. I think mentioned it, I don't think it's no small feat that we've been growing the broad market business as fast as we've been growing mobile, and that really says something in this industry. And it's being driven by 802.11ac deployments, new vertical market opportunities, we call it IOT, but there are a slew of them, and we've got a strong foothold and they continue to grow. And just -- as a marker, our broad markets portfolio year-to-date is up 26%. And we do see success within one of our largest customers by adding content in some flagship models.","Richard E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And so, Dave, that leads you to my second question. I don't know how much color you can give us on this, but you guys have obviously been capitalizing on that trend for greater RF complexity content. Can you give us any color or any sense how much of that growth with your -- one of your or your biggest customers is coming from, just units looking better versus your guys' increased content there?","David J. Aldrich","Well, I would say across the board that when we look at high-end smartphones and even entry-level smartphones in markets like China, we're seeing a dramatic uptake in the analog content, that we call integrated mobile systems. We're sweeping in more and more GPS, very complex, switching architectures using Silicon-on-Insulator. The transmit chain is becoming more complicated, carrier aggregation is adding more switch content, and we're doing a really nice job with our power lighting and display products. We're seeing display drivers, we're seeing camera flash devices for -- and so I think it's really much more the latter, which is just continuing to see this increase in complexity driving our business. And we are truly the only player out there today that can wrap all that functionality either into an MCM or some IC level. We're quite unique, and that's why we're taking share.","Operator","Our next question will come from Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Just to follow on to that question, just to -- I don't think I heard the answer on the seasonal trends you expect into the December quarter given the very strong results, and one of your customers, it sounds like, is in a big ramp here into their new product launches. Just how should we think about normal -- or seasonal trends into the December quarter?","David J. Aldrich","Yes, I guess, let me reiterate, our growth is not being driven by any single OEM or any single platform. It's quite broad-based, and it's a little early to talk about December, but I see nothing to deter us from thinking the December will be another up quarter and that the market will be strong and will be stronger than the market, and that's been relatively consistent for us. These underlying trends will continue in December and beyond.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay, great. That's very helpful. And then, just a question on the model -- and congratulations for blowing through the targets you set 2 years ago, and now it's a $5 annual run rate target. Don, can you just help us think on modeling what was the time horizon for maybe the $5 run rate and is the 13% tax rate what we should think about for the next couple of years as you go towards that target?","Donald W. Palette","Yes, Mike it is. And as you model us going forward, you can expect a lot of the same dynamics that we've talked about in the model over the last couple of years. I mean, it's all based on the top line growth opportunity, so that's -- and you start with those assumptions. And the gross margin will continue depending on what level of revenue growth, you'll drop the margin to 49%. We're going to continue to see operating leverage. And the goal of $5 in annualized EPS, if you take it off of the $680 million that we just guided, it's going to require -- and you do modest increases in the OpEx on a quarterly basis because we'll continue to make some investments. It will require growth of about 20% to 25%. That's the best way to think about it. And if you do that, you can run different scenarios and get a feel for the time frame.","Operator","We'll go next to Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Dave, I know you gave a very good overview of the content expansion story of -- at Skyworks. I think there has been some concern about the China market, perhaps, an overbuild of LTE. And I know you mentioned that your growth is not just one market, that it's more broad-based. But have you seen any overbuild of LTE in that particular market? And for you to report an up quarter in December, is it necessary for that specific market to grow very fast?","David J. Aldrich","Well, Vivek, I would say, if I look at the big picture, we are in the early days of a very large upgrade cycle that's going to be multi-years within China, and we've been talking about this opportunity for a long time. Just a couple of interesting statistics. There are over 1 billion mobile subscribers in China, and over half of them still use 2G. And of course, we benefit tremendously from content gains as 2G goes to 3G, and we benefit again at 4G and with the smartphone. And as you know, we're well positioned there. We've got terrific relationships with all of the leading baseband providers there, and we are adding in a lot -- analog content just as we are elsewhere. That being said, there will be winners and losers among the device OEMs, that's for sure. And as we've seen over the years in the past, we find that we need to really handicap our demand forecast. We've got a good track record of doing that. We take a conservative approach when we factor it into our outlook, and we're quite comfortable where we are today, but you raised a good point on the risk of over driving in some -- with some customers.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","All right. And I had a question not on fundamentals but on the stock. It's obviously done very well. But I'm amazed that it's really being driven more by a very solid earnings growth and there hasn't been as much P\/E multiple expansion. Why is that? And what can you do to help expand the P\/E multiple in the stock?","David J. Aldrich","Well, that's an interesting question coming from an analyst. I think what we can do is consistently meet or exceed our guidance and try to be as transparent as we possibly can of what's driving the growth, and it's been long term for us. We take a very long-term strategic view of our business, and we think we're positioned extremely well. I don't think we've ever been positioned as well as we are today for the long term.","Operator","We'll go next to Harsh Kumar with Stephens Inc.","Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Dave, I wanted to ask you a question. Towards the end of your comment, you mentioned you see, if I'm correct, a mid-teens industry growth for the parts and pieces of semi business that you play in. I'm curious why you don't think it's a higher growth sector? You just put up tremendous numbers. You're probably solidly in the 20% plus range for growth, teens the year before. Why is that number not higher?","David J. Aldrich","I think it could be higher, but I think you ought to think about it as being in that range. But I absolutely -- I fully believe you could be right, it could be higher.","Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then, Dave, a lot of people have already asked about where the strength is coming from. Let me ask you a different question. You are very optimistic about the Internet of Things. Is there any piece you feel that you're missing whether it's the computing piece or some other area that you feel like there's a hole in your portfolio to adequately go out and capture that market?","David J. Aldrich","Yes, I'll let Liam help me with that one. We've done -- we're reasonably happy with the content we've been able to add. It is broad. It's broad in the competition. But there are some pieces that we'd like to add to the portfolio. We are investing in sensors. We're investing in advanced switch architectures, and so we continue to push very hard into new areas that we think leverage our system capability and analog.","Liam K. Griffin","Sure. And as a follow on, and the IOT story is really early innings. And we are very well positioned with some of our core technologies, our 802.11 technology, our ZigBee technology, some of our advanced switching. And even packaging is important now as you look at these size-reduced applications. So we like our position within IOT, but we're very keen on expanding our footprint either organically or through some partnerships.","Operator","We have a question from Suji De Silva with Topeka.","Sujeeva De Silva - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","First of all, a couple of months since 2 of your larger competitors merged. I wanted to know if anecdotally you've seen any changes in the environment in terms of the design wins behavior and so forth? Or if nothing has really happened yet material?","David J. Aldrich","No. The short answer is no. I believe -- we've said in the last quarter, I think consolidation is very healthy for our industry particularly when -- along competitors that have excess capacity. It's just not healthy to have empty fabs, and so we're really happy to see it. But the fact remains that there are fewer and fewer competitors with the capabilities to deal with the system requirements that our customers are asking for today. So I think you're going to see more consolidation coming. The component of supply chain that had been popular in this business just doesn't work anymore. And I guess, I'd end it with we've done big mergers and they take a lot of time, resources and focus. So I think it's a good question.","Sujeeva De Silva - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then question for Don, perhaps. I know you guys just introduced the dividend, but can you talk about what's your kind of metrics are for -- if you would increase that, how you'd think about the payout ratio and so forth?","Donald W. Palette","Yes, I mean, we're constantly looking at our capital structure. The earnings are strong. We're generating a lot of cash. We've really been focused on that 40% return to shareholders, and we're doing that with the combination of the dividend and share buybacks. We think that's working really well. There's no doubt that as earnings continue to grow, we're going to be looking at increasing the dividend over time. As far as the specifics of what that ratio is, we're not going to get into that, but clearly that is something we're going to do over time.","Operator","Our next question is from Anthony Stoss with Craig-Hallum.","Anthony J. Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","And pretty impressive that you kind of skipped over the $4 target and right onto $5. Two parters. One for Don and one for Liam. Going to make sure Liam is involved. On the $5 annual run rate, Don, what do you think -- in terms of longer-term OpEx, what kind of growth you would need to achieve that $5? And then, if Liam won't mind, maybe you could talk a little bit about SkyOne and kind of recent design activity there.","Donald W. Palette","Yes, the way to think of the growth rate on the $5, as I said, is it's probably going to take 20% to 25% off of that $680 million, and that's impacted by multiple things. That depends on the year and the tax rate. So we said that approximately to use 13%. If, in fact, it would go beyond the year, it could be a little higher rate of maybe 14%, 14.5%. So dependent on what year you're putting in those growth rates. As far as OpEx, we just guided $92 million. Now $3 million of that is a onetime event because of the calendar, so you'd start with -- that's kind of an $89 million of an expense level. And from that, we're going to have modest growth over time. So you want add $750 million a quarter or a number like that in expenses, 150K, that -- maybe $1 million. But you can run some scenarios and you get a real good feel for when that's achievable.","Liam K. Griffin","Sure, Tony. And with respect to SkyOne, that continues to be a strategic part of our integrated systems portfolio. We're very pleased today that customers, increasingly, have an appetite for these advanced systems that we bring to market. And the complexity that Dave articulated, it's really going up. So our ability to go in and really take that RF chain, sweep-in filtering, sweep-in power management and provide a customized solution, we're seeing some value there. Also, we've been adding customers. We have 4 customers in production today, 5 or 6 on the hook for new designs going into 2015. We're pleased that we just added Nokia's Lumia suite of smartphones to our list, and we look forward to accelerated growth and continued design wins success in 2015.","Operator","We now have a question from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","I wanted to come back to the Panasonic announcement and just get your point of view on the benefits of that deal for, one, your technology capabilities. And then related to that, what do you think it does from a TAM expansion or customer expansion standpoint for the business?","Liam K. Griffin","Sure, Craig. Well, first of all, we've recognized for years the importance of filters and all flavors. And as Dave mentioned in the past, there really are many different frequencies, many different applications and a variety of filter technologies that can be deployed. For us, today, we love the asset that we're about to require here with Panasonic. It brings surface acoustic wave devices, also temperature compensated SAW devices that truly hit the sweet spot today of some critical frequencies. So what we can do with Panasonic is expand our portfolio; create a footprint for PA, SAW and filtering technologies; immediately lever us back in the design wins that we'll launch in 2015 and beyond; and build out a suite and a platform for us to go further into higher frequencies, more selectivity, higher performance levels with the engineering team and the production capacity that we have there.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","And the follow-up would be for Don related to Panasonic. Once you have Panasonic in house, does it change the way we think about the incremental gross margins on the business as you gain synergies with that capability?","Donald W. Palette","Yes, Craig. The 49% we -- before we said, used 48%, so the 49% already incorporates that extra point of margin. And certainly, our goal over time, well, to do better than that, but we're not -- we're suggesting modeling the 49%, but we're always striving to do better than our initial targets for sure.","Operator","We have a question from Alex Gauna with JMP Securities.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","I want to -- if my math is correct, your inventory days have fallen to about 55, which is the lowest that I can see in quite some time. Can you reflect upon your ability to meet incremental demand, maybe where you are in terms of capacity utilization and your thinking around how you're going to do your mix of internal, external going forward?","Donald W. Palette","Sure, Alex. Yes, it's -- you're looking at days, we look at turns, same thing. But yes, our turns were very, very good this quarter. Part of that is we were getting some really strong demand inputs and we're ramping both our internal capacity and external capacity in the hybrid model as we speak, and we've been working that. So as a result, the inventory that we have, both in the hubs and the inventory that we have on hand, we're building just a little lean this quarter, that will get a little more robust as we move into the September and December quarter because we're ramping the supply chain as we speak. So those numbers are a little higher than they should normally be for us, and we're working through those issues. But at this point, we're working very effectively with the customers in order for them to meet the demand that they have.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","And then I know, Dave, you touched on some of the new analog wins and power management wins that are going on. Could we just, conceptually, think about what sort of percentage of your revenue, either this last quarter or going forward, might now be coming from, let's say, non-RF, your core competency and RF areas?","David J. Aldrich","Well, that would be the integrated mobile systems portfolio, which is everything we kind of -- including SkyOne, GPS, Wi-Fi that is in a smartphone device.","Donald W. Palette","It was 33%, which is pretty consistent with what we run in the first half.","Operator","We'll go next to Steve Smigie with Raymond James.","Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just one here on gross margin, you guys have talked about gross margin expansion going forward and you listed some of the drivers, but I was hoping you could go into a little bit more details. Over the next 18 months to 2 years, what are going to be the main elements of the gross margin expansion?","Donald W. Palette","Yes, Steve, it's going to continue to be us making select CapEx investments and being able to leverage the hybrid model and making sure that we're keeping the right percentage of internal versus external sourcing, and that gives us the right contribution. And so we do -- day to day, we're doing the blocking and tackling of looking at yields and looking at productivity and what we're spending, working our supply chain. Those were all things that we've done for a long, long period of time that have allowed us to be best in class in this space as far as the margins. But I think the real next step function for us is we're continuing to move the mix into more and more integrated mobile solutions where there's more complexity. Complexity for us drives profitability. And there's fewer and fewer people in the space that can do it, and so as that continues to grow the percent of revenue, it's going to be a nice step function for us as far as margin expansion.","Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just turning back to SkyOne. So your thoughts on what that could be sort of percentage of revenue may be exiting the calendar year. And then for more complex devices like that exiting 2015, where do you think the industry is in terms of adoption of that? It seems like it's still early days, but I'm just curious, your thoughts there.","Liam K. Griffin","Well, the complexity theme actually is accelerating. And we're -- there's a couple of leading OEMs that have forged the path, and you would be surprised to see how this is catching on with a number of customers. So we think the ability to deliver integrated mobile solutions, whether they be SkyOne or derivatives -- I'll also, back to our filter comment, we have a great deal of flexibility now in architecting these customized solutions, not only on the transmit side but also on the receive side of a smartphone. A lot of rich content there. So we think the complexity theme will continue. It's a small portion of the market today. We've been capitalizing, but our position there is outstanding. We have the core technology, we have the switching technology, GPS power, core RF. And then, also weaving in some of our packaging and assembly techniques makes it really special. So we look forward to this upgrade cycle throughout the industry, and it's still quite early.","David J. Aldrich","And one thing we've learned, when we first launched SkyOne 1.0, if you will, it was a highly integrated all bands that was intended to hit a swath of the market where companies would look for -- OEMs would look for that a solution, a complete integrated solution. And what we've learned is that doesn't work. What works is a SkyOne architecture that's very reconfigurable and customized. It's really good for our business because we know how to do that, but there isn't anybody out there who seems to have the very same idea as another major OEM in how they want to architect these systems. It's all quite unique.","Operator","Our next question will come from Quinn Bolton with Needham.","N. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","But I just wanted to follow up on that last question. I guess, if we look out at the front end for mobile devices, it seems you've got 2 common architectures. One, sort of the broadband or MMPA; the other is the pad, moving to white band pads. Do you have a viewpoint? Is the industry going to stay diverse? Or do you think one of those architectures wins out over time? And if one of those architectures does win out, are you better positioned from a content perspective one way or the other? And then I got a follow-up for Don.","David J. Aldrich","Yes, I think that the -- if you will look at today, it seems that some form of a power amplifier duplexer or architecture made into a very complex receive set of products, switching and control products, seems to be gaining some traction. I think it's really a hybrid. As I mentioned earlier with SkyOne, what we've seen is SkyOne is very important with some combination of amplifier, duplexer, switching control and logic, and maybe voltage on the front end, maybe antenna tuning on the back end. That's where the architecture wants to go. That can be implemented with PADs, as well as discretes, or with an MMPA, and a couple of PADs, believe it or not, are overlaying some high-performance LTE bands with just a discrete PA. It is not one size fits all. But the trend is more integration and more integration and matching of PAs and filters and more customization on the receive path.","N. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then just for Don, just coming back to the dividend buyback policy. You get close to your $5 of EPS target. My quick calculation would say your cash from operations would be something around $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion. Is 40% of that going to shareholders the right percentage? Or as you get closer to that $5 target, would you consider increasing the percent of cash flow that might be paid back to shareholders?","Donald W. Palette","That was the same question. You said the same thing twice, but I understand the question. Yes, as we continue to grow and as more and more dollar available to us, we're going to look at multiple options. It could continue to be an expansion of the share buyback and dividend expansion. Certainly, as earnings go up, the valuation of the company is going to go up. And if -- we would be looking at a certain yield potentially that would go up. And it's just going to -- we're going to continue to expand. We'll need CapEx dollars. So all of those things we'll do, and we like having enough cash available. We'll also fund anything that potentially happens externally where we want to grow from a nonorganic basis. So it's just a question of managing all those things in concert. And you're right, as the numbers continue to grow, you have different options. The key is -- the key to a strong balance sheet, strong cash flow is it's a competitive advantage. It gives us the strategic advantage, and we like that. So it gives a lot of options.","Operator","And next we have Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","If you look at Panasonic here, obviously, it's helping you reduce your cost of the packaging side, but where you see -- do you see incremental market share opportunity either with the SAW or TC SAW as incorporate that?","David J. Aldrich","I think the short answer is yes. And first of all, it's integral part of our PADs, our SkyOne and even our GPS modules. As I mentioned earlier on customization, no one size fits all. The majority of bands still use a SAW. There are more and more narrow band spacing where we can provide a great differentiated product with a TC SAW, and Panasonic is a performance and IP leader there, hands down. And we see a limited number of bands where we need to partner for BAW acoustic processes, which we are doing. So we have a complete offering, and I think we're the only company in the world that is offering modules that incorporate SAW, TC SAW and BAW. And so it not only gives us the ability to eliminate margin stacking as we buy filters, we now will produce them, but it also gives us a competitive advantage to move TC SAW into more and more bands.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And just a housekeeping question here. What is your 3G, 4G mix? And with the strong ramp here in the second [indiscernible], does the PA plus IMS mix versus analog shift quite a bit?","Donald W. Palette","Yes, on the 2G versus 3G, 4G, it really -- that's really not that meaningful of a number for us any moment. The 2G is sub-10%, and the rest of it is 3G, 4G. And as we move forward, yes, we would expect in the September, December quarter that the PA percentage would drop a little bit. That's still going to be growth year-over-year, and the integrated mobile systems would increase in the percentage. We would expand...","Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I mean, the analog split would be about the same in broad markets basically.","Donald W. Palette","Broad markets would stay about the same percentage.","Operator","We'll go next to Mike Burton with Brean Capital.","Michael A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Just to follow up on that last couple of questions on filters and BAW. David, if you could update us, how many suppliers do you currently have that you can get supply for BAW if you do need it. I know it's not something that's been a huge priority for you in the past. And then, as we've seen the shift to 4G in China, are you starting to see the Avagos and TriQuints start to compete in that market, which has really been you and RFMD in the past?","David J. Aldrich","Well, first, we're getting BAW now from 2 or 3, and I think that list will grow a little bit. I'm sorry, the second part of the question, we're seeing new competitors. You mentioned a couple. We have seen the competitor list within open market China drop dramatically. We used to have 15 competitors for discrete PAs and then other competitors for switches and other competitors for filters. We no longer see that. If you look at the reference design of MediaTek or QUALCOMM or others, you will see 1 or 2 suppliers capable of really capturing the bulk of that analog content. So I didn't think it's -- I think it's not as you have described, Mike. I think it's more the opposite there. And that's where we're gaining. The complexity in all of these smartphones, even the low-end smartphone, is making it impossible, very tough, if not impossible, for component-only companies to compete.","Michael A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Very helpful. And then just a follow-up on -- there's been a few questions already on the SkyOne. But I'm just wondering, Liam, if you actually -- on the competitive landscape, do you see anything from QUALCOMM or RF Micro at this point? And would you actually view a successful offering from one of those guys actually as something that could actually accelerate that product category and today's point actually consolidate the market even further?","Liam K. Griffin","Sure, sure. Well, I mean, certainly QUALCOMM has been in the space for a while. And as David pointed out, with the more preconfigured approach, CMOS driven approach that they featured, there may be some customers that will adopt that. But what we continue to see is performance really mattering now in this industry. It matters a lot. Efficiency matters and GaAs HBT has been critical to that. But we also weave in CMOS and SOI in a lot of our solutions as well. So we have a balance. I think what will happen, and we're seeing it already, and we talked about the market growth and the overall TAM expansion, is that this complexity theme is going up. The appetite for our customers to take upon more complex solutions delivered by OEMs, delivered by suppliers like Skyworks, I think, is there. But we're really not seeing any others offer that. It's a very, very small set of companies that have the architectural leadership, skill set, systems knowledge to deliver to this new hurl within mobile. And we think this hurl is going to continue to go up. Our customers are very pleased with what we've been able to do. And as I mentioned before, the appetite for this type of technology is increasing.","Operator","And we'll go next to Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","Liam, you mentioned expansion of capabilities especially integrated mobile products once Panasonic is in-house. Other than eliminating the stock margin issue, what can you do with Panasonic in-house that you couldn't do with them externally? Does it suggest that you'd be offering discrete filter products that don't include amplifiers and devices? Or just expands your flexibility in addressing more integrated products?","Liam K. Griffin","Well, it does a lot of things. I mean, it certainly does open up a discrete filter opportunity for us, and there's a number of things we can do there. You're quite familiar with the industry. There's products that can address Wi-Fi, there's frequency bands that we could sell discreetly. We fully intend to advance the technology and build platform of filtering capability, center of excellence SAW in Japan. We also get -- back to the core, we have usage within SkyOne, of course, usage within our PADs. And as you know, being able to design and couple your filters under the same roof as your PA team is critical. And that's an advantage. And then on the receive side, if you look at some of these diversity FEMS that we see with LNA and switch and many, many filters, that's a whole new opportunity for us to address. We've had some wins, but having a filter technology in-house is really going to accelerate our hit right there. So there's many, many ways to play Panasonic. Immediately, we see filling modules that we've already progressed on, but we see an opportunity to expand as I outlined.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","Because in terms of TC SAW -- in terms of high-performance TC SAW, it's really only Panasonic and TriQuint. And TriQuint is probably going to be a bit distracted if you're coming here pretty quickly. So if you win in discrete market, it would seem like an opportunity that you could capitalize on given the shortage on this along...","Liam K. Griffin","Yes. No, that is right. And as I said, I mean, our goal is to try to move that forward into some of the higher frequencies, and we found, in many cases, appropriately designed TC SAW can take the space of BAW and perhaps even FBAR eventually.","Operator","Our next question is from Cody Acree with Ascendiant Capital.","Cody G. Acree - Ascendiant Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And maybe, Liam, just following up on that, does that then eliminate any real thought of progressing your -- the Panasonic technology into BAW filters, And do you think you can manage everything you need with TC SAW?","Liam K. Griffin","No, we will keep an open mind to that. I mean, our goal is to leverage the platform. We have a great group of engineers that come with us in this JV. We've been adding designers, filter designers ourselves. We have incredible insight on how the power amplifier filter and the system works together. So our role here is to advance the technology at Panasonic. We'll take advantage of the IP. We'll continue to have partners as well to ensure that we have the best possible solution.","Cody G. Acree - Ascendiant Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","How long might it be before you think you could advance to the tech to include BAW?","Liam K. Griffin","I think we could put the equivalent performance through Panasonic within the next 12 months.","Operator","Our next question is from JoAnne Feeney with ABR Investment.","JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy LLC","If we go back to the revised guidance in early June and we look where we ended up now, what would you say made it challenging to be more aggressive when you made that revision? What changed in the month of June? Was there anything specifically? Was it something about which you have less visibility typically than other things? And then, how does that play into the guidance for this quarter?","David J. Aldrich","JoAnne, I'm not sure I understand. Are you asking why -- what happened to cause us to exceed the revised guidance? Or was there some other question?","JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy LLC","Why wasn't it more predictable?","David J. Aldrich","Why wasn't the revision more predictable?","JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy LLC","No, why wasn't the result after the revision something you were able to predict in June? Was the quarter more back-end loaded than usual? What changed basically?","David J. Aldrich","Well, we exceeded the revised guidance, but I think we exceeded it by a reasonable amount. So not that much change. I think we remain conservative whenever we provide an outlook, and things just happen more right than the opposite. That's all. It wasn't a huge difference.","Donald W. Palette","No, and from the original guidance to the updated guidance, we knew there was a potential for some improvement, but we needed some things to materialize before we were going to do that. That's really all it was.","JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then on the cost front, you said you knew -- you've asked your foundries, it sounded like to step up production. What are you seeing by the way of pricing from the foundries? There's still certainly some excess capacity out there. Has the pricing environment changed very much? And with the pricing declines, if you're seeing them keep up with any component price declines that you might be facing?","Liam K. Griffin","Sure. Yes, I mean, we have great relationships with our partners, our outside partners, foundries, et cetera; and they're pleased to see our demand. We haven't seen anything out of the ordinary on the pricing. We continue to work negotiations into 2015. And the fact that we have been driving a lot of results through our OEMs have put us in a very good position for those discussions.","Operator","And our next question is from Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets.","Timothy Long - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Two, if I could. First, on the broad markets. You said it should be a similar percentage. Just curious because a lot of the highlights for the quarter that you talked about in the press release were non-mobile. So I'm just curious on that business. How important is the 3G versus Wi-Fi for that segment of the business? And then, the second question, just going back to China. I love the perspective on impacts of 2 things. One, being the potential for more 3-mode now than 5-mode; and on the other side, more of an opportunity to talk about the other carriers getting FDD licenses, what do you think that could mean for that important end market?","Liam K. Griffin","Sure. On the broad market piece, you asked about 3G and Wi-Fi. For us, broad market doesn't include any 3G. There's no cellular technology. So broad market for us is our advanced analog capabilities. It's PM, it's SOI switching, ZigBee, some Wi-Fi. And in that space, we have been growing. As we noted, 26% year-over-year, a number of end applications, some that we noted in the highlights from very creative IOT devices like Sonos [ph] high-def audio to Nest Thermostat's automotive opportunities, et cetera. There's a whole host of things. Networking and routers are all big parts of that story. And with respect to China, you had question on 3-mode and 5-mode. Yes, I mean, we monitor that split. And it's quite interesting because if you step back, and as David pointed out, half of that market or more than half is 2G. So a move to 3-mode is substantial, a move to 5-mode is perhaps even more substantial for us. But also remember, if you see more of a swing back to the 3-mode phone, where they drop FTE and WCDMA, they're typically sold at lower price points. So there could be a volume benefit to us there as well. But in any case, the China upgrade cycle is going to be substantial for us. We're starting to see a little bit of that now. 4G is a little bit late. It's back into our numbers, but multiple bands, multiples switching, a lot of content games will certainly be on the horizon.","Operator","And we have a question from Tom Sepenzis with Northland Capital.","Thomas A. Sepenzis - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","I think most of it has been asked at this point. But I'm just curious with QUALCOMM buying Wilocity, have you done any work at 60 gigahertz? Is that a market that you're thinking of going after for 60 gigahertz Wi-Fi?","Liam K. Griffin","Yes, I mean, we've monitored that. We're a pretty substantial player in Wi-Fi. We work with QUALCOMM, we work with Broadcom and a number of the other players. We haven't done anything specifically there, but we are evaluating next leg technologies and certainly expect this to be a big part of our story for years.","Thomas A. Sepenzis - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","Do have any sense of the timing on when you think that will actually become a thing?","Liam K. Griffin","The 60-gig standard, no, I don't have any specific timeline for that.","David J. Aldrich","We predict it to be around the corner for about 8 years.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Aldrich for any closing comments.","David J.

This call is being recorded.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Mitch Haws, Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Haws, please go ahead.","Mitchell J. Haws - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Skyworks Fourth Fiscal Quarter and Year End 2016 Conference Call. On the call today are Liam Griffin, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Kris Sennesael, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our discussion will include statements relating to future results and expectations that are or may be considered forward looking. Please refer to our earnings press release and recent SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for information on certain risks that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially and adversely from any forward-looking statements made today.","Additionally, the results and guidance we will discuss today are from non-GAAP financials, consistent with the format we have used in the past. Please refer to our press release in the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Liam.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Mitch, and welcome, everyone. The Skyworks team discovered solid Q4 and fiscal 2016 results, demonstrating the resiliency and power of our business model. To put a few metrics in perspective, we achieved record revenue of $3.3 billion, expanded gross margin by 280 basis points, delivered 37.8% operating margin, generated record operating cash flow of $1.1 billion, allowing us to return $727 million in cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, more than double the amount from last year. And despite headwinds with one of our leading customers, we are pleased with our ability to deliver record results in fiscal year 2016.","Now, at a high level, we see strengthening dynamics in the core markets we serve. Specifically, we are in the midst of a massive sea change in the mobile usage case. Given the utility and value that connected devices are bringing to the world, we are supporting and, in many ways, enabling a mobile ecosystem that is cannibalizing traditional brick-and-mortar industries, transforming the way we live, work and play. Wireless platforms have become virtual hubs for e-commerce, enterprise to cloud, social media, gaming and entertainment portals.","Ultimately, these devices are a conduit for a new multi-trillion connected economy across a wealth of innovative technology players. Consider that the top five S&P 500 companies, namely, Apple, Google Alphabet, Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon, are all monetizing these themes with mobile-centric business models.","At the same time, smartphone architectures are evolving to accommodate this rapid increase in mobile data across a densely crowded spectrum. The usage case is a catalyst for higher speed, lower-latency, secure and always-on connectivity, which is challenging the capabilities of existing hardware and the supporting cellular infrastructure.","Our mission at Skyworks is resolving this daunting complexity with customized, custom-level solutions, unburdening our customers while improving the user experience with higher levels of efficiency, enhanced streaming capabilities and expanded network coverage. All of this translates into an expanding opportunity for Skyworks. Recall that our focus is on the wireless connection, the most critical function linking the user to this incredible ecosystem.","In addition to the rise of mobile data, we are actively addressing two parallel growth drivers. First, connecting the unconnected. There remain 2 billion people that have yet to benefit from this dynamic ecosystem, and Skyworks will play a leading role in bringing this population online. In addition, we are committed to connecting every thing, as we address an estimated 20 billion new devices brought to market over the next five years.","Skyworks is seamlessly enabling these massive opportunities with highly customized system solutions supporting a broad set of protocols, including cellular LTE, to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee and emerging 5G standards. In an effort to facilitate the explosive growth of data delivery, creation, movement and storage, our customers are implementing methods to improve performance with carrier aggregation, receive diversity and MIMO functionality.","This dynamic involves a step function increase in levels of requisite analog and mixed signal performance, enhanced power efficiency and high precision filtering, as well as configurable systems integration capabilities. Skyworks' broad portfolio in systems-level expertise are well aligned to resolve the intense performance demands facing our customers. And further, 5G will be yet another industry catalyst and significant content driver for Skyworks. This technology will drive band proliferation at higher frequencies and play squarely into our ability to address complexity with fully integrated systems.","The breadth of our portfolio and our unique market reach continues to fuel a robust and diverse design win pipeline. To illustrate, during the most recent quarter, we leveraged our leadership SkyOne architecture across scores of 4G LTE platforms, with customers like Huawei across their Honor 8 premium lineup. We are also powering the first Google-branded LTE Pixel smartphone. And we are capturing design wins across broader markets in the Internet of Things. In particular, we continue gaining traction with customers like Amazon, supporting their Echo and Tap digital assistants. We are also enabling NETGEAR's Orbi home router system and providing an integrated solution to Trilliant for use in their smart grid platforms.","In addition, we are deploying small-cell solutions for several leading infrastructure providers in China. And in automotive, we are delivering 4G LTE solutions for use in both Land Rover and Jaguar models. These wins and others demonstrate our expanding customer and end market reach across both mobile platforms and the IoT.","At this point, I will turn the call over to Kris for his financial review.","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Liam. Revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter was $835.4 million, up 11% sequentially and exceeding our guidance and consensus. Gross profit was $425.9 million or 51% of revenue, in line with our guidance and up 100 basis points from the fourth quarter last year. Operating expenses were $107.5 million, consistent with our guidance for flat sequential spending. We generated $318.4 million of operating income, translating into 38.1% operating margin. Our cash tax rate was 12.6%, driving net income of $277.6 million dollar or $1.47 of diluted earnings per share, exceeding our guidance by $0.04.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash flow from operations was a record $455 million, driven by high profitability and significant improvements in working capital on a sequential basis. In particular, DSOs declined from 69 days to 45 days and days of inventory declined from 108 days to 94 days, and we expect further reduction of inventory dollars and inventory days in Q1.","Capital expenditures were $16 million versus $57 million in Q3, reflecting the lower investment level now required for our TC-SAW filter production. Further, in Q4, we repurchased 3 million shares at an average price of roughly $66 a share. And for fiscal 2016, we've repurchased 8 million shares at an average price of just under $66 per share, helping us to reduce our share count from 195 million shares entering the fiscal year to 189 million shares exiting Q4. We also distributed over $200 million in dividends over the course of fiscal 2016, up 63% year over year. In summary, Skyworks returned 81% of our free cash flow, or $727 million, to our shareholders over the fiscal year, up from the 64% distributed in fiscal 2015.","Now moving on to our outlook. For the first fiscal quarter of 2017, we anticipate our revenue to be up 7% to 9% sequentially. At the mid-point of $902 million, we expect gross margin in the low 51% range. We expect operating expenses to be $112 million, further reducing our overall OpEx ratio to 12.4% of revenue. Below the line, we anticipate around $1 million in interest and other expenses and a cash tax rate of approximately 15%. We expect our share count to be roughly 187 million shares. With our revenue growth and continued operating leverage, we plan to generate non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.58 in the first fiscal quarter.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liam.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Kris. So to quickly summarize, we delivered above-guidance results in the fourth fiscal quarter, closing out another record year driven by increasing global demand for high-speed connectivity coupled with strong operational execution. Skyworks systems-level expertise and scale advantages are positioning us to capitalize on the rapidly expanding mobile and IoT ecosystems, particularly with 5G on the horizon. Our profitability and strong cash generation capabilities allow us to fund growth and deliver increasingly higher returns to our shareholders. Clearly, we remain well-positioned to realize our vision of connecting everyone and everything all the time.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open our lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Go ahead, please.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking my question. Liam, for my first one, your December sales outlook is above Street expectations. When I look at it, though, it is still somewhat down year-on-year. When do you think you will get back to what has been the historic high-single, double-digit growth rate from a top-line perspective? And as part of that, how's the visibility into content gains and to flagship phones for next year?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure. Thank you, Vivek. Well, as you outlined, the guidance here for the current quarter is up strong, 7% to 9% coming off an 11% sequential here in Q4. So we certainly see the momentum coming back into our business. With respect to year-over-year comps, we're confident that we will be up on a year-over-year basis in Q2, fiscal Q2. We continue to see great momentum with the flagship players, not just the leading U.S. player, but globally. We're starting to see strength there and that's being represented in our numbers.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And as my follow-up, maybe one for Kris. On gross margins, if you could address the impact on gross margins from both fab utilization and just the market pricing. Because I think you had mentioned you would take down inventory over the next one or two quarters. What is the impact on utilization and gross margins? And part B of that is your competitor just reported very weak gross margins. And I'm wondering if that's a company-specific for them or are you seeing any pricing issues from a market perspective? Thank you.","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, I can't speak to what happens to our competitor. And we haven't seen any major changes to the pricing environment. That has been very consistent over the last couple of quarters. And looking forward, we don't see any major changes there.","Let me just on the gross margin highlight that, in fiscal 2016, we improved the gross margins with 280 basis points exiting the year at 51%, which clearly demonstrates a strong operational execution in terms of margin improvement. And we definitely want to continue to further drive operational efficiencies. And we believe that we can improve the gross margins with another 100 basis points exiting the fiscal year of 2017.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Blayne Curtis with Barclays Capital. Go ahead, please.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and nice results.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Thank you.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just curious to follow up on a prior question. When you're looking at the year-over-year and being down, are you still working through that specific customer issue? And when do you think you'll resolve that and be able to back ship the total run units (14:47)?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure, Blayne. In our $902 million, we don't have the full complement of what would be the legacy products with one of our customers. So some of that had been invoiced earlier in the year, as we articulated. But I will tell you that by the time this quarter is exited, we're clean, we're back on track. Again, we're pleased with the ability to bring up a 7% to 9% top line off of an 11%. We feel really good about our content position with the leading platforms. But there's a slight \u2013 an abating headwind, but a bit of a touch of that in the $902 million versus the prior year.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Then maybe just a bigger picture question as you look out next year. You mentioned several drivers. Just curious when you look at carrier aggregation, obviously you are combining bands. And some of those bands may historically be a broadband. Just curious of your view in terms of whether SAW and TC-SAW can address a lot of the transmit in terms of carrier aggregation. And when you look at next year, where do you see your biggest gains? You're able to get and receive game content in the larger phones. Where else do you see picking up decent content next year?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","That's a great question. So as you articulated, there's a couple of dynamics. We've been known for leadership in the transmit chain with Power Amplifier and Power Amplifier plus Duplex or SkyOne-like systems. That continues to be beneficial for us. We're probably 30% to 40% of the way of penetrating the market now. New names like Huawei are adopting the technology, players like Oppo and Vivo in China, and certainly the larger Tier 1s have been with us for a while.","So in the transmit chain, we continue to move up in frequency. So we've done a great job in low band. We're starting to win mid band. We can address high band with foundry partners for BAW. So that part of the food chain looks really good.","When you look at the receive side, we have a very unique strategy, a leadership strategy. We've been able to implement high content, high-performance solutions with the leading players in the market. That again now is starting to round out into China and some other spaces where that value is quite unique, and the performance requirements on the downlink side are immense. So we can handle that.","As you move further along, though, you start to look at 5G, et cetera. We think that the way that transmission will occur with TDD as well as FDD, where you have time-division duplexing, our ability to leverage TC-SAW looks very good there. So we can encroach frequencies that had been the domain of bulk acoustic wave with our TC-SAW with performance advantage and also taking advantage of the unique protocols that we see in 5G.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Harsh Kumar with Stephens. Go ahead, please.","Unknown Speaker","Hey. Yeah, thanks, guys, for taking my questions. This is Richard (17:31) in for Harsh. And congratulations on the quarter.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Thank you.","Unknown Speaker","Just wanted to start off and look a little bit deeper into the December quarter guidance, up 7% to 9%. What are some of the base assumptions for broad-based growth versus growth in mobile? What are you seeing at your largest customer? And then also, within China, some of the buy-siders that we talked to have talked about double ordering taking place over there. Are you seeing anything like that?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Well, let me start with Q1 and then we can touch on China. So we are seeing Q1 seasonally being strong in mobile across all of our major accounts in mobile looking good. And with a great enrichment and content really steering the ship there. So we see that the IoT and broad markets business continues to look good. We're up substantially on a year-over-year basis. IoT was up into the high teens on overall broad markets. For the full fiscal year, we're up about 12%. So we continue to see opportunities there.","And then if you think about China, we have \u2013 fortunately, China has changed a bit in the last couple of years. It's moved away from this 10 to 12 white-box players where there's a great deal of distribution and just hoping for the best in terms of upgrade cycles and ensuring that you've picked the right horses. What's happening now is it's starting to coalesce around three or four or maybe five players with names like Huawei leading, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, and then you get into a long tail of others. So we play that directly with the top four or five, with direct engineer-to-engineer engagements. We also play the entire China theater with our base band partners, so close collaboration with MediaTek, Spreadtrum, HiSilicon, even Qualcomm provides a buffer of diversification.","So right now, China has been a solid market. We handicap it quite well. We analyze the data from our distributors, we look at the pull rates and the upgrade data that we get from China Mobile and others, and we feel we have a very balanced outlook. I don't expect any volatility through any double ordering or anything like that. I don't see that. But we'll maintain a cautious view as we look out.","Unknown Speaker","That's extremely helpful. And then wanted to get your sense on what you look for, what are your criteria for M&A? And what's the appetite for M&A right now?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure. Sure. Well, the good news for us is that we're very bullish on the opportunities in front of us today at Skyworks. There's a great deal for us to do in our core markets in mobile and IoT and expanding our broad portfolio. We like what we see there. There's a tremendous need to support great customers looking forward. So M&A isn't something that is mission critical for Skyworks.","But having said that, we continue to look at opportunities if they come about. Our track record, as you know, reflects that we are highly disciplined when it comes to M&A. A deal needs to meet all of our stringent criteria. You can see that we've done a few deals in the last few years. The Panasonic JV has closed, bringing great TC-SAW technology in-house. We did a SiGe deal a few years ago for Wi-Fi technology that's played out beautifully. And even a power management deal with Advanced Analogic. And all of those elements play very well into our long-term strategy. So we'll keep our lens open for opportunities as they come about. But, again, very stringent financial criteria here.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Please go ahead.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on turning the corner in sequential growth in your on-hand inventory. Liam, I wanted to start with a longer-term question on the growth of the business. So one of the supply chain players early in the reporting season noted they think that smartphones will grow about 5% through 2020. I'm not asking you to endorse that. But if that were the industry's growth rate, what growth rate would you be satisfied with organically? And do you feel like you've got enough leverage in the portfolio to drive sufficient organic growth, or do you need to have a blended organic and inorganic strategy?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Well, I think organically, Craig, if you look at the unit growth which is approximately, as you indicated, about 5% on smartphones. It's the content lever that we're most excited about. And if you listen to the prepared remarks, one of the reasons why we talk about this mobile ecosystem and some of these great companies that are monetizing it, is that they really are driving change. They're driving change with our customers and our customers are driving that change to us. And often it's a give and take. In many cases, we're at the drawing board in crafting these incredible systems that move data.","So we see content being really the key focus. So we see unit growth could be 3% to 5% growth, maybe as high as 7% in top-line units. But it's the content lever that is unique. And I think that is where \u2013 I know that is where Skyworks outperforms. The higher the content in terms of the complexity and the performance needs, that's when we do our best work. So with that said, we would expect to be at or around double-digits across the board. Could be higher in some cases, depending on the market and the mix.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","That's helpful. And then one for Kris. Kris, you mentioned that you'd expect gross margins to be up 100 basis points. That's solid, but it is just 40% of what the business had done in the just completed year. So as we look at the performance of the business, should we expect that as the expanded manufacturing facility, both with Panasonic and Impact Gene (23:03), as that really ramps and hits its operational stride, that longer term we can get back to years where gross margins can improve on a multi-hundred basis point basis, or is this the new run rate for the business?","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, there are definitely multiple levers to improve gross margins. As Liam just explained, we see some above-market revenue growth. And, of course, incremental revenue and volume growth help to absorb our fixed cost structure.","Secondly, we are insourcing the filters in our own filter fab, and that is driving further margin expansion. And then, of course, there is the normal tackle and blocking and operational efficiency improvements, including cycle-time reduction, yield improvements and internal and external cost reductions. And maybe last but not least as well, we do see a further mix improvement in some other areas outside of mobile that have slightly above-average gross margin. And when you put it all together, we are comfortable that we can further improve our gross margins.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Atif Malik with Citigroup. Go ahead, please.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for taking my question and good job on the execution. Liam, the first question, you talked about the criteria for M&A. And I think in the past, Skyworks has talked about maybe acquiring something in the $2 billion to $3 billion range kind of size of the company. Can you just remind us what are some of the criteria you're looking at? And is this still the right size of the deal you're looking at?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, I wouldn't really want to put any boundaries on deal size. I think it's more about the merit of the opportunity and how it plays within a Skyworks franchise, so to speak. So we definitely look for opportunities that \u2013 everyone talks about synergies in terms of accretion and financials. But I also want to see entities that really do better with the Skyworks brand than they would separately.","We talked about some success stories. SiGe, Panasonic, even AATI, are example of that. So we would like to have the kind of acquisitions that really raise the overall franchise, that bring us into new technology opportunities that perhaps augment our strength already in the positions in the market that we enjoy today.","So it's a complex answer. There isn't one simple thing that we're looking for. It's a number of things.","We do have a very, very high bar. We've looked at a lot of franchises and a lot of assets. And for us, the bars are quite high. And I like that. I think we've worked really hard to generate the cash that now has been phenomenal for us and I think we're on a great track record to continue to do that. We have the powder to do the right deals when they come along, but we'll continue to be very vigilant.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Sure. And then as a follow-up, you guys had a pretty good design win in the latest iPhone and diversity receive modules. And Murata was quoted in an EK (26:13) article in Japan that they could take pricing down by like one-third to get the sockets back. Can you just talk about the stickiness of these wins? And how should we think about you guys extending this content going to next year?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. All of these complex solutions that you eluded to, whether they're with the lead customer or the top three or four, are highly customized. I know what we offer. It's highly customized. It is very sticky. These are engineer-to-engineer developed solutions, highly calibrated within the customer's ecosystem. There's little risk that anyone will be unseated or there will be any kind of pricing action post design-win.","And then it's the incumbency and the ability to execute, the ability to manage your capacities and execute the supply and all those other things that keep you in it the long term. So we feel really good about our position with the leading accounts and our ability to grow with highly complex solutions that in every new cycle, upgraded, altered, changed to meet customers' needs.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Caso with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC","Yeah, thank you. The first question is regarding the inventory levels. Could you take a bit about where you expect those to be exiting the quarter? I'd suppose you'd want to have the inventory levels down entering the seasonally slower March quarter. Just talk a little bit about that, about the magnitude of any potential reduction and where you'd like to see them exiting the year.","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, so during Q4 we reduced our days of inventory from 108 days to 94 days. That's a 13% reduction. We are pleased with that. We do expect in Q1 to further reduce inventory, both as an absolute dollar level as well as in terms of days of inventory where we target to get to approximately 85 days.","Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. That's 85 days by the end of the year? Or is that a target for the future?","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","There will be some seasonal fluctuations as you go through the normal seasonality, but on average that's what we target.","Operator","Thank you. We have a question from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Go ahead, please.","Kulin Patel - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. This is Kulin Patel calling in for Ambrish. Thanks for taking my question. For your revenue headwind, you mentioned headwind at your largest customer. Is all the headwind due to legacy units, or was there any share loss?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","No. No share loss. This is really just about some headwinds on legacy units that were shipped earlier in the year, trued up now here by the middle of the end of this quarter.","Kulin Patel - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And for the CapEx, you mentioned it's down because of lower investments in TC-SAW. How do we think about it for the new fiscal year? What's your CapEx plans for the year? Are there any investments in the pipeline?","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","No, just normal course. In fiscal 2016, we spent roughly $189 million. For fiscal 2017, we target $200 million to $220 million of CapEx.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, let me just add, if you go back to a couple years back we were at about $400 million to $430 million to really outfit and install the significant TC-SAW facility, which is a $3 billion unit per year producer of high-performance filters. So that's a big bump up. With that behind us, the run rate CapEx that Kris mentioned is sustainable. It's enough for us. We can do a great job with that capital and monetize our assets and filters as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. My first question is whether you can segment revenue out by PA, IMS and broad markets?","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yes, so broad market was approximately 25%, mobile approximately 60%, and PA 15% during the fourth quarter of 2016.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you for that. And then I guess I had a question about the revenue minus your largest customer. You had guided it up in the range of 10% to 12% for the September quarter. Can you give us what that actually came in at? And what the guidance implies if I exclude your largest customer?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, so in terms of the full year, I can give you the full year of 2016, the balance of our business ex our largest customer was up about 11% to 12%. And it's a portfolio of broad market, other mobile absent the largest customer and other IOT businesses. So that's kind of the roughest cut at the high level. In Q1, our largest customer is seasonally strong, of course, going into a seasonal ramp. But the top-three Tier 1 accounts are also ramping aggressively into Q1.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, thanks. Question on the gross margin outlook for the December quarter. Typically, you'd see some fall through in terms of the higher volumes. I know you mentioned you're working inventory. Maybe that's an influence. Anything else potentially from a mix perspective in terms of some of the new wins, what they might carry versus a year ago?","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","No. From a mix point of view, Q1 traditionally has a higher mobile revenue, which is slightly below average. And so that has an impact on the gross margin.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then as a follow-up, there's a number of questions asked on M&A and capital allocation. The diversification angle specifically, how important is that to the company as you explore potential deals out there?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Well, diversification is an element. It's something that we look for. But really, it isn't the only criteria. It's not the underlying criteria. We're looking for opportunities that really drive the entirety of the business. And as we said, we feel really good about what mobile is bringing. It's a lot more than what the market expected three or four years ago or five years ago. And what we are seeing from our customers is just a daunting and relentless push for performance.","And what we're also enjoying are product developments and revenue streams that weren't on the radar screen five years ago, diversity receive, we talked about, Wi-Fi has been taking off. Our GPS location systems are taking off. We are seeing more and more reach into our filter franchise. There's just a lot to do. So we wouldn't look at a deal on the merit of diversification as a primary motive. It would be nice in some cases, but we would also entertain opportunities that really help us advance our core business.","Operator","Thank you. We now have a question from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Go ahead, please.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Yeah, hi, guys. I'm just looking at the gross margins for the December quarter. Last year when your top line (33:23) was up 5%, your margins improved pretty nicely, 100 bps, 140 bps. Here you're guiding flat. Are the incremental gross margins much lower than what you've had historically?","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Our incremental gross margins are in the mid-50%s right now.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Sure. And as you look at the BAW roadmap, I know you guys said you are getting BAW from your foundry partners. Can you update us on how your roadmap looks there? Are you expecting any BAW products launching here, or still expect TC-SAW to take that part of the bands, too? Thanks.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Sure. Well, there are significant growth opportunities in the areas that we are strong today across TC-SAW. We continue to push the frequency range in TC-SAW quite nicely. We're winning a lot of products there, not only on transmit, but also on diversity receive. So BAW technology is not critical. It's not mission critical. We understand where it is in roadmaps, where it isn't in road maps. We are making great progress again in raising the market opportunity for our TC solutions.","And also when you look at things like 5G, what we're seeing is that there's more and more TDD capability in 5G than FDD. So when you go to TDD, time division duplexing, you don't require a BAW filter or a BAW duplexer. You can do it with TC in many of these frequencies. So that's another expanding opportunity for us.","Now having said all that, we have access to BAW. We're using it today with some of our flagship products with foundry partners. We always take a look at make versus buy, is it an opportunity for us to invest in-house. We'll continue to weigh that balance. But be sure that we're going to be able to address the market as we need to. We'll be able to address the filter opportunities and the systems engines that we've been delivering for years. So there's no stop on that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Go ahead, please.","Vincent Celentano - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. This is Vincent Celentano on for Steve. I was wondering if you could tell us during the quarter how many handset customers did you have and if you can you give us an idea of how big the overall Chinese handset OEMs were as a percentage of revenue for the smartphones base?","Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","So we have two more than 10% customers, Foxconn at about 40% and Samsung at about 10%.","Vincent Celentano - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","With respect to China. So China all-in, I don't have the itemization of the handset versus the broad market. All-in China is about 25% in that. And then if you look at the mobile portion would be led by Huawei, for example. But all-in, 25%.","Vincent Celentano - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great. And the obviously, this past March was more of an abnormality in terms of your normal seasonal trends. So just going forward, as you look in the March quarter, is there any reason you wouldn't see the normal trends you had seen the past few years before this past March?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Correct. I think as we anticipate typical market seasonality for our space is maybe 10% to 15% down in the March quarter. Our mission is to offset that to some degree. We're confident we can do it. Last year was a bit of an aberration. So our job is to out-perform that market in March.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Go ahead, please.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Welcome, Kris. Looks like broad markets went down about 5% if it went from 29% of sales to 25%. So is that just lumpiness or anything happening in Wi-Fi or IoT?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, the issue there was more around infrastructure more than anything else. The IoT space was about flat. That will come up again in about March. And infrastructure was a bit of a drag on broad markets in this quarter.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then maybe talk more about SkyBlue. It looks like you've got some nice power efficiency solutions that go beyond envelope tracking. It sounds like you had Panasonic. Should we expect any progress in some other geographies and other OEMs?","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Great question. I'm glad you brought that up. So SkyBlue is a method that Skyworks uses really as another way to provide efficiency in the amplification and transmission food chain. And so we do that with a very unique proprietary architecture we call SkyBlue. It is embedded in some of our systems solutions. If you look at some of the leading platforms that we've announced and you can see through tear-downs, those devices are apparent there.","They've made up with our SkyOne solutions to provide higher levels of efficiency. Incredible levels. Higher than ET in many cases. It's a device that is base band agnostic. We are working with all the key chip providers as well, and it is very early for us right now. We have a long way to go with this solution. We are continuing to provide new and additional revs with upgraded performance. But it is in production with four or five key brands today.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ed Snyder with Charter Equity Research. Go ahead, please.","Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research","Thanks, Liam. If iPhone 6s inventory is all consumed by the time you exit December, as you indicated, why shouldn't we expect to see orders for those parts to you from Apple if they keep selling that phone in 2018? Is that an erroneous assumption? But if the phone is still being built after they consumed all their raw material from you, then I would expect you'd see some sort of revenue for that product.","And then on MediaTek Phase 2\/Phase 3, China has been strong for you and your competitors. And I know that Phase 2\/Phase 3 only use modules with switches and amplifiers. But it sounds like MediaTek may be moving to pads earlier than expected. You currently do not sell discrete filters into that market. But if they go to pads and you're one of the two big suppliers of those parts already, why should we expect that your filter demand should step up significantly because MediaTek would obviously be buying those filters from whoever is buying the modules, and that's going to be you and maybe Corbo (39:37).","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, great insights, Ed. So on the first one, certainly if there were additional demand requirements for the Legacy products with our lead customer, it would be well positioned to deliver, and that could be incremental revenue for us. So that is one.","And then with respect to MediaTek, you got it right. So right now we have a very strong partnership with MediaTek. And one of the products that has done really well in that ecosystem is our SkyLiTE product. So the SkyLiTE product, and I know you get this, but for everyone. It is really a SkyOne solution absent the filter. So we lay out all the required amplification, transmit, receive, switching, and we do everything but the filters. And we allow the MediaTek ecosystem, the customers that use the MediaTek chipset, to pick and choose filters. That's been the lay of the land here for a while.","Next rev we are looking at integrating, leveraging our TC-SAW capability to bring in a complete pad or SkyOne-like product to these MediaTek customers. So it's a great opportunity. We are working on it right now. Hopefully we'll have more to report to you here in the next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Griffin for any closing comments.","Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.","Well, thank you all for participating on today's call. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences and events during the quarter.

At this time, I will turn the call over to Steve Ferranti, Senior Director of Investor Relations for Skyworks.","Mr. Ferranti, please go ahead.","Stephen Ferranti ","Thanks, Greg. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' fourth fiscal quarter 2013 conference call. Joining me today are Dave Aldrich, Don Palette and Liam Griffin. Dave will begin today's call with a business overview, followed by Don's financial review and outlook. We'll then open the lines for your questions.","Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those noted in our earnings release and those detailed from time to time in our SEC filings.","I'd also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we'll discuss today are from our non-GAAP income statement, consistent with the format we've used in the past. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.","With that, I'll turn over the call to Dave for his comments on the quarter.","David J. Aldrich","Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. I'm pleased to report that we delivered a strong close to the 2013 fiscal year, with fourth quarter results beating our prior expectations on the top and bottom line. Our out performance was driven by our expanding diversified analog footprint and growth in custom solutions for connectivity platforms coupled with a laser focus on execution.","During the fourth quarter, we posted revenue of $477 million. That's up 9%, sequentially, and more than 13% versus last year. We produced operating income of $130 million, that's up 26% versus last year. We earned $0.64 in diluted earnings per share, up more than 20% versus last year and $0.02 ahead of our guidance. We also generated $166 million in cash flow from operations.","Our strong fourth quarter performance closed out a record 2013 for Skyworks. To recap, for the full year, we posted over 14% top line growth, achieving revenue of nearly $1.8 billion. We grew our operating income by 19%, exiting the fiscal year with operating margins of 27%. And we generated over $0.5 billion in cash flow from operations. We also repurchased over 8 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $22.75 per share.","The growth, profitability and cash flow metrics that we achieved in 2013 put us among the best-of-breed within our broader peer group and highlight our differentiated business model.","Looking ahead, we see this momentum continuing. Our strategy of aggressively investing in diversified analog markets, while capturing more value through custom system solutions will enable us to continue to drive above market -- above market top line growth, profit margin expansion, strong earnings leverage and robust cash flow.","For more detailed commentary on the quarter, I'll now turn it over to Don for his financial review and outlook.","Donald W. Palette","Thanks, Dave, and thanks again for joining us, everyone. We appreciate that. I'm going to provide a more in-depth review of our fourth quarter results and then outline our business outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2014.","Revenue for the fourth quarter was $477 million, and that's up over 9% sequentially, and more than 13% year-over-year. Gross profit was $211.8 million or 44.4% of revenue, ahead of the midpoint of our guidance range and up 150 basis points from a year ago.","Operating expenses were $81.5 million, consisting of R&D expense of $49.2 million and SG&A expense of $32.3 million. Operating income was $130.3 million for the quarter. That translates into 27.3% operating margin. Our cash tax rate was 7.3%, slightly better than our prior forecast based on favorable year-end tax adjustments.","Net income was $121.2 million or $0.64 of diluted earnings per share, and that's $0.02 better than our guidance.","Turning to the fourth quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement, we generated $166 million in cash flow from operations, we invested $38 million in capital expenditures, with depreciation of $19 million, exited the fiscal year with $511 million in cash and no debt. And we repurchased over 800,000 shares of our common stock. For the full fiscal year, we produced $508 million in cash flow from operations, with free cash flow of $384 million. That represents over 8% free cash flow yield based on our most recent stock price. Finally, our return on invested capital was 20.5% for fiscal 2013, well ahead of our weighted average cost of capital.","Turning to our first quarter 2014 business outlook. We expect Q1 revenue to be $500 million, our first quarter as a company at a $2 billion annualized revenue run rate. We expect gross margins to continue trending higher and recommend modeling at 48% drop-through of incremental revenue to the gross profit line. That translates in the first quarter gross margin of around 44.5%. We expect operating expenses to be approximately $82.5 million, resulting in operating margins of 28%, and that's a 270-basis-point improvement from Q1 of 2013.","Over the course of fiscal 2014, we expect continued margin enhancement driven by growth of our diversified analog business and by capturing new customized content across the world's leading connectivity platforms.","All the line, we anticipate $100,000 in expense from interest income and other expenses, and a cash tax rate around 10%. We expect our cash tax rate to remain at these levels for the remainder of 2014 fiscal year. As a result, we expect Q1 EPS of $0.66 using a base of 191 million shares. Many of the drivers for a strong 2014 are in place today, giving us a high level of confidence in our growth trajectory over the course of the year and putting us on a clear path to achieving our midterm business model of 30% operating margins at a quarterly revenue level of $550 million. And just as a reminder, this would produce around $3 in annualized earnings per share.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave for his comments on our market trends and growth strategy.","David J. Aldrich","Thank you, Don. We're quite pleased by our recent financial performance. And more importantly, we're excited about 2014 and beyond. Our consistently strong business results reflect the healthy underlying trends in our served market and our success in capitalizing on these opportunities. These include the widespread adoption of connectivity in all its forms across a diverse set of end markets. The dramatic increase in analog complexity driven by the proliferation of communication protocols and enhanced functionality, and OEMs need to align with partners capable of providing a total system solution that maximizes performance.","So for the remainder of the call, I'll discuss how our business strategy is designed to capitalize on these trends, generating above market growth with best-in-class financial returns.","At a high level, there are 2 underlying components to our strategic plan. First, we're aggressively investing in growth opportunities across diversified analog end markets. And second, we are capturing more value to highly customized system solutions. The end result is that Skyworks facilitates the adoption of all forms of connectivity within devices, across the supporting infrastructure and throughout the broad markets. Starting with the broader market opportunity, it is clear that connectivity has evolved into a critical enabling technology within the traditional analog landscape, and in fact, represents the biggest growth vector in these markets today. Just as an example, General Electric recently announced that it will incorporate Machine-to-Machine communications across its entire industrial portfolio, including jet engines, including locomotives, turbines and medical devices, representing millions of GE products in total. This is just one example of how traditional analog end markets like industrial, medical, automotive are embracing connectivity. In many cases, for the first time and intersecting directly with Skyworks' core competencies, these are highly attractive markets for us, characterized by longer product life cycles, far fewer competitors and higher margins. Skyworks participates in these markets by leveraging core analog and mixed signal design capabilities and a very broad product catalog.","Our portfolio spans all connectivity standards and includes power management ICs, panel lighting and display modules and switching solutions, along with more traditional analog products. This opportunity creates -- the opportunity that this creates is tremendous. And for example, Cisco forecasted there will be 50 billion connected devices by 2020. In fact, we recorded a number of new design wins during the quarter that illustrate our growing diversification in areas like medical. This is a newer market for Skyworks, relatively small in size for us today, but it is representing a significant growth driver in the coming years. We build the presence in this market through investment in product line expansion and field applications engineering teams and systems development. And for example, in the fourth quarter, we won a custom optical emitter detector module with Varian Medical for oncology radiation applications. We've also been designed into Magnetic Resonance Imaging or MRI applications, where we provide switch matrices for reactors and limited diodes -- limiter diodes, utilizing literally dozens of Skyworks devices.","In total, we provide a portfolio of the analog solutions for a wide range of medical applications like hearing aids and glucose monitors, heart defibrillators and patient telemetry applications. And we're already aligned with the major medical equipment makers like GE Medical, Boston Scientific and Medtronic, among others. Our Q4 design wins also include a diverse set of applications like DC\/DC convertors and LED backlight drivers for automotive displays at LG. Like power management ICs and ZigBee Front Ends for WNC's portfolio of remote lighting, in-home monitoring security platforms. Low noise amplifiers for the broadcast microphone portfolio at Shure. Hi-rel analog solutions with Cobham, EADS and Teledyne and low-power Smart Energy solutions supporting communications hubs, meters and in-home displays with Silicon Labs.","In summary, we're quite excited about the breadth of new market opportunities that deploy Skyworks' technology.","Turning to the second component of our growth strategy, we are capturing more value through highly customized system solutions. Growth of connected devices is projected to continue at a healthy pace for the next several years, but more importantly, Skyworks' addressable content is being driven higher. By the adoption of precision location-based services and upgraded local area connectivity, both of which require highly customized isolation and shielding to avoid coexistent issues with adjacent communication protocols. High-performance power management ASICs and LCD backlighting to support higher resolution displays and more complex camera flash approaches. System-level architectural trends like tuning, carrier aggregation and diversity to maximize data bandwidth within today's spectrum constraints, and brand proliferation with significant expansion in global 4G, LTE capabilities. The net result is an expanding addressable market opportunity for Skyworks. And in fact, it's not uncommon for us today to target addressable content of more than $12 within leading platforms. This is more than twice that of just a few years ago, and we see numerous opportunities to continue adding new content in the coming years.","So in closing, our force -- our fourth fiscal quarter marked another strong performance for Skyworks, and we are optimistic about our prospects for 2014. Our strategy of growing our diversified analog footprint, while capturing more value through custom system solutions will enable us to continue producing best-in-class results.","This concludes our prepared remarks. So operator, let's open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar from Stephens.","Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First of all, in your business highlight section of the press release, there was not a single cellphone design win. So when you talk of diversity, Dave, are you talking about diversity of revenues into analog, or more specifically, diversity of revenues into analog away from cellphones?","David J. Aldrich","No, Harsh. Thank you. It's not away from cellphones. It's more the fact that the smartphone market, tablets and the like, they're very large components and drivers of a broader connectivity landscape. So when we talk about connectivity, we talk about location-based services for example, Wi-Fi connectivity, power management and expanding our footprint. We're talking about mobile as well as the Connected Home, as well as medical application, the automobile, Machine-to-Machine. So we're really talking about connectivity in a more broad sense.","Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then as a follow-up, could you, Dave, maybe talk about your assumptions for the China market in the near-term and even the Korean market on the large customer there? There's been a lot of talk that there's variations going on in the order activity. Any color that you can give us would be helpful.","Liam K. Griffin","Harsh, this is Liam. With respect to China, we have a very strong position there as we've had in the past, with all the major players, MediaTek, Spreadtrum. We've seeing great opportunity going into 2014 and beyond, as they move through an upgrade cycle that's really is in the early innings. As you know, probably 80% of the subscribers today in China are carrying a 2G phone. MediaTek for example, moving from dual- to quad-core chipsets. Supporting customers like Lenovo and CoolPad and others, great partnership for us. And I think, one of the opportunities you should see is not only an expansion in our core power amplifier and multi-band, but also will start to weave in Wi-Fi and power management, GPS and other capabilities around analog. So that should be a growth for us. And with respect to Korea, we have seen in some cases, some inventory correction there, but it's all been factored into our guidance. Nothing that surprises us, and nothing that will impact our numbers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Walkley from Canaccord.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Don, just a quick housekeeping question. Can you just give us a split between the handset and HPA business, and then I have a follow-up question.","Donald W. Palette","Sure, Mike, it's consistent where we've been [indiscernible] it's 40% HPA and partially 60% handset.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Great. And if we just look longer term, we're a big believer also in the Internet of Everything and Machine-to-Machine market. But with the opportunities you highlighted, and the growing band LTE et cetera. Over the next year or 2, it seems like the TAM of just of handset side of your business grows to double-digits, so do you anticipate the next staying similar for you 2 businesses over time?","David J. Aldrich","This is Dave, Mike. No, I don't. I think that the non-handset component of our business will grow and become a larger component than the 40% that it is today, because we talked about medical in the prepared comments. It's a relatively nascent market in terms of connectivity, but the opportunities are exploding, Machine-to-Machine. So I think, the year-over-year growth rates in connectivity into some of these newer burgeoning markets is going to grow -- allow us to grow faster. You're right. Within mobile, what we're really seeing is not so much of the growth coming from traditional products, but being able to provide more custom system solutions and incorporate power management location-based services, like Wi-Fi connectivity and lighting and display. So we done a -- we think a good job of adding more content growing that way within mobile -- it's highly defensible, it's higher margin and then continuing to round out our market portfolio.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Dave, how's the visibility into the flagship models for 2014? So if you, for example, look at the top 3, 4, 5 models that you're in today, would you expect your content to be flat, up or down next year? Any color would be helpful.","David J. Aldrich","Well, I think, Vivek, if I could answer that question more broadly, there is a trend that is not slowing down and that is -- these devices in general, high-end smartphones as well as the upgrade cycle from 2Gs feature phones to smartphones in places like China, is sweeping in much more content and complexity, the screens are becoming, in many cases bigger, but in all cases a higher resolution, the cameras are moving to do full-flash AMOLED technologies. You're starting to see more complex power management and voltage regulations systems required to support low-current consumption. Connectivity with GPS and Wi-Fi being virtually across the board, so I think in general, you should look at the content gains for a broad analog provider like Skyworks, continuing for many years to come. I don't see that slowing down. And then, I think, as you start to see connectivity in its nascent state moving into these other markets, you'll start to see a shift towards a more balanced portfolio of end markets for Skyworks, in addition to a much broader set of functions, customized into a system solution. It's sticky, it's defensible, and we make much higher margin in those class of products.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I see. And as a follow-up, Dave, I always very surprised to look at the growth rate you guys have delivered versus the discount that your stock sells at versus say, TriQuint or Avago, presumably, one of the factors is that those guys have access to broad FBAR filters, and you perhaps do not. I'm wondering, are you being, I don't know if handicap is the right word, but are you being held back in any way in going after certain sockets or do you think you might undergo their growth rates because you don't have access to broad FBAR filter capability?","David J. Aldrich","Vivek, that's the first time I've heard the question asked quite that way. I feel absolutely not. Filters has not been an impediment. If you look at closely at tear down reports of those platforms that use filters integrated with other devices, I think, we're the largest. We produce many, many filters, and we participate broadly, and I think our model is quite unique. We don't sell discrete filters, and I think, that's a big advantage for us. We like the margin structure of more highly customized solutions and integrated solutions. And what we're able to do in SkyOne and PADs and our GPS modules is we're able to couple the very best process with the frequency or with the application. For example, below 2 GHz, if you look at those tear down reports, if you look at our product portfolio below 2 GHz, we use surface acoustic devices and when its spacing is narrow, the frequency spectrum spacing is narrow, we use temp comp saw[ph] devices from a different supplier. Above 2 GHz, in some cases when there is narrow spacing, we'll use a bulk device. As we have strategic partners that are giving us a very good pricing with quite differentiated solutions in each one of those technology nodes. So, no, it's not in the least bit hampering our growth in the margin structures for those products are quite good.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","One last one, if I can squeeze it. If you look at the non-handset market, I would assume that it would be able to grow faster for you guys in the handset market because those are new under-penetrated markets. So if you could address that? And is it fair to assume that those are more profitable markets for you?","David J. Aldrich","It is, as I mentioned earlier, we expect a ratio of 60-40 to swing over time. More growth in these markets for the very reason you've highlighted. They're nascent adopters of connectivity but the growth rate, sequentially, we expect to be very strong. And because of our very broad system portfolio, we are able to address it. In those cases, many of these customers are not proficient at all in connectivity, and in wireless and we're able to land a complete solution that make it very easy for them to get to market. So we expect to grow very fast there.","Donald W. Palette","And almost all of those are accretive as far as the return standpoint.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton from Needham & Company.","N. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","But my first question, Dave, is are you guys broadcasting from the side of the Analyst Day?","David J. Aldrich","I'm sorry, say that again?","N. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Are you guys broadcasting tonight's call from [indiscernible]...","David J. Aldrich","No, unfortunately, we're not. We're here in the dark conference room in Woburn, Massachusetts. I wish we were though.","N. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Sorry. I just had to ask. On a serious note, just a quick question, you talked in some of the prepared comments about the mix shift of some of that opportunities in analog, and I'm just wondering, within HPA, can you give us a sense what percent of HPA is in sort of the non-mobile device segment? is that may be the half of HPA and does it -- it sounds like the non-mobile side of HPA, probably used a faster growing part of business over a long period of time. If that's the case, do you think ultimately you can drive to a better than 47% incremental margin as you see that mix shift kick in?","David J. Aldrich","Yes, I think it is definitely much more in the non-mobile than it is in the mobile. And I think what you're referring to, Quinn, must be that, we have Wi-Fi solutions that we sell broadly and everywhere. And some of those solutions do, in fact, go into smartphones and tablets. But I think broadly speaking, again, we expect the non-mobile piece of our business to grow more quickly over time than the mobile piece. They are accretive to margin. And it will over the long haul continue to see -- help us improve our returns. And in fact, as Don talked about in the prepared remarks, this quarter we guided to about 28 points. Although in the midterm we see 30 points at $550 million of revenue a quarter. We're $500 million now. And that's a function of diversification within custom analog solutions in mobile, outside of mobile and our entry into new markets.","N. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Then just a quick follow-up on the PA side. Qualcomm's out with RF360. It looks like Peregrine Semiconductor just announced the new SOI-based process that they could integrate PAs and switches. Are you guys looking at silicon germanium as a platform for integration? Or are you seeing pretty good demand for modules like SkyOne and don't necessarily see silicon germanium is the right integration platform?","David J. Aldrich","It's interesting. The answer is yes to both. We see SkyOne. In fact, we have our first 2 customers who are ramping production now. So you'll be able to buy 2 different high-end phone -- or high-volume phone models this year. We're excited about that. We have other customers coming online. So it's a great sort of highly integrated and also high-performance solution. It by the way contains SOI content, silicon content, as well as other process technology. Again, focusing on the right process for the function and integrating it in a very inexpensive way using our proprietary manufacturing techniques. We probably ship -- in our connectivity markets alone, we ship over 100 million SOI and silicon germanium devices a quarter. So I think we're probably the biggest procurer of SOI wafers. And we ship more than anybody, I think, in the market today. I believe that's right. So we're quite agnostic. We will ship SOI, silicon germanium. We will ship HBT. And we will ship pure bulk CMOS. Again, focusing on what's the best process for the function where we will have a fair and a high return, and we can provide the appropriate level of integration for the customer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh from Sterne Agee.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Good numbers here. I had a question on the gross margin line again. How much room do you have there? Obviously, it has come up very nicely and you're well above your peers. How much room do you have there as you look at fiscal '14? And what are the levers there to improve that?","Donald W. Palette","Yes, Vijay, this is Don. I mean, the best way to do that is the way we've been talking about modeling it. I would continue to use the 48% incremental margin on all the increased revenue contribution, and that's -- the underlying assumption is, when Dave talked about 30% at $550 million. So take the latest guidance and drop that incremental revenue through at 48%, and you'll see the margin expansion opportunity. But then the real opportunity longer term -- that's short term -- longer term is, as we continue to provide more and more of these complex systems solutions and move towards more and more analog, we would expect that contribution to increase over time. But for '14, that's not the way to model it.","David J. Aldrich","And Vijay, I'd add to Don's comment. You've asked the question in an interesting way. You said our gross margin is above our peers. I don't look at it that way. I think our gross margin today is below our peers. Our operating income is in line with the best among the diversified analog companies. But if you look at companies who are in power management, voltage system solutions around analog mixed signals, their gross margins are higher than ours. And that's where we aspire. I think when you talk about our peers, we don't compare ourselves to traditional PA-like companies, we compare ourselves to highly-diversified, well-run analog companies.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got it. Good to have high aspirations there. Going on to the Qualcomm RF360, are you seeing that in the market? I mean, is there -- how do you see -- do you see that taking away from the RF market next year with some of those integrated solutions there?","David J. Aldrich","You know the short answer to that today is no. And the reason for that is, the vast majority of our OEM customers continue to look for custom solutions with very high performance requirements. And they raise that bar with every new model. I suppose there could be and will be a narrow market with less stringent performance requirements that would utilize a pre-configured system in a package. But even in this segment, we tend to win with configurations like SkyOne, different approaches to MMMB technology, PADs and so on, that are more configurable with a very low cost structure. So in short, we see no impact to our business model and don't see it for the foreseeable future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie from Raymond James.","Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Great. Just following-up, you guys had a very nice performance here and guidance. And I was just wondering if -- given that if you could talk a little bit about your cycle times and how you go to market with your customers given your record of performance here. Do you think you're able to, say, hold less inventory and able to deliver it more quickly? So part of the question is, how quickly or how soon ahead of when your customer's product ramp are you able to ship? And do you think that's better than maybe what your peers are doing that leads you to give some better performance and better guidance?","David J. Aldrich","Our inventory turns right now are pushing 5, we think that's good. We can do better over the long haul. We have aspirations to just continue to reduce our cycle times to increase those turns. That's an aspiration we have across the balance sheet. Our cycle times range from a few weeks in processes in which we're vertically integrated to a couple of months where we have to go out and buy things like CMOS controllers and SOI devices. So I think we have -- and we're able to because we do our own assembly and test. And we think we're pretty fast on our feet. I do think we have a cycle time advantage vis\u2013\u00e0\u2013vis our competition, and we don't see any issue intersecting with our customer ramps or supporting those ramps based on cycle time.","Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just a follow-up on the gross margin and your point about seeing the analog guys more as your peers for gross margin. Is it fair to say that as technology evolves here that it's a more full featured SkyOne solution, et cetera, that would allow you to get to that gross margin that you're talking about? Or could you still do it even if you had like, say, a one-off PA for, say, an LTE phone is -- given cost improvements or whatever, could you potentially get to maybe a 50% gross margin or something just on a PA?","David J. Aldrich","Steve, I think I'd look at it this way. The standalone PA is becoming increasingly a smaller percentage of our business. It's not what is driving the long-term return and growth of the market. When we look at mobile, we look at mobility in terms of a smartphone. We really think that the customer base is becoming less interested in differentiating at the chipset level and looking for companies that are broad, that are smart, that can ramp quickly and support future cost structures that will enable high usage. And there aren't many companies who could do that. So we increasingly don't sell components. We don't want to promote the component business because it's too easy to create competition among the OEMs. So what we do is, we focus on customization. We have, for example, in location GPS modules that we're selling by the hundreds of millions right now, and those GPS modules are fully shield and filtered. It's patented. It's proprietary processes using our own manufacturing. And no one else can do it. And we get paid a premium for it. The Wi-Fi upgrade to AC using SOI and SIGI [ph] and other technologies and our own packaging gives us a differential performance advantage. When we do SkyOne, it's kind of the ultimate because we give them everything from the output of the transceiver to the antenna and everything in between, and it's completely custom. It's all ours. And we don't compete with anybody for components. So it's not a PA business. It's a system solution business that is mixed signal and analog. It is mobile to the sense that there are a lot of smartphones sold, but is increasingly markets that are growing into connectivity in this overall fabric called broad market connectivity, where we think we're broader. We think we have the scale. We know we have the customer relationships. And that's where our growth in margin and revenue is going to come from over the next many years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Maybe if you could just talk about, I mean, obviously, I probably should start with the nice guidance. And I would say, some of your peers have talked about corrections at some of the smartphone vendors. If you could just talk about broadly the space, and you, obviously, are offsetting that. But are you seeing any end-of-the-year corrections as many else have?","Liam K. Griffin","Yes, Blayne, this is Liam. We noted earlier on a prior question that there was a little bit of a correction in Korea. We had visibility to that. It's completely factored into our guidance. And with that account, I should add that we're doing quite well on new product upgrades in the next cycle of smartphones there. So it really isn't anything to be concerned with. We understand it. We recognize it. But it's been fully monetized into our numbers.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got you. And then you probably don't want to guide -- talk too much about Q1, I mean, some of your peers have talked about a more normal pattern in Q1, down double digits. If you can maybe talk about whether there's any factors that would be offsetting of any sort of normal trend, and what you consider a normal trend into Q1?","David J. Aldrich","Yes, I think -- in fact, Blayne, if you go back and look at the last few years, it's obviously a little too early to give specifics about March. It's normally a seasonally down quarter. It will be that way probably this year. But this trend that we're seeing with these new products from Skyworks that are solving some unique difficult problems our OEMs are facing. We're getting them get designed in now, and they're going into production this quarter, next quarter and quarters beyond. So we're seeing an uptake in SkyOne. We're seeing an uptake in a number of different power-based devices and lighting devices, both within mobile and outside of mobile. So I think like prior years, we expect to do better and -- to do substantially better than what would be a normally seasonally down quarter.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then if I can just get one more. I apologize -- there's a couple of calls tonight -- if you already answered this. But the prior answer to SkyOne was, you had parts but there hasn't been a lot of uptick. But has something changed and that you're seeing a more meaningful uptick there?","David J. Aldrich","Yes, we have 2 customers that have gone through type approval. They're ramping now. And there'll be phones available in late November, December. And we have more to follow.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Snyder from Charter Equity.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","Dave, a couple of questions. First, what do you think your blend is, GaAs versus everything else? And by that I mean, in all its implementations, both in your analog business and then also in cellular? And then, kind of a similar approach, other technologies like SOI, particularly in cellular. It's clear that a lot of the bigger handset guys are moving -- I don't want to say more and more away from GaAs because it's still the core technology -- but certainly, other technologies are playing a bigger role in leading with these other OEMs. I'm just kind of curious of how that mix is working for you guys right now.","David J. Aldrich","Yes, I think your basic question is correct. We're seeing, yes, this hybrid model, this fab-light model works really well for us now because we have been scaling up SOI, scaling up CMOS, scaling up other process nodes and technology. And we've been working on those for years. While at the same time, GaAs is an important enabler for certain high-performance applications for the output, transmit -- the output stage of the PA, for example, in most applications, but we're seeing a much bigger and faster growth in CMOS and silicon. To this point, I think we're much less than 1\/2 on a device-by-device level, much less than 1\/2 gallium arsenide than we are silicon as broadly defined.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","Great. And then last year, you were kind of punished because expectations got out of hand for this time with a big new product launch. It sure seems it's been going on much better. And it's no secret, I mean, you haven't had the problem that your peers had with a really lopsided -- this kind of allocation of revenue between the 2 quarters, September and December. Is that one, just that you have a higher module content than most of your competitors, so that you're spread over evenly, I think, which hurt maybe last year? Or how much leverage, not leverage, but how much control do you have in terms of how you stack up your shipments or just manage it tighter than them? I'm trying to figure out how you came off so much better than your peers in a quarter that was heavily skewed for just about everybody.","David J. Aldrich","We have no control over how we skew shipments. We ship to our customers demand. In effect, we run 99% on delivery the customer requests. So we have no visibility. We have [indiscernible] and much of our revenue comes through [indiscernible] and there is no flexibility there whatsoever. So I think it's more about the diversified nature of our business even though you see some OEMs in a quarter that don't do as well as others. We tend to be shipping to all of them. We do manage our turns very closely so that we have short cycle times, and we're able to ramp up and down quickly.","Liam K. Griffin","Yes, and one other comment I think that we've noted throughout the discussion today is that, again, it's not just the power amplifier and the traditional multimode, multiband devices. It's an uptake in what we call our mobile analog, where we're delivering all those technologies that Dave mentioned, Wi-Fi, very, very intense switch applications, now we add ASM, antennas healing, seeing a substantial increase in those devices that wrap around that core in power amplifier.","Donald W. Palette","And that's across all OEMs. I mean, that's the power of the increase, too.","David J. Aldrich","Exactly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Burton from Brean Capital.","Michael A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Don, first on OpEx, great job there. Sticking to your word and keeping that flat. Can you help us heading into next year, what are some of the factors that may move that number around, for example, the merit increases or just running the top line will demand a greater R&D investment?","Donald W. Palette","Yes, thanks for the question, Mike. We've been pretty consistent about when you're modeling that you might see -- expect maybe about $1 million a quarter, and that's kind of what you're seeing with the guidance in this last quarter, a little bit above that. Midyear, midyear for us is starting in the June quarter. We do have a merit increase and a significant amount of OpEx is labor. So that will affect that. And we're making targeted investments, both in R&D and our marketing and sales field apps. So for these investments are, in our minds, going to pay -- contribute a lot of shareholder value down to return because it's going to allow us to position our product portfolio to gain share. So we view these as very critical. So by the end of the year, and that's the calendar year, you could expect an OpEx level of maybe about $85 million. And we -- that's pretty consistent with what we've been saying.","Michael A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Great. And then, so still -- we're still unaware of any adoption of the complete RF360 solution yet, but Qualcomm is now shipping its envelope tracker. So some of your competitors are saying that they have an advantage getting some of these early sockets with some of their own systems expertise that they're bringing in. Can you point us to any design wins that are coming right now where your PAs are being used with Qualcomm's or a competitor's tracker?","David J. Aldrich","Sure, yes. I mean, there's really a broad list of opportunities that we've won, and we'll be going into production that utilize envelope tracking. In many cases, what we're seeing is the tracker is not -- the power amplifier comes in separately. The tracker is integrated with the baseband and the SoC. So that's not an issue. We're seeing that in some of the smartphones that are in production now this quarter. And if you go out into 2014, more and more wins for us. And I should also say that in the interim, you are also seeing APT, average power tracking, as an enabler for efficiency. We have very high share with that. And that's with Qualcomm and with others.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Diffely from D. A. Davidson.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Just another margin question for you here. Your 48% incremental gross margin is very clear. Sounds like that goes up over time as the non-handset business starts to ramp. I'm curious though, on the operating expense side, when you go to more diversified customers, is there going to be a long-term effect on the operating expense with sales and marketing that we need to think about?","Donald W. Palette","No, not any long-term step function change. I think that's kind of the way you're thinking about it. We still think it's very manageable. And the key to us is, all along we've talked about this, we are going to make some targeted investment, but there's a tremendous amount of leverage, and we don't see that going away in the model. So as we add revenue, it's not linear, so that's going to be a key component for us to drive to 30% and beyond as far as our income return.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. That sounds good. And then just quickly on the tax rate. You talked about just a modest cash tax rate for this year, '14. Longer term, is there kind of a peak cash tax rate we need to start thinking about?","Donald W. Palette","Well, it's really difficult to do that. Even for a year, it's tough to do it. But beyond that, we've just been saying, we've done some long-term estimates. But for beyond '14, we think in '15, that the good number to use is 12% to 14%. But again, that's a pretty high-level estimate. But we haven't really guided it beyond that. The GAAP and the cash rate will converge a little bit over time, but there will always be a significant benefit. And we're seeing that when you look at the rate posted this year, a little over 7% and business initiatives and restructuring that we've done clearly is adding shareholder value to the company.","Operator","Next, we'll go back to the line of Mike Walkley from Cannacord.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","With the strong cash that you've been generating, can you just share your thoughts on additional buybacks or a potential dividend given your predictable business now with the strong cash returns.","Donald W. Palette","Yes, thanks, Mike. It's something that we look at regularly. We're always analyzing the capital structure because we do have some alternatives to consider. And when you look at the business model and the growth opportunity from the top line and translating that into the 30-plus percent, we just think buying back stock continues to be a really strong way to deliver shareholder value. But you want to balance that with having cash available to maintain financial flexibility for strategic growth initiatives. So we try to balance those two out. We did repurchase 8 million of shares, 8 million shares in '13, which was $173 million. And at some point, dividend is certainly something we would consider as well.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","And Don, just while I have you, can you tell us what you said for the tax rate next year? I missed that.","Donald W. Palette","In '14?","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Cash tax rate.","Donald W. Palette","10%. 10%.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Edward Snyder from Charter Equity.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","Sorry for all the questions, guys. But overall, your Wi-Fi, is all your Wi-Fi components included in your HPA, none of it is in your cellular at this point, is that correct?","Donald W. Palette","Yes, Ed, in the 40-60 split, the 40% HPA and 60%. In that split, all of the Wi-Fi mobile connectivity business is in that 40%. That's correct.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","Okay. And increasingly, with carrier aggregation release 10 and LTE coming up here, I know there's a lot of designs in the work that focus more on the switching aspects of it, especially the front end of it, of the carrier aggregation. I know that it gets larger. How do you see yourself positioned there? I know of Microtech [ph] too, the antenna switch modules at Apple, which is obviously a key piece for the 2015 or '14 phone. But Skyworks is also very big in SOI and growing. Do you feel that you're in a competitive position for a lot of those designs next year and the year after that kind of focus on CA and the SOI product?","David J. Aldrich","You're right, Ed. And one of the -- really, the big driver of carrier aggregation in terms of overall content is very precise switching algorithm that need to take place. And so, and as I said, I think we are a leader, if not the leader in SOI. And we have a suite of antenna tuners. We've been shipping them for a long time, both before SOI was used in different ways to affect that tuning in an efficient way. And we're all over that with a good portfolio. We expect to see multiple designs in production in 2014. It's just another, albeit highly complex, analog switching algorithm.","Liam K. Griffin","Yes, and I think, Ed, as you know, it represents a substantial increase in complexity and content for providers like Skyworks. We see as many as 30 switch arms in some of the newer smartphones. And absolutely, we're going to be all over it. We've won a couple of major sockets in APAC with carrier aggregation, and we'll be winning more domestically and abroad going into 2014.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research","And then, so then Liam, that begs another question there. In carrier -- and there's a lot of talk about it, and I think a lot of investors don't really understand what CA involves right now. But in the big picture, the content increase in CA is mostly focused in what areas? Switching, filtering, PAs, where would you?","Liam K. Griffin","It's in switching. I mean, we're not even talking about the PA. Certainly, when you're in a carrier aggregation environment, you have larger protocols and connectivity, LTE, et cetera, but the switch arms go up substantially. And we've been in this business a long time. We have SOI capability. We have P Amp. We'd probably not use it as much in CA. We have filtering capability. And it's certainly a market that we expect to be a leader.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Aldrich for any closing comments.","David J. Aldrich","Okay. Well, thank you, everyone, for participating today, and we look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

This call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Steve Ferranti, Senior Director of Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Ferranti, please go ahead.","Steve Ferranti","Thank you, Rick. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' second fiscal quarter 2014 conference call. Joining me today are Dave Aldrich, Don Palette and Liam Griffin. Dave will begin today's call with the business overview, followed by Don's financial review and outlook. We will then open the lines for your questions.","Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those noted in our earnings release and those detailed from time to time in our SEC filings.","I'd also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we will discuss today are from a non-GAAP income statement consistent with the format we've used in the past. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for complete reconciliation to GAAP.","With that, I'll turn over the call to Dave for his comments on the quarter.","Dave Aldrich","Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. I'm happy to report that Skyworks delivered another very strong performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, outpacing normal seasonality and exceeding expectations across our key metrics.","The combination of robust year-over-year revenue growth, earnings leverage and strong cash flow we posted in the seasonally soft March quarter is a clear testament to the benefits of our diversification strategy. All-in-all, I\u2019m quite pleased with our accomplishments in the first half and expect our momentum to continue as our market footprint and customer engagement expand.","The world is rapidly becoming more interconnected from the cloud to the data center, to wide area networks, into the enterprise and vertical markets and within the home. Skyworks is a key enabler of this global megatrend, providing custom analog solutions that facilitate connectivity across a wide range of communications protocol.","These positive market dynamics create complementary growth opportunities for us with a new product categories like media gateways, like small cells and tablets, and in entirely new verticals like the enterprise, medical and automotive. And as analog design complexity rises, it creates the need for highly specialized systems, driving higher addressable content opportunities.","We\u2019re capitalizing on this today by leveraging our analog design expertise, expanding our product portfolio and integration capabilities, which when combined with our consistent execution, translates into superior financial results. Specifically during the quarter, we delivered revenue of $481 million that\u2019s ahead of our guidance of $470 million and up more than 13% year-over-year.","We produced operating income of $130 million, which is up over 30% from a year ago. And we posted $0.62 in earnings per share, that\u2019s up 29% versus a year ago and our fourth consecutive quarter above 20% earnings growth. We generated $214 million in cash flow from operations which is another record for the company. And we also repurchased 2 million shares of our common stock and we announced the quarterly dividend of 11% per share.","So in summary, Q2 was an excellent quarter for us across the board. Looking, ahead we see strong demand signal spending our end markets in 4G solutions for emerging market and new 802.11ac deployments in network infrastructure but connected home and other key vertical market opportunities.","In short, fiscal 2014 is shaping up to be a very good year for Skyworks. With the opportunity pipeline we have in place, the stage is set for continued revenue growth, margin expansion and earnings leverage.","So for more in-depth review of our financials, I\u2019ll turn it over to Don for his commentary and his outlook.","Don Palette","Thanks Dave and thanks again for joining us everyone. Revenue for the second quarter was $481 million, ahead of our prior guidance and up more than 30% versus the year-ago quarter.","Gross profit was $215.2 million or 44.7% of revenue, better than our prior guidance and up 250 basis points from a year ago quarter. Gross margin upside was driven by strong adoption of our integrated system solutions, margin accretive new product introductions and strength in key vertical markets.","Operating expenses were $84.8 million consisting of R&D expense of $53.1 million to support organic growth initiatives and SG&A expense of $31.7 million. We generated $130.4 million of operating income yielding 27.1% operating margins, that\u2019s a 370 basis point increase versus the year-ago quarter and it highlights the continued strength of our business model in our execution.","Operator profits were up 31% year-on-year. And let\u2019s put this in perspective. We have delivered an incremental of $107 million in revenue year-to-date versus the first half of fiscal 2013.","We successfully converted this into $58 million in operating profits and that represents a 54% contribution margin as we leverage capital investments and reap the benefits of our margin enhancing integrated custom solutions and precision analog products. Cash tax rate for the second quarter was 9%, producing net income of $118.6 million or $0.62 of diluted earnings per share and that\u2019s $0.03 better than our guidance.","Turning to our second quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement, we generated $214 million in cash flow from operations and invested $41.8 million in capital expenditures in support of upcoming program ramps. Depreciation was $21.7 million.","We also repurchased 2 million shares of our common stock during the quarter, representing a $61.5 million investment. With the confidence we have in our business outlook, we continue to believe that repurchasing shares, common stock represent a highly accretive use of our cash. And finally, we exited the quarter with $798 million in cash and no debt.","Now, let\u2019s turn to our third quarter business outlook. Based on the order backlog we have in place today, we expect third quarter revenue to be $535 million and that\u2019s up 23% year-over-year driven by strength in the emerging markets, content gains in key programs, 802.11ac deployments in an expanding set of opportunities within the internet of things.","At this revenue level, we suggest modeling gross margin in the 45% range with operating expenses of approximately $86 million. Below the line, we anticipate $100,000 in expenses from interest income and other expenses and the cash tax rate around 10%.","We project our tax rate to remain at these levels for the remainder of the 2014 fiscal year. We expect the share count to be around 193 million shares resulting in third quarter EPS of $0.73 and that\u2019s up 35% year-over-year.","It\u2019s worth noting that our third quarter guidance represents our fifth consecutive quarter of about 20% year-over-year earnings growth, reflecting the strength of our demand for our products, our differentiation in the market place and the consistency of our execution.","As Dave mentioned earlier, we initiated a quarterly dividend with initial payment set at $0.11 per share, implying roughly at 1.2% dividend yield. With the combination of the newly initiated dividend in our ongoing share repurchase activity, we are returning roughly 40% of free cash flow to shareholders, a pace which we believe strike the appropriate balance between internal investment for growth initiatives and shareholders returns.","Finally, I\u2019d like to briefly recap our previously announced revenue split, in order to provide investors with better visibility for the growth and profit drivers of our business. Last quarter, we highlighted three new subgroups, power amplifiers, integrated mobile systems and broad markets. For the first half of fiscal 2014, power amplifiers was 40% of revenue, integrated mobile systems was 33% and broad markets was 27%.","We expect these percentages to stay relatively consistent throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. In fiscal 2015 and beyond, we see integrated mobile systems and broad markets revenue continuing to grow as an overall percentage of our mix, which should support improved returns based on the high differentiation and better margins associated with these products.","And with that, I will turn the call back over to Dave for his comments on the market.","Dave Aldrich","Thanks, Don. While it\u2019s clear that our business fundamentals remain quite healthy, but the outlook for Skyworks is strong. To review the high-level drivers for our business in 2014 and 2015, we see three key trends powering our growth.","First, increasing worldwide demand for high-performance, high data rate broadband services like 802.11ac and 4G LTE. Uptake of this technologies are still in their infancy, accounting for just the fraction of connected devices today. These technologies underpin lucrative new revenue streams for carriers and ecosystem providers alike and are being very aggressively deployed.","And today, we are seeing tremendous demand within the emerging markets across large global brands as well as regional players. As one measure of this, Credit Suisse estimates that the number of LTE connected smartphones in Asia will grow by over 70% over the next two years.","Second, connectivity is proliferating in new vertical markets in new device categories. A recent report on Morgan Stanley suggests that by 2020, the total number of connected devices could reach a staggering 75 billion, dramatically expanding our addressable opportunities.","And we spend the last few years positioning the company for this trend, investing significant resources in new growth verticals outside of mobile, within markets like automotive, medical and industrial. While these new products are still in the early stages of adoption, we have already developed strong traction in these exciting new growth avenues.","And third, dollar content opportunities for connected devices is expanding. In some cases, this is driven by products incorporating multiple network standards in concert like 4G LTE, 802.11ac and GPS. In other cases, it maybe driven by our expanded product offering where we are more fully integrating our power management and antenna tuning and received diversity product portfolios.","But in all cases, we are driving our addressable content higher in each successive generation of technology. And just to give one example, the leading 802.11ac chipset provider recently announced the industry\u2019s first six stream MIMO router solution, which provides data speeds of up to 3.2 gigabits per second and that\u2019s 50% faster than current generation ac products, providing users with the availability to stream simultaneous HD or high definition content wirelessly on several devices at once. This is an analog content rich application where performance is paramount.","Skyworks is enabling this lead architecture with an entire suite of analog products and we expect to benefit from the roll out of these during the second half of this calendar year. In all cases, the fundamental need is the same, ensuring seamless connectivity across multiple communications standards, while maximizing overall system performance within the smallest possible footprint.","This underlying market need creates tremendous design challenges for our customers, as they contend with issues like battery life, signal interference and data throughput. To solve these challenges, customers are demanding more than just the best standalone component and our increasing aligning with Skyworks based on our end-to-end product portfolios, our broad technology footprint, our robust system design capabilities and our integration roadmap.","We see a very limited number of other competitors with this whole [Technical Difficulty] growth of capabilities. And to highlight some examples of our recent success, during Q2, we captured other new design wins across a number of diverse applications. These include analog control ICs at Medtronic or implantable hard monitors, a suite of five front-end devices for the Moto G smartphone, home automation solutions with security sensors motion detectors, lighting and meters.","Switching Wi-Fi and GPS within a set-top box application from EchoStar and tuning IC's see for Audi's HomeLink programmable system, complementing the navigational assist design we announced with Volkswagen last quarter. And finally, we have secured our fourth production customer for SkyOne, which includes a full suite of Skyworks products including our generation 2.0s SkyOne module, our Sky Hi LTE power amplifiers, power management, antenna switching and diversity switch modules.","Our strategy of continuing to diversify and expand its new verticals, while maintaining a laser focus on operational execution is clearly working. We are quite optimistic about our prospects for 2014 and beyond and it is clear that we are riding a wave of powerful underlying market focus. We expect these positive trends to fuel growth in our addressable markets for years to come and as our product highlights demonstrated, we are capitalizing today.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let\u2019s open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Rick Schafer. Please go ahead.","Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co.","Yeah. Thanks guys, and congrats on a great quarter. I guess I was hoping -- my first question is if, Dave, you can provide maybe a little more color on what's driving or what's behind the better than seasonal -- much better than seasonal June quarter, is there any particular customers or end markets or anything you can highlight there?","Dave Aldrich","Thanks, Rick. Well, it\u2019s really very broad based. It\u2019s across our mobile customer set and our broad market customer set. It\u2019s within the three categories that we described in the prepared comments. And specifically what we are seeing is very high content in early stage of an LTE ramp in emerging markets. This is China but it\u2019s also outside of China in Central, Latin America.","We are seeing signs of some strengthening demand in network infrastructure. But more importantly, 802.11ac rollouts in mobile and across vertical segments are very strong for us right now. We are seeing in the connected home and as we said, we are begging to ramp even further and deeper with our SkyOne customer set. And as we mentioned earlier with the guidance in Q3, the year-to-date total is over 15% year-over-year growth. So it\u2019s really very broad-based and there is no single customer and there is no single platform that\u2019s having -- that\u2019s driving in.","Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co.","Got it. And then just as my follow-up, could you give some color to describe sort of the recent GS 5 launch and your content there? I mean I guess, were there any surprises there for you guys versus your expectation and maybe as part of that answer, how does that Samsung content opportunity here in the first half compare to the other big platform launch later this year for you guys?","Liam Griffin","Sure, Rick. This is Liam. With respect to the Galaxy S5, as we know, there are a number of different regional SKUs. We actually did quite well in the platform in aggregate, number of designs wins with MMMB solutions, power management solutions. We're diversified across two major baseband platforms. And overall, our revenue growth there within Samsung is going to be up in 2014. And as we look beyond 2014, we are starting to now engage early with the Galaxy S6 and we are seeing another opportunity where performance is up, content opportunities are up and we expect to pick up share there as well.","Operator","Next question comes from Alex Gauna. Please go ahead.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities","Hey, thanks. Let me echo the congratulations on the powerful result. I was wondering with regard to the June quarter guidance, I know you said it was broad-based, but I'm wondering based on the magnitude of these emerging market ramps, what does that say about the dry powder that is left for seasonality in the September quarter? Could we still see a typical double-digit or double-digitish type of growth then or are we robbed from some of that?","Dave Aldrich","No, it would be lot easier to answer that question if it was really been driven by one phenomenon and it\u2019s not. I mean, we are seeing, as I said, there is trend around, instead of things product moving into the home, there is a lot of fairly early stage ramps that we are seeing irrespective of seasonality in the March quarter that we are seeing extended to June. We are seeing LTE ramp in China, but we are also seeing other rollouts in connectivity ac and so on. So it\u2019s really not anyone customer or anyone on region. If I look at what I can see in September today, I think expect September to be normal season. I think September will be up and I think it will be a strong quarter for the industry and a strong quarter for us.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities","All right. Thank you. And then you've done a great job getting to your gross margin targets. I'm wondering with the merger of TriQuint and RFMD and what you're seeing in the market in new opportunities, what's your potential to move beyond that and actually I'd like to know what you think or what your customers are telling you about what they think of the TriQuint-RFMD merger? Thank you.","Dave Aldrich","Thanks, Alex. Good question. You know I will you what I think about, I think consolidation is very healthy for our industry, particularly when it involves companies, competitors who have excess capacity. I think the fact that there will be a need to collapse some of that capacity, consolidate design centers and so on, which my understanding of the merger, I think that\u2019s very good for the industry and it\u2019s particularly good for Skyworks. I think a broader, like if I move up a little bit and think about this more broadly, we are seeing fewer and fewer competitors with the capability require to deal with this analog complexity.","When we talk about SkyOne or we talk about the content gains we are gaining in platforms both in connectivity or within mobile, it\u2019s a lot of GPS, it\u2019s a lot of power management, it\u2019s sliding and display, location-based services, it\u2019s from pretty sophisticated tuning using SOI technology, it\u2019s very broad. And our customers are -- one of the reasons why we are growing much faster than market is our customers are asking us to solve the overall analog front end. It maybe a bundle, it maybe integrated in the case of SkyOne and there just aren\u2019t many competitors that can do that. So I expect more consolidation because I think it\u2019s getting harder and harder to sell even the best among point products and components. And that\u2019s very good for us.","Operator","Next question comes from Vivek Arya with BofA ML. Please go ahead.","Vivek Arya - BofA ML","Thank you for taking my question. Dave, I am curious about the WiFi growth that you are seeing in 802.11ac because we are hearing that the Broadcom is now starting to integrate more power amplifiers in their WiFi combo chips. And I am wondering does that cannibalize the Europe business in any way, how should we think about competition in that market?","Liam Griffin","This is Liam. What we see in WiFi is a certain set of customers that will adopt an integrated PA solution. So by that, I mean, they take the transmit PA and integrate that to SoC. For that part of the market, we have a very compelling receive side strategy. We take SOI switch and LNAs on the receive side and we deploy solutions there and that\u2019s going well. But the larger part of the market today is still adopting 802.11ac with both 5 gig and [2.4] (ph). Our position there is outstanding. We are seeing some of the leading smartphones companies now go to 2 x 2 MIMO in mobile again with 5 gig and 2.4. So that\u2019s playing out well. And in parallel as Dave alluded to earlier, there is a very strong networking in access point and router market that is growing quickly. And here we see three streams, six streams up and nine streams of MIMO, you have 5 gig, 2.4 and switches as well. So in total, the WiFi opportunity for Skyworks is outstanding. We continue to take share. We have great technology. We partnered with Broadcom. We partnered with Qualcomm and others and the outlook there is quite bright.","Vivek Arya - BofA ML","Thanks, Liam. Very helpful. And then maybe Dave if you take a step back and look at the overall industry right recently RFMD and Triquint announced that they plan to merge. I am wondering what your view is of that industry consolidation. And as part of that, I think you have also spoken about looking for opportunities on the M&A front. So how do you think about the RF industry structure and then how do you think about your own long-term strategy and what Skyworks will look like say three, four, five years from now?","Dave Aldrich","Thanks, Vivek. (indiscernible) RF industry. It\u2019s the analog connectivity of mobile industry because it\u2019s hard to sell an RF-only product today and there in lies some of the problem and some of the need for consolidation. So when we are engaging today, we are engaging typically with multiple dollars in a broad target within our customers say because they are asking us to look at the voltage being provided to the transmit path, they are asking us to filter and switch and tune in a way that preserves battery life even beyond the power added efficiencies of the amplifier. And when we move in to receive or GPS, there are lot of coexistence problems, a lot of interference problems, so we do things in manufacturing for the proprietary shielding or we are able to do things with filtering, whether it\u2019s a PAD or designing around duplex or filter architecture. And so that is just going to continue.","So I think that there are going to -- there is a going to be a shake out most likely in the analog space where there are companies who have scale, customer relationships and the breadth of technology that can ramp a system integration mindset and capability. And I think companies who can do that, there aren\u2019t many are going to win, they are going to win a lot because this market is going to grow. And I think that will continue.","So as we look at our M&A strategy, we have, if you look what we have done in the past starting Conexant, if you look at what we did with AATI or even SGI, we have been to convert a broader technology footprint where we have the customers, we have the scale, we have the manufacturing into high returns into a much broader target. We\u2019d like to continue to do that. So as we see M&A opportunities to expand into new vertical markets or expand the content, add more value, more relevance to our customers we will continue to do that. And we don\u2019t rule out highly accretive businesses that required would give us materially bigger footprint outside of mobile. We like those as well, but they need to be rationalized in terms of our ability to add sales leverage in some degree of operational synergy.","Operator","(Operator Instruction) Our next question comes from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Steve Smigie - Raymond James","Great. Thanks a lot. And I will add my congratulations on the great quarter and guide. Just as we look to the June guidance, can you talk if you picked up maybe a major socket at your leading customer, that\u2019s maybe you already start shipping that say in the June quarter that helped that or is that nothing to be part of that?","Dave Aldrich","No, there is no customer ramp, there is no specific socket that\u2019s driving, that\u2019s driving June. As I said, it\u2019s broad-based. It\u2019s a number of customers. It\u2019s emerging markets, and it\u2019s a non global vertical market.","Steve Smigie - Raymond James","Okay. And the 802.11ac, I mean, again it sounds like that\u2019s broad-based as well in terms of being across enterprise networking but also connect your device but also on a handset. And on the handset side, I mean would you -- if you shipped in say modules for large customer end, would that already be occurring this quarter, I mean would you ship in the model say -- a module say quarter and half ahead of a major launch?","Dave Aldrich","The answer to that, the simple answer is no.","Operator","Next question comes from Anthony Stoss with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.","Anthony Stoss - Craig-Hallum","Hey, guys, my congrats as well. Don, I don\u2019t know if you have this handy but the percentage of your mobile revenue that\u2019s in China, also a little more information on SkyOne date in terms of you got forecast raise now. What kind of feedback you expect to continue to add, new customers, is that largely finding its way into the China market, and last but not least, I would love to hear your further thoughts on content on the [IOT] (ph) side if you are able to get across car management other chipsets into those devices in addition to connectivity? Thanks.","Don Palette","I will just go first one on, I\u2019ll take Tony on China. If you were to look at China combined as a customer, it would be 10%, very diverse customer base.","Dave Aldrich","And I think with respect to SkyOne and let we have jumped it on this one. But to be clear SkyOne is a broad platform approach and it embodies that we\u2019re moving away from point solutions to its more integrated solutions. Typically, SkyOne platform for us is highly reconfigurable, but it hasn\u2019t common, it has a lot of switching control content moving up to the antenna filtering, duplexing, power amplification. And when we will get the more product categories, it could be integrated at [MCM] (ph) and at the IC level. It is quite margin accretive and it is very unique and it is without competition. So it\u2019s by definition competitive, unique and sticky.","Don Palette","Yes, and a follow-on to that, I think what is really kind of winning the hearts and minds of our customers is our ability to configure and customize on-site customer by customer. So what we are pleased by the systems level approach that we have been taking, it\u2019s been well received by customers. We have got a number of introductions today. We are adding new accounts. And as you mentioned China, I mean that market is perfect for us. We can come in there with a solution that is fully tuned and matched specifically for each customer again there and due to work we get those accounts to market.","Dave Aldrich","And think about it, there are really three approaches that we use to go to market. One is the SkyOne, highly integrated filtering switching amplification. Another is a power amplifier duplexing kind of a market where we would then wrap switching functionality around that maybe GPS, maybe some power management, and a almost always WiFi. And the third would be which would be kind of an MM\/MB multimode power. And again, we would wrap a lot of analog content around it and we have different customers that favor one architecture over another. So some use all three, increasingly through the trend is toward more integration and less discrete.","Operator","The next question comes from Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","Mike Walkley - Canaccord Genuity","All right, thank you. Just jumping back into the China market, can you talk maybe about the sequential growth you\u2019re seeing from China and your strong June quarter guidance. And were there any near-term supply constraints in the March quarter that might have been -- affected your ability ship into the TD-LTE ramps in China in the March quarter?","Don Palette","Yeah. With respect to -- I will take the June quarter first. I mean, China will be up in June. It\u2019s pretty much in line with our total business. There could be some upside with LTE. We are seeing some roll off there across a number of indigenous China customers. We are also seeing as Dave mentioned emerging markets in general. We have some customers today that are gaining share in Latin America, we\u2019re populating those devices. We see some of our customers gain share in India. We\u2019re populating those devices as well.","Dave Aldrich","And we also see in terms of content, there is a drive because if you look at the indigenous China players, which we are shipping. Coolpad, for example, obviously Vaio, Lenovo and others. I mean, they\u2019re not -- they don\u2019t view their competition to be among other indigenous Chinese. They view the competition to be the big worldwide players of smartphones.","And so the pressure is to improve the performance of Wi-Fi so the very same dynamic will be to more high performance Wi-Fi, adding more, switching, filtering more, perhaps amplification moving towards ac in some cases.","There is an ASM play for us in addition to Wi-Fi power amplifying switching. So I think that really we don\u2019t make the distinction of what a China customer maybe looking to ship internally or export versus other big brand. The dynamics are the same and they are competing with one another for the hearts and minds of the very same consumer.","Mike Walkley - Canaccord Genuity","Okay. Thank you and just on a follow-up question for Don. Now that your June quarter guidance is very close to your $0.75 longer term target with seasonal trends in September, you could be above those levels. Any longer term milestones maybe we should think about from modeling given the new size of the business. And then just on the previous question, were there any supply constraints in TDLP that might have impact you on the short term? Thanks.","Don Palette","Yeah. Mike, on the performance and going out to September as it relates to a model. We\u2019re obviously very close to achieving the mid-term model we\u2019ve being talking about for over the past year. We just guided $535 million revenue and $0.73 so that\u2019s obviously knocking on the door for $0.75. Its too early for us to really give any formal view what\u2019s beyond the mid-term model.","But one thing I can tell you as you\u2019re stepping back in modeling the business, we would expect a lot of the dynamics, business dynamics to play out beyond that $0.75 per quarter, the same as you saw building after that, so gross margin expansion of 48% to 50% and there\u2019s clearly going to be operating leverages as we move forward. So that\u2019s the best way to think about our business that you add revenue going forward.","Operator","Next question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Please go ahead.","Craig Ellis - B. Riley","Thanks for taking the question and guys congratulations on what appears to be two milestones, both the dividend initiation and what I think is record gross margins in the outlook. My question first is on the vertical markets business and it\u2019s a short term and intermediate term question. As we look at the progress that you\u2019re making and there were seven different applications identified in the press release that you penetrated with those initiatives. Where are we in the build out of the vertical markets program? Are we in the second inning, the fifth inning, the eight inning, can you put recent progress in perspective points?","Don Palette","What I love about the vertical markets obviously and we have been talking about it and investing for, we started moving from infrastructure into smart energy and then into the connected home and so on and so forth. We got a couple of acquisitions which gave much bigger target rich environment, probably six or seven years now in fact. So what I like about it is while there isn\u2019t any one individual stock that they could drive huge amounts of revenue like you might see in the smartphone or tablet.","But we have been very successful in creating system design team that we\u2019re very closely with our customers in the field, phone applications approach and being able to identify where we can serve that set of customers. Well, the customer differentiated products that will last throughout multiple product cycles, long product life cycles very margin accretive. And I must say that we\u2019re very much on track to our strategic plan in long range to continue to do that.","And we continue to grow sequentially in helping our margins that reducing our volatility which make us a much stronger, broader company. I would say, we are in a very early stages because as the price points of this technology have gotten more affordable. And as consumers have become more use to the technology and as our device manufactures are creating more intuitive easy to use devices, its starting to continue penetrate more and more markets and today its just a astounding the array of products we're working with our customers on. All trying to figure out how to remain connected, do it at the right budget and at the right level of user ease.","Craig Ellis - B. Riley","So the follow-up would be related to that, what percent of revenue is vertical markets currently in and where would it potentially go over a two to three-year period?","Dave Aldrich","","Today it\u2019s about 27% as Don mentioned in the prepared comments. And I think that the combination of vertical markets as well as those analog products going into some of our mobile customers platform like GPS, like Wi-Fi, I think that grows much faster than our PA revenue, PA business which is good to the overall returns of the business.","Operator","Next question comes from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity. Please go ahead.","Edward Snyder - Charter Equity","Thank you. Couple here, first off on SkyOne. We understand the platforms of both Samsung and Apple are moving toward, its seems like the end game on that is going to something like SkyOne. They\u2019re not there yet but certainly seems to be direction everybody is moving into.","First, is SkyOne material today to revenue, we talking 1%, 5%, 10% or is this more of a test year for where people are trying it out. And then we could expect much more material growth in say 2014 as maybe the top OEMs move more to that what kind of occupation given the complexity of the LTE. Thanks guys.","Don Palette","Yeah. It is material, it is not yet 5% but it\u2019s getting close. But remember it\u2019s in early stage of ramp and the ASP is very high. So the customers are launching, they are actually quite big. So I think its going to be very significant and it will be significant, more significant in the second half than it was in the first half. In 2015 we expect to be a big SkyOne here but keep in mind that it is a platform. So SkyOne will take on many different shapes and forms as our customers get comfortable with the technology and comfortable with allowing us supply our partner to architect the entire front end.","That\u2019s being a little bit of a learning curve. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve needed to work very closely with our customers to get them comfortable with because they give up a lot of control in favor of the user views. And we\u2019re having a lot of success with that was not fast.","Edward Snyder - Charter Equity","Don, as a follow-up, I was little confused by the answer to the last question. You said verticals are probably around just under 30%. Your largest customer was well over 30% last year. Is that break obviously out between horizontal and verticals markets you looking at definitional thing there. And the larger question you\u2019ve done exceedingly well on Wi-Fi, it seems to be continue to be a growth engine here. Is Wi-Fi spread between all three of your [Technical Difficulty] integrated mobile systems in broad markets or is it more concentrated heavily more on those? Thanks.","Don Palette","Pulled it back to broad market number as Dave said and we said the program mark is 27%. And our top customer last year was in mid 30s or little above that and -- but that the revenue for the customers across multiple revenue areas, they can be a mobile, they can be in broad markets as well, so it\u2019s mixed.","Dave Aldrich","","I think, what you\u2019re getting that there is no Wi-Fi that winds up in a smartphone or tablet that we are including in that 27%, that is all non-mobile broad market.","Operator","Suji De Silva with Topeka. Please go ahead.","Suji De Silva - Topeka","Hi guys, nice job on the quarter. Thanks for breaking out the pre-segment here. Can you talk about the relative margins of each either qualitatively or I think we can and what do you expect the core PA business to grow longer term versus the other business?","Don Palette","As we talked about, the initial presentation, the relative margins for the PAs are in low 40 is slightly below what the corporate average is. Integrated mobile is slightly above that that and our best margins in the broad market. But understand within each of that their products that there is some variability on that, those are averages within those categories.","Suji De Silva - Topeka","Thanks. And on the PA segment, I think the growth there can be versus the other ones which is clearly going faster?","Don Palette","I think the PA business is going to grow in revenue dollars shrink as a percentage. I would put a 5 percentage growth rate in PA dollars, which will be materially less than the growth rate of the company therefore and it has been trending for the last few years, it will get smaller but will remain meaningful.","Operator","Next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.","Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee","Hi guys. Congratulations again.","Dave Aldrich","Thanks Vijay.","Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee","As for the quarter and you might have answered this question already, but if you look at the second half and you look at the tier one marquee phones, how do you see about your share in those going to second half?","Dave Aldrich","I think -- I believe that two things are going to happen. One is industry dynamic in the second half in 2015 and 2016, as the content will go up. The number of bands that are being added, the amount of functionality around higher performance connectivity and what we see our customers trying to do with the intend or improved current consumptions using things like carrier aggregation and sophisticated tooling techniques. It is no doubt in our mind that content over the next several years is going to go up.","And I am -- as we engage our customers today, I am really pleased with the fact that our technology offering is unique. We are engaging at the system level early in the customer\u2019s decisions as to which SOC they are going to use which and so on. And they will really able to have a system level conversation not a component conversation. So, I am absolutely convinced that the TAM overall in the industry is going to go up and that we are going to continue to gain share.","Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee","Right. And just housekeeping question here, did you add any 10% customers in the quarter here and keep it up, guys? Thanks.","Don Palette","Yeah. Thanks Vijay. We had two, 10% Foxconn and Samsung.","Operator","Next question comes from Mike Burton with Brean Capital. Please go ahead.","","Mike Burton - Brean Capital","Hey, guys. Congratulations on the great quarter and guide. Don, if I could just on the margin side that you mentioned the 48% to 50% contribution margin going forward. But I'm wondering on OpEx expectations into next year, can we stay in the kind of the mid to high 80 tier or would we expect that pick up as IoT and that the broader markets become a bigger portion of the mix?","Don Palette","Yeah, I mean the increases that you've seen and guided as, the majority of the increase is on the R&D line and it's some target investments that we're making to support new growth opportunities and quite frankly we are saying the benefits of these initiatives in topline out performance. We're going to -- we are expecting to continue to see strong leverage, so we expect the revenue growth will be well ahead of the OpEx growth and that leverage is a key component of continuing to drive improved returns.","Remember in the June guide, we have a merit increase, solid merit increase mid-year so that's in the number as well. On going forward, that number is going to continue to ramp some as revenue grows and investment grow. So as far as what you model next year, I think by the time you get to mid-year when you have another merit increase to that number is going to be high-80s and the 90s kind of number for sure. But there is some incremental investment every quarter in way that we model it.","Mike Burton - Brean Capital","Thank you. That is helpful. And then, Dave, a few comment on bulk for a second. Do you have any concerns with the RFMD or TriQuint merger as a potential supplier or borrower, or are you still comfortable with the bar available to you from the non-domestic suppliers and have you actually started to shift some of the bar into any SkyOne platform or any other modules so far this year?","Dave Aldrich","The answer to latter question is yes. And I am actually extremely comfortable with it and the reason is that today, we're participating in filters more broadly than any competitors in power profile duplexes in SkyOne and in most of our GPS modules in fact. And the more we engage with the filter ecosystem, more convinced I am that there is no one side that's all. We are seeing the vast majority of bands using some form of saw and with more narrow band spacing at an higher frequency, we're having a lot of success using a temperature compensated saw and we are shipping both and there are limited number of bands with very high frequency and type spacing, type frequency spacing the benefit from bulk device if there are or some other bulk acoustic device.","And our strategy is to be flexible. It is to work with our filter partners on a foundry level and to really get involved in the packaging and the design to make sure we are hitting performance and we match it to our PA or we match it into SkyOne. It gives the absolute best possible performance. And if you look at recent teardowns, I think we are the largest integrator of filters in the world today in fact.","Operator","Next question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company","Hey guys. Let me add my congratulations on the results and guidance. Dave, just wondering on the sequential June, you've named a number of factors that are behind that roughly $55 million sequential increase. Can you give us some sense is it fairly broad-based or is the LTE opportunity in China at emerging market just given the content in LTE phone, would that be the single biggest factor accounted for that $55 million increase and then I have a quick follow-up?","Dave Palette","Yeah. I think the biggest single factor would be -- although, I\u2019ve got to say, it is really very broad, but the biggest single factor would be in content games within mobile devices when we talked about our integrated mobile systems. So our ability to release successive design suite and much more dollar content than the traditional PA and switch is a big driver of this. And we're applying much of that in China, but a lot into Central America. We have customers doing very well in India and some of the brands that are not Chinese brands are doing extremely well, penetrating emerging markets with our technology. So that is a big -- that is going to be indeed a big piece of it.","The 802, the Wi-Fi component of our business in the connected home and within ac rollout of the enterprise, within the home and then as well as into our mobile customers upgraded ac or upgrading to more bands MIMO, that's a big driver. We're seeing that as well. We're seeing it not only in the home we're seeing in verticals, we're seeing in the mobile. And SkyOne is a nice top force as well with very margin rich high dollar content.","Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company","Great. And then just on a follow-up on TriQuint, RFMD in there sort of synergy discussions, so they don't anticipate any revenue this synergies. I was wondering if you might comment on opportunities you see as those come together where you might have opportunities to either pick up sockets or perhaps as they shut down in fact, we may have to translate products? Are there opportunities for you to coming as an alternative source of supply? Thanks.","Don Palette","Having done mergers and a couple of sizable ones, I mean they are, they take a lot of time, they take a lot of resources and a lot of focus. But I will say this that when we look at our business and our guidance in our 2014, 2015 plan, it has nothing to do with the notion of competitor having struggled or becoming defocused. It's all about ducktailing into trends of the market where our customers just need more help and more technology breadth to solve these phony analog problems and that's what we do, that's what we wake up everyday trying to do and do it better than our competitors. But more importantly do it in a way that we add value to our customers and they're willing to pay us for it.","Operator","Next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays","Thanks and I will echo strong quarter guys. Going back to just the emerging markets. Maybe just looking at your view of the entire market, I know the China mobile, it's still not a 100 million units given the builts that you have shift to and are looking at for June, what's your sense of just how big that market is so far in the first half?","Dave Aldrich","Yeah. Blayne, without getting into all of the details so our care specific details, we certainly see a ramp in China, I know the ramp as Dave alluded, we also see emerging markets in general being a content and a unit driver for us and includes Latin America and India. The good news for Skyworks is that we've been very well positioned with all the leading players that enabled. There is companies like MediaTek, like Broadcom, like Qualcomm like Marvel.","So we have our best hedge very, very nicely with all those players. The content is MMMB solutions, its switching, its power management. GPS is a real nice analog switch that ramps around our mobile. But it's also tether with the leading basement provider, so wherever they win, we're going to be attached. We're seeing in China. We're seeing in emerging markets and we think it is all unique in this ramp.","Don Palette","Unlike 2G, or even 3G upgrade cycles in early smartphones, they have made in 2G base. They were EDGE based. The difference we're seeing today in the system performance requirements that this class of customer is requiring and it is very much competition on the world stage. So we are not seeing the small component companies with the threat of lowering price with albeit inferior products being able to penetrate this customer set. It\u2019s not working in this architecture, the technology doesn't play and that's very, very good for us and companies like us who can feel a real robust system.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays","Thanks. And then just on the new breakout. Thanks for providing that. On your slide deck, you talked about integrated mobile having multi-band pads. Does that inclusive of single band pads as well just a clarification and then you can talk about in broad market, maybe rank some of the bigger end markets I am assuming Wi-Fi is probably the biggest but any clarity there would be helpful.","Don Palette","Yeah, playing on the pads, the pad devices would be included in IMS integrated but we only have a single pad. I mean, they attend to be multi-band, couple of filters, multi-mode, multi-band PA. So there is really no instances where we have a single pad with one filter. But those solutions do get included in IMS.","Operator","Next question comes from JoAnne Feeney with ABR. Please go ahead.","JoAnne Feeney - ABR","Hi, guys. Congrats on a great quarter and a nice outlook. I had a question about a quick follow-up on another question about the timing issued for the year. In the past there have been instances where you have shift components that have been assembled into modules by partners. It sounds like this year that is not something, that's a big components of your business. Can you just clarify that more broadly? I believe the earlier question was more specifically to Wi-Fi?","Dave Aldrich","I think that the -- the question is, are we in June benefiting from big program ramps by shipping in the module manufacturer, be it Wi-Fi or something else. And the answer to that is no.","JoAnne Feeney - ABR","And so we wouldn't expect an earlier declining of business because of that timing emptiness?","Dave Aldrich","Absolutely not, in fact -- absolutely not in fact, I expect, given what I'm seeing in the second half of the calendar year to be seasonally up and really quite strong for us.","Operator","Next question comes from Tom Sepenzis with Northland. Please go ahead.","Tom Sepenzis - Northland","Hi, congratulations as well for me. I'm just wondering, if you could talk a little bit more about ac specifically as we go from 1 to 2, 2 by 2, 4 to 6 MIMO, what do you -- how you are thinking about the potential TAM benefit there?","Dave Aldrich","Sure. That is a -- it's a great question and you've seen some recent releases from some of our chipset partners that are really demonstrating MIMO to 3, 6, even 9 streams. I mean, you literally get a -- if you go from 3 streams to 6, its 2x content for us. And we start with very high content, we can double it, we can triple it and you will able to see some routers and access points now that have substantial Skyworks content 11ac FEMs, switching and even power management in some cases.","So this is deployed very well in routers. But again as I mentioned, we're starting to see mobile handsets adopt 2-by-2 technology on next generation platform, so that would be two streams in the mobile handsets, potentially 2.5 gig devices, 2.4 gig devices together with switching. So that trend is really good and by the way, the benefits that when we see on delivering this higher data rates through the home, delivering these higher rates to handheld the tablet or mobile device are outstanding. So it's a win-win for the customers and we're in a great position to capitalize.","Operator","Next question comes from Harsh Kumar with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Richard Sewell - Stephens","Yeah guys, thanks. This is Richard in for Harsh. Let me pass along my congratulations as well.","Dave Aldrich","Thank you.","Richard Sewell - Stephens","So my first question. Can you give any color on how your visibility compares to prior years and how the lead times in the integrated solutions compare to discrete PA?","Dave Aldrich","The visibility is as good if not better and I would say better in the sense that the -- that we\u2019re participating earlier in the product lifecycle in almost all cases. In fact, we're beginning to participate at the point at which the overall SOC or chipset has been selected. So we have much more visibility. In fact, we're looking now at products that will be launching in the second half. We're well into designing late 50 and some cases 60 products today. Because the architecture choices among our customers differ and some other product lifecycles at vertical markets are very, very low, in fact, most of them are.","And so we're doing some connectivity enablement upfront. And so our customers -- these new customers are coming to us and we're helping to figure out how to deal with these phone analog connectivity problems for the very first and they're engaging us right upfront. So the visibility today, I would have to say in general is better.","Richard Sewell - Stephens","Great. And then a quick follow-on, we're seeing a couple of year peers launch integrated solutions. What do you think driving a more integrated solutions approach across the industry?","Dave Aldrich","I think it's quite simple and that is in order for our customers to meet their performance requirements, their design time to market -- and to just reduce their need to get into the detail of architecture as these comps -- as these analog systems become more and more complex. They're looking for a partner and that partner has to have system expertise and partners has to have good solid manufacturing capability to do unique things, bumping, flipping, diving and a broad product portfolio. And so we've been a leader in integration. We were in front in FEMs, we're upfront with Pads, we're upfront in SkyOne, we're upfront in WiFi and integration of devices and we think that's a big, big advantage for us and the trends that I think we'll not stop for many years.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Aldrich for any closing comments.","Dave Aldrich","Okay. Well, thank you very much everybody for participating and I look forward to see you in upcoming conferences.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation."],"19669":["Skyworks Solutions, Inc.

Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Skyworks' fourth fiscal quarter and year-end 2019 conference call. With me on the call today are Liam Griffin, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kris Sennesael, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our discussion will include statements relating to future results and expectations that are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Please refer to our earnings press release and recent SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on certain risks that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially and adversely from any forward-looking statements made today.","Additionally, the results and guidance we will discuss include non-GAAP financial measures consistent with our prior practice. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Liam.","Liam Griffin","Thanks Mitch, and welcome everyone. The Skyworks team delivered solid profitability and strong cash flow in Q4 and throughout the fiscal year, demonstrating our technology leadership and the resilience of our business model, despite a challenging end market. ","During the fourth fiscal quarter we grew revenue 8% sequentially, and excluding Huawei revenue was up 20% sequentially. We produced gross margin of 50.3% and operating margin of 34%. We posted earnings per share of $1.52, ahead of our guidance and up 13% sequentially, and we generated exceptional operating cash flow totaling $472 million. ","For the 2019 fiscal year we delivered revenue of $3.4 billion, earnings per share of $6.17 and operating cash flow of $1.4 billion. We generate free cash flow of nearly $1 billion, up 16% from the prior year, representing a free cash flow margin of 29%, approaching our model target of 30%, and we returned nearly $1 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. ","At a higher level, the 5G upgrade cycle is now fully underway, expanding across four continents with over 80 carriers and an expanding set of smartphone and IoT customers. We expect a substantial upgrade cycle as the 5 billion mobile subscribers today migrate from their 3G and 4G devices to 5G, creating a significant opportunity for Skyworks. ","Stakeholders are now seeing the compelling economics that this substantial technology inflection brings, with the momentum building into 2020 and beyond. As we said in the previous calls 5G is a technology, not a product. It offers gigabit speeds, ultra-low latency and greatly enhanced network capacity catalyzing a wide set of usage cases, while becoming be the universal connector. ","Although the smartphone will lead the transition to 5G, we see an even more compelling opportunity in new markets and applications, including industrial IoT, autonomous transport, smart cities, artificial intelligence and the proliferation of high definition streaming media. More importantly, highly integrated connectivity engines will play a pivotal role in the deployment of this next generation standard, by resolving the daunting analog and RF complexities that challenge the capabilities of existing hardware and networks. ","Skyworks is squarely at the forefront of this sea change in connectivity. We have a rich heritage in the design and execution of highly integrated and customizable system solutions, earning the trust of market leaders as they cross the chasm from 4G to 5G. ","Our operational footprint goes far beyond units and scale. It is centered on unique strategic technologies, crafted in our own fabs, while creating sustainable competitive advantage. Our technology strength is fortified by world class performance in scale across a broad array of capabilities, including TC-SAW and Bulk Acoustic Wave filters, an expanded family of MIMO Solutions and ultra-high band and diversity receive module. ","Our highly customized system solutions support a broad set of wireless protocols, including GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, LoRa, Zigbee and of course 4G and 5G. From our breakthrough Sky5 unifying platform, our 5G small cell solution, Skyworks comprehensive approach across both infrastructure and user equipment facilitates powerful, high speed, end-to-end connectivity. ","Now in our mobile business, traction in 5G is accelerating, with design wins at leading OEMs leveraging our broad and growing set of platforms. Our solutions are purpose built to offer interoperability and customization across all baseband suppliers including Qualcomm, MediaTek, Samsung LSI and HiSilicon, and with the successful launch and expanding capabilities of our BAW filter portfolio, we are positioned to extend our reach across a broader spectrum of 4G and 5G bands. ","Moving to the internet-of-things, we are ramping more than 10 new LTE based design wins, supporting Tier 1 automotive customers. We are powering Sonos\u2019 first all-in-one indoor\/outdoor portable smart speakers, delivering LTE powered IoT engines to Sierra Wireless for their industrial and transportation gateways, enabling a range of wearable devices leveraging our GPS, Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity engines, expanding our reach into high performance audio with the introduction of our cognitive chipsets, and we are executing on the launch of our Wi-Fi 6 platforms, expanding our customer set with leaders including Amazon, Arris, AT&T, Juniper, Linksys and Netgear.","Now moving to the infrastructure markets Skyworks is leveraging its vast capability in gallium arsenide, BAW technology and Ceramics to support strategic customers as they deploy their 5G networks. 5G infrastructure requires new technologies and capabilities, which drive the need for a unique set of complex solutions. For example, massive MIMO increases RF content up to 8x per base station, with new antenna systems utilizing multiple channels and beam steering to deliver gigabit speeds. ","As a company we remain focused on driving diversification across high value markets, while our customer set continues to expand and is now numbered in thousands. In addition, we are gaining momentum in new verticals, enabling wins with automotive leaders like Continental, Audi and BMW, along with industrial players including Honeywell, Siemens, GE, Phillips and Rockwell.

Differentiated system solutions with unmatched levels of integration and performance, focused and strategic investments, expanding our product portfolio, IP and scale, and finally a predictable business model that yields premium profitability and strong cash flow. The strength of our design win pipeline coupled with our experience across multiple technology generations positions us well to convert these market opportunities into sustainable growth. ","With that, I will turn the call over to Kris for a discussion of our Q4 and fiscal year performance as well as our outlook for Q1. ","Kris Sennesael","Thanks Liam. Skyworks' revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2019 was $827 million, up 8% sequentially and $2 million above the midpoint of the outlook we provided in August. When excluding the revenue from Huawei, in both the June and September quarter, our revenue increased 20% sequentially. This represents one of the strongest sequential growth rates for Skyworks. ","Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $416 million, resulting in a gross margin of 50.3% in line with expectations. Operating expenses were $135 million, flatish through the March and June quarters. Going forward, operating expenses will come down as we implemented certain cost reductions during the fourth fiscal quarter. ","We generated $281 million of operating income, translating into an operating margin of 34%, up 110 basis points from fiscal Q3. Other income was $3 million and our effective tax rate was 7.7%, driving net income of $262 million or $1.52 of diluted earnings per share, up 13% sequentially. ","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow; fourth fiscal quarter cash flow from operations was $417 million and capital expenditures were $84 million, resulting in $333 million of free cash flow, translating into a free cash flow margin of 40%. We paid $75 million in dividends, and repurchase 1.9 million shares of our common stock for a total of $146 million. ","As this is the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, let\u2019s also review our annual results. We generated $3.4 billion of revenue with gross profit of $1.7 billion, resulting in a gross margin of 50.6%. Operating income was $1.2 billion. We have an operating margin of 34.5%. ","Full year effective tax rate was 8.5% and net income was $1.1 billion, translating into $6.17 of diluted earnings per share. Cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion, up 8.5% from last year, with CapEx at $398 million, resulting in a strong free cash flow of close to $1 billion and our target free cash flow margin of 30%. ","We returned $932 million to shareholders in fiscal 2019, just under 100% of our free cash flow, with $274 million of dividend payments, and $658 million in share buybacks as we repurchased 8.9 million shares throughout the fiscal year. We ended the fiscal year \u201819 with cash and investments of $1 billion and we have no debt. ","Now, let's move on to our outlook for Q1 of fiscal 2020. The initial launch of 5G and gains across a diverse set of high-performance mobile solutions, matched with solid traction in growth markets, are driving accelerated growth into the December quarter. ","For the first fiscal quarter of 2020 we anticipate revenue to be between $870 million and $890 million, representing sequential growth of 6.5% at the midpoint of the range. We expect gross margin at approximately 50% and operating expenses of approximately $132 million, which is $7 million below Q1 of last year as we continue to manage our operating expense level. ","Below the line we anticipate roughly $2.5 million in other income and a tax rate of 9%. We expect our diluted share count to further reduce to approximately $171 million shares. Accordingly at the midpoint of these ranges, we intend to deliver diluted earnings per share of $1.65.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liam. ","Liam Griffin","Thanks Chris. Skyworks continues to deliver consistently solid profitability, while generating strong cash flow. Looking ahead, our market leading solutions are at the forefront of the next major cycle in connectivity. However, unlike the prior 3G and 4G upgrades which were largely paced by smartphone unit, we see 5G as a transformational technology that will impact, disrupt, and fuel a connected economy that we have not yet seen or comprehended in our markets today. ","We addressed this opportunity with a proven culture of success, driven by a talented team, deep customer relationships, strategic investments and global scale, positioning us to succeed at this very important stage of technology inflection, while executing the financial discipline to ensure shareholder value. ","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, lets open the line for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from a line of Karl Ackerman from Cowen. Your line is open. ","Karl Ackerman ","Hey, good afternoon gentlemen. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I want to focus on 5G for a moment. So some of your peers have got at least 200 million 5G phones for next year. I would appreciate how you are thinking about your opportunity for 5G with regard to geography and whether or not we should anticipate the 40% content uplift that you've alluded to from 4G to 5G. Should that be realized over the duration of the ramp or is that recognized more immediately on initial devices; and I have a follow up. ","Liam Griffin","Sure, well 5G of course is going to impact multiple markets, multiple customers and the timing of that could be different depending on the geography and the specific OEM. We are 100% engaged with all the leading players, we have a really significant opportunity to gain content, we are rolling that out now. The reach of our portfolio continues to expand and we have some really significant customers that are in production now. We also have some really big customers, they're going to be launching next year. ","So we are in great shape, we are demonstrating the capabilities that we discussed in prior calls. I will tell you that the 5G implementation is incredibly powerful for the consumer, but very challenging for the OEM and our job is to get in there and do the hard work with our customers, and deliver the right kind of technology to make their systems work, and that's what we're doing. ","Karl Ackerman ","I appreciate that. On 5G infrastructure, you reference some design wins for massive MIMO and the content being nearly 8x higher than 4G. Do you see the revenue inflection more of a 2021 event or is that something that can ramp in the back half of 2020? Thank you. ","Liam Griffin","Yeah, no that's a great question. So the infrastructure side of 5G is still a little bit behind schedule, so we are seeing some great adoption with the handset players and they'll be ready to roll, but infrastructure has been a little bit slower. ","We've made some great progress specifically with Nokia and with Ericsson. On Nokia\u2019s platforms we\u2019ve got opportunities that are you know measured in the $10 to $15 per base station, significant opportunity. We're looking at antenna arrays that are very rich, high content, complex high margin, going to be pivotal to that, and they use a lot of unique technologies that we also bring to market, including some ceramic technologies and other filtering technologies, as well as our gallium arsenide expertise. So we do have a great hand in the infrastructure side that will work adjacent to what we see in the mobile phone. ","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. ","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question. Liam for my first one, how are you positioned OpEx and CapEx wise when it comes to addressing the 5G market? I think you mentioned some OpEx right sizing in the quarter, which areas did you right size? And just overall, you know and where my question is coming from is that in the past you had one really large customer, but as we come to the 5G opportunity, you'll probably need to address a much wider range of customers I imagine over a much wider range of a products. So how are you managing OpEx and CapEx going into the 5G cycle? ","Liam Griffin","Sure, great question. So just to start, you know some of the reductions in OpEx were more around 2G, 3G products and legacy devices and moving R&D resources to higher end platforms, like Sky5 and the 5G rollout, so that\u2019s one part of it. ","We are addressing all the customers and working across our market to deliver the right technology. Also you know when you mention CapEx, you know one of the things that we do at Skyworks is we craft our technology and build it in house. We very rarely outsource. We do it in house; we have incredible capabilities to customize a wide range of TC-SAW products, TC-SAW base products with that filter inside and also our Bulk Acoustic Wave portfolio.","So the CapEx that we have is actually strategic technology investments. These are not filters that we could buy in the open market, they are filters that we craft and customize and work customer by customer to implement. It\u2019s a very different business dynamic, a business model than some of our peers.","Vivek Arya","Got it. And for my follow-up, on gross margins, I think Kris you mentioned that it would be approximately 50%. So I'm just curious, is it just mix that's driving them, you know perhaps kind of flat to slightly lower, and then how should we think about the trajectory of gross margins getting into March, which tends to be a seasonally down quarter? ","Kris Sennesael","Yeah, yeah Vivek. So first of all, I'm pleased with our gross margin performance in the September quarter at 50.3. You also have to take into account that we had some serious headwinds with the export ban on Huawei, which was our second largest customer and most of those products were actually manufactured in-house, so that was a serious headwind for us, but I think the company managed it very well. So we are guiding for December, approximately 50% so we still have some lingering issues there with the Huawei business. ","And then of course, when you look ahead into March and June we will go through our normal seasonality, but then in the second half of 2020, as we get back to a sequential growth, growth that is fueled by 5G new, complex, highly integrated products, as well as our [growth] [ph] market business, we will start seeing gross margin improvements all the way up to our target multiple of 53%. ","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Your line is open. ","Jamison Crone","Hi guys, this is Jamison calling for Ambrish. So I was hoping that you guys could talk about a little bit more about 5G and piggy backing on Karl\u2019s commentary. Qualcomm has talked about 200 million 5G smartphone in 2020 and assuming you are able to get 50 percent market share and maybe half of the $25 content you talked about in front end value, that would imply about $1.3 billion in 5G revenue possible for you guys in 2020. ","So I was wondering if you guys could talk about the revenue and percentage mix of 5G in your mobile segment this quarter and where do you expect revenues and mix to land in 2020 and beyond? Thank you. ","A - Liam Griffin","Yeah, we don't \u2013 we're not going to guide mix to 5G, but I will tell you that we are at the forefront. As we stated in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re at the forefront of this inflection without question and it's difficult to handicap how many units, but I will tell you, there's a lot of units coming, there's a lot of complexity on the table. Everyone\u2019s going to come to market with a different play, but it's a great opportunity for this industry, it really is, and what we love about our company is the flexibility that we have and the tools that we have to put together configurations with every customer. ","And let me also say that you know we are basically technology agnostic or base band agnostic. We will sell with a Qualcomm base band; we\u2019ll work with the MediaTek platform. We have incredible content there. We\u2019ll work with Samsung LSI and if conditions change with Huawei we\u2019ll work with HiSilicon, so we have the tools and technology. ","We've been investing in this for years. You know when we talk about decades of technology, it\u2019s real. We've been through 2G, 3G, 4G. We know how hard it is in 5G, but it\u2019s a great opportunity","So we're going to see an increasing level of revenue in 5G and it will not just be smartphone. It will be smartphone, IoT, it will be enterprise, it'll be factory automation and some incredible new avenues that we haven't even explored yet. So there's a lot coming and the business is ready to go. We\u2019ve made great investments in capacity and the right technologies and we\u2019re positioned for growth. ","Jamison Crone","Thanks. And for my follow-up I was wondering if you could maybe touch on your plan for millimeter wave solutions, just for your company given where Qualcomm is with theirs. Any thoughts on the market in terms of liability and revenue for handsets will be appreciated? Thank you.","A - Liam Griffin","Sure, sure. Yeah, well millimeter wave is an interesting technology. It does \u2013 you know can offer some pretty compelling attributes around speed and performance. The challenge with it though is, it has some technical road blocks right. You need to have some very complex beam steering to implement this. There's some line of sight limitations; there\u2019s some cost limitations to it and what we're seeing is some of our handset partners are just not ready right now to engage in that technology, and often for you know sub 6 gigahertz, 5G technologies where the market is pretty rich and the opportunity is pretty rich. ","So I think there's a possibility for millimeter wave to play a role in this industry and you know high capacity environments, sporting events, college campuses where there's a great deal of density. There could be an opportunity for that, but right now it's kind of still on the cusp of whether the adoption will take place or not. ","Meanwhile, we're hedging our best; we\u2019re investing in the technology; you know we do a lot of our work internally as I mentioned with the Kelly Marcin filtering. So we know the road map looks like to be a player in millimeter wave, but we're going to take our time as we progress. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is open. ","Blayne Curtis","Hey guys, thanks for my question. I just wanted to get back to the 5G timing. You've seen Qorvo and Qualcomm talk about a March up-tick and I'm just kind of curious because you, you know put that with comments as some of the infrastructure is taking a little bit more time. I know you don't want to guide March, but I\u2019m just kind of curious, would you be able to see an up-tick even as early as the March quarter. Any comments on the direction there and then the pace of the rest of the year will be helpful. ","A - Liam Griffin","Sure. Yeah, I mean there should really be no difference between the peer group on what the units are going to be, right. So we can all handicap that. I think the issue and the opportunity Blayne is what we do, how do we execute and what kind of content can we gain in this industry, that's kind of more at this point for us.","So a couple of things: If you look at the company year-over-year, we\u2019ve done incredible enhancements in our TC-SAW capability and rounding out low band PAD and DRx across the board, which is great. But we\u2019ve also uplifted the technology with Bulk Acoustic Wave. We're already delivering ultra-high band solutions right now that are very compelling and our customers love them. ","We're moving into mid and high band also with accounts and then you have just an incredible inflection and infrastructure that we talked about, and then further on we\u2019ll start to see the 5G opportunity really penetrate multi markets; automotive, machine-to-machine applications; we talked a little bit about that, enterprise, a lot of really cool stuff that we're talking to customers about and some of that maybe later into late 2020 to \u201921, but there's a really significant tail on that. ","But in the meantime, all the companies that you named and all the OEMs that are on the table, we are deeply engaged and we have been for quite a while and feeling really good about where this is moving. ","Blayne Curtis","Thanks and then maybe just for Kris, just if you can give us any color in the September for the mixed-stream mobile and broad markets and any perspective into December between those segments in terms of growth. ","Kris Sennesael","Yeah, absolutely. So growth markets in the September quarter was approximately 33% of total revenue, so its running now well above $1.1 billion in annualized run rate. This was down slightly on a sequential basis, but you have to take into account that we also have Huawei related revenue in that broad market business. ","If I exclude Huawei, actually it was up sequentially, as well as year-over-year in the mid-single digits. So very pleased with our performance in growth markets, as multiple drivers there, the Wi-Fi 6 adoption, the 5G opportunity beyond the mobile phone, as well as some good traction in our audio play that we have as well. ","Liam Griffin","Yeah Blayne, let me add a couple of other interesting points here. In addition to kind of the run right opportunities in broad markets, we've really been focused on cost \u2013 what I call customer acquisition. Going out there and finding new account that we can populate with our technology and we made some really good progress design wins now with Honeywell, design wins with Ford, design wins with Continental, Rockwell, Siemen, we have some other great account that we can't talk about yet that are on the cusp. ","So we're really happy with the ability to run broad markets in a diversified way, but also capture significant customers that just haven't been part of the Skyworks family, right, because we haven't been selling to these guys. And with the technology inflection in 5G and the need for these companies to go to a wireless engine, it's a great chance for us to do our work. So there's some other cool things happening in broad market that really weren't on the table a year or two go. ","Operator","And your next question comes from a line of Craig Ellis from B. Riley FBR. Your line is open. ","Craig Ellis ","Yeah, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the performance guys. Liam, I wanted to follow-up with some of the 5G commentary, both prepared and in Q&A. So I think if we look back at 4G, integrated mobile was a business that could consistently be a mid-teens year-on-year grower and now with 5G the company has expanded its filter portfolio with BAW. ","You've got internal filter supply, we've never had that before in our interface transition and you've got it top to bottom. So my question is, as you look at the engagements that exist across your different OEMs, do you feel like you're gaining the line of sight for that segment to not only return to growth, but to potentially return to mid-teens double digit year-on-year growth? ","A - Liam Griffin","Yeah, I think as you know, like the opportunity is very, very strong right now and the indications we have with the customers we've been working with are powerful, and the complexity is way up and some of the points that you just made about honing our facility with big deals, it's a big deal. We could have gone outside to do that at a lower performing engine, that\u2019s not the way we want to go. So there's a lot of complexity right now. ","There's a customer engagement with us. We're always reaching into our accounts, but they are coming into us too. So it's a difficult transition to make technically, but it has incredible benefit. And so we saw a lot of great action in the last quarter, a lot of action in design wins, lots of discussions, lots of visits to our sites from our leading customers to go in and really kick the tires on some of the things that we are working on and most customers walking away with confidence. ","So we think this is going to be a very significant \u2013 this is more than a mobile inflection. This is a technology shift that\u2019s going to disrupt the markets that we all play in here, right. So I think there is some great stuff going on, and we'll start to see more and more customers evolve, classic mobile customers, but then kind of that second wave into IoT, enterprise, etcetera, where there's just a long tail of opportunity. ","So we feel good about it. I feel it\u2019s a design win activity in the last six months or so that has really accelerated, the sampling activity across a whole set of OEMs, also some really good work with base band partners. We've done some exceptional work with MediaTek for example, transitioning from a strong position in Phase 6 now shifting to Phase 7, which is all 5G; launching the higher frequency bands with BAW. So it\u2019s a compelling time right now for Skyworks to execute. We are not opportunity constrained. It's about getting out there and helping our customers win. ","Craig Ellis ","That's really helpful. Kris, the next question is for you and I wanted to follow-up on the comments that gross margins could move from current levels up towards the 53% target model. What I wanted to do is break that down and get your help just on identifying what the specific drivers are. ","So can you just help us understand how we get from first 50% to 51%. Is that all just going to be volume coming back and kind of making up for the loss of Huawei and then more significantly I think getting from 51% to 53%. If you could just help us understand how much of that is helped from broad markets, Avnera, mix shift within the integrated mobile portfolio from 4G to 5G, etcetera, it would help give us some clarity on how we get to 53%. Thank you. ","Kris Sennesael","Yes, that\u2019s a good question and so I\u2019ve answered in the previous question there, some of the headwinds of course is the Huawei revenue that almost disappears and Huawei was running on or about 15% percent of total revenue and so that\u2019s definitely a headwind. ","But nevertheless, I think we have been able to keep the margins above the 50% and looking forward there are three major blocks to drive margin improvement and the first one, the most important one is continue to develop highly integrated complex, high value added type of products to our customers, that made their product better and that made the user experience better. And we do that all the time, and 5G is a great opportunity to demonstrate our technology leadership and help improve as a result of that our margins. ","Of course in addition to that, we will continue to work out operational cost structure and drive down the cost in our factories and with our suppliers and all of that, and then last but not least, of course yes there is a little bit of a tailwind in terms of mix. Our broad market business has a higher gross margin that our mobile business, and our broad margin business has been growing and will continue to be growing faster than mobile and so we get a little bit of tailwind there as well. ","Liam Griffin","Yeah and I will add one thing to that comment. I think that if you look at 5G and the complexity of 5G and the types of unique systems and engines that are being deployed, the margins there are going to be higher. I think there's going to be fewer players in the industry that can execute to the level that our customers need to be successful. ","So I think you've got a case where the 5G inflection and the power of that connection and the value that that's providing is going to translate to better growth margins, it\u2019s just the way that\u2019s going to run. Now working within our factories is going to make it even easier for us, but there's going to be, and there should be for us you know meaningful margin rules with the roll-out of 5G as we get a higher level of concentration there.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes thanks. First question just Liam, to follow-up on the BAW activity. You know you\u2019ve see that mostly in diversity receive at this point? And then just how you think about it and the future layering into you mentioned kind of ultra-high band pad and things like that. ","Liam Griffin","Sure Craig. Yeah, so we actually, right now today have been shipping in high volume on ultra-high band path that includes our BAW device and that's running at about 3.3 gig Craig, so we are looking at high frequency, high band devices. ","We are sampling more than 10 customers with our bulk acoustic wave technology across a broad set of frequencies and spectrum, and you know we\u2019ve had strategic customers come and test our metal and they like what they see. So we are going to continue advancing that category, and we\u2019ll use the filtering technology that\u2019s best equipped for the application. We\u2019ll continue to use TC-SAW and some areas we\u2019ll bulk acoustic wave, and in some areas maybe it will be in diversity receive, maybe it will be in transmit chain. ","So again, just having the ability to create that unique customization for each and every one of our accounts is important for us. So we\u2019ve made those investments, and you should expect more from us from the BAW side as the year turns here, as we get further into 2020. ","Craig Hettenbach","Got it, and then just a follow-up for Kris. I know you guys have talk about it, as you insource filters, the inventory is kind of higher than the historic. You know just how you are thinking about managing that into what's typically the seasonally this easily weaker March quarter. Yeah okay soul compatible with where we are from an infantry weaker march quarter. ","Kris Sennesael","Yeah, so I feel comfortable with where we are from an inventory level. Actually the days on inventory came down four days to 135 days, and is expected to continue to come down in the December quarter, but looking forward, inventory is going to split the rate between 120 days to 140, to 145 days and again, that is higher than a couple years ago, mainly driven by our filter manufacturing. We continue to expand the capacity not only in TC-SAW but now also having make major investments to get Bulk Acoustic Wave capacity into our filter operation and so that is driving the inventories and to the 120 to 145 days.","Operator","And your next question comes from a line of Chris Caso from Raymond James. Your line is open. ","Chris Caso","Yes, thank you, the first question is on Huawei and I think last quarter your commentary was that the majority of the restrictions were on the infrastructure products, but yet in the handset products you sold to Huawei and you weren\u2019t getting demand signal. Could you give an update on where that stands now, how much Huawei is in the guidance right now, and do you expect that to come back at some point going forward, you know speaking to the handset side. ","Kris Sennesael","Yes, so the Huawei revenue played out exactly in-line with our expectations, in the September quarter we expected to approximately $10 million of revenue and that's what it \u2013 that's what it came in. So looking for work, we believe that Huawei will continue to run at approximately that level, maybe it might be picking up a little bit, but a lot of that will depend on this whole situation with Huawei and the export ban will evolve. ","Liam Griffin","Yeah, I mean Chris this is really just about being in compliance with the export ban. It's not about share loss or gain, it's about being in compliance and as Kris said $10 million was the number for the quarter. Over time if things change, we could be right back in the saddle with this customer. They were our number two customer for us, not long ago. So it's not about technology on our end or market share, it's really about staying I compliance with U.S. law at this point, and if things change, we\u2019ll be ready to alter. ","Chris Caso","Alright, as a follow-up, I guess as a follow up on that, and there has been some investor concerns over, other fall out around the trade tensions where you know perhaps some Chinese customers would seek to be less reliant on U.S. content, perhaps even backsliding into discrete solutions. ","Could you talk to that, what the customers are telling you or is there any evidence where you've got customers that perhaps would like to go away from U.S. content and you know as you move into 5G and work in the higher complexity, is that even a feasible solution at this point and can you develop a 5G phone that uses discrete solutions. ","Liam Griffin","Yeah, so I'll start -- I\u2019ll get the second part and then I go to the front end of your question. So I think it's very difficult to deliver the kind of compelling technology that is needed in a 5G device, I really do, I believe that, and I think you know, U.S. companies had played a vital role in that area and I think we have this great technology. It\u2019s difficult to do it without some of the things that we make here at Skyworks and some of our other peers, so that's one. ","But at the other side here is, you know the Huawei situation is a Huawei situation. There are trade issues in China, we get it, but if you look outside Huawei and you look at Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi, our business is very strong, very strong and there\u2019s a lot of 5G launches going on right now with Skyworks. ","There were some initial launches where we had a baseband provider in there and there were some content in there that we didn\u2019t win, but that\u2019s turning over. So we see tremendous momentum and what we call the OVX side the Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi side within China. So that continues to go on and as Kris noted we\u2019re playing it down with Huawei. We\u2019ve got a number now that\u2019s conservative, we\u2019re going to focus on everybody else and if Huawei comes back, like I said, that revenue will come back.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Snyder from Charter Equity. Your line is open.","Edward Snyder","Thanks a lot. Liam, if I could, there\u2019s been a lots of ultra-high band and Sub-6 stuff. Qualcomm obviously based on their comments is just going to take it all. They said something like virtually all base band antenna solutions for 200 something different flagship devices. ","Leaving that aside for now and any comments you want to make on what you\u2019re seeing competitive threats on that, but more importantly, it looks like the architectures that are coming out in the next year, but each are from China Mobile including the 79 bands. What\u2019s your opening now on the content for the device, ultra-high beams up for a while probably normally about $2 in content. ","Are you seeing this rise much faster than expected, because you\u2019re including these extra bands in this? And do you expect to capture your traditional share, which has been relatively high in that spot for the next year or so or are you getting more competition? Then I have a follow-up.","Liam Griffin","Yes, no that\u2019s a great question, Ed; a lot of insights to that. So we are seeing some real good action on the UHP pad, you know right around 3.3, 3.5 and so what you\u2019ve got there is some great opportunity to continue to expand that, that\u2019s working out great. We\u2019re also looking at a number of other solutions with our China customers and other OEMs. ","And then the other major catalyst for us in this area is MediaTek and you know these guys really well. We\u2019ve done a lot of work with MediaTek back to the 2G days and we had a nice position on Phase 6. But when you start to roll into Phase 7, our platform position to MediaTek is really compelling. We\u2019ve got Sky5, we\u2019ve got DRx technology, we have UHP opportunities and there\u2019re some incredible new technologies across that platform and if your really good about that.","We could be looking at a $7 or $8 handle on MediaTek shifts that attach here in Phase 7. So we\u2019re excited about that. ","In the meantime you know we\u2019re continuing to do the work with Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi. Despite the baseband provider, whoever it may be, if it\u2019s MediaTek or not MediaTek, if it\u2019s Samsung LSI, we\u2019ll work it; if its Qualcomm, we\u2019ll work it. So there\u2019s a lot of action going on there, but I would say that the MediaTek transition is going to be quite strong, it hasn\u2019t happened yet, but it\u2019s headed for the second half of the year and it will be a really compelling driver.","Edward Snyder","And then, I\u2019m glad you brought that up. He was my second question basically. I mean the Chinese OEMs took their toe in Phase 6 last year to the first full module design, and for safety sake, it looked like in the core we took most of the main path, you guys were all over the place and the other sections of it, but it sounds like now they like to \u2013 love to really accelerate the deployment of both Phase 6 and Phase 7 sooner before MediaTek gets their 5G out. ","We certainly saw that in some of the reports coming out on the quarter, big upside in not only number of 5G phones but a number that are using more of these high content modules. ","You kind of stepped back a little bit last year just because on the transition to this new architecture volumes when for safety and I know your taking some of that back, but outside of say the DRx and all the other areas you guys were in tune as we saw that, outside of that packet, the main path, you expect to gain back some of the share now that the OEMs are getting comfortable with that design or are we going to see a bifurcation here where it\u2019s you and Qorvo taking nearly all the content in this fall, and then it\u2019s just going to be bifurcated main path for them and most of everything else for you guys, what\u2019s your feeling on that?","Liam Griffin","Yes, I think \u2013 well, I think you\u2019ve got a lot of that captured. You definitely have an increased opportunity and we are certainly not going to get all of the business. We\u2019d like to get the lion\u2019s share and I think we will, but it\u2019s an increased opportunity and in the complexity that you see in these new phones, the Phase 7 devices specifically are deontic right? ","It takes the best and the brightest to go out there and execute it, so we\u2019re seeing that, but I will tell you that in addition to the traditional stuff that you see in low band PAD and maybe some of the DRx, we\u2019re starting to move up the mid and high band. We\u2019re starting to move up with mid and high band pads, which could be a really meaningful high potency opportunity for us for content. You mentioned, we talked about the UHP that\u2019s continuing to gain not just with MediaTek, but with some other accounts. ","So the aperture\u2019s widened a bit, but one of the common themes here is complexity, like you said, the number of devices, the number of hand-offs carrier aggregation, the power consumption and the efficiency required to drive these 5G devices, it\u2019s just going to be a game changer in terms of challenge and that\u2019s exactly what we want to see. So there\u2019s some really good stuff out there. We hope to lead in this market, but it\u2019s a great opportunity for the industry as well.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Bill Peterson from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Bill Peterson","Yes, hi. Thanks for sneaking me in. I have some questions around the broad markets business and I guess first is a follow-up to Blayne\u2019s question. Do you anticipate sequential growth in the December quarter? I mean, I know Huawei is kind of running at a low level and then I guess as you think about the fiscal year based off your design win pipeline, you talked about Wi-Fi 6 and some of the other opportunities. How should we think about growth and that can never turn back to double digit growth as we think about that in this fiscal year?","Kris Sennesael","Yes, just for the December quarter broad markets, normal seasonality is down 8% to 10%. We saw that in fiscal \u201818, we saw that in fiscal \u201819 and so we expect something similar in the December quarter of fiscal \u201820, normal seasonality. Having said that, on a full year basis, yes, we do believe that broad markets given all the drivers that we\u2019ve talked about, it could be back to double-digit year-over-year growth.","Liam Griffin","And recall, if you look at the proxy for semis in 2019, you\u2019re looking at double-digit declines for most of those markets. The broad markets within our business, we felt they behaved pretty well and grew pretty nicely, but we\u2019re going to continue to invest and drive that into 2020.","Bill Peterson","Okay, thanks for that color. And I guess just lastly a housekeeping. How should we think about OpEx trajectory throughout the year? Are you bringing it down here in the December quarter? Should we expect that to kind of grow somewhat in line as revenues continue to grow and maybe return to year-on-year growth? And then your tax rate, I guess 9%, so we just assume that for the fiscal year as well?","Kris Sennesael","Yes, on OpEx we\u2019re going to remain disciplined, but at the same time we\u2019re not going to hesitate to make the necessary investments to fuel the growth of the business and make those necessary investments in technology, 5G, broad markets, support of the broad markets. ","So yes, over time here in fiscal \u201820 we will see some modest increases in the OpEx. It\u2019s running on or about 16% or so to revenue right now, which I do believe is world-class and we will continue to manage it. And then on the tax rate, you know on a full year basis on or about 9% is a good number.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Mr. Griffin for any closing remarks.","Liam Griffin","Thank you all for participating on today\u2019s call. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming investor conferences during the quarter. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. "]}}
