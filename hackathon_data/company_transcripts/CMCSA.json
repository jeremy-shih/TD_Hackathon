At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Jason Armstrong. Please go ahead, Mr. Armstrong.","Jason Armstrong ","Thank you, operator and welcome everyone. Joining me on this morning\u2019s call are Brian Roberts, Michael Angelakis, Mike Cavanagh, Steve Burke and Neil Smit. Brian and Mike will make formal remarks, and Michael, Steve and Neil will also be available for Q&A.","As always, let me now refer you to slide number 2, which contains our Safe Harbor disclaimer, and remind you that this conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, in this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our 8-K for the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.","With that let me turn the call to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian?","Brian L. Roberts","Thanks Jason and good morning everyone. As this is the first call since the death of my father, I\u2019d like to express my gratitude for the tremendous outpouring of support for me and the entire Comcast family. So many of you recalled your favorite memories and stories and for this I'm beyond grateful. And as I think about today, reporting on another terrific quarter it\u2019s such a great reflection of the special company Ralph built and I'm honored to help lead.","Comcast NBCUniversal has real positive momentum on many fronts and so we are pleased to report that in the second quarter we grew revenue by 11.3% and operating cash flow by 8%. Our growth was broad based. In cable our investments in customer experience, a faster X1 rollout, and our leading broadband network are all paying off. We grew overall customer relationships, added broadband customers and reduced our video losses in half. In fact this is the best second quarter result in video that we\u2019ve had in nine years. ","But the highlight of the quarter was Universal Pictures and Universal Theme Parks. And overall at NBCUniversal I just can\u2019t say enough great things about the second quarter. Operating cash flow increased 19.4% following a 14% growth in the first quarter. Steve Burke and his team continue to transform the business and are on track to soon double the operating cash flow since we made our original announcement with GE in 2009. ","Led by blockbusters Furious 7 and Jurassic World and a successful Pitch Perfect 2 the Filmed Division put up an unbelievable quarter. We broke a long list of records, so let me just highlight a couple. Universal\u2019s worldwide box office grosses have already set a yearly record for the company, exceeding the prior high achieved in 2013. Jurassic World generated $1 billion in worldwide box office in its first 13 days, which is faster than any film in history and now stands as the fourth highest grossing film of all time and Furious 7 is the fifth highest grossing film. ","Notably we\u2019ve had outstanding success internationally. Furious 7 became the highest grossing film ever in China. And Minions which is off to an excellent start will help continue the trend of global success into the third quarter. This all demonstrate, not only our focus on franchises and sequels but also our approach to global marketing and distribution under the leadership of Jeff Shell, Donna Langley, Ron Meyer and many others. ","Turning to Broadcast and Cable networks, industry viewership continues to be under pressure but we have a strong diversified and enviable line-up of networks. A big success was NBC Broadcast, which won the 2014-2015 season for adults 18 to 49, marking the second year in a row as number one. NBC Sports continues to demonstrate the power of live sports with year-over-year viewership gains across the NHL Stanley Cup Finals, The English Premier League, Top [ph] Channel and now NASCAR. ","We also remained focused on original programming; a recent example is we\u2019re very encouraged by how strongly Mr. Robot has gotten out of the gate on USA. It now ranks as a number two new scripted cable series of the year. Finally at NBCUniversal, our terrific momentum at Parks continues. ","Tom Williams and Mark Woodbury and their teams have led the business to a stellar 45% operating cash flow growth. The enormous success of the new Harry Potter attraction in Orlando was sustained in the second quarter. Our strategy of consistently launching new attractions is really working. Our recently opened Fast and Furious super charge attraction in Hollywood provides already an additional boost to that park and we have an exciting roadmap with other new attractions that we will launching in the future including the highly anticipated opening of Harry Potter in Hollywood next summer. All-in-all the team at NBCUniversal is doing a fantastic job and is executing incredibly well.","Moving to Cable Communications, Neil Smit and the team continues to drive the industry\u2019s best technologies and platforms forward and the results prove this out. In the second quarter we increased revenues 6.3% and operating cash flow 5.1%. We continue to believe X1 is an absolute team changer, better connecting our customers to content serving as a platform for so much more. We have scaled our deployment to nearly 30,000 boxes per day and we are pushing to go even faster. The results are measurable and I am pleased to report that the significant improvements we\u2019ve shared previously around X1 viewing patterns, churn, DVR penetration and additional outlets, amongst others continue to hold as we get further into the base with our deployment. We very much believe in the video business and our place in its future and we will strive to lead in innovating to match the demands of our customers. ","Along these lines we continue to generate serious interest in licensing opportunities for X1 with Cox and now Shaw engaging with us on trials, and number of other companies expressing interest. Importantly we are making progress in our commitment to improve the customer experience. We told you that our intention was to take the same focus we\u2019ve had on product innovation and technology experiences and apply that to customer service and we\u2019re doing it. Some notable examples we recently announced include new cloud-based platforms to give our employees a better view of customer\u2019s account history, a reimagined retail experience, apps that put customers in the driver seat to troubleshoot problems themselves, a tech tracker feature and commitment to service windows, and our plan to add more than 5,500 customer service jobs. ","In short our goal is to make customer service and the customer experience our best product, and our customers are responding to these efforts. Churn is down in every category; video, data, voice and home security which is excellent news and evidence of the progress we are making. And the future holds even more for our customers. We recently began providing voice remote standard with our X1 product; the next iteration in simplifying search and discovery on our platform. And just last week we announced that we are launching a new video product called Stream, that will offer Comcast Internet-only customers in easy way to add a light cable package to their subscription, enjoy immediate access to programming across computers and mobile devices.","We also announced a gaming service in partnership with Electronic Arts on the X1 platform and later this year we will begin trialing and ultimately deploying DOCSIS 3.1 in our network which will provide significant added capacity and lay the groundwork for future speed increases for our broadband customers. In addition to our strong performance on the residential side in business services, Bill Stemper and team continue to deliver, with another quarter of greater than 20% growth in revenue. The consistency of the growth has been amazing and we have significant runway ahead.","Summing up we have a great portfolio of complementary businesses. The diversification of our businesses carries significant benefits as evidenced again this quarter. The key to our success is not only a great set of assets, it\u2019s also our collaborative culture. We make sure that our people work together, enabling us to innovate and execute more quickly. ","And I am excited today for you to meet Mike Cavanagh, who is here with us on the call. As you know he recently joined us to become Chief Financial Officer. Mike has an incredible background and will be able to contribute broad experience and perspective to the role and he is going to be a great partner to me and to the senior team. But it\u2019s bittersweet that this will be Michael Angelakis\u2019 last earnings call. So I want to thank you Michael for all that you have done as our Chief Financial Officer and Vice Chairman, and so much more for the past eight years. But we are all excited by your new initiative, which I think will be exciting for shareholders, for the company and for you personally. ","You\u2019re one of the smartest and most successful deal makers I know. We wish you only the best of luck. So Michael, why don\u2019t you take a few words before we turn it over to Mike Cavanaugh.","Michael J. Angelakis","Thank you, Brian. I very much appreciate the kind words. I'm proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished and it has been an honor for me to represent this amazing company and all my talented colleagues, to our shareholders and the investment community. As you can see from these results the company is so well positioned and has incredibly strong leadership teams throughout the organization. I\u2019d like to thank all of my Comcast NBCUniversal colleagues for their friendship and dedication. ","Also I am very pleased that Mike has joined the team. His experience, his energy and fresh perspectives, as well as great business judgment has made our transition seamless. I am proud and delighted he is here and look forward to our partnership. Now let me turn it over to Mike who will review the quarter\u2019s results. ","Michael J. Cavanagh ","Thanks, Michael and good morning everybody. Although it\u2019s only been about two months since the announcement, I feel welcome and at home at Comcast. It\u2019s great to be joining the team at a time as exciting as Brian just described. ","Before jumping into our results I\u2019d like to say a few words about Michael. He has established a great culture and financial organization inside of Comcast, putting me in a great position, to step to this role and to provide leadership from this special seat. He himself is an outstanding leader and has been and will continue to be a trusted partner of mine. I wish him the very best as he pursues his new growth opportunity for our company.","Now let me begin reviewing our second quarter consolidated financial results, starting on slide four. Overall we are very pleased with our second quarter performance, which reflects healthy growth and consistent execution across our businesses. For the second quarter consolidated revenue increased 11.3% to $18.7 billion, and operating cash flow increased 8% to $6.3 billion, reflecting healthy organic growth in our cable business and outstanding performances in Film and Theme Parks and NBCUniversal. This result includes Time Warner Cable and Charter transaction related costs in the second quarters of both 2015, and 2014. Excluding these transaction costs consolidated operating cash flow increased 8.5%. ","Year-to-date consolidated revenue increased 6.8% to $36.6 billion and consolidated operating cash flow increased 7.8% to $12.2 billion. For comparison purposes, if we exclude the $376 million of revenue generated by the Super Bowl this year as well as the $1.1 billion of revenue generated by the Sochi Olympics in the first quarter of 2014 consolidated revenue increased a very strong 9.3%. Similarly if we exclude transaction related cost incurred in the first six months of this year and last year consolidated operating cash flow increased 8.7%. ","Earnings per share for the second quarter grew 10.5% to $0.84 a share, versus $0.76 per share in the second quarter of 2014. However excluding several adjustments we outlined in our press release, EPS increased 12%. Year-to-date earnings per share increased 12.2% to a $1.65 a share versus a $1.47 a share in the prior year, again excluding adjustments our normalized year-to-date EPS increased 14% to a $1.63.","Free cash flow for the quarter increased 30% to $1.5 billion and a free cash flow per share increased 34.1% to $0.59 a share driven by growth in consolidated operating cash flow and improvements in working capital, partially offset by increased capital expenditures and cash taxes. For the first half of this year we generated $4.7 billion of free cash flow, an increase of 17.7% over the first six months of 2014 and year-to-date free cash flow per share increased 21.9% to a $1.84 per share. ","Now let\u2019s review the results of our businesses in more detail, starting with Cable Communications on slide five. Our Cable Communications team continues to execute well and we are pleased with our second quarter performance of solid revenue and operating cash flow growth along with healthy customer metrics. ","Cable Communications revenue increased 6.3% to $11.7 billion, reflecting the ongoing strength in high speed data and business services as well as higher video revenue. Total revenue per customer relationship increased 4.5% to $143 per month, driven by a higher contribution from business services, customers subscribing to multiple products and higher levels of service and rate adjustments.","In addition to strong financial growth we continued to deliver strong metrics. As Brian highlighted despite the typical seasonality we experience in our second quarter we added 31,000 customer relationships during the quarter, compared to a loss of 25,000 customers last year. More encouraging is that the improvement was driven by increases in our double and triple play relationships as customers continue to find value in the bundle and are increasingly taking multiple services from us. At the end of the quarter 69% of our customers subscribed to at least two products and 37% subscribed to three products, compared to 36% at the end of last year\u2019s second quarter. ","Moving on to the individual products, as Brian mentioned, video delivered great results. We improved video net losses by $75,000 year-over-year to $69,000. This impressive performance was driven by better customer retention as we focused on improving the customer experience and delivering innovative products. The investment we have made in our cloud-based X1 platform is paying off as the positive customer benefits make their way into a larger portion of the base.","Our X1 net additions continued to accelerate this quarter, increasing more than 10% from the first quarter and up nearly 35% compared to last year. X1 accounted for about 50% of our second quarter video connects and X1 customers now represent nearly a third of our total triple play customers. Our high speed data service continues to gain share as we differentiate our product through speed upgrades and the deployment of wireless gateways. Not only do these gateways provide our customers with the fastest in home Wi-Fi they are also fueling our impressive growth in Wi-Fi hotspots, which now number more than 10 million. We added 180,000 new data customers in the second quarter and 587,000 customers year-to-date, which matches last year\u2019s first half total.","In addition voice remains a valuable component of the bundle, as our voice customer base grew by 49,000 in the second quarter. This slowdown in voice net additions primarily reflects our focus on double play this year compared to prior year results that had stronger triple play additions.","As we look at our revenue categories video revenue increased 3.7% reflecting an increasing number of customers taking advance services and modest rate adjustments, as well as an increase in pay per view revenue due to the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight in the quarter. High speed internet revenue increased 10% in the quarter making it again the leading contributor to cable revenue growth driven by continued growth in our customer base, rate adjustments and an increasing number of customers taking higher speed services. At the end of the quarter 69% of our residential high speed Internet customers received speeds of 50 megabits per second or greater.","Voice revenue declined by 2.1% in the second quarter, as growth in our customer base was offset by a modest decline in ARPU. Our business services division continued to help fuel cable growth this quarter, with revenue increasing 20.4% to $1.2 billion. Our performance in the small end of the market continues to be especially strong with growth driven by an expanding customer base and rate adjustments. At the same time the contribution from mid-sized businesses continues to increase. There is a tremendous opportunity for growth in this segment as we have captured only a 25% share of the small end of the market and less than 10% of the mid-sized segment. Cable Advertising revenue decreased 0.9% during the second quarter, reflecting lower political revenue. Excluding political our core cable advertising revenue increased 2.5%. ","Now let\u2019s turn to slide six. Second quarter cable communications operating cash flow increased 5.1% to $4.8 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.9% compared to 41.4% in the second quarter of 2014 primarily driven by higher programming cost, additional expenses related to the deployment of X1 to our customers and the investments we are making to improve the customer experience. ","Second quarter program expenses increased 9.6% reflecting higher sports programming cost and increases in retransmission consent fees as well as an impact from the pay per view fight in the quarter. Excluding the impact of pay per view fights in both years our programming expense growth would have been approximately a 150 basis points lower. We continue to expect program expense growth for the full year 2015 to grow at a similar level to 2014\u2019s growth of about 8%. ","Technical and product support expenses increased 6% in the second quarter, as we continue to accelerate the deployment of the X1 platform and invest in the customer experience. As Brian said earlier in the call we are committed to transforming the customer experience and it is our number one priority this year. As a result this means we will incur modestly higher expenses as we\u2019re hiring additional technicians and service personnel, strengthening our dispatch teams and operations and investing in training, tools and technology, including a new cloud-based customer platform that gives our employees a better view of our customer accounts so they serve them better and faster. ","We\u2019re already starting to see these additional investments pay-off as the metrics we use to evaluate our service levels are all improving. Things like our on-time metric, how quickly we answer calls, how successful we are in on-boarding new customers, all have shown real improvement. We firmly believe that these investments in the customer experience will pay-off for us overtime as we do a better job maintaining and deepening our customer relationships. Overall Cable\u2019s second quarter and year-to-date results prove that we are executing well and competing effectively, with innovative products and services that provide a great value to our customers. We are focused on improving the customer experience, having best-in-class products and continuing to deliver strong financial and customer results. ","Now let\u2019s move on to NBCUniversal\u2019s results, which are presented on slide seven. NBCUniversal delivered strong results in the second quarter, as revenue increased 20.2% and operating cash flow increased 19.4%. Cable networks generated revenue of $2.5 billion in the second quarter, a decrease of 1% driven by a 26% decline in content licensing and other revenue and a 3% decline in advertising revenue, that was partially offset by a 5.6% increase in distribution revenue. Cable networks operating cash flow declined 4.6% to $872 million in the second quarter, reflecting lower revenue and modest increases in operating and administrative expenses. ","With regards to our Broadcast Television segment, revenue was essentially flat at $1.8 billion in the second quarter, as a 7% decline in content licensing revenue was offset by increased retransmission consent fees and a slight increase in advertising revenue. Stable revenue and a modest increase in operating cost in the second quarter led operating cash flow to decline 3.7% to $231 million. ","Moving to filmed entertainment second quarter revenue nearly doubled to $2.3 billion driven by higher theatrical revenue from the strong performances of Furious 7 and Jurassic World, which both saw tremendous success at the box office. As Brian said earlier these were two of the biggest films in Universal\u2019s history, so we had an exceptionally strong quarter. Second quarter operating cash flow increased $227 million to $422 million, driven by the significant revenue increase, partially offset by an increase in the amortization of film costs and higher advertising marketing and promotion expense to support the larger film slate. ","The momentum at our Theme Parks continued this quarter, as revenue increased 25.7% to $773 million, and operating cash flow grew 44.9% to $354 million, reflecting strong attendance and per capita spending, driven by the continued success of Harry Potter Diagon Alley in Orlando which opened in July of last year. This new attraction has been a real success since its opening, driving double-digit increases in park-to-park ticket sales record attendance levels and per capita spending. ","While we believe the momentum at Harry Potter will continue the growth rates will likely slow as we have now passed the anniversary of the Diagon Alley opening. In Hollywood, Fast and Furious SuperCharge opened strong on June 25th with double-digit attendance growth ever since. ","Let's move to slide eight to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. Consolidated capital expenditures continue to track our investment plan and increased 9.6% to $2 billion compared to second quarter of 2014 driven by increased investments at cable. At cable communications, second quarter capital expenditures increased to $183 million or 12.3% to $1.7 billion, equal to 14.3% of cable revenue versus 13.5% in the second quarter of 2014. The increase was primarily driven by higher spending on CPE to support the aggressive deployment of our X1 platform and wireless gateways, our continued investment in network infrastructure to increase network capacity, additional investment as we continue our cloud-based initiatives as well as our expansion in business services. ","Year-to-date cable communications capital expenditures have increased 18.3% to $3.1 billion, representing 13.5% of cable revenue. We continue to expect that for the full year of 2015, our cable capital intensity will be approximately 14.5% of cable revenue, compared to 13.9% in 2014. We are focused on investing in the business where we think there are attractive financial and strategic returns. All of these initiatives are great examples of this growth oriented investment strategy and X1 is no exception. We continue to be very pleased with the results of X1 and its success underscores our confidence in accelerating the rollout. We have accelerated our X1 net additions quarter-after-quarter and the positive customer results have continued. More customers are subscribing to DBRs and additional outlets, increasing video-on-demand usage and we continue to see reduced churn levels among these customers. ","Second quarter capital expenditures at NBCU decreased 8.5% to $272 million, primarily reflecting decreased investments in facilities, partially offset by higher spending at Theme Parks, as we build new attractions including Harry Potter in Hollywood and King Kong in Orlando. As we mentioned at the beginning of the year we expect that NBCUniversal's 2015 capital expenditures will remain relatively stable at 2014's level with over half directed to our Theme Park segment as the investments we are making in our parks are clearly generating strong returns as they drive increase attendance and per capital spending. ","Turning to slide nine, as I mentioned earlier we generated consolidated free cash flow of $1.5 billion in the second quarter, an increase of 30%. For the first half of the year we generated $4.7 billion in free cash flow, an increase of 17.7% over the first half of 2014. The increases for both the quarter and the year-to-date results reflect growth in consolidated operating cash flow and improvements in working capital, that were partially offset by higher capital expenditures and cash taxes. ","In the second quarter we returned $2.2 billion of capital to our shareholders, an increase of 65.8% compared to the second quarter of 2014, including share repurchases totaling $1.6 billion and dividend payments totaling $628 million. In the first six months of 2015 we've returned $4.8 billion of capital to shareholders, representing an increase of 84.5% compared to last year, including share repurchases totaling $3.6 billion and dividend payments totaling $1.2 billion. Recapping our return of capital plans for 2015 we plan to buyback $6.75 billion of our shares, which includes the original $4.25 billion we announced at the beginning of the year, plus the additional $2.5 billion announced with our first quarter earnings release. As we hit at that point, this should place us at roughly two times leverage at year end. And as always we will discuss next year's return of capital plans when we release fourth quarter earnings after the process of reviewing our business plans is complete. ","My priorities are to make sure our businesses are being fed the capital they need for strong and profitable growth and to make sure that we have strategic flexibility from a financial perspective and to prudently maximize our return of cash to shareholders. Overall we have had a really strong first half of year in both cable and NBCUniversal. We are pleased with the financial and operational progress we've made in all of our businesses and we are focused on continuing that momentum throughout the year. ","We believed that our disciplined investments, along with our focus on execution will continue to generate healthy growth and yield positive results. Before I turn in the call over to Jason for Q&A I would like to say how great it is to be here. Comcast is a fantastic company with a portfolio of leading businesses, that have tremendous opportunities ahead. Brian, Steve, Neil and David are a great leadership team and in my short time here I have found that all levels of this company are filled with smart energetic people with high integrity. I'm very happy to be part of this team. Over to you, Jason.","Jason Armstrong ","Thanks, Mike. We will now move to our question-and-answers. I'll remind you Brian, Mike, Michael and Steve are in the room with us today and Neil is traveling, but he has dialed in and available for questions. So with that Brent we'll turn it over for you to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ben Swinburne","Thanks and good morning. I have two questions. Neil, can you give us a little more insight into the churn trends the customer adds this quarter, were really strong I can't remember the last time you guys added customers in the second quarter. So when you look at the voluntary and voluntary look at the investments you are making in customer service. Can you just help us to think about what's drive in the churn down and what's the opportunity is from here to take that down further, and I'll just give Steve my question which is, there has been some press coverage on your upfront, I wonder if you could give us some details on how the upfront went from your perspective across your property? Thanks.","Neil Smit","Hi, Ben, it\u2019s Neil. I think the churn has been a key driver of Q2 results. But over the last year and half the churn numbers improved every month year-over-year and part of it is driven by the S1 deployment where we're seeing about 30% less voluntary churn. Part of it is driven by the fact that we're getting a higher percentage of our customer\u2019s on contract. It's more than double year-over-year and I think we're getting better quality customers and retaining them longer is the real story. ","How far can that go remains to be seen. We're going to keep on driving our X1, we are targeting our segments better, we're doing better on non-pay disconnect, we are just I think managing the customer relationship more effectively and I think because all the work we're putting into customer experience is paying off. It's each initiative is kind of additive and it's really effecting the churn number over time.","Stephen B. Burke ","In terms of the upfront I think we had a great upfront because it was a challenging time for the industry and we ended up with our volume up. We gained share. We talked a lot about the monetization gap. We closed some more of the monetization gap for really the second time in a row and despite the fact that I think overall industry volume was down ours was up and our CPM's were right at the top for both NBC and the big cable networks. So we feel very pleased and part of it is because of the way we manage our advertising business, Linda Yaccarino has responsibility for all advertising, every single one of our channels and we have around 20% of viewership. ","So that gives us a tremendous portfolio approach to the market and allows us to outperform and hopefully we'll continue to do that.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you both.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John Hodulik","Maybe another question for Neil. I mean, Neil does the lower churn you are seeing in video and all the runway you still have with the X1 deployment, does that give you sort of better visibility and a return to sub growth in terms of on the video side and then looks like a lot of the growth is coming more from double play that it has from triple-play in the past, has there been a change in marketing or your approach to focus more on doubles than triples? Thanks.","Neil Smit","Well, our goal is always to improve year-over-year customer metrics which we done for the last four years in a row on the video side. I think the churn and the X1 deployment does give me optimism that we can continue to improve the voluntary churn number. I think going forward we're going to continue to drive out X1 at an accelerated rate. It does impact CapEx and the second part to your question, John was what?","John Hodulik","Was about the double plays versus triple plays. It looks like more of the growth is coming from double plays and I was just wondering if there was a change in your approach from a marketing standpoint?","Neil Smit","On that, I think this quarter we did shift to more double plays and triple plays, I think that unaffected phone. If you look at Broadband for the first half of the year it\u2019s right on what we did in the first half of last year. So we don\u2019t think there\u2019s any big macro change in our approach but each quarter can vary a little bit. I would just add on the churn point, I also am excited by the innovation roadmap that we have around X1, around the customer experience, around the stream product, around the EA games and more things in the labs. So I think we\u2019re -- each quarter it gets a little better and we\u2019re pleased that this was the best second quarter in video in nine years. ","John Hodulik","Okay, thanks Brian. ","Jason Armstrong","Thanks John, next question please. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead ","Jessica Reif Cohen ","Thank you. I have two questions but I -- questions -- one is for Brian, condolences to you and your family on the passing of Ralph Roberts, Comcast Founder and obviously your father. Ralph was such an amazing person and a great leader and for Mike, nothing but good luck, hopefully you\u2019ll be a very important part of the company and the company\u2019s initiative. But anyway on the question, so one for Cable, one for NBCUniversal. For Cable with the rejuvenated focus on customer service and the customer experience, it just seems so much different than the past. I'm just -- can you say how your vision has changed and how do you judge the effectiveness, you mentioned churn, is there anything else we should look for and over what period of time? ","And for NBCUniversal, I obviously fulfillment part is just amazing, I don\u2019t even know what adjective to use, but as an outsider it seems like Parks just seems too obvious that there\u2019s a long runway. So maybe you can just review some of the attractions and hotel plans that you have in film, is there anything that you\u2019re doing differently how will this perform if you look at it from now?","Brian L. Roberts","So, let me Neil feel free to weigh in but I\u2019ll take it -- let me say first of all thank you Jessica for the kind words. So the Cable customer experience is a mind shift, a cultural shift. It is quite sincere. We\u2019ve talked about it over the years why now. I think the opportunity to focus on it more, the technology can be your friend and self-help and using apps and like the TechTracker and being able to self-diagnose, reset your modems and things that we have on the runway, we\u2019re very pleased with the team we were building around that and we\u2019re taking that innovation culture which really kicked in using the cloud for X1, and we\u2019re going to try and to do the same thing around the customer experience. I think it starts with all employees, we\u2019re retraining all employees, starting with myself and right on through the entire company, where we\u2019re experiencing the opportunity to re-look at everything from the customer\u2019s, not from the company\u2019s perspective. ","We\u2019re using all sorts of new incentives. So I think you should be paying attention to churn. I think you should be paying attention to the quality of the customer. The customer lifetime value is a big area that we\u2019re focused on and we are excited by X1 and we\u2019re excited by accelerating that into the future. We\u2019re up to 30,000 a day, as I mentioned. That\u2019s a lot but we think we can do even more and then the customer has that much better remote control, the voice remote is getting rave reviews from people who use it. We\u2019re putting 6 million of those out this year, Wi-Fi, it\u2019s the whole experience. So I don\u2019t want to go on too long. Steve, about Theme Parks and film?","Stephen B. Burke","So obviously the headline from the NBCUniversal side of the company of the quarter was film but in many ways Theme Parks had as good or even better quarter than the film business. So our total operating cash flow for Theme Parks grew about 45% which I\u2019ve never seen. I mean that\u2019s just a huge-huge number for a business this size. Five years ago we made about $400 million in the Theme Park business. We probably added a $1 billion to that. This year\u2019s results are probably over a $1 billion higher than that 400 million. The year is not over but the way we\u2019re tracking and we see this as a major growth driver for the company for five, 10, 15, 20 years. ","We're basically adding more attractions than we had historically added. We just did a year ago we did Harry Potter 2 Diagon Alley in Orlando, which has fueled a lot of the growth there. We have Harry Potter coming to Hollywood next spring, which I think is going to be a tremendous sea change, about how people think about that park in the Los Angeles market. ","So basically on both coasts about one major new attraction a year. We have King Kong coming next year in Florida which is a fantastic creatively a fantastic attraction. We have a big water park coming in 2017. So you will see us on both coasts continue to add. And then we're also adding to our hotel stock. We looked in Florida, when we first got here and we had 2,400 hotel rooms. We did a study as to how many hotel rooms we should have given the strategic importance of keeping people onsite to increase length of stay. At the time we had 2,400 hotels and the study said we could easily digest 10,000.","So we've added a couple thousand hotel rooms. We're going to be adding hotels rooms next year and what's happening is we're seeing the combination of better attractions which give people a reason to come and then when they come more hotel rooms which keep people longer. And that kind of attraction is embedded in that kind of growth rate you're seeing. Orlando grew 21% in terms of attendance during the quarter, which is just a phenomenal results and Tom Williams, who runs our theme park business is fantastic, Mark Woodbury is in charge of the creative side of that businesses is doing great things and we haven\u2019t even talked about China or other parts of the world where we are also very excited about the growth opportunity. ","So theme parks when you think of NBCUniversal saw 20% to 25% of our operating cash flow but it's a great global business and we think there's lots of green lights as you look down the highway.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks Jessica. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Craig Moffett","Yes, hi. First Brian let me reiterate what Jessica said, condolences on the passing of your father but also I think it is great to celebrate just what a spectacular thing he\u2019s left behind and how many people he touched and so it's nice to remember him. I wanted to ask Neil a question about fiber. AT&T has now made some commitments to significantly expand their footprint. I think you talked about your gigabit pro. Can you talk about how you think about fiber to the home and your Gigabit Pro service versus DOCSIS 3.1 and how the competitive market will shape your thinking in the architecture that you use?","Neil Smit","Well, I think we've completed with both AT&T and Direct for a number of years. We feel very good about our broadband network and then as Brian mentioned in his comments we will be rolling out for market trial DOCSIS 3.1 in Q4. We continue to pull fiber deeper as we roll out our business services network and that strengthens the residential network as well. I think we will be ready to complete our fiber, as we think about new households, we pull fiber directly to the new households, we are in the beginning of the development and we're also pulling fiber to the premise in some of the large MDU complexes. So we feel good about our network going forward, we continue to increase Steve, I think we're -- as we mentioned the numbers were year-to-date the same as the numbers last year and which will get about our ongoing\u2026","Craig Moffett","Do you think that your DOCSIS 3.1, I think the industry has talked about Gigabit per second speeds being attainable with DOCSIS 3.1. Is your latest view that is likely to be the case or is that probably or is that potentially too high an expectation?","Brian L. Roberts","I think let me jump in, if I might. Again thank you for the nice comments but I think we have a superior product. When you take the totality of our triple play offerings but a lot of that is broadband, Wi-Fi, the infotainment [ph] Wi-Fi and it\u2019s important that we continue to have a great network and have superior products, that is core what we\u2019re about. And DOCSIS 3.1 combined with -- we\u2019ve now fully encrypted the entire company. So we keep reclaiming bandwidth, we apply it to broadband, we split nodes, we pull fiber deeper, we use DOCSIS 3.1 which will be a quantum leap forward, we believe not just linear and allow you to go to the kind of speeds you\u2019re talking about. In fact as you know we have a two gigabit product that we\u2019re using as our business services, our residential kind of converge in terms of where these fibers go.","So this is top of mind. We think we have an exciting roadmap. It doesn\u2019t require us to go out and rebuild things, but to continually improve things. We\u2019ve increased speeds 13 times and we envision doing that, we hope into the future and remaining in a very, very strong position. But it\u2019s a competitive market, as we\u2019ve always said and we\u2019re learning to compete better all the time and we\u2019re very prepared to compete into the future.","Craig Moffett","Thanks Brian.","Jason Armstrong","Next question please.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Phil Cusick","Hi, guys. Thanks. Brian I wonder if you could expand on the stream products and how that\u2019s going to fit into the business. And you\u2019ve talked about churn a couple of times, as you\u2019ve seen churn in the business, has there been any change in the number of people who are leaving for economic versus competitive reasons, and is there any indication that they\u2019re leaving for the over the top competitive products out there? Thanks.","Brian L. Roberts","Look there\u2019s a little of everything in the real world, and we\u2019re dealing in millions of units every quarter. So but I think we\u2019re encouraged as Neil said by these results and by not just this quarter but by several years where we\u2019ve had improving results. The stream product is extension of a couple of things. One we have a college product, university product that we\u2019re very excited about and is doing well, that it\u2019s attracting to younger consumers. We have a broadband product as I just got finished saying that we\u2019re extremely proud of and excited by -- have more broadband customers than we do video customers, and what can we do with the mind shift of selling people broadband and then introducing them to video, whether there are university student or someone that wants a different kind of product and maybe not even set-top box but a way to get started with all their mobile devices. ","And so I think it\u2019s we\u2019re doing couple of markets this year, it\u2019s not going to be something you\u2019re going to see meaningful results from in the near future, but it\u2019s very exciting to be able to have a range of products and then to have a platform to upsell consumers from, which we\u2019ve had great results doing this with our Internet plugs and other examples where, when you have that relationship with the consumer. And another thing that our technical teams are excited about and our customer experience team, is this product\u2019s going to kind of just work. You just got to turn on your device and boom, you\u2019re going to be receiving the video, the authentication, all the things we\u2019ve been talking about and customers -- and we get to chance to start new from a mobile device is going to work faster and easier to introduce people to a relationship with us. ","So we\u2019re using it also to drive some of those improvements on just the onboarding experience and then the ability to upsell in a seamless, frictionless way. So lot of reasons to like the product and it\u2019s a part of the whole play of just having a range of offerings which is very, very different mindset then where we were several years ago.","Neil Smit","Yeah. I\u2019ll just add Brian that this is a great example of how our cloud-based technology is enabling us to innovate at a faster pace and target-specific segments such as you mentioned.","Phil Cusick","Thanks guys.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks Phil. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jain [ph] with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst ","Thanks. I\u2019ve two questions. First for Mike Cavanagh, obviously you\u2019ve only been there two months. If you can give us any thoughts about, if there any differences in your philosophical view on capital allocation and the like, a very broad question, if there is any change you think that could be incorporated? And then for Neil, you have a bunch of trials going on, on usage based pricing down south, any color on how that\u2019s working, is that something that we can expect to be introduced across the footprint anytime soon, thank you. ","Michael J. Cavanagh","Thanks Vijay, it's Mike. So it's early days as you said, but we will end the year two times leverage. And I think just observations would be that that puts us in a place consistent with what I commented on earlier, want to some financial flexibility in the balance sheet. We'll return $6.75 billion of capital this year through dividends and share buyback, consistent -- both of those numbers consistent with what we said last. And as this company has always done it's been my experience you've got to spend time focused on business plans and what's coming next which we will do over the coming months that will put me in a good position to have a perspective when we come back in the early part of the next year and talk about what we'll do next year and beyond. ","But to share some views anyway, I think it's always been and this team in my personal view is that highest priority is to make sure we're giving our businesses all the capital they need to win in the marketplace and grow their businesses, albeit do that profitably. So we'll be very focused on that and that's job number one. Beyond that we'll love to return capital to shareholders as we are doing and have done. And we're going to want to maintain flexibility in the balance sheet to be able to continue making those investments and driving the business the way we want to through economic cycles, through whatever headwinds might come along and maintain some other flexibility to do smart things for the shareholders. ","Brian L. Roberts","Vijay, concerning the usage-based pricing trials, we actually we do have a few trials going on in different markets. The responses have been neutral to slightly positive. We don't have any plans on expanding that to other market\/bases anytime too. ","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thank you. ","Jason Armstrong","Thanks Vijay. Next question please. ","Operator","Next question comes from line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","Brett Feldman","Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned earlier some of the investments you're making in customer experience and how that's already starting to payoff and also sounds like you continue to plan on investing in those areas. If you could just help us out from thinking about it from margin standpoint. How much longer do you expect some of these spending initiatives to continue? And then as we look into '16 and beyond, how we come to know that you are getting g a return on those investments. Is it something we should look for to turn, or add to or some other areas in the performance of cable. Thanks. ","Michael J. Cavanagh","It\u2019s Mike Cavanagh. I mentioned X1 broadband capacity and gateways business services and customer experience. The customer experience investments is generally a lag times between when we make the investment and when we see the returns. But we are measuring the return on each of our initiatives, a few success points on getting it right the first time. The percent of the customers who are calling and speaking to agents is down 15%. So we're getting things right the first time. ","And the customers are getting the repeat tech [ph] business within 30 days are down 9%. So our waiting times are down and we're getting it right. It's resulted in a real improvement in customer satisfaction. So we will -- we test each of these investments, we have a test market up in Portland Oregon where we test the initiatives before we extend on a widespread basis. And I think we'll continue to invest and I think we'll continue to see returns. And at the end of the day the right thing to do, we're going to compete on both our products and our service and we want to get our service to be our best product areas. ","Michael J. Angelakis","Yeah and it's Mike. I'll just jump in. You'll see year-to-date our cable margin at 40.2% is up 20 basis points from a year ago and given all that we're all -- stable again to last year. And that's something that's we're proud that we're getting all these things done and maintaining that stability of margins. But view obviously on it's hard to parse, it's all in the numbers. The improvement in service and the quality of the product I think it's all part of which is driving churn and driving lifetime value at customer side. ","Brett Feldman","Great, thank you. ","Jason Armstrong","Thanks, Brett. Operator, next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. ","Marci Ryvicker","Thanks, I have two questions. The first, your stream product it looks like it's one of the only one actually including live broadcast. Just curious if you're talking to the stations and if so, how those negotiations are going. And then secondly, when we look at the numbers your Q2 video, so much better, your voice I think less than expected. We've always thought that the more products you sell the stickier the subs, that you're focusing a little bit more on double play. How do you know that your subs today are sticky as your subs have been?","Neil Smit","Marci, it's Neil. On the stream product we didn't have to pay any additional programming rights for this product, stream\u2019s a title six service that's delivered to you, that customer\u2019s [indiscernible] enabled gateway and it's covered under our existing contracts. It's not an OTC service. Concerning the voice number, we did focus a little bit more on double-play this quarter which also reduced the churn. But it's always a blend of what's the right offer is for the right customer base at any time and kind of as Mike mentioned our double-play customers grew to 69% and our triple-play are also up to 37%. So we are increasing both. It's just a matter of balancing the mix.","Marci Ryvicker","Thank you.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks, Marci. We are almost up on an hour here. So we'll take this last question.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Kannan Venkateshwar","Thank you. Just a couple of questions. The first is your -- I think the deal between Comcast and NBC on the return [ph] side comes up next year. Just wanted to figure out how you guys are thinking about it and within the organization how that kind of negotiation happens. And secondly on the stream product given the fact that it's not really an OTP product, is there any implication on the clauses that you guys have with the programmers in general? Thanks.","Brian L. Roberts","Neil, I think I can take that, maybe finish the call. Feel free to jump in if I don't cover it. I don't think that your facts are right on the NBC Comcast timing. But we're not going to go into more detail than that. But I can say that one of the things that\u2019s worked really well is how well the company is working together and that's one of the points that I want to end on which is this combined portfolio of incredible companies, first half of the year and the second quarter we couldn't be more pleased, really broad-based results and as we talked a lot about NBCUniversal, but also within cable broadband video results, just really pleased with the start to the year. ","I think our innovation in products including stream, but also being able to say that we nearly doubled, now the cash flow with NBCUniversal since the acquisition in 2009 is a terrific achievement and we believe we can lead innovation in the cable industry and do well by content companies and help both work together and that's what we're doing. We're shifting our focus to addition innovation to real focus on the service customer experience, that's going to take years. One of my comments is some of the questions that got asked would be this is going to take a long time to see some of the results but we are going to stay the course. ","And I think we feel that the transition with our Chief Financial Officers has gone extremely well and we didn't miss a beat here and we're exciting by Michael's new venture and building value for our shareholder through creative opportunities. But there are priorities to continue to find profitable growth, return capital to shareholder and to keep the company in a strong position in a sustainable way, that has -- we've been doing since Ralph started the company 51 years ago. So thank you all for your support and we'll see in the third quarter.","A - Jason Armstrong","Thanks, Brian, thanks everyone for joining us. Brent, back to you.","Operator","Thank you.

Please refer to our 8-K for the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.","With that, let me turn the call to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian?","Brian L. Roberts - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jason and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. 2015 was a terrific year for Comcast NBCUniversal, and I couldn't be more pleased with the strong operational performance and financial results that we delivered both for the fourth quarter and for the full year.","Honestly, 2015 was not without its challenges. But instead of letting those challenges become real distractions, our company pivoted and executed extremely well, particularly in the second half of the year. I'm so proud of our resilience and leadership team for creating the momentum that is now driving us forward in 2016.","Neil Smit and Dave Watson and everyone at Comcast Cable is heroic in my mind, for not only staying focused, but generating the best yearly video subscriber results that we've had in nine years and the best broadband subscriber results that we've had in eight years.","We ended on a high note as our fourth quarter video net additions were our strongest quarterly results since the first quarter of 2007. At the same time, we expertly balanced these great customer metrics with solid financial performance. At NBCUniversal, Steve and his team exceeded expectations once again. We set new box office records, achieved number one ratings in Broadcast from morning to primetime, to late-night. Continued the outstanding progress in our Theme Parks and sustained healthy profits at Cable Networks.","Altogether, Comcast NBCUniversal made incredible strategic operational and financial progress in 2015 and did this through a collaborative culture where our businesses are focused on strengthening themselves and each other.","Overall, we grew revenue 8.3% in 2015 and operating cash flow by 7.7%. We generated close to $9 billion in free cash flow and increased cash return to shareholders by over 40%.","After reviewing our performance and outlook with our board, we are announcing today our decision to raise our dividend by 10% marking the eighth consecutive annual increase. We've also increased our stock repurchase authorization to $10 billion and we expect to repurchase $5 billion of stock in 2016.","Comcast NBCUniversal is indeed a special company. This is a time of exciting change in media and technology, and we are uniquely positioned. We have a diversified portfolio of businesses working well together and the best suite of products, content and experiences that we've ever had.","So with that, let me talk about some of our specific achievements in 2015 and a few of the things that we're looking forward to in 2016 and beyond.","Starting with NBCUniversal, we've now fully doubled the operating cash flow since we announced the acquisition in 2009. In our TV business, we maintained our number one ranking in broadcast primetime and saw continued success in The Voice and Blacklist, paired nicely with some new breakout hits, including Blindspot.","In addition, we build on the strength of our Chicago franchise with our new show, Chicago Med. Sunday Night Football remained TV's number one primetime show for the fifth year, grew viewership by 6% and completed the highest-rated season in its history. And as I mentioned, we exit 2015 with strength across all parts of the day with the Today Show, Nightly News and Late Night all number one in their respective categories.","NBC Sports Network had its most-watched year ever driven by NASCAR's debut and the continued growth of English Premier League and NHL. USA's Mr. Robot just won the Global Globe and the Critic's Choice Award for the best drama on television, a terrific accomplishment. Congratulations to Bonnie Hammer and her team.","Film had the best year in its history. Jurassic World, Furious 7, Minions and Fifty Shades of Grey, along with other titles, were hugely successful. With $6 billion in worldwide box office receipts, two-thirds of which was international, and a strong and growing list of franchises, Universal Pictures is in a great position for ongoing success.","And finally, Theme Parks had another outstanding year. We again grew revenues and operating cash flow double digits through our proven formula of new attractions complemented by additional hotel room capacity. From Harry Potter, to Transformers and Fast & Furious, our team at Universal Parks and Resorts has been on a fantastic run and there's plenty of growth on the horizon with our recent acquisition of a 51% stake in the park in Osaka, Japan, a new Harry Potter attraction opening in Hollywood, a new water park being built in Orlando, a brand new park being designed for Beijing and our focus on increasing hotel room capacity.","At Cable, I feel we stand out in the industry, delivering a healthy balance between solid improvements in subscriber metrics, coupled with very strong financial performance.","In 2015, we added 666,000 customer relationship and that's a 86% improvement versus last year. And at the same time we increased revenue per customer relationship a healthy 4.2% and grew operating cash flow 5.6%.","In 2015, we made improving customer service our main focus. I'm really pleased that as we sit here today, we are seeing great progress. In fact, we achieved significant improvements across the key metrics we use to track customer satisfaction, with some of our best customer metrics in years. We are going after each of the areas that have the most impact on the customers' experience. In 2015, we also continued to take our new products to scale. Our voice remote is the latest example, with 4 million activated since our launch just eight months ago. The result of these investments are showing up in our subscriber trends where we're seeing notable improvements, particularly in reduced churn across all product categories.","Business Services, under Bill Stemper, has now exceeded a $5 billion revenue run rate while maintaining a growth of 20%, which is remarkable. We recently launched into the enterprise segment and have some good early traction in this market to go along with the robust share gains in small and medium-size businesses. Overall, our progress during 2015 sets up incredibly well to be successful in 2016 and beyond.","In cable, we are aligned around a few critical top priorities. The first is to continue our progress in transforming the customer experience, and as we've seen, our customers are responding to our efforts in a resounding way and we will keep pushing hard.","Second, we will focus on driving share growth through even better products, faster speeds and additional customer segmentation. Finally, technology leadership will remain at the forefront as we enhance X1 and drive it deeper into our customer base, roll out DOCSIS 3.1 to deliver gigabit speeds at scale and to continue to develop solutions for more targeted advertising.","At NBCUniversal, we feel great about our position and the range of opportunities ahead of us. We are proud to bring the 2016 Olympics in Rio to the American people, delivering the most comprehensive and technologically advanced Olympics in history.","We are also excited to open a new Harry Potter attraction in Hollywood, add The Secret Life of Pets to Illumination's growing list of animated films, and this week's exciting announcement that NBC will now be the home to five Thursday Night NFL games.","We continue to be entrepreneurial and look for ways to invest and grow. Like our investments in Vox and BuzzFeed, and our partnership with the Tower's (10:00) Michael Angelakis new venture, which recently launched with a talented team who are scouring the globe for smart investments.","So on a final note, I am excited about all the opportunities that lie ahead, and believe we will approach them with the same level of operational excellence and financial discipline that has served us so well for more than five decades.","Mike, over to you.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Senior EVP","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everybody. Since Brian covered the terrific full year results, let's go straight to the fourth quarter on slide five. Adjusted revenue for the fourth quarter increased 7.6% and operating cash flow increased 4%.","As a reminder, the adjustments this quarter primarily reflect the exclusion of the partial quarter results of our acquisition of Universal Studios Japan. The overall growth in operating cash flow was primarily driven by high-speed data, video and business services at Cable, and film and parks at NBCUniversal, which we'll go into in greater detail on the slides to come.","Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.81, a 5.2% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. And free cash flow during the quarter decreased 6.3% to $1.6 billion, and free cash flow per share of $0.64 declined 1.5%, reflecting growth in operating cash flow and lower cash taxes, offset by higher capital expenditures and increased working capital.","For the full year, we generated $8.9 billion of free cash flow, a 9.4% increase over last year's results, and free cash flow per share of $3.55, a 13.8% increase.","Now let's review the results of our businesses in more detail, starting with Cable Communications on slide six. Cable Communications delivered a solid fourth quarter. Revenues increased 5.9% to $12 billion, as we added 281,000 customer relationships, a 58% improvement compared to last year's fourth quarter ,driven by growth in our two product and three product customers, and reduction in churn across all products, with video and high-speed data each improving churn for 23 consecutive months.","Total revenue per customer relationship reached $145 per month, a 3.5% increase that reflects the successful execution of our strategy that is focused on retaining customers, growing customer relationships, and driving our value-added bundling strategy.","Taking a closer look at our video business, fourth quarter revenue increased 4.4%, reflecting rate adjustments and higher take rates of advanced services. We ended the year with very strong video customer growth, adding 89,000 customers in the fourth quarter. This is our best quarterly result in eight years, driven primarily by another quarter of improved churn. Our churn results reflect improved customer support, better market segmentation, and customer recognition of what we believe is the best video product on the market.","We continue to make great progress rolling out X1 to new and existing customers, adding 1.1 million customers in the quarter, a 73% increase compared to last year. X1 customers now represent about 30% of our total video customer base.","In addition, we continue to expand our TV Everywhere and on demand choices. We now have 75,000 shows on demand, 700 full season stacked series, which is up 50% from a year ago, and 98 live streaming channels available outside the home. Lastly, we are doing a better job segmenting the market, providing offers with more choice and appeal to new audiences that address multiple segments of the market. For example, we have increased our penetration of Hispanic households with targeted bicultural products and offers.","The strong momentum in our high-speed data business continued. Revenue increased 9.8% during the quarter, making it again the leading contributor to overall cable revenue growth, driven by an impressive increase in our customer base, as well as rate adjustments and an increasing number of customers taking higher-speed services.","We added 460,000 data customers during the quarter, and 1.4 million during the full year, with 77% of our customers receiving speeds of 50 megabits per second or greater. We have now added over 1 million high-speed data customers for 10 years in a row, and we see significant room for growth ahead.","About 74% of our residential high-speed data customers now have one of our wireless gateways, which are also fueling our impressive growth in Wi-Fi hot spots, that now number more than 13 million.","Voice revenues declined by 1.7% in the fourth quarter, as customer additions were offset by a modest decline in ARPU. In the fourth quarter, we increased net customer additions by 139,000, a 13% increase versus a year ago.","Business Services was once again a large contributor of cable revenue growth, with revenue increasing 18.9% to $1.3 billion. We have three engines of growth in Business Services, each at a different stage of development. Small business, which is healthy market penetration and generates the majority of our revenue. Mid-size business, where our market penetration is still less than 10%, but is growing at a higher rate. And our recently announced enterprise division that targets Fortune 1000 companies and is gaining traction, with more than 20 large enterprise customers and multiple eight figure deals already signed. Business Services has strong positive momentum and continue to represent a large and attractive growth opportunity for the company.","Finally, cable advertising revenue declined 9.3% due to lower political revenue. Excluding political, our core advertising revenue increased 2.8% during the fourth quarter.","Turning to slide seven. Fourth quarter Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 4.6% to $4.9 billion resulting in a margin of 40.9% compared to 41.4% in the fourth-quarter of 2014 driven by higher expenses, primarily related to the investments we are making to improve the customer experience and higher programming costs.","Fourth quarter programming expense growth slowed to 4.7% reflecting the timing of programming renewals, while the full year increased 7.1%. As I said at a recent conference, the rate of programming expense growth will increase in 2016. We expect approximately 10% growth in programming costs for the year driven by several contract renewals beginning in the first quarter, as well as increases in re-transition consent fees and higher sports programming costs.","In negotiating programming deals we continue to value expanded content rights for our on-demand and TV Everywhere platforms. We are adding more content out-of-home rights, stacking rights and back seasons ensuring we have the most compelling and competitive video product on the market.","Non-programming expenses increased 8.1% for the quarter and 6.4% for the year. This growth reflects increased spending to improve the customer experience as we've added technicians and service personnel, strengthened our dispatch teams and operations, and invested in training tools and technology. Metrics including on-time appointments, call pickup time and new customer on-boarding success rates are all trending in the right direction.","Finally, our outlook for 2016 cable operating margin is that it will be flat to down 50 basis points compared to 40.8% in 2015. We expect programming and other expense growth will be offset through modest rate adjustments, growth in high-margin businesses, like high-speed data and Business Services and cost efficiency improvements resulting from our X1 and customer experience initiatives, as well as general cost control efforts.","Now, let's move on to NBCUniversal's results. On Slide eight, you can see NBCUniversal delivered solid results in the fourth quarter as adjusted revenue increased 10.5% and operating cash flow increased 4.7%, driven by strong results at film and theme parks. Cable Networks' revenue increased 3.4% and operating cash flow declined 1.9% to $894 million. Distribution revenue increased 6.8% and was positively impacted by higher affiliate fees associated with NASCAR on our NBC Sports Network during the quarter.","Advertising revenue declined a modest 0.3% as the positive contribution from NASCAR advertising and increased pricing from a strong scatter market were more than offset by ratings declines at some of our networks. The decline in operating cash flow reflects the inclusion of NASCAR rights fees in the quarter that weren't present in last year's fourth quarter.","Broadcast revenue increased 7% and operating cash flow declined 5.6% to $217 million. Advertising revenue increased 7% driven by solid ratings in primetime and strong ratings growth at NFL, Sports and Telemundo, as well as a strong scatter market. This higher demand in the scatter market has continued into the first quarter. Content licensing increased 35%, primarily driven by Straight to SVOD (20:09) series produced by our studios, like Masters of None and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, as well as an increase in production at our international studio.","Last, retransmission revenue increased nearly 40% to $136 million, and totaled $535 million for the full year. We expect retransmission revenue to increase to $800 million in 2016. Total expenses increased 8% driven by the launch of mid-season shows.","Film revenue increased 25.8% and operating cash flow increased 84.6% to $143 million. Home entertainment revenue increased 75% driven by the strong performances of Minions and Jurassic World, partially offset by a 37.5% decline in theatrical revenue and higher operating costs during the quarter.","This was the most profitable year in Universal's history with full-year operating cash flow increasing 74% to $1.2 billion. While our 2016 slate is not as large and will be a difficult comparison to 2015, we are excited about our strategic slate of core franchises, sequels and animated films.","Theme Parks adjusted revenue increased 15.5% and operating cash flow increased 12.3%. Both our Orlando and Hollywood parks delivered higher attendance and healthy per capita spending growth partially fueled by a record Halloween Horror Nights at both parks.","Even more promising, despite having lapped the opening of Harry Potter -Diagon Alley two quarters ago, Orlando continued to deliver healthy growth. In 2016, we look forward to the opening of Harry Potter in Hollywood and delivering on our plans to integrate Universal Studios Japan into our already strong parks portfolio.","Now, let's move to slide nine to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. Consolidated capital expenditures increased 18.6% to $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter, and 14.5% to $8.5 billion for the full year. At Cable Communications, capital expenditures increased 10.2% to $2.1 billion for the fourth quarter, and 14.3% to $7 billion for the year. This growth reflects higher spending on our customer premises equipment, including X1 and wireless gateways, increased investment in network infrastructure to increase network capacity, as well as the continued investment to expand Business Services.","In 2016, we will continue to invest in each of these areas as they are driving positive results in our business. As a result, Cable CapEx, as a percent of Cable revenue, is expected to remain flat to 2015 at approximately 15%.","At NBCUniversal fourth quarter CapEx increased 65.2% to $557 million, and full year increased 13.5% to $1.4 billion. The increased investment at Theme Parks was the primary driver of the quarterly and yearly increases, and in the fourth quarter we acquired land adjacent to one of our theme parks for $130 million.","In 2016 NBCUniversal's capital investment plan is expected to increase approximately 10% reflecting the consolidation of Universal Studios Japan and continued investment in Theme Parks. The investments in our Theme Parks are clearly generating strong returns as they drive increased attendance and per capita spending.","I'll now finish on slide 10 with capital returns. In 2015, we returned $9.2 billion to shareholders, it was composed of $2.4 billion in dividends and $6.75 billion in share repurchases. As you can see on the left side of the slide, Comcast has a great track record of consistently returning capital to shareholders. The compound annual growth rate on our dividend from 2009 to 2015 was 24.4% versus 10% for the S&P 500. Looking ahead, it is a high priority for us to continue this record of great total capital returns. This will be achieved by balancing three elements.","First, the healthy annual return of capital to shareholders which for 2016 is an eighth consecutive annual increase in the dividend to $1.10 per share together with a plan to buy back $5 billion of stock over the course of the year.","The second element to balance is investment in our business to profitably grow the long-term earnings capacity of the company. This includes a significant CapEx investment that I covered on the last slide. It also includes the deployment of capital to enhance our existing businesses through relatively modest business development efforts such as the Vox and BuzzFeed digital investments and the Japan park deal that we did in 2015. And lastly, it includes exploring continuous growth opportunities as we are doing in a variety of ways including through Michael Angelakis new fund.","As we set our capital return plan for the year, we earmarked some capital for the whole basket of these types of situations, but we consider each situation on its own financial merits. And since I know it's on many of your minds, we will be filing to participate in the upcoming forward spectrum auction. But I want to be clear that the $5 billion in planned 2016 buybacks will not be reduced in the event that we acquire some spectrum in the auction.","The third and final element of our balanced capital plan is the very important maintenance of a strong balance sheet to protect the company in times of economic and market stress, and position us to potentially capitalize on opportunities to create value in such times, such as we did with the NBCU transaction.","As we began what has thus far been a very volatile 2016, we are well positioned with our leverage at around two times.","With that, I'm done with the slides. I hope everyone has a good sense for how pleased we are with the fourth quarter and full year 2015 results as well as our momentum as we head into 2016.","Now I will turn it back to Jason to lead the Q&A.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Mike. Brent, let's open up the call for questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi. Good morning, and thanks. So Mike, one quick clarification first, and then a question for Neil. Mike, you just said a moment ago that your share repurchases wouldn't be conditional on participation in the auction. If you participate in the auction but don't find the prices attractive enough, and end up not buying in the auction, would that suggest that you might actually increase your share repurchases?","And then for Neil, you just announced yesterday your first markets for DOCSIS 3.1. I was wondering if you could give us any color on whether you plan to offer that as a standard product or as a premium product going forward, and if you've got anything that you can talk about with respect to how you might price it for consumers?","Michael J. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Senior EVP","Okay, hey Craig, thanks. It's Mike. So, you hit it right on the auction. We just said that we're going to take a paddle on the auction, which means we're going to evaluate, consider and may purchase, but only if we think the price is right after we do our evaluation of what's available. As far as what we do in the buyback, if we don't buy, we'll just wait to see how \u2013 that'll be deep in the year and we'll, if there's a change of view on what we think our capacity is, at that stage we'll come back and update you then.","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","Craig, this is Neil. Concerning DOCSIS 3.1, as you know, we announced five cities yesterday, and we haven't priced the rollout yet. But we \u2013 the great thing about DOCSIS 3.1, it's a very efficient way to deliver gigabit speeds, and we'll be rolling it out on a widespread basis over the course of the next few years.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. Thanks, Neil.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Craig. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Oh, thank you. I guess a couple things. First on the FCC initiative, the set-top box initiative, can you give us your views? I mean, given the importance of the set-top box, not just to rental fees, but also data analytics, how do you see this kind of progressing?","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","Well, I think it's premature to comment on this, since a proposal has not even been seen yet. We believe that, generally speaking, in a dynamic environment that's rapidly changing, technology mandates just don't work very well. But we'll continue to look \u2013 we look forward to seeing the proposal, and we'll work with the Chairman and his office to come up with what's best for the customers and the consumers.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then on the video bundle, your great video numbers and broadband, but the video numbers tell a really different story than what we've seen in the market, post media meltdown, since August. Can you give us your view, from both sides of the company, on how you see the video bundle evolving over the next three years to five years?","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","Well, we feel very good about the video numbers. They're the best in nine years, the best quarter in nine years. I think part of it's X1, which is a real game changer. 60% of our subs got X1, and the net new adds and new connects. We have a great TV Everywhere proposal, where 34% of our customers are using some form of TV Everywhere. And the viewing hours on dot-com and mobile combined are up about 20%, so they're watching more. I think we're segmenting the market better, getting the best customers, and getting them to stay longer. And we're improving the customer experience, we're developing new channel stores, MDUs, the on-campus product, we're segmenting better, so we feel good about the video numbers and the progress.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then I got...","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","Well,...","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sorry.","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","I think churn is the one thing that I would add to that. And all that adds up, with each of the products having a decrease in churn. I don't know, Steve, on the NBCUniversal side, we...","Stephen B. Burke - Chief Executive Officer, NBCUniversal & Senior Executive Vice President","I think if you have great channels with great products, like the Olympics or the NFL or Mr. Robot on USA, your channels are going to stay in the bundle, and it's going to continue to be a very good business for a very long time.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Can I just follow up on what NBC \u2013 the land acquisition? I mean, given the IRRs on theme parks, which are really impressive, can you talk about kind of the usage of the land, and timing?","Stephen B. Burke - Chief Executive Officer, NBCUniversal & Senior Executive Vice President","Well I think it's a little early for that. We just closed on the deal this quarter. We got 475 acres, so we have a lot of land to work with. And we have some ideas, but we don't have firm plans at this point.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","One of the great things about Universal theme parks, and we've seen this now in different geographies, there's a long lead time, a lot of smart planning, understanding what attractions work. But it all starts by having the ability to do that. And so this plan we think is really a wonderful, strategic acquisition and it's long term down the road, I think.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Jessica. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. I have a question back on wireless, and then some maybe housekeeping for Mike. Brian, I don't know if you'd comment, but you're obviously planning to at least participate in the auction. You have a large Wi-Fi footprint out there, you have the MVNO. Can you talk a little bit about where your head is at on wireless broadly? Where is all this headed? Have you figured that out yet? Or is it still very much a dynamic situation?","And Mike, I don't know if you'd help us as we think about that free cash flow number. You said $9 billion for 2015, and we think about that for 2016. I don't know if you want to help us on things like cash taxes, working cap, and maybe the intangibles which are numbers that factor in to how we think about next year or I guess this year? Thank you both.","Brian L. Roberts - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You know, I think you've put your finger on it. We have a lot of assets in the company, and Neil, feel free to join on this answer. But really, all we are doing today is saying, as Mike called it take a paddle at an auction to see if there's an opportunity for the company to be rewarded in that auction with something that we think has strategic value. And in the past, that has proved to be not only a moneymaker but given us more strategic flexibility, and we want to know if that's the case this time. Beyond that I don't think it's any more than that, and it's a free auction if you will to get a paddle and see what the values are, and how much capacity. It's a very complicated auction as you know, it's not clear exactly what's for sale, exactly yet, and all that has to be determined. But you have to make the decision now, and so we're making it.","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","I would just add we are filing to retain the option to participate in the forward auction which we expect to occur sometime in the late spring or early summer. And we have, what we believe are very valuable assets in the mobile space. 28 million customer relationships, 13.3 million hotspots, Wi-Fi hotspots, and so they are assets that we want to leverage, and so we're testing and learning.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Senior EVP","On free cash flow, we covered a little bit the guidance we gave, or the outlook we gave for the momentum we've got in the businesses and CapEx which I hit (34:58). The other parts of free cash flow, we will see some headwinds as we usually do in a Olympics year. It's one of our best properties obviously, and we're going to make money on it, but on a cash basis we will advance funds to the Olympic Committee during the year, so it will be a year-over-year negative on the cash flow side to the tune of maybe $0.5 billion. And the intangible, the software, it follows suit with CapEx and cable.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Ben. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. A couple of quick questions on the video side, maybe for Neil. First of all, it looks like Neil you lost about 35,000 subs, a lot of improvement over last year, at the same time a lot of the drivers, it sound like we are just starting to see that these things come to fruition, there's a lot more run way to go. I mean, is it reasonable to assume that you're going to grow subs next year first of all.","And then second of all, the improvement this quarter came with a nice step up in ARPU as well. So, I don't know, are you finding that given all the value you're adding to the bundle with all the stacking rights and TV Everywhere options, are you finding it easier to get price increases through as people are recognizing the value of the product and it continues to improve? Just trying to get a sense of how we should look at that going forward as well? Thanks.","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","Hi, John. I think I'd look at it through two lenses. One is we have, what we believe is the best product out there in X1, and that's helping to drive ARPU because you're getting more VOD views, 40% more VOD views, you're getting lower churn, you're getting more DVR, 50% more DVR usage, or subs, and you're getting digital outlets. So all that drives ARPU, that's positive. I think, the other things we're doing in the business and segmenting and driving channel performance and bundling effectively and targeting customers is improving the throughput of the subs. And then we're retaining them for longer, and a lot of that is better customer experience, better targeting, better subs and getting them the right package.","We are segmenting with different offers for different customers. On Campus is an example, Internet Plus is an example. Stream is an example of products that we're targeting at a specific segment. So we're giving them the product they want at the right price, and we're retaining, we're servicing them well and retaining them longer.","John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, John. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Also for Neil. Any color you can give us where you are on your trajectory with some of the segmented skinny products, and how much runway do we have there? At least very broadly to your carriage minimums. And second on an IP only product, I know you have a low-end proposition in the market. Some of your peers have talked about rolling that out in the next phase. Is that something you think could be a good strategy going forward? Thanks.","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","Concerning skinny bundles, they are actually a small percentage of our overall video customer base. And we do feel we have room with the programmers and the penetration rates. In the fourth quarter, 75% of our video ads were the higher end packages. So I don't want to overstate the significance of skinny bundles. The stream product we just rolled out in a few markets in Boston and Chicago. It's probably too early to say what it will be, what it will turn into over time. But we feel good about the usage and good about the product. It's a good value proposition for the customer, and we'll continue to roll it out to other markets.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI","Great thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Vijay. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I have a question for Mr. Roberts. Given your past success in M&A, the lean balance sheet that you have, the more muted, maybe, buyback relative to your cash flow, a lot of investors in meetings that we're in put on the radar screen more transformative M&A in wireless and the Internet space, European cable. Do you think that's a misguided notion? Or is that something that investors should think about in terms of the realm of possibilities for the next year?","Brian L. Roberts - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thanks for the broad way you asked the question. And I will give you an answer that I think covers a lot of territory. It's always amazing to us sometimes, almost humorous, but none of this is ever humorous. What we read about ourselves in every possible M&A scenario that gets invented. And in many cases it's literally that, just invented. And we're always trying to remain focused on some core principles.","First of all, really like the company we have right now. And I think we've said that consistently. And nothing has changed in that view. If anything, I think we feel better about our mix of assets NBCUniversal, doubling the cash flow in the five years since we bought it. I think we bought it right, but we've operated it even better. And so I sit there and look at those scenarios and many others that have been suggested and there's nothing we feel we have to do. At the same time, Mike Cavanagh and the team that he's building are always looking to see if there's ways we can grow shareholder value and look for new opportunities as the markets evolve. But sitting here today, our plan of record in 2016 is to execute on a business plan, stay focused, and I don't feel the need that we need to go and change the face of our company. I think we're in a wonderful, unique position at the cross-section of two industries, and we're leading the way in both.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you very much.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Jason. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Earlier when Mike was talking about programming costs for 2016, he noted that one of the reasons why the rate of programming cost is going up is that you're getting more rights, and you talked about examples of that such as stacking. So two follow-up questions on that. The first is, does your expanded rights package in some of these new agreements allow you more flexibility to put together different channel programs? Meaning you're paying a bit more and maybe you could put together skinnier bundles on a broader basis as a result of that. And then in general, how close are you to getting the expanded rights across all of your programming agreements, with the concept of the question being once you get to the point where you feel comfortable with your stacking rights and your TV Everywhere rights and anything else across most of your agreements, is that a point at which the rate of programming costs growth might be a bit slower than what we're going to see this year? Thanks.","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","Well, most of the difference between Q4 and what we're projecting for 2015 is timing of when contracts renew or terminate. So, that's point one. We do feel that we get a wide set of rights, including stacking rights, as you mentioned; in and out of home rights, in some cases; digital rights. So we've increased our rights, and it does give us more flexibility in terms of how we package. Each contract is a little bit different. But as you can see from our different offerings, I mentioned Internet Plus, Stream, Watchable, we're innovating in the packaging area to get customers a package that's appropriate to them, and whether it 's streamed or delivered in a linear fashion, we are getting increasing rights and more flexibility. And we work together with the programmers to define the best value.","Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then just with regards to the second part, do you feel like you've done a lot of that work, or do you think it's something that's going to be ongoing for a period of time?","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","I think, it's going to be ongoing. The think the video marketplace is very dynamic now, there's a lot of competition, and I think the programmers recognize this, and as do the distributors and we work together to \u2013 we trial things all the time and we're working in both the programming packaging space as well as advanced advertising space to deliver more value via more targeted advertising. So it's an ongoing conversation.","Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Brett. Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks for taking my questions. I have two for Steve. Steve, can you just share with us please the strategic thinking on licensing the five Thursday Night Football games, and how that NFL contract will work its way into the NBCU financials this year? And then secondly, the distribution revenue growth at the Cable Networks was 6.8% in the quarter. Just wondering if you could give us kind of breakdown of that number in terms of what was the affiliate rate increase per sub, and then what's the subscriber volume underneath that number? And is that a sustainable type of growth rate going forward into 2016? Thank you.","Stephen B. Burke - Chief Executive Officer, NBCUniversal & Senior Executive Vice President","Let me answer the second question first. We had a slight decline in the number of subscribers that was overmatched by a series of rate increases. It's going to be lumpy quarter-by-quarter and year-by-year on the affiliate side. But, and this is probably on the low end of what you can see the future, but it will be lumpy.","On the NFL, the number one show on television is Sunday Night Football, and is a very, very important part of our business. Football is profitable for us now, and it will be profitable for us after the Thursday Night deal. And the ability to have these 24 football games, which will be 24 of the highest rated nights of the year is very, very valuable for a marketer that wants to reach a broad audience. In fact getting more valuable all the time as the world continues to fragment.","So we're very happy that we were selected the \u2013 NFL has put their faith in our team and our broadcast, and we're delighted about it. It's really the best programming, most powerful programming on television and we got it at a very fair rate.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks very much.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks Anthony. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. I have two questions. The first one is for Neil. We know about the tough comp and equipment charges, as it relates to ARPU for 2016 versus 2015. But can you talk about maybe other rate increases in cable and how it might compare to 2015, in terms of magnitude and timing? And then the second question is for Steve. It was mentioned that scatter remains strong in Q1, and we are starting to read about a slowdown in auto, but it sounds like you're not feeling any of this yet. I guess, is that a correct statement? And is there anything anecdotal about auto specifically that you are hearing? Thanks","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","Hi, Marci. Concerning rates and equipment, we'll continue with the accelerated X1 rollout. We're putting out 40,000 boxes a day which, if you do the rough math, it'll get us in the range of 50% of the footprint covered by the end of the year. In terms of capital intensity, we said it would be around 15%, so I think that trend will continue. We are investing behind things we know are good investments, like X1, and I think that's the basic story. We are investing behind business services, behind Wi-Fi, advanced routers, DOCSIS 3.1, and these are all things that I think you can see from the sub numbers and the financial results, we're balancing well the investment as well as the return.","Stephen B. Burke - Chief Executive Officer, NBCUniversal & Senior Executive Vice President","So I think the scatter market is the strongest it's been any time in recent memory. And when we went through the upfront, we were wondering, everybody was wondering, is more money going to digital and is that depressing the upfront? Or are advertisers just waiting? And it now appears, given that scatter has been strong now so consistently, that a lot of advertisers were waiting and placing their money later. I don't think there's anything to worry about in terms of the automotive side of the scatter market. I think the whole market is very strong. Automotive should be very strong. And the good news is, we're now in February and we're getting closer and closer to the upfront. So I think there are reasons to be optimistic about the trajectory for the up-front process.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Marci. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. I have a two-part question on dynamic ad insertion. Comcast has been one of the biggest proponents of a targeted dynamic ad insertion model, going back to really before you owned NBCU. Can you talk about NBCUniversal's strategy for reaching households beyond the Canoe partners, beyond those big cable companies? And also secondly, Canoe placed about 11 billion impressions last year. So it was almost double 2014. But still pretty small percentage of TV ad impressions in your footprint. Can you help us understand at this point what the impediments are to really scaling the platform more on the On-Demand side? And also, can you talk about what it would take to extend the dynamic ad insertion platform to linear viewing as well? Thank you.","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","Steve, why don't I start and then hand it over to you, if you have any additional comments. We believe there's a real opportunity in the linear space to do some of the things that the digital space does so well, such as measurements and targeting. And we've done a few acquisitions, FreeWheel and Visible World, that fit into building that platform, that delivers from targeted advertising, both from the demand side as well as the sales side, making it easier for the customers to deliver their ads.","We have the Visible World, which delivers the targeting system. We have set-top box data which can power it. And we think we're still building the platform, but we're delivering value as it is to a number of programmers. I think that, concerning Canoe, it's a integral part of delivering the dynamic ad insertion. And I think we're \u2013 one of the other things we're working on is, what's the right ad load in VOD, and can we improve the ad targeting and delivery of that system. Steve? Do you want to add anything?","Stephen B. Burke - Chief Executive Officer, NBCUniversal & Senior Executive Vice President","So I think broadly, what advertisers are talking about in almost every single discussion is how to use the kind of data that they're accustomed to getting from \u2013 when they place a digital buy, how to get that with a television buy. And if anything, I think the pendulum is swinging a little bit back toward traditional television advertising, putting a 30 second spot on television. Obviously, the nirvana is to have nationwide addressability. I think that's years away and difficult to cobble together, for all the obvious reasons. But in the interim, we have a whole variety of products, that we have right now in the market, that take advantage of set-top box data and other information overlaid on top of our shows and existing ratings data, so that we can go to advertisers and say, we have more eyeballs than anybody else in America, than any other company in America, and we can inform your purchases of those eyeballs, we think, as well or better than anyone else. So it's not like we're waiting for addressability. But obviously, addressability is a final end state which I think is going to make television advertising that much more valuable.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Bryan. Brent, we'll take one last question, please.","Operator","Final question comes from the line of Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. Neil, maybe just a quick comment on very strong broadband adds. What you were seeing out there, was it a reduction in churn, better gross ads, a combination of the two? Any particular markets where you had more success than normal? And then maybe just the follow-up on Wi-Fi hotspots and handoff. Can you just give us an update on what you're seeing from a customer experience standpoint on handoff technology and quality of service? Thanks.","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","Concerning the HSD numbers, I think that it was strong delivery across the board. Almost every market had indexed higher on connects. But the biggest driver was disconnects or churn. And that was across the board in the business, not just HSD. So I think there's still room for growth. 70% of America has broadband and there's room for growth within the sector. And we feel we've got the best, fastest Wi-Fi in the household and we can deliver a great experience. We're rolling out DOCSIS 3.1, and I think it's going to be a good business for us going forward.","Concerning the Wi-Fi hotspots, people are connecting who use it about five times a day and the average session is over 25 minutes, so we're seeing consistent usage. We've build out the public spots based on the usage trends we see and I think it's \u2013 concerning the handoff between Wi-Fi and cellular, there is some technology out there. The question is whether you'd need to do the handoff or not and how seamless it would be. But we are looking at technology in that space as well.","Brian L. Roberts - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, let me just add to that, that one of the things I think we did really well the last few years was have our technology team, led by Tony Werner and others, really see around the bend, see Wi-Fi, make an investment, so our definition of broadband is totally different today than it was five years ago for what you get as a consumer. And I think that goes back into whether we can do something creative in the future, whether that's involving spectrum or Wi-Fi or some of the existing relationships we've got.","Brian L. Roberts - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So as I sum up, I think about the fact that 2015, amazing year. I think these numbers are \u2013 across-the-board I think all our colleagues stand out in the industry because it's not just great subscriber numbers, but it's also strong financial cash flow and growth doubling the cash flow at NBC since the acquisition. It's a real milestone that we're pleased with. And I think we're better together and that both sides of the company are more informed, we have a collaborative culture not only strengthening each other, but strengthening ourselves. And together I think that makes Comcast NBCUniversal very unique.","And as we thought about return of shareholder capital, we increased it 40% in 2015. We are reinvesting in the business first and foremost, things like Japan, and Vox and BuzzFeed, our dividend has increased since 2009 on almost 25% compounded growth rate, 10% for the S&P 500, so we think we continue to return capital. But we also want to use the growth that we've got to play offense with things like X1 and the kind of things we've been talking about on the call and I think we're doing that well and mostly giving customers what they want. And that cultural shift, which really, Neil, you started in the second half of the year, is paying dividends. So thank you for your support. We look forward to a great 2016.","Jason S.

As we have done in the past, Brian and Michael will make formal remarks, and Steve and Neil will also be available for Q&A.","Before we begin, I want to highlight for you some changes and enhancements we have made to our disclosure.  First, we reclassified revenue from certain commercial customers such as hotels, bars, and restaurants to business service revenues, from residents video revenue.  ","We also expanded the disclosure of operating expenses and all our businesses, except for theme parks, will have the following expense categories in common: programming and production; advertising, marketing, and promotion; and other operating and administrative.","We are also providing added transparency by presenting certain cable communications expenses, previously included as other, in an expanded technical and product support line item and in a new franchise and regulatory fee expense line item.

","With that, let me turn the call to Brian Roberts for his comments.  Brian?  ","Brian Roberts","Thanks, Marlene, and good morning everyone.  I\u2019m really pleased with our solid start in 2013.  Excluding the Super Bowl, we are reporting revenue growth of 5%, cash flow growth of more than 7%, and record quarterly free cash flow of $3.1 billion.  Michael will discuss these results in more detail, but let me start by providing some highlights.","Cable had another strong quarter, with revenue growth of 6.4% and cash flow growth of 6.7%.  Every product showed strength, with revenue increases across our residents products in business services and in advertising.  Video revenue growth has been accelerating and was a standout this quarter, up 3.7%.  That\u2019s the highest rate of growth in any quarter in the last four years.","As we continue to effectively balance financial and customer performance, the combined unit growth of our three main products, with 583,000, a 3% increase, and very solid when compared to prior quarters.  Michael will describe this in more detail, but while we lost some more video customers this first quarter than last year, our goal is to continue to make progress in reducing video customer losses.","High speed internet had another robust quarter, with 433,000 new customer additions, and voice customer additions grew by 29% as we continued to upgrade customers to triple play.  Business services had 27% growth in revenue in the quarter, and ongoing momentum as it expanded services to small businesses and its presence in the midsize market.  ","We\u2019re making steady headway in the rollout of new products, and we\u2019re about to significantly increase our marketing of X1, so that by the year end, it will be available and marketed nationwide.  At the upcoming cable convention in June, we will demonstrate the next generation version of X1, really showing how we are accelerating innovation on this exciting new platform.  ","We\u2019re also expanding our definition of the fastest home by deploying wireless gateways to power the fastest in-home wireless network and growing the number of wirelessly connected devices on this platform in our customers\u2019 homes.  ","We completed the acquisition of NBC Universal during the quarter, and feel really good about the entire transaction going back to 2009.  The timing, the structure, the acceleration, and the strategic impacted all seem right.  We\u2019ve been operating these businesses for the last two years, and we now have a fantastic platform with a lot of different growth opportunities for many years to come.","In the first quarter, NBC Universal businesses generated strong results, with 17% operating cash flow growth, which is a real highlight.  Our film business had two successful releases, broadcast results were as we expected, and we continued to see excellent performance at theme parks.  The cable networks had solid results, and we\u2019re delighted to see improved ratings at USA and Bravo, our two biggest networks.  With all our cable networks now together under the leadership of Bonnie Hammer, we are very enthusiastic about how we can further strengthen and grow these businesses.  ","Comcast NBC Universal works together in ways that are unique.  One is the April 15 premiere of \u201cDefiance,\u201d which was Syfy\u2019s most watched scripted series premiere in 7 years, as top performance in total viewers since 2009.  Comcast Cable showcased \u201cDefiance\u201d through cross-channel spots, on VOD, online, and in our on-screen guides, helping to promote the new series.  As a result, ratings for \u201cDefiance\u201d in Comcast homes outperformed all other distributors by 77%.","We\u2019ve had many successful examples like this of working across our company to experiment and launch new and innovative programs, and this continues a great trend.  So all in all, a really solid start to 2013.  Let me now pass it to Michael to cover the first quarter results in detail.","Michael Angelakis ","Good morning, and thank you, Brian.  Let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated financial results, starting on slide four.  Overall, we are very pleased with our first quarter results, which reflect consistent execution, profitable growth, and the fundamental strength in our business.  ","First quarter consolidated revenue increased 2.9% to $15.3 billion.  If we exclude the $259 million of revenue generated by the Super Bowl in the first quarter of 2012, consolidated revenue actually increased 4.7%.  Consolidated operating cash flow increased 7.4% to $5 billion, reflecting focused execution that resulted in strong organic growth in both our cable communications and NBC Universal businesses.","Free cash flow for the first quarter, which excludes any impact of the economic stimulus, increased 3.3% to $3.1 billion, primarily reflecting growth in consolidated operating cash flow, partially offset by higher capital expenditures.  Free cash flow per share increased 5.4% to $1.17 per share in the quarter.","Earnings per share for the first quarter grew 20% to $0.54 per share, compared to $0.45 per share in the first quarter of 2012.  Excluding a gain related to the sale of wireless spectrum of $0.03 per share, our adjusted earnings per share increased 13.3% to $0.51 in the first quarter of 2013.","Now let\u2019s review the results of our businesses in more detail, starting with cable communications on slide five.  We had a strong quarter of financial and customer growth in our cable communications business.  In the first quarter, cable communications revenue increased a healthy 6% to $10.2 billion, driven by higher video revenue growth and the continued strength in high speed internet and business services.  ","As a result, total revenue per video customer increased 8% to $155 per month.  Contributing to this growth are rate adjustments, an increasing number of customers taking multiple products, and a higher contribution from business services.  ","At the end of the quarter, the number of video-only customers declined, as more customers subscribed to multiple services, with 76% of our video customers subscribing to at least two products, and 41% now subscribing to all three services.","In the first quarter, we added 583,000 total video, high-speed internet, and voice customers, a 3% increase in net customer additions over last year\u2019s first quarter, reflecting strong high-speed internet and voice net additions, partially offset by video customer losses.","In the first quarter, we lost 60,000 video customers, compared to a loss of 37,000 in last year\u2019s first quarter.  During the quarter, we accelerated the timing of rate adjustments and implemented increases to 72% of our customer base versus 62% in the first quarter of 2012.","In addition, we implemented equipment price increases for [D to As] and HD DVRs to this larger base, which in combination negatively impacted our customer base during the quarter.  However, about half of our video subscriber losses were due to the methodology we use to count [MDU] subscribers under our bulk contracts and the other half were primarily video-only customers.","As you may know, we count video customers that are billed under bulk contracts on an FCC equivalent or [EVU] basis, which results in fewer customers as rates increase.  In order to improve our transparency in how we report and manage these bulk contracts, we\u2019ll be changing our external reporting to a billable units methodology at the end of the year.  We believe this change will reinforce our operational focus in this customer segment, and align our video customer account methodology with the rest of the cable industry.","As we have mentioned previously, we have been very focused on striking the right balance between customer growth and financial growth, and in the quarter we reported strong video revenue growth.  Video revenue increased 3.7% in the first quarter.  This is the highest video revenue growth in more than four years, and video revenue was the second largest contributor to cable revenue growth in the first quarter.","This strong growth reflects the rate increases I just highlighted and also an increasing number of customers taking advanced services.  We added 273,000 advance service customers in the first quarter, and now have 12 million HD and\/or DVR customers, equal to 55% of our video customers.","High-speed internet was, again, the largest contributor to our cable revenue growth in the first quarter, with revenue increasing 9%, driven by continued growth in our customer base as we added 433,000 new high-speed internet customers, implemented rate adjustments, and increased the number of customers receiving our higher-speed services.","We recently announced speed increases and remain focused on providing our customers with higher-speed services.  And today, 31% of our customers take a higher-speed tier above our primary service.","With regard to voice, revenue increased 3% in the quarter, driven by strong growth in our customer base.  We added 211,000 new voice customers, a 29% increase over the last year, reflecting continued success in converting 1- and 2-product customers to triple play and also in acquiring new triple play relationships.","As Marlene mentioned, we have restructured responsibilities, and therefore reclassified revenue from certain commercial establishments that was previously presented in residential revenue and now to business services.  This added $160 million to the full year of 2012, and $38 million to the first quarter 2013 business services revenue, lowering its reported growth by more than 200 basis points to a still very healthy 27.5% in the first quarter of 2013.","Business services remains an exciting and substantial opportunity for us, as it continues its positive momentum.  The small end of the market, or businesses with less than 20 employees, continues to drive our growth and accounted for nearly 85% of business services revenue in the first quarter.  The midsized business, which is now established and growing at over a 50% annualized rate, continues to represent approximately 15% of this group\u2019s revenue.","Our cable advertising group also performed well, as the first quarter revenue increased 2.7%.  When excluding the impact of last year\u2019s political revenue, our cable advertising revenue actually increased 5.3%.  ","Please refer to slide six.  First quarter cable communications operating cash flow increased 6.7% to $4.2 billion, for a consistent margin of 41.3%.  In the first quarter, total expenses in cable increased 6.3%, primarily reflecting higher programming expenses as well as additional costs related to expansion of business services and XFINITY Home.  ","Programming expenses increased 8.5% in the first quarter, and as we\u2019ve mentioned, last quarter our program expense increases reflect higher rates for two recently completed long term agreements, increasing retransmission [consent] and our expanding content lineup on multiple platforms.  We continue to expect programming expenses to grow at low double-digit rates for full year 2013.","In the first quarter, we have effectively offset some of these expense increases, with continued efficiency gains.  During the first quarter, we reduced our activity level by 1.2 truck rolls and by 1 million agent calls handled in our call centers, even as we added 583,000 total new customers.","Customers continue to elect self-installations, which in the first quarter accounted to 38% of our total installations, compared to 24% in the first quarter of last year. In addition, we now have 29% of our customers managing their accounts online.","These operating and technology platform improvements result in a better experience for our customers, lower activity level, and improved productivity for our cable operations.  Please refer to slide seven so we can review NBC Universal\u2019s results.","For the first quarter of 2013, NBC\u2019s revenue increased 2.4%, excluding the Super Bowl, and operating cash flow increased 17.2%.  These strong first quarter results were driven by cable networks and film and consistently strong performance at the theme parks.","Now let\u2019s take a closer look at the individual segments at NBC Universal.  For the first quarter, cable networks generated revenue of $2.2 billion, an increase of 4.6%, primarily reflecting an 8.6% increase in distribution revenue.  Advertising revenue from the networks increased 2.5%, primarily reflecting price increases, offset by lower ratings.","Content licensing revenue from our studio and certain cable networks declined by 11.9%.  Cable networks operating cash flow increased 6.2% to $859 million in the quarter, primarily reflecting improved revenue performance and a 2% increase in programming and production costs, due to the continued investment in original programming, partially offset by lower sports programming costs compared to last year\u2019s first quarter.","With regard to our broadcast segment, first quarter broadcast television revenue decreased 18.5% to $1.5 billion.  However, excluding the impact of the Super Bowl in the first quarter of 2012, broadcast revenue decreased 5.3%, reflecting a decline in advertising due to lower prime time ratings, driven by changes to the timing of key shows including \u201cThe Voice\u201d and lower content licensing revenue from a prior library content agreement.","Primarily reflecting the decline in revenue, the broadcast segment generated operating cash flow loss of $35 million in the first quarter, compared to a loss of $14 million in the first quarter of 2012.","Moving to film entertainment, our first quarter revenue increased 2% to $1.2 billion, driven by the strong box office performance of \u201cLes Miserables\u201d and the successful first quarter releases of \u201cIdentity Thief\u201d and \u201cMama\u201d as well as higher content licensing revenue.  Film operating cash flow increased $63 million to $69 million, reflecting the positive performance of the film slate and lower marketing costs due to the timing of theatrical releases.","Switching to our theme park segment, we had another strong quarter as theme parks generated revenue of $462 million, a 12.2% increase, driven by attendance growth at both parks, which benefited in part by the timing of holidays.","In addition, theme parks continued to benefit from the success of the Harry Potter attraction in Orlando and the Transformers attraction in Hollywood.  First quarter operating cash flow increased 10.3% to $173 million, reflecting higher revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating costs to support new attractions.","Let\u2019s move on to slide eight, to review our consolidated capital expenditures.  Consistent with our expectations in the first quarter, consolidated capital expenditures increased 16% to $1.4 billion compared to $1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2012.  At Cable Communications, first quarter capital expenditures increased $38 million, or 3.6%, to $1.1 billion, equal to 10.7% of cable revenue versus 11% in the first quarter of 2012.","The increase primarily reflects our continuing investments in network infrastructure to ensure product leadership in our video and high-speed internet, as well as the expansion of new services that generate attractive returns like business services and XFINITY Home.","NBC Universal\u2019s capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2013 increased $152 million to $263 million, primarily driven by increased investments in theme parks, as we built new attractions, particularly Transformers and other attractions in Orlando, Despicable Me in Hollywood, and expansion of Harry Potter.","As I mentioned in February, we continue to expect that, for the full year 2013, cable capital expenditures will increase by approximately 10%, with capital intensity increasing slightly, and that NBC Universal\u2019s full year 2013 capital investment will increase by approximately 25% from 2012.","Please refer to slide nine.  As I mentioned earlier, we generated consolidated free cash flow of $3.1 billion in the first quarter, an increase of 3.3%.  Free cash flow per share increased 5.4% to $1.17 per share.  The first quarters typically are our strongest free cash flow quarter, due to the timing of payments of our federal cash taxes.","The NBC Universal transaction was funded and closed on March 19.  As a result, we ended the first quarter with consolidated debt and $725 million of subsidiary preferred stock, totaling $48 billion and a gross debt to operating cash flow leverage ratio of 2.4x.  ","We view our balance sheet as a strategic asset, and are focused on strengthening our financial position with a medium-term leverage target of 1.5 to 2x.  As a result of the transaction and our revised targets, our public debt ratings were recently upgraded by the two major credit rating agencies.","We are executing on our 2013 financial plan that we outlined in our year-end earnings call, and during the first quarter we returned $929 million of capital to shareholders, including share repurchases totaling $500 million and dividend payments totaling $429 million.  As we enter the second quarter, our dividend payments will reflect the 20% increase that we announced with our year-end earnings.  ","Overall, we are very pleased with the start of 2013, reflecting our strong operating and financial results and our momentum.  We believe that our ongoing investments, along with our focused and disciplined execution, will continue to yield positive results and profitable growth.","Now let me turn the call over to Marlene for Q&A.  ","Question-and-Answer Session","Marlene Dooner","Thanks, Michael.  Operator, let\u2019s open up the call for Q&A, please.","Operator","[Operator instructions.]  Our first question will come from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.  Please go ahead.  ","Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank","I have a question for Neil regarding marketing strategy and a quick clarification from Michael.  For Michael, on [MDU] video subaccounting, you noted half the video sublosses in Q1 2013 were due to MDU accounting.  How much of Q1 2012 reported video sublosses were due to that MDU accounting?  ","And then for Neil, you showed strong voice growth.  I think the focus remains on triple play marketing.  A peer is deemphasizing triple play marketing.  They\u2019re concerned customers don\u2019t want to pay for voice service.  How do you gain comfort that triple play remains the right marketing strategy?  Is there anything in customer quality metrics or churn or customer satisfaction surveys that you can share with us?","Michael Angelakis ","Why don\u2019t I take the question on the second part.  Really the way I think we\u2019re looking at it is we did lose a little bit more primary customers in the first quarter of 2013 than we did in the first quarter of 2012.  So that\u2019s really one of the focus points that we\u2019re on.  And as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, the primary reason for that was really the increases that we had provided in rates during the first quarter compared to last year.","Neil Smit ","On our marketing strategy, it\u2019s very consistent with where we\u2019ve been in the past.  We\u2019re very focused on triple play.  Our triple play sell-in was up 8% year over year, and I think a lot of the good performance in our phone results was attributable to that.  We\u2019re getting a higher triple play sell-in, and triple play customers churn at a significantly lower rate than single play customers, and customer sat is higher.  So that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to continue with that strategy.  ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America.  ","Jessica Reif Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess one for each segment.  On cable, can you talk a little bit about new products?  You have a lot of rights that you\u2019re buying from programmers that I think you\u2019ve talked about in the past that you may market differently or introduce new products?  So if you could just talk about that and other opportunities like home monitoring, which you didn\u2019t mention?","And then on the NBC Universal, it seems like really excellent progress across the board, with the exception of broadcasting, which probably has the most upside over the longer term.  So just hoping, since Steve\u2019s on the call, if you could just address what you\u2019re doing to turn around NBC, which has had glimmers of light at times.","Neil Smit ","I\u2019ll speak to the products.  As you know, X1 is rolling out nationwide.  We\u2019re in about 30% of the country now, and launching markets on a continuous basis.  We\u2019ll be at about 50% of the footprint by the end of Q2.  ","Our home product has rolled out nationally.  It\u2019s starting to gain momentum.  Interestingly, a relatively high percentage of the customers who have never had a security service are taking home, and 40% of those are new to Comcast, and 70% of those are taking triple play or taking quad play.  So it\u2019s an encouraging sign.","In terms of rights, we, as you know, acquired new rights to our TV Everywhere contract with a number of major distributors.  And we\u2019re leveraging those in areas like [watch-a-thons].  We did watch-a-thon and we got the 123 million views across all our platforms.  And interestingly, the set top box views were up 27%.  So it wasn\u2019t just viewing, it was viewing on the television and the big screen.  But our views on mobile as well as online were also up.","And Streampix, we\u2019re getting rights for SVOD from a number of the programmers, and Streampix continues to grow, both in the service that we include for our high-value customers as well as the a la carte buys.  So there\u2019s a lot of new product growth going on, but our real focus now is on X1 and also on the gateway product that ups throughput of our in-home wifi.  ","Steve?","Steve Burke","When we announced the deal a couple of years ago, we said that it would take something like three to five years to get momentum at the broadcast network really materialized.  I think we made good progress in the first couple of years, primarily with \u201cThe Voice\u201d.  We are now doing \u201cThe Voice\u201d both in the fall and the spring, and the good news, when \u201cThe Voice\u201d came back this spring, ratings were actually higher, are actually higher, in the fall.  ","So that strategy\u2019s worked, and we had real momentum in the fall.  And during the first quarter, when the voice was not on the air, we lost that momentum.  We knew that would happen, and then it came back when \u201cThe Voice\u201d came back.","We have a few other shows that are showing glimmers of hope, but we really need to get one or two more good shows.  But we\u2019re making progress.  We were in fourth place for a number of years.  Last year we came in third place, barely, primary because of the Super Bowl.  This year it looks like we\u2019re headed for a strong third place.  So we\u2019re making some progress, but we do need some more shows.  ","I happen to be in L.A. right now, we\u2019re going through pilots, and we\u2019re putting a tremendous amount of focus and concentration on building on the success we\u2019ve had so far, and developing shows that will continue to have that success next year.","Jessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America ","","Can I ask a quick follow up for Neil?  What is the opportunity for home monitoring?  Like a dollar amount?  Can you say?","Neil Smit ","Well, we currently sell our security service, our XFINITY home service, for different price points, $29, $39, and $49, depending on the amount of equipment and level of service.  That includes the home monitoring service.  I think that there are other opportunities for products that we could hang off the wifi, that we\u2019re currently investigating.  ","So you could have the home security service, the lighting service, home energy management that we have today, and you could add other services onto that.  And we\u2019re looking at that portfolio of services that we could hang off the wifi umbrella right now, which is one of the reasons we\u2019re focusing so heavily on wifi.  We\u2019ve got the fastest in-home wifi.  60% of mobile usage is in-home, and people are hanging a lot more devices, an average of 6 devices, off their home wifi.  So we\u2019re going to continue to push hard on that product.","Michael Angelakis ","Related to XFINITY home, as Neil mentioned a few minutes ago, is we kind of look at it two ways.  One is as another product that certainly is attracting a different customer base.  A lot of the relationships are new to Comcast.  In addition, a lot of them are bundled, whether it\u2019s triple play or quadruple play.  So we think that\u2019s really positive.  And then on a standalone basis, we hope to build a business which we think is pretty successful over the next few years.  ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs.  Please go ahead.","Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs ","First, on the programming cost inflation.  Obviously we saw a step up this quarter, but still sort of below the annual guide.  You flagged ABC and Fox as sort of pressure points over the course of the year, but it seems like a decent chunk of that could have, and probably should have, shown up in the first quarter.  So what are the things, from here, that would drive continued increases in the rate of inflation over the course of the year that\u2019s sort of implied by your guidance.","And then second question, on business services, another good quarter there.  You\u2019ve talked, I think, before, about margins in the 50% range in that business.  As you think about tapping into different segments of the market from here and getting higher penetration, what\u2019s happening with incremental margins in that segment?  ","Neil Smit ","Why don\u2019t I take programming?  Programming expense growth we still expect in the low double digits for 2013.  We had a few exceptions in the quarter, one of which was the NHL lockout, which resulted in a one-time rebate.  But as you know, programming rates fluctuate as contracts come in and out, and carriage varies.  But I still believe we\u2019ll be in the low double-digit rate increase this year.","Concerning business services, as the business scales, and we leverage the infrastructure better, the margin has gone up.  And I feel that as we enter new business segments, that should continue that trend.  As you saw in the quarter, we moved over what we call the hospitality business, which is bars and restaurants, into the business services management structure.  We felt like we could manage and focus on it more effectively.  ","That resulted in a $40 million movement, which was 200 basis points of downward movement in the margin.  It went down to 27.5, and would have been 29.5, if we hadn\u2019t done that movement.  The growth rate, excuse me.  But we\u2019re managing the business more effectively, and I think the margins are going to continue to be healthy in business services.  ","Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs ","And Neil, just quickly, on the first question, what was the size of the NHL rebate?","Neil Smit ","We don\u2019t disclose the size.","Michael Angelakis ","And Jason, let me just add, we do have, as part of contracts, different step ups at different times, taking effect at different parts of the year.  So as we\u2019re provided with some insight into how our programming costs will go up, we did have some, obviously, increase in the first quarter.  Some of that was offset by the rebate that Neil mentioned.  And as other channels, we do have different points in time where those kind of reset during the year, which will have an impact on our full year estimate.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi.  Please go ahead.  ","Jason Bazinet - Citi ","","For Mr. Smit, do you mind just updating us on your current thinking on data caps and consumption-based pricing on the internet product?  And then for Mr. Angelakis, can you remind us, I guess on the cash flow statement, do you settle the station venture liability?  Does that have any bearing on the way we should be forecasting the TV station group at all, in terms of financials?","Neil Smit ","We are currently underway with two tests in the markets.  One aligns itself with the speeds that people are buying up to, and another is where you can buy incremental data packages as you move along.  It\u2019s still in the early stages of test, we haven\u2019t drawn any conclusions yet.  We\u2019re pleased with our current pricing, and the growth in the HSD business.   ","Michael Angelakis ","With regard to station ventures, we\u2019ve been the majority shareholder of that joint venture for many years, and we\u2019ve always consolidated that operating cash flow.  So as you look at that business going forward, there will be really no change to our financial statements related to the resolution of that joint venture.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of John Hodulik of UBS.  Please go ahead.","John Hodulik - UBS ","Just some follow up questions on the X1 rollout, I guess for Neil.  Can you update us on trends you see in the markets where you\u2019ve had the X1 rolled out the longest?  I\u2019m basically trying to get a sense for whether or not X1 drives a change in the trajectory, and if so, are there some markets where you\u2019re seeing subscriber growth?  And then as it relates to the new marketing along the X1, is that something that should affect margins as we go into the second half?  Or is it just a shift from some other kind of marketing around the X1?","Neil Smit ","The X1, the results have been very positive.  We\u2019ve seen increases in overall VOD views, especially in the transactional VOD.  HD viewing is much higher due to the autotune switch.  The customer sat is higher, and the most viewed features are the mini guide and the last nine channels that you used.  So overall, very positive results.  ","In terms of the growth in markets, we have seen growth in a number of our markets.  I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d attribute it specifically to X1, since it\u2019s in the very early stages.  And we will begin marketing it more aggressively going forward.  And I think that would be a shift in marketing dollars from one program to another, but I don\u2019t think that we\u2019ll see notably higher marketing budget increase.  ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Marci Ryvicker of Wells Fargo.  Please go ahead.  ","Marci Ryvicker \u2013 Wells Fargo","I want to get back to the upsell to the triple play, and I\u2019m thinking about what happened with Time Warner Cable, because they were successful with the triple play last year, but it ended up that they had acquired less profitable subs that actually churned more quickly than expected.  How do you think about this risk of potentially increased churn, and the quality of your triple play subs?  Is this being driven by promotions, or do you have more flexible packaging?  Any color around the difference between what you\u2019re seeing and what Time Warner Cable may have seen?","Neil Smit ","I can\u2019t speak to Time Warner Cable\u2019s marketing program, but we\u2019re still very focused on the triple play.  Our triple play customers churn at a lower rate than our single or double play, and that\u2019s been consistent for some time period now.  I think we\u2019re seeing, as I mentioned earlier, our triple play sell-in is up about 8%.  So that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing more upgrading from single and double play to triple play.  And you saw that in the numbers.  Triple play customers are now 41%.","We\u2019re also doing a transitional sales program where, as we solve a billing call, for example, we are asking, if they don\u2019t have phone, if they\u2019d be interested in purchasing phone.  So we\u2019re upgrading more customers.  But I can\u2019t speak to Time Warner, but I think the triple play has still been a very effective program for us.","Michael Angelakis ","Something I would add is if you even go back to 2011, and between 2011 and 2012, we added about 300 basis points of penetration of triple play, and then if you look at \u201912 to \u201913, it\u2019s about another 300 to 400 basis points of penetration on triple play.  So now we\u2019re, as I mentioned, 41%.  And it\u2019s pretty clear, as Neil mentioned, that those customers have higher sat, lower churn, and for us, the best customer lifetime value.  So we\u2019re going to continue to focus on customer lifetime value, and that\u2019s where we see some of the benefits.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Michael Senno with Credit Suisse.  Please go ahead.","Michael Senno - Credit Suisse ","Just wanted to go back to the rate increases and what impact they may have had on churn to see if you think you\u2019ve gotten over that hump, or there may be still some lingering effect heading into the next quarter, and what you\u2019re seeing in the competitive environment in general with telcos getting aggressive on some promotions.","Neil Smit ","We\u2019re always balancing rate and volume, and this quarter, the first quarter, we took rate increases across 72% of our footprint versus 62% of our footprint last year.  We also, the rate increases included both an increase on service as well as DTAs and HD DVRs.  So we got a double impact there.","The good news is revenue was up 3.7%, which is the best in over four years, and it was $184 million worth of revenue impact.  I think whenever we\u2019re taking rate increases across a wider swath of footprint, we\u2019re going to see an impact on volume.  Generally speaking, that impact occurs within the quarter, and doesn\u2019t linger on into subsequent quarters.  ","Our goal is to keep making progress on video sublosses, and I think one of the things that was notable was that most of our losses were single play only customers, and we continued to drive focus on high-value subs, and you\u2019re seeing that in the triple play results.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.  Please go ahead.","Phil Cusick - JPMorgan","Two for Brian, if you don\u2019t mind.  First, I think you were on CNBC this morning and you mentioned that you see a steadily improving economy.  But it doesn\u2019t seem like the video industry is growing with occupied housing.  Can you give us some thoughts on that?","And then second, would you mind opining on the Cablevision lawsuit versus Viacom from both an MSO and a programming owner\u2019s point of view?","Brian Roberts","Well, I don\u2019t know that I have any better crystal ball on the overall economy than anybody else.  We\u2019re not seeing a lot of housing growth, which would be the main driver of expansion.  But at the same time, we\u2019re seeing some modest improvement in some pockets of the country, and generally, as I said this morning, I think we\u2019re in a steady, longer, maybe somewhat frustrating to many of us that it\u2019s not going faster, but that it\u2019s in the right direction.  And we don\u2019t see any big changes.  ","So we\u2019re planning our business as if the economy will continue to recover.  We\u2019re bullish long term, and I go back to the statement just in terms of [your actions], which is we accelerated the buyout of GE, and we feel really good about that decision a few weeks later and a few months later, and the whole decision with NBC Universal who have all this growth opportunity now in the company, in addition to cable.  ","The lawsuit, I think I\u2019m just going to stay away from that at this time.   ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.  Please go ahead.   ","Ben Swinburne - Morgan Stanley","One for Brian and one for Steve. Brian, you guys are leading edge on TV Everywhere and XFINITY and some of the apps you\u2019ve rolled out.  I was curious if you could share with us what kind of consumption and usage trends you\u2019re seeing on out of home rights that you\u2019ve been able to bring together, and even in home, how people are using the tablet and other non-primary screen devices to interface with the Comcast cable services.  Particularly thinking about that in context with some of the Netflix data about how much time Netflix subs spend using Netflix.  I\u2019m curious what the experience has been on the Comcast side.  ","And maybe for Steve, one segment that really doesn\u2019t get a lot of attention is the studio.  It was a strong quarter this quarter.  Years ago, that was a very significant profit generator.  I\u2019m curious if you could just opine for us on any changes you\u2019ve made at the studio on the cost side or in the development side that you think suggest that we\u2019ve got a lot of room to expand profit pools at the studio.","Steve Burke","I think we\u2019ve made a lot of fantastic progress on creating a TV Everywhere experience.  Is it perfect?  Is it ubiquitous?  Is it finished?  Absolutely not.  But we have some quarter of a million choices, plus, between XFINITYTV.com and all the other various versions of that, whether it\u2019s VOD or the iPad app.  We\u2019ve had 8 million iPad app downloads.  I could give you lots and lots of stats.  ","On demand, as Neil said, we created a fantastic event called \u201cwatch-a-thons\u201d.  We got all the broadcasters, all the premium channels, and a number of cable channels, and we opened up really the best series of television to our viewers for a week on all the platforms.  It helped upsell pay.  It was authenticated easily, and got people to use their Comcast XFINITY experience on multiple platforms.","So I think you\u2019re going to see a lot more of that kind of thing.  The other thing that\u2019s exciting and we\u2019re going to show some of this, where X1 can evolve to, is just the continuation of how your DVR can interact, and how you can have even more seamless nature of accessing the content and easier search, and faster results, and moving it across other devices.","So a lot of progress is happening.  At the same time, we\u2019re very mindful.  The market continues to evolve with other services that we don\u2019t necessarily directly touch.  [Neither] our broadband.  So we\u2019re investing in broadband, which is why I think you\u2019re seeing such a healthy broadband investment cycle and customer growth and the fastest speeds, and we\u2019re pretty excited about what\u2019s happening.  And for many, many years, we sort of believed that we should have the best network and the best user experience, and all this pushes up to keep innovating.  ","So I don\u2019t know, Neil, you may want to add to that, but I think the main thing with TV Everywhere is how easy can you make authentication, first gate, and when we go back to, say, the Olympics, we made some great progress there.  Watch-a-thon was even better.  And I think when we get to the Olympics next year, a lot more progress will have been made in that two-year period and I think you\u2019re going to be able to begin authenticating using other credentials from other population web apps and things that we\u2019re working on right now that are exciting.","Brian Roberts","Regarding film, we\u2019ve had a very good nine-month run.  And some of that, I think, is just better films.  You could start with \u201cTed\u201d and go through \u201cLes Miserables\u201d and \u201cIdentity Thief\u201d.  We\u2019ve had a very good run in terms of the films that we\u2019ve picked.  The good news is we\u2019re looking forward to \u201cDespicable Me 2\u201d and \u201cFast 6\u201d, both coming out between now and the fourth of July.","I think there\u2019s been some strategy change.  I think we\u2019re more focused on sequels and more internationally focused, and we\u2019ve made some progress in terms of the cost side of the business with international home video joint ventures and things like that.  But I think it really comes down to we\u2019ve had a run of very good films, and hopefully that will continue with some of the films that are coming up.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Brian Kraft with Evercore Partners.   Please go ahead.  ","Brian Kraft - Evercore Partners","Just wanted to ask you, on the parks, now that the Universal Studios 25-year evolution plan has been approved by L.A. County, when will that begin to impact capex?  How long do you anticipate the project taking?  And what do you think the total investment would be?  And is there any spend on that in this year\u2019s capital budget?","And then also, just on the revenue growth, was all of that acceleration, do you think, the timing of the holidays driving improved attendance?  Or was there some underlying acceleration as well?","Michael Angelakis ","Why don\u2019t I take evolution plan?  First of all, we\u2019re very excited that evolution plan has been approved.  And we\u2019re really excited to make more investments related to the park in Hollywood.  There is some capital that will be invested in 2013 related to the work we\u2019ll be doing with Harry Potter in Hollywood.  There will be more, obviously, in 2014.  ","So our expectation is, over the next couple of years, we will be investing in the park in Hollywood pretty substantially.  We\u2019re not talking about how much it is, but we\u2019re pretty excited that Harry Potter, when it comes to our theme park in Hollywood, will do terrific.  And we\u2019ve done a lot of work on planning for that, and the team is exceedingly excited.  So it\u2019s going to take us a couple of years to make that investment, and I think you\u2019ll see some of those dollars this year, next year, and even a little bit into 2015.","Steve Burke","[unintelligible] helpful during the first quarter, but really what\u2019s going on is both in Orlando and Hollywood, we have real, underlying momentum.  In Hollywood, a lot of it is Transformers.  In Orlando, it\u2019s a variety of things.  We\u2019re opening a Transformers attraction in Orlando in the near future, and that will hopefully provide continued momentum.  And then Harry Potter, I think, has been a game-changer for Orlando, and when it\u2019s up and running in Hollywood, it will be the same for that park.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Amy Yong with Macquarie.  ","Amy Yong - Macquarie","In the past, you\u2019ve outlined that ratings for NBC were stronger in Comcast territories.  Is that still the case?  And can you just update us on that strategy, or I guess Project Symphony, post the buy-in?","Brian Roberts ","I think what we\u2019ve said before is that we\u2019re finding a pattern, whether it\u2019s a big movie or a new television show like \u201cThe Voice\u201d or \u201cDefiance\u201d on Syfy, when the entire company gets behind a specific show or movie, the results in Comcast markets are markedly better than the rest of the country.  And I think that\u2019s just a fundamental belief, and a differentiator that we have that maybe half a dozen times a year, we can pick something that\u2019s important to the company and really make it work by bringing the entire company together.  ","I think one of the things that is also happening is our own stations are getting stronger.  And our own stations overlap significantly with Comcast markets.  So you see a lot of markets where we were actually the number four or number three news provider, where we\u2019re now number three or two or one in some cases.  So the stations are getting stronger, the Comcast markets are very supportive, and the way to think about it is really to think about our major properties are doing well because of Symphony.  ","We\u2019re trying to continue that, and in some cases improve it and tweak it.  We\u2019re learning things, we\u2019re doing a lot for the major movies that are coming out, and I think \u201cDefiance\u201d was clearly a huge impact on the Comcast side.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James.  Please go ahead.  ","Frank Louthan - Raymond James","Looking at some of your opportunities with Verizon Wireless, can you comment on that, and particularly with what you mentioned about the wireless gateways and the faster speeds, and any of that in relation with your Verizon partnership?","Neil Smit ","I can only say that the Verizon Wireless partnership has been terrific.  They\u2019re great partners.  We work well together.  We identify products that would be opportunities for both of our customer bases.  The focus to date has been on getting the infrastructure set.  So we\u2019re in 500 Verizon stores, and about 1,000 agent stores.  We\u2019ve got a common billing system, so the agents in their stores can bill and sell things in a manner that they\u2019re familiar with.  We\u2019ve got some products lined up, a product roadmap, and HSD is certainly a good opportunity in there that we want to leverage, but so is video.  The data usage on mobile phones is very high for video, and we think there\u2019s a real opportunity there as well.  So great partnership, more to come."," ","Marlene Dooner","Thank you Frank, and thank you all for joining us this morning.

Comcast NBCUniversal is a special company with a fantastic team working really well together, and we're executing an exceptionally high level. We had a terrific year and it ended on a real high note with our strong fourth quarter performance.","In the quarter: we added nearly 400,000 broadband subscribers; we're again Video net add positive; and we made important customer-friendly advancements, highlighted by the launch of Netflix on the X1 platform where we've seen an incredible first few months of sign-on activity and engagement.","Over at NBCUniversal, we capped off a strong 2016 with the box office success of Sing, and NBC is already off to another excellent start in the 2016-2017 TV season. So all-in-all, a great end to the year for Comcast NBCUniversal, and this provides strong momentum as we begin 2017.","For the full year 2016, we increased revenue 7.9% and operating cash flow 7%, and generated over $8 billion in free cash flow. The consistency and strength of our results enables us, with the support of our board, to announce a 15% increase in our dividend, our ninth consecutive annual increase.

Finally, we increased our share repurchase authorization to $12 billion and expect to repurchase $5 billion in stock in 2017.","Comcast NBCUniversal has an unrivaled portfolio of businesses that are working well together. So let me talk about some of our notable achievements in 2016, and then some of the things we're looking forward to for 2017 and beyond.","Starting with Cable, we added 161,000 Video subscribers. This is our best result and also the first time we have added Video subscribers in a decade, ending with almost 23 million strong. This is a fantastic accomplishment. To do this in the face of increasing competition and the rapid evolution in the category, speaks volumes about the team's innovative culture, focused execution, and the leadership position we've developed with X1.","Speaking of X1, we've now deployed it to approximately 50% of our residential Video customers and we're seeing continued impressive results. We'll keep driving X1 into our base and add features along the way to help further differentiate the experience as well as adding to our list of X1 licensing partners, which now includes Cox, Shaw and, most recently, Rogers.","In broadband, we added 1.4 million subscribers. This is the 11th year in a row that we've add more than 1 million. And, in fact, in 2016, we had our highest full-year result in nine years. All-in-all, at Cable, we added 858,000 net new customer relationships, which is up 29% year-over-year.","We have a great formula going with industry-leading products including the best in-home WiFi experience and the most complete video delivery platform. We also continue to make significant progress in our customer service, reducing customer calls handled by our agents by over 22 million in 2016, a double-digit improvement year-over-year. All of this is contributing to better customer retention and, therefore, extended customer life across each of our products.","In Business Services, we have really hit our stride, ending the year with a nearly $6 billion revenue run rate and great traction across all three of the customer segments that we serve, small, medium and enterprise.","At NBCUniversal, we had a fantastic year, further validating what a game-changing acquisition this was. As we've said before, operating cash flow at NBCUniversal has more than doubled since the announcement of the acquisition. And now, we can report that we have grown operating cash flow double digits each of the last four years; pretty great performance, in my opinion.","In our TV businesses, This Is Us is the year's breakout new hit series and a wonderful show. SNL is having its most-watched season in 20 years and we continue to rank No. 1 across day parts in broadcast, ranging from the TODAY show to Nightly News, all the way through to Late Night. And Telemundo beat Univision on many nights for the first time in its history.","In Cable Networks, USA was the number one cable entertainment network for the 11th consecutive year. MSNBC produced outstanding growth, and we ended the year with eight of the top 25 cable entertainment shows in the fourth quarter.","In Film, we knew in 2016, we had tough comps from the year before at Universal. We ended up with a wonderful year, with two breakout hits laying the groundwork for future franchises with Secret Live of Pets and Sing.","In Parks, the standout was in Hollywood, where our new Harry Potter attraction opened to tremendous guest reception and shattered attendance records. In addition, we continue to focus on growing internationally, creating a global platform that we expect to build upon for years to come.","Overall, our progress in 2016 sets us up incredibly well for 2017. So as we look to our priorities for the year, in Cable, we are focused on further strengthening our leading position in high-speed data, winning in Video, successfully bundling these and our other innovative products, expanding in Business Services, building upon the improvements we've made in customer experience.","While 2017 will involve an uptick in programming expenses, as Mike will detail, we expect programming cost growth to return to more normalized levels beyond 2017. And we've taken steps in this coming year in our cost structure to protect our margin and our ability to grow Cable's operating cash flow.","Another priority in 2017 is to launch our wireless product. I would characterize our efforts and approach in the following way. One, we plan to include wireless in our multi-product bundles in a way that is designed to add value to our customers, improve retention and ultimately benefit lifetime customer economics for us. Our offering will give customers access to a world-class wireless network benefiting from our WiFi with the best mobile devices and a simple, transparent experience, all for a great value.","Two, we will be disciplined with our investment and expect to be NPV positive on each incremental customer once we've achieved a limited initial scale. And three, we will be measured in our roll-out, learning and adapting along the way. Mike will provide some additional details later on the call.","At NBCUniversal, we're well-positioned with a range of opportunities ahead of us. The conclusion of recent distribution deals at year-end gives us excellent runway on retrans and affiliate fees.","In addition, the year is off to a great start at Broadcast, where, so far this season, NBC is once again ranked number one in 18-to-49 viewing, but this time has more than a 30% margin over the number two ranked network. This is the biggest lead for any network 17 weeks into the season in the history of Nielsen's People Meter sample.","In Parks, we expect big things from Orlando in 2017, as we bring a third gate to market with our spectacular new water park, Volcano Bay, and launch an impressive Jimmy Fallon attraction, Race Through New York.","In Film, the year-end success continues to benefit us into the first quarter, which helps us start the year on solid footing leading into upcoming releases of our returning top franchises, including Fifty Shades Darker, The Fate of the Furious and Despicable Me 3.","So overall, we're confident and optimistic about the opportunities ahead. We have great momentum in our businesses, and we'll stay true to our formula, embracing ways to be entrepreneurial and invest prudently for growth, looking for smart investments while also returning a significant amount of cash to shareholders.","Mike, over to you.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everybody. I'm starting on slide 5 for those following presentation online. I'm going to go into greater detail on the slides to come, but let me give a quick summary of the consolidated numbers.","Our fourth quarter results reflect consistent execution and broad-based strength across our businesses. Consolidated revenue increased 9.2% and operating cash flow grew 7.8% for the fourth quarter, reflecting solid growth in our operating businesses.","Earnings per share was $0.95, a 20.3% increase compared to a year ago. On an adjusted basis, EPS increased 9.9% to $0.89.","Free cash flow during the quarter increased 64.2% to $2.6 billion, primarily driven by growth in operating cash flow and improvements in working capital. For the full year, we generated $8.2 billion of free cash flow, a decline of 8.2%. This decline was mainly driven by higher working capital and capital expenditures.","So now let's start with Cable Communications on slide 6. Cable Communications delivered strong fourth quarter results. Revenue increased 7.1% to $12.8 billion, as we added 258,000 customer relationships and reduced churn across all products. In fact, we have improved churn in Video and high-speed data for 12 consecutive quarters, which we believe is driven by the positive benefits of the X1 platform, our best-in-class high-speed data product and the meaningful strides we have made in improving customer service.","High-Speed Internet continues to be the largest contributor to overall Cable revenue growth. Revenue increased 9% to $3.5 billion in the quarter, reflecting an increase in our customer base and rate adjustments. Our customer momentum continued as we added a combined 385,000 net residential and business high speed data customers in the quarter and added 1.4 million net customers during the full year, our best full year results in nine years. Our high-speed data penetration is 43.8%, up from 41.9% a year ago, as customers continue to respond to our product differentiation.","Through consistent investment and innovation, we offer the best broadband product on the market. We double the capacity of our network every 18 to 24 months, have increased Internet speed 17 times in the past 16 years, and now over 50% of our residential customers have speeds of 100 megabits per second or higher.","Coupled with the best in-home WiFi experience, we believe this greatly increases our customer value proposition and competitive differentiation. Looking ahead in 2017 and beyond, we think there's a lot of runway to continue to grow high-speed data subscribers.","Video revenue increased 4.3% to $5.6 billion in the quarter, primarily due to rate adjustments and customers subscribing to additional services. In terms of volume, we added an impressive combined 161,000 net Video customers in 2016, compared to a loss of 36,000 customers in 2015. This is the first time in 10 years that we have added Video customers for a full year. We ended the year strong, adding 80,000 net Video customers in the fourth quarter, driven by continued improvements in customer retention, better market segmentation and broader recognition of what we believe is the best video product on the market.","Our X1 platform is a real competitive differentiator, and we have made good progress rolling it out. We deployed X1 to 936,000 net new and existing customers during the quarter, ending the year with 48% of our residential Video customers having X1 compared to 30% a year ago. Even as we have expanded the base of X1 customers, the positive benefits continue with better retention, improved customer satisfaction, and higher Net Promoter Scores for X1 customers. As a result, we will continue our rollout of X1 at a healthy pace, with an expectation that year end 2017 penetration will be in the low 60%s range.","Voice revenue declined by 3% to $873 million in the fourth quarter, as the positive impact of adding a combined 44,000 net customers was offset by a modest decline in ARPU. The strong results in Business Services continued in the fourth quarter. Revenues increased 14.5% to $1.4 billion during the quarter, with the small business segment accounting for over 70% of our revenue and 60% of our growth, driven primarily by the net increase in customers. Revenue for the midsize business segment had a higher growth rate, fueled primarily by additional Ethernet sites as we continue to invest in expanding that business.","Cable Advertising revenue increased 14.9% to $728 million, reflecting higher political revenue related to the elections. Excluding the political contribution, our Cable Advertising revenue decreased 1.9%.","Turning to slide 7, fourth quarter Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 6.4% to $5.2 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.4% compared to 40.6% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The change in margin was driven by higher expenses, primarily related to programming.","Programming expenses grew 12.2% during the quarter, reflecting the timing of contract renewals, while the full year increased 10.1%. The underlying increases continue to be driven by higher retransmission consent fees and higher sports programming costs. For 2017, we expect programming expense growth of approximately 13%, driven by contract renewals that began in the second half of 2016 as well as additional contract renewals beginning in the first quarter. We continue to believe that in the years following 2017, programming expense growth should normalize to historic levels of high single-digit growth.","Non-programming expenses increased 4.8% for the quarter, which is lower than the full year growth of 5.7%. The fourth quarter growth reflects higher expenses to continue the rollout of X1, but these are partially offset by benefits we are beginning to realize from the investments we have made to improve the customer experience over the past several quarters. Notably, customer service expenses declined 2.1% this quarter. We expect the rate of growth for non-programming expenses to trend lower in 2017 compared to 2016, as we continue to benefit from our customer experience initiatives and disciplined cost management.","Our focus on cost controls, along with modest rate adjustments and growth in high margin businesses like high-speed data and Business Services, should allow us to again mostly offset the impact of elevated programming expense growth. As a result, our outlook for 2017 Cable operating margin is that it will be flat to down 50 basis points compared to 40.2% in 2016.","So now, let's move onto NBCUniversal's results. On slide 8, you can see NBCUniversal's revenue increased 13% and operating cash flow increased 14% in the quarter. Adjusting to include the acquisition of Universal Studios Japan in last year's results, pro forma revenue increased 10.5% and operating cash flow increased 7.8%.","Cable Networks revenue increased 4% and operating cash flow increased 2.4% to $916 million, reflecting higher distribution and content licensing and other revenue, partially offset by an increase in programming and production expenses, including higher sports rights costs.","Distribution revenue increased 4.7%, driven by contractual rate increases and contract renewals, partially offset by a slight decline in subscribers at our Cable Networks. Content licensing and other revenue increased 14.6%, due to the timing of content provided under licensing agreements as well as the sale of USA's Falling Water into SVOD. Advertising revenue increased slightly, as higher rates were mostly offset by ratings declines.","Broadcast Television had another strong quarter, with revenue growth of 14% and operating cash flow growth of 21.1%, to $264 million. This increase reflects higher advertising, content licensing and retransmission revenue, partially offset by higher programming and production spending. Advertising revenue growth of 12.4% included our premiere of Thursday Night Football and higher political advertising. Excluding these, advertising increased modestly, as strong pricing from the upfront outpaced ratings declines.","Content licensing increased 20.2%, primarily due to the availability of content provided under licensing agreements. Last, retransmission revenue increased 55% to over $200 million for the quarter, and totaled nearly $850 million for the full year. In 2017, retransmission revenues should reach nearly $1.4 billion, an increase of almost 65% over 2016, as a result of the recent successful renewals of a number of our distribution agreements.","Film revenue increased 12.6% to $1.8 billion and operating cash flow declined 15.3% to $121 million. These results reflect the full quarter of DreamWorks, which we acquired at the end of August. While the strong box office performance of Sing drove a 97% increase in theatrical revenue during the quarter, a tough home entertainment comparison to last year and DreamWorks-related expenses resulted in the 15.3% decline in OCF. For the year, Film generated about $700 million in OCF.","While this is down 43.5%, due to the difficult comparison to the record results that we achieved in 2015, 2016 nonetheless proved to be one of the best years in the history of our film studio. And in 2017, we are excited to have some of our biggest franchises return.","Theme Parks revenue increased 32.1% to $1.3 billion. And operating cash flow increased 41.9% to $640 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. On a pro forma basis for Universal Japan, revenue increased 13.2% and operating cash flow increased 18.4%. These results reflect higher attendance and higher per capita spending, driven by new attractions including The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Hollywood, King Kong and The Incredible Hulk in Orlando, and the Jurassic Park Coaster in Japan. In addition, the stronger Japanese yen has a positive impact, accounting for about 20% of the overall OCF growth.","Partially offsetting these results were higher costs associated with new attractions, and the impact of having to close our Orlando Park for two days due to Hurricane Matthew. As we look to 2017, we expect our investments in new attractions to continue to drive growth. As Brian mentioned, we are looking forward to Orlando opening a third gate with the Volcano Bay Water Park. In addition, we will be opening a Jimmy Fallon attraction in Orlando, and bringing the successful Despicable Me attraction to Japan.","Let's move to slide 9 now to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. Consolidated capital expenditures decreased 2.4% to $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter.","At Cable Communications, capital expenditures increased 1.5% to $2.1 billion for the quarter and increased 7.9% to $7.6 billion for the full year, resulting in capital intensity of 15.2%, which is in line with the plan we outlined at the beginning of the year.","The full year was led by customer premise equipment including X1 and wireless gateways, which remained the largest component of our capital expenditures, though spending declined modestly year-over-year.","We also invested in our network through increased spending in line extensions as we extended our network to more business and residential customers and in scalable infrastructure as we invested to increase our network capacity. These investments enhance our competitive position, allowing us to continue to take advantage of opportunities to grow penetration and market share by delivering the best broadband product to more homes and businesses.","For 2017, spending on CPE is expected to continue to decline, while we increase our investment in network capacity as well as our investment in line extensions to reach more customers. As a result, our outlook is for 2017 capital intensity to remain flat to 2016 at approximately 15%. Longer-term, as spending on CPE continues to decline as X1 scales and shifts to less expensive IP devices, we expect to see a decline in overall capital intensity.","At NBCUniversal, capital expenditures decreased 17.2% to $461 million in the fourth quarter and increased 4.8% to $1.5 billion for the full year. The full year growth was primarily driven by the inclusion of Universal Studios Japan and investments in the Orlando Park. In 2017, NBCUniversal's capital investment plan is expected to increase approximately 10%, reflecting the continued spending in Theme Parks, as these investments are clearly generating strong returns as they drive increased attendance and per capita spending.","Now before finishing on return of capital, let me build on Brian's earlier comments on wireless. In terms of how we'll report on our wireless initiative, we'll report the results of wireless in the Corporate and Other segment. And once the business is launched, we'll provide quarterly reporting on its key financial metrics.","The only guidance we can provide for 2017, since we still haven't launched our offering, is that the OCF of the Corporate and Other segment may see an additional $200 million to $300 million drag over the approximately $900 million of negative OCF in 2016.","Separate from the OCF impact of wireless is the working capital impact of providing handsets. Our approach will be to purchase the phones and collect handset-related payments from our wireless customers over time. While this approach to handset financing will impact the timing of our free cash flow recognition, we wouldn't expect it to impact overall company capital allocation plans. We are excited to launch and learn from our wireless initiative in 2017.","Now, let's finish on slide 10 with our capital allocation plans. To remind everyone, our capital allocation plan is a balance of several important priorities. The first is investing in our businesses to increase the long-term earnings capacity of the company, including our CapEx investment, the deployment of capital to enhance our existing businesses, and exploring growth opportunities. I believe the plan we have for 2017 will continue to demonstrate our prudent and consistent approach to investing in our businesses.","The second aspect of the balance is a healthy and steady return of capital to shareholders. As you can see on the left side of the page, Comcast has a great track record of consistent capital returns. In 2016, we returned $7.6 billion to shareholders, comprised of $2.6 billion in dividends and $5 billion in share repurchases.","For 2017, we are increasing our dividend 15% to $1.26 per share, which reflects our efforts to deliver a prudent dividend payout ratio balanced with a competitive relative yield, consistent with ranges in which the company has operated in the past. We believe we have a strong history in this respect. This is the ninth consecutive annual increase in the dividend. And the compound annual growth rate in our dividend from 2009 to 2016 was 22.2% versus 10.3% for the S&P 500.","In addition to the dividend increase, we expect to buy back $5 billion of stock in 2017, similar to our buyback in 2016. And the last element of balancing our capital return priorities is the imperative to maintain a strong balance sheet. We ended 2016 at 2.2 times leverage, and we continue to be comfortable operating with leverage around this level.","That concludes our summary of the quarter. I hope that everyone now has a good sense for how pleased we are with our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results as well as our momentum as we begin 2017.","Now, I'll turn it back to Jason to lead the Q&A session.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Mike. Regina, let's open up the call for Q&A, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. One for Neil and one for Steve, if that's okay; Neil, Brian outlined like several priorities for 2017. And there just seems to be a lot going on in your area. Could you give us color on maybe your top three priorities for the year?","And then for Steve, seven years later, there still seems to be some big buckets of growth opportunity for NBCU. Some of the more obvious ones seem like Telemundo, where your ratings are up pretty dramatically versus your competitor, consumer products and Theme Parks, obviously. Can you talk about some of the areas that provide the biggest upside? And maybe is Cable Networks the biggest risk for the year?","Neil Smit - Comcast Corp.","Hi, Jessica. This is Neil. I think the top three priorities are: continue to win in Video, rolling out X1 deeper into the base; drive and continue winning in HSD, where we roll out DOCSIS 3.1 and advanced gateways and drive Business Services; continue to rollout hyperbuilds and roll in all three markets, small, medium and enterprise. I think additionally, we're going to continue to focus on customer experience. And we'll roll out the wireless product in the middle of the year.","Stephen B. Burke - Comcast Corp.","So we've owned NBCUniversal now for almost exactly six years. And during that time, we've had the fastest compounded growth rate of any of the media companies. I still think there's a lot of opportunity, maybe not quite as much opportunity as there was in the early days, but you mentioned a few of the areas. Theme Parks, I think we have a long, long runway. As long as we invest and build more hotel rooms and have creative attractions, we, I think, have a lot of growth ahead of us there. Consumer products you mentioned. We were essentially out of the consumer products business six years ago. And now, that business I think is couple hundred million dollars of OCF and has a long, long runway as we build that out.","Telemundo's a great story, where Telemundo was essentially making no money at all. And it now makes a couple hundred million dollars a year. And, as you mentioned, our ratings would suggest in the future, we should make significantly more than that. But we have another dozen things that we're looking at investing in and trying to optimize and grow. And I think the easiest stuff, obviously, you do first, but I think we still have a lot of opportunity to continue to grow the company.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Jessica. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. I want to ask about X1 and about free cash flow. So on X1, either for Brian or Neil or both of you, when you look at the X1 deployment in 2017, and particularly the impact you've had recently deploying that product, how are the returns looking versus what you saw going back to the beginning of the deployment? I'm wondering if you're seeing the same kind of churn, ARPU lift, et cetera. And I know the product has obviously evolved. You mentioned Netflix. Just curious how you think about that going forward versus what we've seen in the past and if the low 60%s is sort of the maturation point for that product, in your mind?","And then on free cash flow for Mike, free cash flow in 2016, I think, was down year-on-year. It's a big working capital drag. I guess it's mostly NBC related, but you mentioned the wireless drag. Any help with free cash flow in 2017? And maybe help us think about how you prioritize free cash flow versus earnings from a financial management perspective of the company?","Neil Smit - Comcast Corp.","Ben, concerning X1, we continue to see very positive results consistent with early in the launch. We were at 48% penetration, going to low 60%s next year. I think ultimately, it could be a 75% to 80% penetration. DVR uptake is three times the legacy. Pay-per-view is two times. We get more additional outlets. We get more VOD viewing. So it continues to be an improved impact on retention and higher ARPU. So I think we're going to continue to drive it into the base, and it's continued to perform as well or better than expectations.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Before Mike jumps in, let me just add to that. If you look at our Video ARPU and combine that with the fact that we had the best Video year in 10 years, and half our base now is X1, it's pretty exciting to get the other half, however far it can ultimately go with that product. The product itself didn't remain static. The Netflix integration, just to name one, was a great achievement during the year. What we did during the Olympics was really special and, of course, voice, the amount of utterances.","The last thing is the team is really focused on reliability of X1, hardening the system. And I've seen a number of charts of sort of customers who've had it now for a couple years and what their churn and their reliability and their usage \u2013 and every way you study this thing, it looks like a fantastic product, game-changing product, and I think the results continue to encourage us to keep going.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","Ben, it's Mike. So on free cash flow in 2016, the decline was for the reasons we talked about on this call a year ago. It was a year where we had, in particular, a drag on working capital given the Olympics. But as you look at 2017, based on everything we've said earlier on this call, the operating results and momentum in both of the operating businesses, as well as a plan for good investments in the businesses, net of all that is we expect to grow free cash flow in 2017.","Beyond that, I would say it's our expectation to be growing free cash flow over the long term, though one year to the next, we'll have some variability based upon some of the investments and, obviously, some of the business cycles, but we do focus on it. It's a big, important factor as we're running the company. It's not the only thing we look at, though. So hopefully, that covers it for you.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Ben. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi. Thank you. Brian, I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about your wireless entry this year. And in particular, sort of how should we think about the MVNO agreement with Verizon? Should we think of the MVNO agreement as sort of an end state? That is, where \u2013 something that you think you can actually make a real sustainable long-term business or more as a stepping stone to a longer-term strategy, where you think of the MVNO really as sort of the market entry strategy instead?","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Well, I think what we've said was pretty clear. But just to go a little deeper into that now is I believe that we'll find out. But we're hoping that it's an end state strategy and that it's sustainable. And the goal of the business is to have better bundling with some of our customers who want to save some of their bill and get a world-class product and take a bundle and have lower churn. And if you can achieve that, we'll see. The economics really work. And that's the goal. And there's only one way to find out and it's to get started. And we're going to take it very carefully. And Neil's doing a great job getting us organized.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","So if I could ask a follow up then, Brian, is the Verizon relationship then, do you think of it as a network supplier or is it deeper than that? Is it really a partner in the wireless business?","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","I'm going to stop there and say stay tuned. And we'll clarify things. But we're putting together \u2013 we have a good relationship, we believe, and we're excited to get it launched. We'll learn a lot as we go. One example is the way X1 worked. We crawled, walked, ran, and we knew for sure that we had a really special thing before we really hit the pedal. And that allowed us to answer the previous question with a lot of confidence as we have a world-class product. And we think we have the piece parts, but we'll find out together and we'll be very transparent as we go.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","That's great. Thanks, Brian.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Craig. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Just a question for Mr. Smit. I think there's still some confusion, at least among our clients, about whether coax or fiber can support 5G. And so can you just elaborate sort of on your view of that? And in particular, any sort of color on where you are in terms of homes passed per node. Are we sort of at the 250 level, or is it lower than that? Any sort of color would be helpful. Thanks.","Neil Smit - Comcast Corp.","Well, hi, Jason. I think that 5G is an exciting evolution in the business. It has some characteristics that require densification of antennas. It propagates over short distances. It doesn't pass through physical objects very well. We're doing some testing right now. We think that it's going need economical space, power and backhaul. We have, call it, 150,000 miles of fiber across 650,000 miles of total plant. And we think that we're well-positioned to participate in the 5G rollout, no matter how it happens, as a result of having all those assets in place already.","Concerning the usage, I mean, our HSD usage went from a median of 88 gigabits per month in Q4, and that's up 55% from 57 gigabits during the same period of 2015. And if you look at cellular data usage, it's about 3 gigabits per month average. So there's a lot of capacity in the wired network. We feel comfortable with our position in participating in the overall 5G roll-out.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Is it fair to say that you can't support 5G on coax, but you may be able to do it on fiber? Is that too simple of a distillation?","Neil Smit - Comcast Corp.","I think that's a simple distillation. We're testing and we'll continue to learn. It's early in the roll-out.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Jason. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, Jason. One for Neil on video; it's great to see growing video subs. Is it still your goal to grow video at this or a faster pace, given the expansion of X1 and better customer experience? And how do you see that potentially offset by continued industry decline, driven by cord-cutting and MVPDs? And quickly a follow up on wireless; Brian, it sounds like we should be looking for a few cities to start maybe at mid-year and slow expansion from there. Is that fair?","Neil Smit - Comcast Corp.","We continue to see opportunity in Video and we'll continue to focus on growth of the business and gaining market share. We've seen competition before. We've continued to adjust and compete. We think X1 is a great platform and will continue to drive Video results. Brian?","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","I'm not going to add any color to our statement that we're going to launch something by the first half of the year, and we'll have more to say and we'll let you know when we're ready. We're not ready today to answer that.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Great. Thanks, Phil. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. Maybe just one more try on the wireless side, maybe for Mike. Any chance you could quantify or maybe bookend the working capital drag you expect from the wireless launch? And then maybe for Neil, shifting over to business; business, the growth is slowing a little bit. It seems to be sort of an emerging trend in the, you know, across the industry. Can you remind us where your market shares are both in the small and medium-sized business market, maybe the investment strategy, and whether you expect to see that deceleration sort of level off as we look out into 2017?","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","So it's Mike. So just on handsets, I made the point earlier that the whole thing in wireless is going be success-based, so I would wrap the comments on free cash flow for 2017 in what I said earlier. We expect to grow inclusive of everything and more to come later when we actually come back to talk about the wireless launch.","John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Got it.","Neil Smit - Comcast Corp.","In Business Services, we expect to continue to grow, generate double-digit revenue growth for the next several years by capturing share. It's a $5.5 billion revenue business. We've been growing about three-quarters of a billion dollars per year over the last couple years. We have about 20% share in small, 15% share in medium, and the opportunity in enterprise, we believe, is a $13 billion to $15 billion opportunity in our markets, so we see strong growth across all three segments.","John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, John. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Just a broader question, first, for Brian with the prospect of Trump-related tax reform and a deregulated FCC philosophy, can you talk about how if those sort of worked out based on current thinking, what would you do differently in terms of investment and return on capital? And a quick one for Neil; obviously, the Netflix carriage on the X1 platform, you guys talked about being very successful. Are these platforms willing to pay to be authenticated on these platforms? Is that a real opportunity as you add more applications on? Thanks so much.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Okay. Well, thanks for the question. I think regulatory certainty for investors is the same as it is for management. It helps you have the confidence to make long-term plans. And the kind of discussion we've been having this morning, whether it's fiber or other investments in in-home equipment, and what your business opportunities are, the more uncertainty, the less encouraging it is to want to invest. So we're encouraged by the prospect of rules that we believe will encourage that investment, stimulate investment, whether that's tax decreases or revisiting the authority of the government to go to places that they said they weren't going to, but legally they could go to in the Open Internet Order with Title II.","So we're looking forward to working with the new administration and the new regulatory leaders to try to frame something that's good for consumers, and it gives a stable platform that we can invest in and I think should allow us to accelerate both business opportunities and if there are things such as tax return, then revisit it where all that opportunity lies and how much gets returned to shareholders and invested in new opportunities. So we're encouraged and stay tuned.","Neil Smit - Comcast Corp.","Concerning the Netflix integration, I think it's a tribute to both the flexibility of the platform that we were able to integrate it so smoothly, and a tribute to Tony Werner and the Technology team and the speed with which they got it done. VOD viewing for the fourth quarter was up overall about 18%. And we want to offer more and complementary content to make the viewing experiences as rich and easy to access as possible. So we'll continue to seek other partners and integrate them into the overall experience.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI","Great. Thank you.","Neil Smit - Comcast Corp.","Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Vijay. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. I have two. The first one's for Steve. Assuming that, at some point, there is an increase in the national cap or the UHF discount is reinstated, what is your appetite to acquire stations? And then, my second question is for Mike and your view on capital returns. Just curious, how flexible is this? We are going to have the auction over. There's the potential for tax reform. So is this something that you will revisit from time-to-time or is your view on capital returns that it is a one-time thought process, and you'll revisit it again next year? Thanks.","Stephen B. Burke - Comcast Corp.","So we like the broadcast business. We think we're doing well in it. And recently, took an affiliation back from an affiliate in Boston and launched a station there, which we now own as of January 1 at essentially no cost. We had some start-up costs, but that, to me, was a wonderful way to increase our footprint. I don't think there's a necessity to increase our footprint, but I think if the caps get changed, we would certainly look at it and do what's right for the company.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","And, Marci, it's Mike. On capital return, it is an annual exercise. We take it seriously this time of the year and give what we think is the right guidance for what we'll do in the course of the year, factoring in everything we have a point of view on, obviously. So that would include everything, but, in this case, corporate tax reform. Corporate tax reform, we're in a wait and see mode. We're big supporters of the idea of corporate tax reform. We think it would be good for the U.S. economy, but none of our capital plans, none of what I've described today are counting on any particular changes in corporate tax. When all that is done, we'll do a holistic review of what it all means and come back and report. That may well be in this call next year. But if it happens really early in the year, we'll see.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Marci. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask a question on cable advertising and also one on the theme parks, if that's okay. First on cable advertising; excluding political, it's been pretty soft for a few quarters now. Is that something you view as cyclical or secular? And if it is secular, do you have any view on when you think revenue growth from advanced advertising will be large enough to offset it and bring you back to a growth trajectory there? And then, on the theme parks, I was just curious, Steve, what are the trends you're seeing with booking and reservations? I know it's been quiet on the Zika front lately, but are you seeing any impact from concerns re-emerging as the weather warms up this spring? Thanks.","Neil Smit - Comcast Corp.","This is Neil. On cable advertising, we have seen the core a little softer than in the past. Auto, in particular, is a little bit soft, but I think it may just be cyclical. And we are making up some of the difference in advanced advertising. We're seeing strong growth there. And I think we'll continue to build upon that capability going forward.","Stephen B. Burke - Comcast Corp.","So just to add to what Neil said about local cable advertising, the national advertising market is very strong. And it's been very strong now for a while. We had such a good upfront last year. One would have assumed that scatter might slow down. That often happens. That has not happened this time. And all of the indications, options, cancellations, the type of shows people want to get into, suggest to me that we have a good shot of having another very strong upfront nationally.","In terms of theme parks, all the bookings and advance indications for Florida and for California remain strong, quite strong. I think we're going to have a very big year in Orlando. We're opening, I believe, the world's best water park in the spring, and an attraction based on The Tonight Show, and that'll get a lot of publicity and a lot of attention. And hotels are 90% occupancy. Bookings look great and we got great new attractions. So my bet is that we're going to have a very strong year in both Orlando and in California. And then, Japan, we own 51% of Osaka. Japan has a Despicable Me attraction going in, and their attendance trends are good. So I think all green lights, as far as I can see, in the theme park business.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Bryan. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Instinet. Please go ahead.","Anthony DiClemente, CFA - Nomura Instinet","Thanks. I have for Mike and one for Neil. Mike, on the 2017 programming expense uplift, the 13%, just wondering on a net basis what that's going to imply for Cable OCF growth in 2017? So we're getting to around mid-single-digits and I assume it could decelerate. Can you just talk about that? And then, should it reaccelerate again in 2018 as the programming expense growth moderates, as you describe? And then maybe for Neil, back to the topic of set-top box integration, you talked about Netflix. Before year end, you signed a deal to integrate Sling into the X1 platform, so just wondering about that decision. Could you just talk about the thought process there? And does that one create any risk from a competitive standpoint over time? Thank you for the question.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","Thanks, Anthony, for the question. It's Mike. So on the first point, I'll just maybe restate some of what we said earlier which is that, yes, programming costs are high in 2017 for the reasons we described, which is big renewals happening in the second half of 2016 and early \u2013 with effective the beginning of 2017 and that rate comes down in the years that follow 2017 to something that looks more normal. I'd say the overarching and important point is all the work that Neil and team have been doing on non-programming costs.","So you saw it in 2016, where when programming costs were also higher than the normal long-term rates, great work to protect the margin of the overall business. And the guidance we gave for margin is that it'll be flat again to down 50 basis points in 2017. So, obviously, all the growth and initiatives that Neil has working to drive the top line will push through that margin. And I'll leave it to you to kind of model that out.","Neil Smit - Comcast Corp.","Concerning the Sling integration, we really were focused on the multicultural content that they had. It's an important segment for us to target, and we think they have great content and will be a good partner to integrate.","Anthony DiClemente, CFA - Nomura Instinet","Okay. Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Anthony. Regina, we'll take one last question, please.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. I want to ask about the customer service expenses. They were actually down year-over-year in the quarter. You mentioned you had fewer calls into customer service as a driver. And this is an area where you've just invested so much over the last few years. I'm wondering if what we saw is potentially an inflection point, meaning you're not simply benefiting through lower churn, but you're actually getting better operating leverage now through the P&L because of the sum total of the investments that you've made there.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","I think that's a good assessment. We've made investments on taking noise out of the system, reducing the calls, focusing the truck rolls, getting it right the first time, being on time and all those things, the move experience, the onboarding experience, we're very focused on. And the teams have done a great job, led by Dave Watson, in driving, as I said, some of the noise out of the system. And I think, ultimately, this will reflect itself in better profitability as we take unnecessary costs out of the system, and we retain customers for a longer period as a result.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And is this one of the key line items that supports your outlook for less upward pressure on non-programming expenses this year?","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Yes, it is.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking the question.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Great. Well, thank you, Brett, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. We'll wrap it up there.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Jason Armstrong. Please go ahead, Mr. Armstrong.","Jason S.

Brian and Mike will make formal remarks and Steve and Dave will also be available for Q&A. As a reminder, and this will be the last day this is in place but it is in place at this time, as part of the FCC's anti-collusion rules for the Broadcast Incentive Auction, we cannot discuss or answer any questions related to the auction or spectrum on today's call.","As always, let me now refer you to slide number 2, which contains our Safe Harbor disclaimer and remind you this conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, in this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our 8-K for the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.","With that, let me turn the call to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian?","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. We are off to a fantastic start, our fastest in five years. In the first quarter, we increased revenue by 9% and EBITDA by over 10%. These outstanding results were highlighted by NBCUniversal, which increased EBITDA by 24%, driven by strong growth at each business.","At Theme Parks, our multi-year momentum continues. A great example is the success of Harry Potter in Hollywood, where we saw a 60% increase in attendance this quarter. And we have some incredible new attractions in the second quarter.","In Orlando, Jimmy Fallon's Race Through New York opened earlier this month. And we think Volcano Bay will transform the water park experience for visitors when it opens as a third gate in just a few weeks. It looks amazing. And in Japan, we leveraged one of our most successful film franchises with the opening of Minions Park last week. Our confidence in the trajectory and leadership of the parks business under Tom Williams reinforced our decision to acquire the remaining 49% of Universal Studios Japan.","In Film, as I've said repeatedly, we have an exceptional management team at Universal that is taking smart risks and using skillful marketing, and the results speak for themselves. The first quarter's terrific performance was driven by a wide range of theatrical releases including Fifty Shades Darker, Split and Get Out, as well as the carryover success of Sing. Our box office strength has continued in the second quarter with Boss Baby and the exciting premiere of Fate of the Furious, which just set the new box office record with the biggest-ever global opening.","Turning to our TV businesses, NBC has maintained a healthy lead and as the season ends, remains the top-ranked network in primetime for the fourth consecutive season. Congratulations to Bob Greenblatt and everyone at the network.","At Cable Networks, we had a strong quarter. I would highlight MSNBC, which continued its outstanding performance with record ratings and even topped CNN in total viewers during weekday prime and total day for the quarter.","With our unified portfolio of NBC Broadcast, Telemundo and Cable Networks, we feel great about our position as we head into the advertising upfront. We will be selling into an exciting 2017-2018 season that includes our airing of three of the biggest events on television with the Super Bowl, the Winter Olympics and the World Cup on Telemundo. So really, a fabulous quarter from NBCUniversal, further validation of what a transformative acquisition this was for us, perhaps the best in our history.","Moving on to Cable Communications, I want to start by thanking Neil Smit for all that he has done as CEO of Comcast Cable. I can't say enough about Neil, and a number of you have reached out as well to say how fortunate we are to have had his leadership and character at Comcast over these seven-plus years. He handed over the company to his top leader, Dave Watson, who, as you can see already, is off to a very strong start.","We had an excellent quarter balancing robust EBITDA growth with terrific customer metrics. We added 297,000 customer relationships, a 10% increase compared to the first quarter of 2016, with 429,000 broadband subscriber additions and 42,000 video subscriber additions. We are also seeing good traction with XFINITY Home and now have nearly 1 million customers.","And our best opportunities are ahead of us with a roadmap to continue adding value for our customers and differentiating all of our products. Next month, we will be launching our new cloud-based smart home networking solution for customers with our Wi-Fi Gateway. We're going to call it xFi. Just like X1 has transformed how our customers experience television, we think this will be a game changer for Wi-Fi, enabling people to easily improve, personalize, manage and control their home network and the devices connected to it.","We also continue to add to the X1 platform. On the heels of our successful Netflix integration late last year, during the first quarter, we announced that we are also going to make YouTube content available on X1 all searchable using our beloved voice remote control. This will allow our customers to seamlessly browse and access billions of YouTube videos alongside our live and On Demand programming options.","And earlier this month, we unveiled our highly-anticipated wireless service, XFINITY Mobile, with simple, straightforward plans and a digital-first experience. We believe including mobile in our bundles will help improve retention and ultimately benefit lifetime customer economics. We are taking a disciplined approach to the wireless business, leveraging our existing customer relationships and infrastructure along with our access to Verizon's industry-leading wireless network. We expect to be NPV-positive per subscriber on a stand-alone basis once we reach a limited initial scale over time.","Our digital-first approach to XFINITY Mobile reflects a broader shift in how we view the future of the customer experience. We're making it a priority to give our customers the ability to interact with us through a variety of options in the digital world, including online, on devices and even through X1. We know this is what our customers want and we are working hard to provide the tools so they can do it with ease.","As we continue our effort to improve the experience, we've seen how quickly customers respond to these initiatives. You may recall about two years ago, we committed to making customer service our best product. We put meaningful investment towards this goal and it's really working. In the first quarter, we reduced customer calls handled by our agents by over 4 million, a double-digit improvement year-over-year. First-call resolution is at a multi-year high, a sign that we are making progress in terms of getting it right the first time when our customers call with an issue.","So I'm incredibly proud of these results across the entire company this quarter. And with our unique innovation platform to Comcast Cable and the industry-leading growth at NBCUniversal, we are off to a great start.","Mike, over to you.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","Good morning, everybody. I'm on slide 4 for those following the presentation online. As Brian just said, we had a great first quarter. Cable delivered terrific results, balancing strong financial growth with healthy customer metrics. And at NBCUniversal, we had phenomenal growth this quarter, with good contributions from all the business segments. So on a consolidated basis, revenue increased 8.9%. Adjusted EBITDA grew 10.4%. And by the way, adjusted EBITDA is the new label for the metric we previously called operating cash flow. Earnings per share was $0.53, a 26.2% increase on an adjusted basis, and we generated $3.1 billion in free cash flow during the quarter.","So now let's start with Cable Communications on slide 5. Cable Communications delivered strong first quarter results. Revenue increased 5.8% to $12.9 billion. We added 297,000 customer relationships, and we grew total revenue per customer relationship by 2.6%. Beginning this quarter, we are providing additional disclosure for residential and business customers, given the success of Business Services, which now annualizes at about $6 billion in revenue.","Now for the numbers, starting with our Residential business, we added 263,000 net new relationships, an increase of 11% over last year, and ended the quarter with nearly 27 million relationships. Contributing to these results were the positive benefits of customer retention with our Video and High-Speed Internet churn remaining at the lowest levels in over 10 years. Customers continue to respond to our innovative X1 platform, our best-in-class high-speed data product, and the meaningful strides we have made in improving the customer experience. Our ability to bundle our products is also a key driver of customer retention, and we continue to do so successfully with 71% of our residential customers now subscribing to at least two products.","In terms of the individual Residential revenue categories, High-Speed Internet continues to be the largest contributor to overall Cable revenue growth. Revenue increased 10.1% to $3.6 billion in the quarter, driven by an increase in our residential customer base and rate adjustments. Building on the strong performance in 2016, we added 429,000 total high-speed data customers in the quarter, with 397,000 of them being residential. We've invested to provide a best-in-class broadband product as we have consistently increased the speeds we offer our customers, and we continue to invest to improve the Wi-Fi experience in and out of the home.","We ended the quarter with 54% of our residential customers taking speeds of 100 megabits per second or higher. Looking ahead, we believe we have a long runway for growth in adding broadband customers and a great roadmap to provide additional value to our existing customers.","Video revenue increased 4.3% to $5.8 billion in the quarter, primarily due to rate adjustments as well as customers subscribing to additional services and an increase in our residential customer base. Of our 42,000 total video customer net adds in the quarter, 32,000 were residential. X1 continues to move the needle on the customer experience, ARPU and retention, driving higher customer lifetime value.","We ended the quarter with 52% of our residential video customers having X1 compared to 35% a year ago, and we continue to expect our X1 penetration will be in the low 60% range by year-end. Voice revenue declined by 3.6% to $863 million in the first quarter, reflecting a modest decline in ARPU as well as the loss of 27,000 net residential customers. We continue to believe that our voice product is a good value for our customers and an important part of our triple and quad play bundles.","Business Services delivered another solid quarter of double-digit growth, as revenue increased 13.6% to $1.5 billion during the quarter. We added 34,000 business customer relationships and grew revenue per business customer relationship by 5%. The small business segment accounted for about 70% of our revenue and 60% of our growth, driven primarily by the net increase in customers. And our mid-size and enterprise segments continue to grow at higher rates, given the strength of our product set and the earlier stage of our efforts in these areas.","Cable Advertising revenue decreased 6.3% to $512 million in the quarter, reflecting lower political revenue compared to last year. Excluding the political contribution, our Cable Advertising revenue decreased 2.3%, reflecting a challenging advertising environment this quarter, particularly in discretionary categories.","Turning to slide 6, first quarter Cable Communications EBITDA increased 6.3% to $5.2 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.3%, up 20 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2016. This is a terrific financial performance as we manage through a period of higher programming costs by offsetting this impact with strong revenue growth and real discipline on non-programming operating expenses.","Programming expenses grew 11.7% during the quarter, reflecting the timing of contract renewals. Because of these renewals, our programming expense growth should trend higher for the remainder of the year, consistent with our guidance at year-end.","Non-programming expenses increased 1.4% for the quarter, helping preserve margins given the increase in programming expenses. As we noted during our year-end call, this growth rate is trending lower than previous quarters as we benefit from our customer experience initiatives and overall disciplined cost management. Notably, Customer Service expenses declined 1.1% this quarter, even as we grew our customer relationships by 3.2%. Consistent with our objectives, we expect the rate of growth for our non-programming expenses to continue to trend lower this year compared to 2016.","Now let's move on to NBCUniversal's results. On slide 7, you can see NBCUniversal's revenue increased 14.7% and EBITDA increased 24.4% in the quarter. These strong results were driven by a successful box office, strong growth in retrans and affiliate fees, as well as the continued healthy performance at Theme Parks.","Cable Networks delivered strong growth this quarter, with revenue increasing 7.6% and EBITDA increasing 16.8% to $1.1 billion. This EBITDA growth is higher than recent trends of low to mid-single-digit growth, and it was the result of two factors. First, distribution revenue increased 8.6%, due to the successful renewals of a number of our distribution agreements, and should continue to contribute to healthy EBITDA growth for the remainder of the year. Second, content licensing revenue increased 54%, reflecting a new licensing agreement and is timing-related. Partially offsetting this growth was a 2.9% decline in Advertising revenue.","Broadcast Television delivered another solid quarter with revenue growth of 5.9% and EBITDA growth of 13.4% to $322 million. This growth was primarily driven by higher retransmission consent fees, which increased over 70% to $350 million and reflect the same contract renewals I just mentioned in Cable Networks. We remain on track to reach $1.4 billion in retransmission revenue this year, a 65% increase over 2016 results. In addition, Advertising revenue was stable compared to the first quarter of 2016, reflecting higher rates offset by audience rating declines and lower volume. Partially offsetting this quarter's EBITDA growth were higher programming and production costs.","Film revenue increased 43.2% and EBITDA increased 120.6% to $368 million. These results primarily reflect higher theatrical revenue, which increased by $415 million to $651 million due to the strong performances of Fifty Shades Darker, Get Out and Split, as well as the continued success of Sing in the quarter. In addition, Films' EBITDA growth reflects a positive contribution from DreamWorks, partially offset by higher programming and production costs.","Theme Parks revenue increased 9% and EBITDA increased 6.1% to $397 million in the first quarter. These results reflect higher attendance and higher per capita spending, despite an unfavorable comparison from the timing of spring break vacations. The Easter holiday occurred in the first quarter last year but occurred during the second quarter this year, creating a challenging comparison this quarter. If we adjust for this timing, EBITDA would have grown double digits this quarter.","We just opened the Jimmy Fallon attraction and we will be opening our third gate, the Volcano Bay water theme park, later this quarter. We expect these new attractions to drive growth at the parks this year.","Let's move to slide 8 to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. Consolidated capital expenditures increased 10.2% to $2.1 billion in the first quarter. At Cable Communications, capital expenditures increased 13% to $1.8 billion for the quarter, resulting in capital intensity of 13.8%. For the full year, we continue to expect capital intensity to remain flat to 2016 at approximately 15% of total Cable Communications revenue.","For the quarter, the increase reflects a higher level of investment in customer premise equipment related to the deployment of the X1 platform and wireless gateways. However, the increase is timing-related and we continue to expect full-year CPE spending to decline. In addition to our CPE investment this quarter, CapEx growth reflects a higher level of investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity as well as increased investment in line extensions.","At NBCUniversal, first quarter capital expenditures decreased 3.3% to $285 million, reflecting an increased investment in Theme Parks, offset by lower spending at headquarters. For the full year, we continue to expect NBCUniversal's capital investment plan to increase approximately 10%.","And now finishing up on slide 9, as I mentioned earlier, we generated $3.1 billion in free cash flow in the quarter. In terms of returning capital to shareholders, this quarter included: dividend payments totaling $657 million, up 7.5%; and share repurchases of $750 million. We do continue to expect to repurchase $5 billion of our common shares this year.","In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter at 2.2 times net leverage. This reflects investing activity this quarter, which primarily included a $500 million investment in Snap as part of its initial public offering, and the acquisition of Icontrol Networks. I would note that subsequent to the end of the quarter, we purchased the remaining 49% stake in Universal Studios Japan for $2.3 billion.","Regarding the recently-announced results of the FCC's Broadcast Incentive Auction, as Jason said, it is still the quiet period, so we cannot discuss or answer any questions related to the auction or spectrum strategy today. However, based on facts disclosed by the FCC, I can confirm that, first, in the reverse auction, NBC sold spectrum in New York, Philadelphia and Chicago for expected total proceeds of $481.6 million.","In the forward auction, Comcast invested $1.7 billion to acquire spectrum in the markets identified in the FCC's Public Notice. The average price Comcast paid per megahertz pop was $1.17. Hence, our net spectrum outlay is $1.27 billion. These results confirm the comments we made prior to the auction. We stated we would evaluate the opportunity and purchase spectrum only if we thought the price was right and if we thought the spectrum would have strategic value.","That concludes our summary of the quarter. I hope that everyone now has a good sense for how pleased we are with our results as well as our momentum for the rest of the year.","Now, I'll turn it back to Jason to lead the Q&A.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Great. Thanks, Mike. Regina, let's open up the call for Q&A, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

Can you talk about the drivers that, as you see them, for this year and beyond? And then finally, if I could just throw one last one in on the auction results, it showed incredible discipline on your part with the spectrum and footprint, the cost was way lower than I think anybody expected in the market. Can you discuss your plans for a ramp-up, including potential owner economics? I know you said you can't discuss specific spectrum results, but it does seem like you have a lot of optionality. Thanks.","David N. Watson - Comcast Corp.","Well, Jessica, Dave here. So thanks and I've been working with Neil on our strategy for a while now, so no great surprise that I'm going to stay focused on what's working. And I'm pretty comfortable, helped develop and with a really good Cable team, we've executed on three main areas, profitable growth, innovative products and services and constantly improving customer experience.","So we're going to keep focus on adding value to our customer subscriptions and we're going to keep delivering more innovation and backing it up with this experience improvement, so really good momentum around the innovation area, X1, broadband, Wi-Fi. Brian talked about xFi and now Mobile, so this will be a centerpiece for us. And we will stay and I will say focused on growth areas like Business Services.","Maybe of all the opportunities in front of us, the one that stands out maybe at the top of the list to me is taking the customer experience to the next level. There's real energy around this in the company; digital, giving our customers more capability to take transactions on, proactive network approaches, first contact resolution. And we're going to take key moments, like when customers move or when they on-board, and we're going to continue to make progress. There's real traction around that. It's good for customers and this is a, I think, the right way to drive healthy and sustainable efficiency. So our strength has been to maintain a good balance of healthy growth, driving share and revenue, and backing it up with solid financial performance.","So on a personal note, as Brian mentioned, I'll miss working with Neil. He's been a great partner, a great boss. However, I am excited about this next chapter. And with a very good Cable team, we're going to go after the opportunities in front of us. Steve?","Stephen B. Burke - Comcast Corp.","So we had a very good quarter in Film in the first quarter. But if you take Film out of the equation, the rest of NBCUniversal grew over 13% during the quarter. And by the way, I think we're going to have a very good quarter this second quarter in Film as well. But really, it's every part of the company hitting on all cylinders.","If you look at affiliate fees, we did a bunch of big deals at the end of the year. And you'll see in the numbers this quarter, affiliate fees were up, I think, 9%. And that's now built into our base, so that should continue to go throughout the rest of the year. In terms of ad sales, we're going to the upfront with the strongest hand we've ever had, by a lot. NBC primetime's relative advantage, in other words, we're in first place by more than we have ever been, I think going all the way back to the early 2000s. And Telemundo has been neck-and-neck with Univision in primetime, which was unthinkable five years ago.","MSNBC's beating CNN in prime most nights. And then as you go into next year, we have the Super Bowl, the Winter Olympics and the World Cup on Telemundo, so we couldn't be going into the upfront with a stronger hand. I think the advertising market is quite strong. We've already started discussions with big advertising buying groups. And I think we have a lot of momentum and a lot more to go.","When we first looked at NBCUniversal when we bought it, we were making a little less than $3.5 billion. I think this year, we're going to be somewhere in the $8 billions, $8.3 billion, $8.4 billion, $8.5 billion, so we've added about $5 billion worth of cash flow in the last six years. I think we can continue to find places to grow. I don't know what inning we're in, but we're certainly not in the ending innings of above market growth. We still have a lot of opportunity areas, consumer products, Telemundo, a lot of different parts of this business that are yet to build out, and we're excited to continue to do that in quarters ahead.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","And finally, Jessica, it's Mike. On spectrum, we can't speak to the spectrum, other than to confirm what we did, which I did earlier. But I'll just say we approached it the way we said we would before the auction started, and we're pleased with the outcome. We'll leave it at that for today.","Jessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Jessica. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you. Maybe for Brian, you've been an observer of the wireless industry for decades now, and with the end of the anti-collusion rules, can you give us a sense of, sort of, how you view the wireless industry today from a competitiveness or from a strategic standpoint, and talk maybe about whether or not the secular changes we're seeing, maybe in terms of usage and technology, how important or critical is it becoming to your offering on the cable side? Thanks.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Well, we've been talking about wireless for 20 years. And we sold our wireless company, which Dave ran and that was how Dave came into Comcast Cable. And I don't think we have any regrets with that decision. And the question of where wireless is and where it's going, I think we've done a really good job of making sure the company now has that offering in our bundle. It is for our bundled customers. It is in our footprint. And it is going to be a fabulous value for those customers with the brand-new product that you would buy, a new cell phone, tablet. It will have premier coverage from both Verizon Wireless' network and our best Wi-Fi network and it's going to intelligently allow you to be on Wi-Fi without having to log in. And any time there's extended Wi-Fi, it will automatically give you all your capabilities.","And coupled with that, as we were talking about, a great digital experience, where there's really just two options; all you do is you push the app and you see how many gigabits you've consumed. You pay $12 a gigabit. And if at any time you want to just click a button, push one button and you're now unlimited. And based on what package customer you are, it's either $45 or $65 for that unlimited option and you can switch back. If you're going out of the country, if you're not going to use your phone, push the button to go by the gig. You get five devices and there's no line charge for any of those devices if you're one of our broadband customers. That's pretty great. And I think, in our minds, that gives us what we need.","And so we are always looking at where future technologies are going and things of that nature, but, right now, I think we look at our results today, compare them to anything that we've seen and take Jessica's comment a moment ago, I couldn't be more pleased with the portfolio of our company and the trajectory we're on, and leave it at that and say we're really pleased with the team's effort.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, John. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. Two quick ones, if I can, Cable margins were up year-over-year and the low non-programming expenses were particular heartening. Is this a good run rate for those non-programming expenses or could the rate improve further from here on Mike's cost initiatives? And second, quickly on Home Security, thanks for breaking that out. I guess 1 million or so is the magic number. Can you add some more detail on this in terms of residential versus business mix and some level of revenue per user? And is this still on the Other revenue line of Cable or is it mixed into Business Services as well? Thanks.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","So it's Mike. Just on Cable margins, we gave guidance for the year that we'd be flat to down 50 basis points for the year, with programing costs continuing to be high this year and that we did expect to drive improvement in the rates on non-programming expenses. So had a very good first quarter, but as far as going down the road on changing any guidance, we're not doing that. That said, I'll hand it over to Dave to give some qualitative stuff of what he's doing because all that will really continue.","David N. Watson - Comcast Corp.","Well, we expect the rate of growth for non-programming expenses to trend lower in 2017 compared to 2016 and this is as we continue to focus on the benefit from the customer experience initiatives that Brian outlined, I talked about. And we will continue to have really focused cost management, so there's big opportunities. While we're not changing anything in regards to the margin and where things are going, what we're focusing on is continuing to take transactions out, by just doing a better job of handling repeats and all the digital capabilities and we're seeing it really take hold.","So I think there's upside in regards to these operational efficiencies. This will be online. This will be through apps. And actually, right through X1 itself, you'll be able to resolve issues. So the voice remote will connect you to content. The voice remote will also be a service option. So we're excited about this. This is going to be a big focus in regards to efficiencies, but no changes, obviously, as Mike said, to margin guidance.","And on Home Security, the second part, excited about Home Security. This is another good opportunity we talked about another option for us in terms of packaging. Just in our footprint alone, it's a $9 billion opportunity. And so we added the 66,000 for the quarter and just about 1 million customers at this point. So the benefits for Home Security continue to be in packaging. We have over 90% of our customers, Home Security customers, are subscribing to three or four product bundles and half of these customers are brand new to us.","So it opens up, as I expect Mobile to and has been proven with XFINITY Home, it helps consideration. So we're bringing new people in to think about overall, our packaging. So we're pleased with it. We are not giving any financials as the specifics of Home Security, but it's a healthy contributor to our efforts.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, Dave.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Phil. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. A couple questions for Steve. Can you just talk about advertising at the stations versus the networks? I just got back from the NAB and I think the ad environment is a lot more tempered, both from a short-term and a long-term basis, so just curious on your thoughts there. And also, any thoughts on the potential impact of a writers strike? I know you had positive comments on the upfront, but just thinking about that. And then secondly, I guess for Dave, the press keeps reporting that Comcast has an elective desire to go outside your footprint. Can you talk about why this strategy might or might not make sense?","Stephen B. Burke - Comcast Corp.","So let me start with the writers' strike. I think in the majority of cases, things get resolved. And I'm optimistic and hopeful that the writers' strike will get resolved. Strikes aren't good for anybody. The people on both sides of the table tend to lose and I'm hopeful that we're going to get it done. And we're coming down to the deadline.","In terms of local advertising, I think the national and local markets are quite different and exhibit different characteristics. I do think there's more weakness in local. I think national is quite strong, but I think local has pockets of weakness. We're in a unique position because we have gained so much share at the NBC stations, and the Telemundo stations are growing so quickly in terms of ratings, that we're not as affected. We've grown EBITDA very substantially in the owned stations over the last few years. So we're feeling good about the local station market. Our retransmission consent numbers are growing very, very dramatically and our ad sales are just fine, but I do think it's a fair comment that the local advertising market is weaker than the national one.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","I think the second part in regards to out-of-footprint opportunities, Marci, there're kind of two things. One, we think we have a lot of opportunity just in our footprint. It's a big upside. We continue to believe in what we're doing. So that's the first thing. The second thing, we just haven't found the business model that works outside. We'll keep evaluating, keep looking at it, but our success within our footprint is packaging, bundling. So we'll continue to drive that internally within our footprint.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Okay, Marci. Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi. Thank you. Yeah, first, let me add my congratulations to your new role, Dave. That's terrific news. So I guess since we've sort of beaten the thinly-disguised M&A questions to death, I'm going to turn to something else. There's so much expectation about 5G wireless as a competitor in your footprint, I wonder if you could just talk about what your own internal strategic analysis of 5G as a competitor has told you about that. And then, Dave, if I could ask a somewhat technical question about your new wireless service, can you talk about when you expect to have, or if you expect to have, hot handoffs between the Wi-Fi network and the wireless network? And is that permissible under the Verizon agreement?","David N. Watson - Comcast Corp.","Well, first off, thank you, Craig, and appreciate that. Let me start with 5G and I'll get to the Wi-Fi question. First, the main thing with 5G, reminding everybody, I think folks know, it is early. I've been through it before, back in the day, in wireless. There are promising, really promising, aspects of the new technologies, but it takes time to scale. So while there may be early-stage applications of something like 5G, we compete today with microwave applications, the MDUs in dense urban areas. So, again, while there's promise, we're going to stay close to it. We're testing both fixed and mobile aspects of it.","And I think the main question for 5G, at least for us, with this higher frequency range, can it be used to broadly, reliably and economically deliver fixed wireless broadband? So we're going to stay right next to it, and I think we're on the same testing curve as everybody else. I don't believe, at this stage at all, that it's a significant threat in regards to the wireless fixed broadband side.","But in the meantime, on that front, we're not standing still. We're going after DOCSIS 3.1. We're rolling it out. We'll have 65% of that deployed by the end of the year. We're working on great devices; the best wireless gateway that we have, that'll deliver 1 gig capability. So this will continue to improve our competitive position as this evolves, and we'll stay close to it.","As to the question on the wireless side and the technical side, no new news in terms of the timeframe. I would say we are working on the Wi-Fi capability. As Brian mentioned, we got a good first step in terms of the auto connection, just taking some of the pain points out of the interaction between 4G and Wi-Fi, simplifying that process. The next step that we're on, that's one of them, but no timeframe to deliver that seamless handoff.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. Thank you, Dave.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thanks, Craig. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Question on cable on the Wi-Fi front, and one for Steve on NBC. For Dave or Brian, either one of you, I'm curious. How do you think we should be thinking about xFi and what that might mean for your business? I guess what I'm trying to get a sense of is what does it mean to make Wi-Fi great for the consumer? How important is this to your mobility efforts? And how you think about selling this? Is this something you're going to be pushing into the base? I believe you've been sort of upgrading gateways and routers for years now and so probably have relatively new equipment in the field, but how you're thinking about the cost and benefits of this.","And then for Steve, when you guys did the NBC deal, the Cable Networks were the high-growth asset. And everything else was sort of, we'll see what happens. And today, the world sort of turned around and people are most excited about the non-Cable Network businesses and concerned about Cable Networks. You're pared some of your networks back. There's a lot happening with the bundle out there, but you put up some pretty nice affiliate revenue growth this quarter, which sounds like it will continue. Can you give us a little bit of a state of the state for the business as you think about the growth opportunity ahead of the Cable Networks segment, which is an area certainly people are more nervous about? Thank you.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Okay. Ben. Got a lot in there so we'll see if we can cover all that or we'll take a shot. Let me just kick off on the xFi, which is we're going to talk about it a little bit down the road so let me leave a little bit as we put it out there, but as a strategy matter, a couple relevant things. First of all, as I don't have to remind you, we have more broadband customers than we do video. And the rate of that growth is pretty exciting in broadband.","So as we built and I think completely remade Comcast in the last decade into an innovation and technology thinking and new products company, our team looked at the broadband space and said, well, right now, it's really just speed is the main differentiator. But our usage of broadband in the home, whether it's your home printer, your tablets, smart devices, home security is just exploding with the amount of things. And if you project out two, five, 10 years, you're going to see more and more use of broadband in the home. That's the bet we're making. I think it's a fairly safe bet.","So how do we bring the same innovation mentality that we did to video the last decade with the incredible X1 and then the voice remote and the content and the rights management all working seamlessly for the consumer? And that's the trajectory that I think the team is on. We're going to deliver to our broadband customers levels of options of services, levels of speeds and services, but also a mindset of innovation, constant innovation. And some of the things \u2013 and Dave, you can go into specifics or we can hold that, but I think it's demonstrating to us that we have a leadership and we're going to use that leadership opportunity to innovate.","David N. Watson - Comcast Corp.","Well, let me offer just a couple things. We are excited about xFi. It'll rolled out later, so more to come. But our goal is to do to broadband what we did with video and X1, create a much better experience of Wi-Fi. Our strategy has been to focus in the home with providing great Wi-Fi because great high-speed Internet is not just a connected experience; it's Wi-Fi spread throughout the house. So xFi is simply three things: it's great speed; it's great coverage; and then this next generation cloud capability control. It lets you define the user experience throughout the household.","So, again, more to come on that, but I think it's a premium position for us and evidence that we're going to keep growing the broadband category, not just on speed, but coverage is awfully important so we'll control over time, so more to come.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Just to be clear, it doesn't require everybody to go get a new device. There may be some opportunities for customers to want to upgrade to different things, but as we launched XFINITY with an X1, it was when we reached a certain level, you got a certain service. You were no longer in the past. You were in the future. I think that's the mindset as we're thinking about this.","David N. Watson - Comcast Corp.","That's a great point. It will have approximately 10 million customers can immediately benefit from this in terms of the devices. So they'll be new devices, existing devices, so we're in pretty good shape to go after a large chunk of our customers.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Helpful. Thank you.","Stephen B. Burke - Comcast Corp.","Cable Networks, which grew, I think, 17% in terms of revenue this quarter, I think that's going to be a high watermark. I don't think we're going to replicate that many quarters in the future. I think this is still a good business. It's a very profitable business and it's a business we should be able to grow. I don't think we're going to grow it more than, call it, low to mid-single-digit growth rate, but you've basically got a bunch of different ways that you make money. You've got affiliate fees, which in this quarter went up 9%.","That won't always be the case, but affiliate's fees should go up. You've got ad sales, which is a function of ratings and CPM. And, to a degree, they cancel each other out, but I think it's quite possible that we will have quarters where ad sales go backwards. But if affiliate fees go up and ad sales go backwards, you can still have revenue growth.","And then the other way you obviously make revenue is by content distribution deals with people like Netflix and Hulu and Amazon. And we had a good deal in this quarter, which increased that. And then you can also make money on digital and other new technologies. Over-the-Top I think is going to be moderately beneficial to these businesses. We're not counting on Over-the-Top being a huge impact, but I think it will be moderately beneficial. And it's going to be a grindier business than it was, but it's a lot of cash. And I think our job is to continue to grow the legacy businesses and the businesses that are very profitable but have a lower growth rate, while at the same time investing in things like theme parks, consumer products, Telemundo, digital, et cetera, that have higher growth rates and hopefully blend it to something that is attractive to investors.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, everybody.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Ben. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you, just want to talk about Business Services quickly. What sort of investments can we expect you to make in terms of sales and engineering as you see that grow? And then, if you could comment also on network investment with regards to the Chairman's commentary about Open Internet Order. If that goes as described, what sort of new quantifying growth investment opportunity you might see that that would open up?","David N. Watson - Comcast Corp.","Let me take Business Services, Frank. So one of the things that, right from the beginning to look at, we're still, there's a lot of opportunity and upside around growth and you look at the three basic categories that we have: SMB, we're at 40%; penetration midmarket, we're at 10% penetration; enterprise, less than 5%. So I think extensions, plan extensions, it's success-based, but opportunistically looking at a couple of proactive ones where they make sense and get a good return, we'll continue to evaluate those. And we think those are good sound areas to keep investing. We like our rate of growth. Bill Stemper and his team are doing a fabulous job. So it's an area that will continue to have sustainable good revenue growth, but we'll invest to keep that going.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","I think, on your regulatory question, we're encouraged that the FCC made the announcement yesterday and is beginning a process to revisit whether Title II is really the right regime. We've said for a long time that we think it puts a damper on ability to invest and react to change. And we steward a lot of capital every year. And so having the right kind of consumer protections and Net Neutrality, which we've said we support and want, but not in a regulatory regime designed for a different era that doesn't apply to the business.","And so the beginning of that conversation is heartening and I think it will allow for, hopefully, an end result that balances the need for consumers and our commitment, legally enforceable, for those consumers to know that they can surf an open and free Internet, but not do so in a way that has real dark clouds for our investment community.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Frank. Next question, please.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI","Thank you. Two questions, first for David, the virtual MVPD market seems to be scaling. Can you talk about what impact Comcast's broadly seeing? We've seen some of your competitors not show good subscriber trends. . The press has talked about it. Can you talk about what market segment is that really going target? And then for Mike, obviously, there's been talk about tax reform, maybe a little early on a view there, but if that does happen, how do you sort of look at capital allocation from return on capital and investment in broadband? Thank you.","David N. Watson - Comcast Corp.","Let me start, the competitive landscape. So there's no question that video, high-speed, both are competitive, but it has been competitive. I'd start with maybe the most important thing I'd tell you is we added 42,000 video customers in the quarter and so there's a lot to that in terms of what we're doing. The good news is it's not one thing that puts us in that position. Let's start with a fantastic X1 platform.","How we go to market through segmentation and packaging that make sense for customers, and I would say we're in the early innings of operational improvements and how we deliver good bundles, good packaging, that helps us compete. So one of the main things that we look at is constant churn improvement and making sure that, as we have success, which I think we're holding our own, on attracting new customers, but we also want to hold onto folks longer.","So I think that our product position is strong and how we compete against folks when \u2013 we've been going up against discounted video offerings for some time. And so we look at the new entrants as a broad category and we won't necessarily chase everything. We stick with our guns. Our guns are developing and providing great products and good healthy packaging and taking broadband video, whether it now, home security, phone and\/or mobile. I think that will help us compete. So to the extent that we go and leverage any other form of lower priced tiers, we do that in an extremely targeted and segmented way, and we think that that helps us compete. So I like our position and like our momentum. We had, again, good quarter, feel good about the video momentum, even with the increased competitive climate.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","And, Vijay, on capital returns, so the company's got a great track record of being very thoughtful about how we balance our needs to invest in the business and return capital to shareholders. So we maintain a strong capital structure, as you know. And we think that's strategically important. We like the idea of consistently increasing the return of capital to shareholders, but making sure that we keep the ability to allocate strategic capital to take advantage of opportunities when they arise.","So it's way too early on tax reform to say anything, other than we seemingly are positioned well to be a beneficiary of the various ways in which it might shake out. And once we have some final details, we'll take all that into consideration through the lens that we've always talked about, our balancing capital priorities.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI","Great. Thanks so much.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Vijay. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Thank you. So the trends in Other costs in the Cable segment are really encouraging and I'm wondering as we look ahead to next year with programming costs reverting to more normal trends of growth, if you can maintain this lower growth in Other costs, it seems like we could see real meaningful margin expansion for the first time in a few years after sort of years of investment in the business. It looks like you could do at least sort of 100 to 150 basis points of margin expansion in the Cable segment. And I'm not expecting you guys to give guidance at this point for next year, but I'm just wondering if we're thinking about the trends in the business in the right way?","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","Well, Jonathan, it's Mike. Thanks for the question. I mean, Dave covered earlier all of the things that are ongoing in the business, in terms of attacking non-programming expenses. And we've commented previously on where programming goes. So the answer, as I said earlier, is we're not going to go beyond the guidance we already gave of margins for this year, but we'll keep working on optimizing the business for the long term and we'll be back to you early next year with our thoughts.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Thanks.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Jonathan. Regina, we'll take one last question, please.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Instinet","Thanks for taking my question. My question is for Steve, really, on the theme of the value of sports rights. So since the last earnings call, we saw Amazon pay $50 million for the Thursday Night Football NFL rights, putting up behind a paywall. NBC Sports, obviously, shares the linear deal with CBS. How do you, Steve, think about that agreement now as it comes up for renewal? And just on sports more broadly, how do you think about valuing the linear side of sports rights in an environment where those rights could become more bifurcated? You have linear on the one side and then you have the Internet players bidding up the value of the streaming rights of the other side. Love to hear your updated thoughts there. Thank you.","Stephen B. Burke - Comcast Corp.","Well, I think it's early on. I mean, if you look at the ratings for Sunday Night Football or Thursday Night Football when Twitter had the deal, or the Olympics when we do our streaming, streaming is typically very low single-digit percentage of the total. And then in many of these deals, and this is the case with the Twitter deal and the Amazon deal, the same ads that are on linear are also in the digital feed. So from an aggregating-an-audience point of view, it really has been a very minimal impact, and the impact is combined.","I think more broadly, we feel very good about our sports deals. We have an Olympics deal that goes out until 2032. And we have a long-term NFL deal. And these are deals that really make their money on advertising. The bulk of the money that we make on the Olympics is because we're advertising on primetime. They're not affiliate fee-related. They're not related to the number of subs that are in the MVPD universe.","These are deals that basically wash their face very nicely based on advertising and they're long term, and so we like the sports business a lot. We think a company like ours should be in the sports business. The Olympics are part of the DNA of NBCUniversal. And it's a good business, in our opinion, going forward for many, many years. Families will gather to watch major sporting events. And they're going to want to watch it predominantly, not always, not 100%, but predominantly on a big screen. And we're happy to be the company that brings those big events to them.","Brian L.

I also think, Dave, hopefully, everybody else can see why we're so excited to have Dave leading the Cable division. He's got a grasp of the issues. He's going to take the work that Neil started and he started with him, and accelerate us and focus even better as we go forward and pick priorities as we now go into new businesses, and his expertise is particularly perfect at this moment.

Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. We were off to a terrific start in 2018 with first quarter revenue growth of over 10% and healthy EBITDA, earnings per share and free cash flow. I'm really proud of these results, which reflect strength across all parts of Comcast NBCUniversal. We have such a special company with a collection of scaled businesses, each executing at a high level and substantial opportunities for continued growth led by our margin accretive segments. We have a business model that works well, and we see more and more of our peers attempting to pivot towards a similar strategy of integrating distribution and content. We think our team has done a great job of this, particularly with NBCUniversal, as you can see in today's results.","This successful execution led us to make an announcement earlier this year that further strengthens this strategy with our proposal for Sky. This morning, we're excited to take the next logical step with a formal binding cash offer for Sky. The terms are consistent with what we already outlined in our 2.4 announcement and Mike will provide some additional color on this later. So let me turn now to our strong first quarter results.","Starting with Cable, our connectivity businesses, including residential broadband and business services are now at a nearly $24 billion annualized revenue run rate combined, growing over 9% with significant runway ahead. We are confident in our outlook for high-speed Internet subscribers as the total market continues to grow our homes and businesses past steadily increase and our focus on product innovation and differentiation through speed, coverage and control elements enables us to continue to grow and take share.","In business services, we're making nice strides in our newest segment serving enterprise customers and also continuing to gain in the small and mid-size business space with superior products and attractive value proposition. We have built an incredible organization within our company with over 10,000 employees dedicated to our business services efforts and more than 3,000 of them are sales professionals helping us add new business customers every day. In the first quarter, we added almost 380,000 net new broadband customers grew residential high-speed Internet revenue by 8% and business services revenues by 12%. Fueled by these businesses and our ongoing customer experience efforts, we're on track to increase Cable margins for the full year in 2018.","While investing in a network to strengthen our position in our connectivity businesses remains a priority, we expect overall capital intensity to decline in Cable. Altogether, this puts us on a path for healthy Cable EBITDA and net cash flow growth as our first quarter results demonstrate. We continue to increase customer relationships with 273,000 net new additions balanced with healthy EBITDA growth of nearly 5% and margin expansion.","Cable net cash flow, which is EBITDA less total capital spending, grew nearly 13%, which is the fastest rate of growth in six years. As you can see, our Cable business overall remains well positioned for the future. The team is also capably reacting to and managing the ongoing changes in the video competitive landscape. This includes the increasing presence of virtual MVPDs which contributed to our net loss of 96,000 video customers in the first quarter. We remain focused on finding innovative and profitable ways to deliver the best video and most complete experience to our customers.","We have pivoted X1 to be a whole-home platform that aggregates the best content, not just linear TV. We recently added Sling TV's international programming, joining YouTube, Netflix, Pandora, to name just a few of the partners we've already integrated. X1 also serves as a dashboard for WiFi connectivity and home automation, with recent launch of xFi notifications and new Voice Remote commands that help manage our customers' smart home devices.","The value that this seamless integration of services brings to our customers is quite apparent. X1 has quickly become the most used platform for Netflix viewing among our customers. We are excited to deepen our relationship with Netflix with our recent announcement that Comcast will begin packaging Netflix with TV offers, creating an additional revenue source for our company.","It has been about a year since we entered the wireless market with our launch of Xfinity Mobile and we are pleased with the results so far. Our offers are clearly resonating, adding value to our customers by bundling wireless together with access to our high-speed Internet at attractive prices. We ended the first quarter with 577,000 customer lines and continue to enhance this offering with features like bring your own device.","In addition, last week we announced the new operating platform partnership with Charter, the result of our continuing collaboration aimed at getting to scale more quickly through operational and cost efficiencies as we develop our respective mobile businesses, enabling both companies to better compete in the national wireless market.","Finally, our results continue to benefit from our ongoing efforts to make interacting with us simpler and more consistent, including through more all-digital tools. In the first quarter, we reduced calls handled by our agents by 13% and increased the portion of customers interacting with us only digitally by about 15% year-over-year. I'm proud of the consistent progress we are making with these metrics and our room for further improvement bodes well for the future.","Turning to NBCUniversal, we are well positioned to succeed in an evolving media landscape with our high-quality sports, news, and entertainment content fueling strong results at our TV businesses, our focus on leading franchises at Filmed Entertainment, and a fantastic trajectory in our high-margin Theme Park businesses. This strategy again delivered terrific results in the first quarter, with EBITDA increasing by double-digits, highlighted by exceptional growth at our TV business and Theme Parks.","Broadcast and Cable Networks, collectively delivered 23% EBITDA growth, underscoring the power of our Big Event Strategy as well as continued distribution and retrans strength. The Olympics generated over $1.1 billion of revenue at our TV businesses and were a tremendous success. The Games averaged nearly 20 million viewers in prime time over all 18 nights across broadcast, cable, and digital. And NBC's prime time viewership was over 80% higher than ABC, CBS, and Fox combined, the widest margin on record for a Winter Games.","I'm extremely proud of the efforts across the company from NBC's fantastic and very personalized and human coverage to the amazing Olympics dashboard on X1 that made it easier than ever to access all of the moments that make it such a special event. The results within our Cable footprint highlight the benefits of the entire organization working together, as ratings in X1 households for NBC and NBC SportsNet prime time coverage were 26% higher than the national average. We think of the Olympics as a technology laboratory for the future of television.","NBC also aired the Super Bowl in the first quarter, which generated over $400 million in advertising. Notably, the broadcast of This Is Us after the game was the highest-rated scripted series following a Super Bowl in over a decade.","On the back of these incredible big events, NBC is on track to finish number one for the fifth consecutive year in demo and is number one in total viewers for the first time in 16 years. We also have the fastest-growing cable network with MSNBC and a number one cable entertainment network with USA.","At Theme Parks, another quarter of double-digit EBITDA growth reflects continued strength from Volcano Bay in Orlando and Minion Park in Japan. And there is more to come this year with several exciting attractions debuting across our parks this spring that leverage our own intellectual property, including a Fast & Furious ride in Orlando, Kung Fu Panda in Hollywood, and a Hollywood-themed night parade in Japan celebrating films, including Minions and Jurassic World.","Speaking of Filmed Entertainment, as we expected and communicated, we face a tough comparison to last year's record results. We continue to focus on our franchise strategy and are pleased with the performance of first quarter releases, including Fifty Shades Freed, which brought that series across the $1 billion mark. And we are looking forward to Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom coming to theaters in June.","So I'm incredibly proud of the team's performance this quarter and excited about the opportunities ahead for our company. I believe today's announcement for Sky will further strengthen our successful strategy and momentum.","We love our position owning content and distribution businesses that individually have a great outlook and together make each other stronger. We think Sky is an outstanding company that follows this same formula, with a similar business model in new and attractive geographies. We believe Sky, when combined with Comcast NBCUniversal, will create an even stronger and more international business with an increased ability to invest in content and innovation.","Much like Comcast NBCUniversal is in the U.S., innovation is at the core of Sky's culture, and it has a portfolio of attractive content. A larger combined base of 52 million customers will help support the ability of a combined Comcast Sky to invest more in original and acquired programming and technology capabilities as we strive to deliver truly differentiated customer experiences.","When opportunities arise from unique timing and company-specific situations, we look to take advantage, while viewing any potential transaction through the lens of both financial and offensive strategic impact.","Financially, we evaluate opportunities against alternative uses of capital, including buying back our stock as well as accretion to free cash flow per share, and ultimately, the ability to exceed the cost of capital in a reasonable timeframe.","Strategically, we are focused on where we can enhance our position through scale with complementary businesses that provide us with new capabilities, new markets, and other growth opportunities. We think Sky is a great fit when judged against these criteria.","So in closing, we like our outlook at Cable. And NBCUniversal continues to grow at a faster pace than any of us originally imagined. The whole team is off to a great start this year.","And with that, now let me turn it over to Mike for more details.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everybody. Let me start by providing the details on our Sky announcement, which is a binding cash offer known as a Rule 2.7 firm offer under the UK Takeover Code. The key terms are consistent with our original proposal back in February, an all-cash offer for \u00a312.50 per share and acceptance condition of 50% plus one share.","Our various intention statements related to investment in the UK are all consistent with the Rule 2.4 announcement. And our commitment to Sky News has been strengthened with a pledge to establish an independent Sky News editorial board, maintain investment, and to not acquire a controlling interest in any UK newspapers.","In terms of process, in the near future, we'll file for EC antitrust approval, which would kick off a 25-day Phase I review. We still expect to complete all regulatory reviews in a timely manner so that Sky shareholders will be in a position to review our offer without any regulatory concerns attached.","In terms of the financial and strategic merits of the transaction, let me add to what we have said before. We believe this is a financially attractive transaction. New information in the 2.7 announcement today is a synergies estimate of around $500 million achieved through a combination of revenue benefits and recurring cost savings across the combined company.","These are expected to be achieved through optimizing Comcast and Sky's complementary operations with only limited impact on head count expected. We believe those synergies, combined with the strength of Sky's standalone business, which we've spent more time studying, makes this a compelling transaction based on a variety of measures.","To reiterate what Brian mentioned, we evaluate all opportunities against alternative uses of capital. This includes buying back our stock, investments we make in our own business, as well as other inorganic opportunities.","Quarterly evaluation is optimizing for a range of criteria, including accretion to free cash flow per share and the ability to earn and exceed the cost of capital in a reasonable timeframe. All balanced with potential strategic merits of the transaction.","In essence, transactions that are financially sound and put us in an even stronger strategic position are exactly the type of opportunities we engage in and also where we have a strong history of value creation. In this context, we believe Sky is a great fit.","So now let's discuss our first quarter results. First, I just want to remind everyone that as we previously announced on our year-end earnings call, we adopted the new accounting standard related to revenue recognition effective January 1, 2018. Today's results are reported on that standard.","Beginning on slide 5, let's review our first quarter consolidated results. Revenue increased 10.7% to $22.8 billion, which includes results from the broadcast of the PyeongChang Winter Olympics and the NFL Super Bowl. Adjusted EBITDA increased 3.3% to $7.2 billion. Results for the quarter reflect healthy EBITDA growth of 4.7% and 13.1% for Cable and NBCUniversal, respectively.","The corporate and other results include an EBITDA loss of $189 million associated with our newly launched wireless business.","Adjusted earnings per share increased 17% to $0.62 for the quarter. And finally, free cash flow was $3.1 billion in the quarter.","Now let's get into the details of our quarterly results for the Cable Communications business, starting with slide 6. Revenue increased 3.6% to $13.5 billion, reflecting a 273,000 net increase in customer relationships to 29.6 million and rate adjustments. These results were driven by our high-margin connectivity businesses, including high-speed Internet and business services, which together totaled nearly $6 billion in revenue in the quarter and grew over 9%.","Taking a closer look at our residential business, high-speed Internet continues to be the largest contributor to overall Cable growth, with revenue increasing 8.2% to $4.2 billion in the quarter. These results were driven by a net increase in our customer base and rate adjustments. We added 351,000 net new residential high-speed Internet customers. And as Brian said earlier, we continue to be confident in our outlook for high-speed Internet subscriber growth for several reasons.","First, the broadband market is expanding as more Americans adopt high-speed data. Currently, only about 80% of American households subscribed to Internet access and we believe this number will continue to expand. Second, we have an opportunity in our footprint through new home formation and by extending our plant within our footprint to increase our homes passed on a steady basis. This has been growing at a rate of about 1.5%. Lastly, we are driving market share gains on the back of ongoing investment in innovation and product differentiation. As Brian said, we are focused on continuously improving speed, coverage, and control in our best-in-class broadband product. In terms of speed, 75% of our residential customers receive speeds of 100 megabits per second or higher.","We continue to make good progress rolling out DOCSIS 3.1, with 90% of our footprint now offering gigabit speeds. At the same time, we are putting our advanced gateways in the home, translating these speeds into the best WiFi.","With WiFi powering an increasing number of connected devices in the home, our xFi app enables the customer to better manage their home network, further improving their experience. All this differentiates and increases the value of our broadband service and helps us capture additional market share.","Switching to video, revenue declined 0.8% to $5.7 billion in the quarter. The difference in the quarter's results compared to last year is primarily driven by a decrease in customers as well as our choice to take lower rate increases. We had 93,000 residential video customer net losses in the quarter.","The video marketplace is highly competitive and our business continues to adapt in a way that allows us to compete while preserving strong Cable EBITDA and net cash flow growth. We continue to believe X1 is the best video product on the market and remained focused on innovation and our aggregation strategy around content in a market where total video consumption is at an all-time high.","In addition, we are segmenting the market to get the right product to the right customer by offering other video products including products with thinner packaging that extend our reach into additional segments that we still think we can serve profitably. And we are doing this all in the context of managing the whole-home relationship.","While broadband is at the epicenter of the majority of our customer relationships, customers can still get the best experience and value with a bundled service, including some combination of broadband, video, voice, home security, and now mobile products. And despite the shifting contributions, we are growing EBITDA and EBITDA per relationship.","Speaking of Xfinity Mobile, as Brian mentioned, we are happy with the early results we are seeing in this business, ending the quarter with 577,000 customer lines, having added 196,000 lines in the quarter. We are seeing real momentum as the product is resonating with our customer base, and we believe Xfinity Mobile is a big opportunity to continue to drive the bundling strategy of the Cable business and provide more value to our broadband customers. Financially, our $189 million EBITDA loss at Xfinity Mobile in the first quarter reflects our ramp in subscriber acquisitions and the incremental operating costs associated with getting this new business launched.","Moving on to business services, which continues to be a top driver of our overall Cable results, we delivered another strong quarter of double-digit growth, with revenue increasing 11.9% to $1.7 billion during the quarter, primarily driven by customer growth. We added 29,000 business customer relationships in the quarter and grew revenue per business customer relationship by 5%. These results are driven by connectivity, as the rollout of DOCSIS 3.1 has enabled us to offer gigabit speeds to small businesses and our investment to push fiber deeper in our network helps us continue to increase the number of mid-size customers. All business services segments, small, medium-sized, and now enterprise, are focused on connectivity and have substantial room for future growth.","Now let's turn to slide 7 to discuss our Cable expenses and margin. First quarter Cable Communications EBITDA increased 4.7% to $5.4 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.1%, up 50 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2017. We continue to believe our full-year margins could be as much as 50 basis points higher compared to last year.","We have added 745,000 total customer relationships over the last 12 months, which translates into 2.6% growth year-over-year in our customer base. If we look at our Cable financial results on a per-customer relationship basis, we increased total revenue per customer relationship by 0.9% and EBITDA per customer relationship by 2%. These results were driven by growth in our high-margin connectivity businesses and our focus on cost control.","Programming expense growth moderated to 3% this quarter. After experiencing double-digit growth for the past two years, driven by the timing of several contract renewals, this quarter's growth is mainly driven by normal escalators in our programming contracts, partially offset by a loss of video subscribers.","Non-programming expenses increased 2.8% this quarter. We continue to benefit from the investments we've made in customer experience initiatives as well as disciplined cost management overall. Notably, customer service expense continues to improve, declining 2% this quarter even as we grew total customer relationships by 273,000.","Now let's move on to NBCUniversal's results. On slide 8, NBCUniversal's revenues increased 21.3%, and EBITDA increased 13.1% to $2.3 billion in the quarter. These exceptional results were driven in part by the successful broadcasts of the 2018 Winter Olympics and the NFL's Super Bowl, which generated an incremental $1.6 billion of revenue at our TV businesses, of which over $1.2 billion is related to advertising revenue.","In addition to these big events, NBCUniversal's results reflect healthy growth in retrans and affiliate fees at our TV businesses and strong results at our Theme Parks. Cable networks revenue increased 21% to $3.2 billion and EBITDA increased 13.7% to $1.3 billion. Excluding $378 million of revenue associated with the Winter Olympics, revenue increased 6.6%, reflecting solid growth in distribution, advertising and content licensing, and other revenue.","Distribution revenue increased 5.7% this quarter, reflecting the continued benefit of previous renewals of distribution agreements, partially offset by a decline in subscribers at our Cable Networks. Advertising revenue increased 2.4%, reflecting the impressive performance of MSNBC as well as strong overall pricing that was partially offset by ratings declines and the impact of channel closures. Lastly, content licensing and other revenue increased 26% due to new licensing deals and the timing of content provided under current agreements.","Broadcast Television revenue increased 58.3% to $3.5 billion, and EBITDA increased 57.5% to $507 million. Excluding $770 million of revenue associated with the Winter Olympics and $423 million of revenue generated by the broadcast of NFL's Super Bowl, revenue increased 4.3%, primarily reflecting higher retransmission revenue. Retrans revenue increased about 18% to nearly $415 million. In addition, advertising revenue, excluding the Olympics and Super Bowl, was stable, as the strong scatter market offset ratings declines.","Film revenue declined 16.3%, and EBITDA declined 45.2% to $203 million, primarily driven by lower theatrical revenue. Coming off the most profitable year in its history, Film results were down due to the size and timing of the slate. While the third installment of Fifty Shades delivered strong results in the quarter, it was a tough comparison to the higher number of films during last year's first quarter. As Brian said, we remain focused on our franchise strategy and we are excited to have the return of one of our biggest franchises with Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom opening in the second quarter.","Finally, Theme Parks revenue increased 14.5%, and EBITDA increased 24.6% to $495 million. These strong results are partly driven by the timing of spring break, which was concentrated in the second quarter of last year. Even if we exclude this benefit, EBITDA growth would still be strong, up double-digits compared to last year, driven by higher per-capita spending. In the second quarter, we expect to benefit from several new attractions opening that Brian highlighted earlier.","Now let's move on to slide 9 to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. Consolidated CapEx decreased 5% to $2 billion in the first quarter. At Cable Communications, capital expenditures decreased 5.2% to $1.7 billion for the quarter, resulting in capital intensity of 12.5%.","For the full year, we continue to expect capital intensity to be favorable relative to 2017 by as much as 50 basis points. For the quarter, the decrease in spending is driven by a decline in spending on customer premise equipment, primarily related to X1, which is now deployed to over 60% of our residential video customers.","Partially offsetting this lower spending was increased investments in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity and increase investment in line extensions to reach more business and residential customer addresses. We expect the composition of our capital spending to continue to shift away from video-centric customer premise equipment and towards connectivity-driven broadband infrastructure spending.","At NBCUniversal, first quarter capital expenditures decreased 5.6% to $269 million. However, this is mainly timing-related and for the full year we expect capital spending to increase at NBCUniversal, with the majority of the investment directed to our Theme Parks.","And now finishing up on slide 10, let's cover return of capital. As I mentioned earlier, we generated $3.1 billion in free cash flow in the quarter. We returned $2.2 billion of that to shareholders, about a 60% increase over last year. This includes $738 million in dividends and share repurchases of $1.5 billion in the first quarter. This equates to an annualized rate of $6 billion, nicely above the minimum target for 2018 of $5 billion, which we reaffirmed at the time of the Sky announcement. In addition, we remained at net leverage of 2.2 times EBITDA.","Regarding potential acquisitions, it's our job to continuously evaluate whether there are opportunities for us to create value. But should we pursue anything while our stock is at these levels, while circumstances can always change, I think it's unlikely that we would use Comcast shares as a medium of exchange for a transaction. Our strong balance sheet allows us to consider strategically important opportunities at times like this.","So thanks for joining us this morning. I will just conclude by saying we feel great about the fundamentals and underlying strength of our businesses. Our first quarter results support that and set us up well for a strong 2018.","With that, I'll hand it back to Jason.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Okay, thanks, Mike. Regina, let's open up the call for Q&A, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thanks. Maybe to focus on the strategic topic. Brian, as you said, you're seeing increasing competition in the video market here in the U.S. And with the Sky transaction, you will be purchasing an asset that is primarily a satellite TV distribution company. Is there reason to believe that the video market in Europe will not evolve similarly to what we've seen here in the U.S.?","And then number two, as a follow-up, just if you could give us any color on the $500 million in synergies, or any more details would be great. Thanks.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, John. Look, they're very different markets. Obviously, video and television have many similarities, but you really have to do the work and look at the competitive situation, dynamic, the future potential for competition. And I think the markets are just coming from different vantage points.","Also, Sky has a terrific programming business, content creation business, over-the-top business. And so we looked at it and continue to look at it, look at their quarterly results, which they posted last week. And they also are in the broadband business in the UK. And they made announcements that they intend to do so in Italy.","So we are impressed with just the continuing momentum at the business, the ability to have a content and distribution company that looks very similar to Comcast NBCUniversal. Mike?","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","So on synergies, John, $500 million, it's the same categories, I'd say, that we flagged that we expected to see when we did the 2.4. But it's about $300 million of expense side, $200 million of revenue synergies.","On the expense side, just think about the amount of third-party spending the two businesses at our scale does. And then the ability to get some efficiencies across the two companies in some of the more administrative and production side of things. All that $300 million represents such a small percentage of the overall expense base that we're not too \u2013 we're confident that's gettable, as we said earlier.","And then on the revenue side, it's again $200 million. When you think, again, about the ability to add to the power of monetization of Sky content in the U.S. and to some degree NBC content elsewhere, together with the strength of what we can do in producing new originals together is what gets you to those combined $500 million or so.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks guys,","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, John. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Yeah. Hi. I mean I'll stay with the strategic theme as well. So, I guess, my and most people's reading is that your interest in Sky and Fox signals a view that the scale required for the next generation of media is likely to be much, much greater. First, is that right? And is the production side of that business, does that require much larger scale, hence (33:04) perhaps more than just Sky, but a real kind of addition to the studio?","And then if that's a global concept, I wonder if you could revisit your thoughts about how the U.S. fits into that with a sort of direct-to-consumer platform outside of your existing footprint?","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Okay. Well, thank you, Craig. Let me start by saying, because there has been some commentary around this question of strategic intent, is that love our core businesses. And anybody who is viewing this as some divergent from that is not reading us properly in my judgment. We didn't choose to put Sky in play or any other asset in play. That event happened around us.","And the question is, do we take a look at it and engage? And as we have done the work and in M&A generally, as Mike just articulated, and I tried to earlier, what are the reasons to do it and what are the reasons not to do it? And we look at all of that. And we think we are disciplined. We think we have a great track record. Nobody is perfect. But I go back to NBCUniversal and say we didn't have to do that. And at the time, there was what's the strategic rationale and other things.","In the end, you want to buy it right, you want to operate it right, and you want to make a strategy and a growth trajectory for your company that's better than without it. And that's how you build an organization over 50 years. And so in the question of scale and looking at the future, again, I don't think we have to do this. I don't think international is broadly is a strategy. I think it is a unique asset in Sky's case that fits well within the mix of businesses we have already got, and is aligned with our existing strategy of integrating content and distribution. And a benefit is that you will get new geographies and additional scale, which gives you optionality for future things to consider, not a requirement or a necessity.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thanks, Craig. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. I'd like to maybe switch gears to NBCU. And I don't know if Steve is on the phone, but just a question or two is, as you approach the upfront, what will be different this year in how you sell those or how buyers view the market? Or how the marketplace occurs, whether it's targeting or demos or digital versus linear?","And then secondly, could you comment on the health of the movie business? And any changes in distribution with the Fox-Disney deal combination pending. Does that change premium video-on-demand or the potential premium video-on-demand?","Stephen B. Burke - Comcast Corp.","Okay. So this is Steve. First on advertising, we're entering the upfront, which is two weeks from Monday is our presentation. It's amazing how quickly it comes every year. But we are entering the upfront in the strongest position we have since we arrived seven or eight years ago at NBCUniversal.","If you look at NBC, we are over 40% ahead of the number two network in ratings. We had a very, very high percentage of the big nights in television between the Olympics and the Super Bowl, Golden Globes. We have a very, very strong schedule. And scatter for the last two or three quarters has been quite strong. The first quarter was the strongest quarter for scatter that we've had in a while. It's too early to say what the second quarter will be. But I think we have the cards to enter the upfront in a stronger position than we have in many years.","In addition, there is a pendulum swing that happens between traditional linear broadcast and cable and digital. And I think for a whole variety of reasons advertisers are coming to the conclusion that that pendulum ought to swing back in our favor. It's not to say it definitely will, but there's certainly signs in people that we've talked to of a coming home to a trusted environment where an ad can be in context, where an ad can be watched the way people watch television ads from the beginning until the end. And behaviors change and brands are built and businesses succeed.","So for all those reasons, the strength of our portfolio, in general, but in particular with NBC and also the strength of the market and the pendulum coming back to television, I am really looking forward to a very robust upfront.","In terms of Film, Universals has been around something like 105 years. And we have set the record for operating cash flow consecutively in two of the last three years. We had the highest year, the best \u2013 our best year ever last year. This year, because we are comping against that year and you see it in the first quarter results we won't be quite as strong in terms of Film. But we are going to plenty strong, in my opinion.","We are looking forward to Jurassic World on June 18. We have Mamma Mia! coming back as a sequel. We have The Grinch at the end of this year. And our approach to our Film business, led by Jeff Shell, has been to build on franchises, which we have more now than ever, and animation. And the purchase of DreamWorks Animation is going to start bearing fruit starting next spring with our first new release under our control. And of course, Illumination has never been stronger.","So we feel very good about the Film business. I do believe that technology allows windowing to occur that will be beneficial to the Film business. And it's hard to say when and how that's going to happen, but we're doing so well in the Film business, that's just upside for us. And very proud of our team and their approach to the business, their discipline, their creative risk-taking, and the kind of movies that we are making, which are making Universal more profitable than ever.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thanks, Jessica. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, good morning. I have two questions. Mike, I think, I just wanted to go back to your comment before, you talked about where your stock is today and that it's a currency. To make sure we're hearing you right, it sounds like you are sort of taking any equity finance deal off the table at the moment. And then related to that, can you just remind us sort of how far you would take the leverage or the company is comfortable taking leverage up through acquisitions? Just so we can put some kind of parameters around there? And then I have a follow-up for Dave.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","Sure. I don't really have much to add to what I earlier said. I mean, obviously any comment like that is subject to facts and circumstances at the moment. But since I have been getting the question about would we or wouldn't we in a variety of different possible scenarios, I guess, in people's minds, just want to make personally the point that I don't see us using stock at these levels. So that's the point I was making earlier, really in response to a question that I have been getting.","In terms of does that necessarily mean we can't do anything, no, because the follow-through on that is the strength of our balance sheet and the history of being able to take advantage of the strength we keep in our balance sheet if something makes sense, which just ties back into what Brian said earlier about how we look at opportunities. And we are trying to always consider situations where if we can add value on top of the existing business, we view it as our job to try to do that. I wouldn't throw out any parameters for where we would or wouldn't go, other than the idea would be we like the leverage that we have and the strength of the balance sheet. And would be intent if we ever temporarily increased our leverage to bring it back to the neighborhood it's been operating in in a reasonable period of time.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's great. And then, Dave, just on the broadband business, as AT&T upgrades their network, deploys more fiber, can you talk a little bit about how your flow share sort of trends over time? Do you see any marked differences in Comcast's ability to grow the business as they upgrade their DSL plant and even U-verse plant to more fiber? And are you doing anything around Verizon's 5G deployments in terms of just preparing the business or your customers for their deployment later this year? I realize the markets aren't all announced yet, but I'm just wondering how you are thinking about that.","David N. Watson - Comcast Corp.","Well, Ben, first off, I think you go through competitive cycles. And certainly we saw that earlier with AT&T moving more of their DSL footprint over. Once these adjustments happen, you level off. We make some adjustments to how we go to market and then there is sort of the new normal that exists. And what we are seeing is we have great momentum. We really like the trajectory of our broadband business. So we had a good result, as you all saw with the 379,000 new high-speed customers. And we think there is more room here. There's more room in share, there's more room in terms of how we approach the marketplace. So when you look at \u2013 Mike and Brian talked about the overall market growth in terms of broadband, in terms of homes passed. From our standpoint, when you go up against a lower-end broadband, I mean, how we are talking about how we compete, we talk about connected devices, how much consumption is going on. And our focus on providing a superior speed, coverage, and controlled answer to the broadband marketplace, I think, is working.","So from our standpoint, you go through it and there's an opportunity to win some customers back that maybe are testing the waters. But I think our network is really designed and has great opportunities to scale around this new market. We increase the capacity every 18 to 24 months. And so I just feel that not all broadband networks are created equal. We have a great network designed, I think, to help us compete with more consumption.","And in 5G, we're paying close attention to it. We are testing our own results in terms of what this can do. And we still feel that I think it could be a good opportunity for a mobile network provider to enhance their mobile applications and mobile service. It's a different question around whether or not it can \u2013 what it's going to \u2013 what they will do in terms of fixed broadband.","So our focus, whether it's Verizon or whoever, is to continue to build out our network. We're very focused around broadband. We are going to test opportunities with 5G. But we are not going to stand still. We are going to continue to enhance our network capabilities. And you look at in terms of just overall consumption, just at a high level, you look at the top 10% of our customers, just how much they use, they are using 20 or more connected devices. And it's a tremendous amount of consumption that we have. And I think that's where the market is going. There is going to be more consumption, more connected devices. And so our focus is to provide the best in-home solution. And we will see what happens with 5G, but in the current spectrum use, the current way they are looking at it, I'm still very confident of our ability to compete.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Ben. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Thanks. I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit more context on trends in the wireless business this quarter. So if the $189 million losses that you reported, associated with wireless, how much of that is sort of one-time costs associated with getting the business started versus sort of ongoing costs?","And then how does the cost profile of the business change now that you have the JV with Charter, where they are covering some of the platform development costs?","And then finally, when do you expect the pace of net adds to start accelerating as you upgrade the stores and get your sales channel really behind the product? Thanks.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","So, Jon, it's Mike. I'll start and then I'll let Dave take over. But I actually feel pretty good about the 198,000, I think, line adds to close to 600 (46:40) thus far. We feel pretty good about the launch.","But in terms of the expenses, the $189 million of EBITDA losses, in line with what we had guided. We had several hundred million of losses last year. It will be a few hundred more this year. And that is really as we are acquiring customers and ramping the business.","We also have to cover expenses of just getting a business started, from marketing departments, technology departments, the like, just core infrastructure. We will get some benefit in our deal with Charter of bearing some of those costs together.","And in terms of where we go from here, I'll let Dave comment. But as we always said, when we get to scale in the business, we'll be able to cover those costs and be NPV-positive on a per-customer basis once we get to scale.","David N. Watson - Comcast Corp.","Well, so on \u2013 as Mike said, I think we're off to a really good start in mobile. It is early, launched last May. I think the consumer response to the choice of By the Gig or Unlimited is working.","And it's still early in terms of how we expand distribution. And you mentioned kind of where we're at with that. We've launched now completely our retail stores. We didn't have to add a lot of retail stores, we just converted our existing stores and providing the capability to sell mobile in them. So that's going very well.","We continue to press, I think, a very good digital solution. And we're just now beginning to package mobile solutions with broadband with other options. So I think it's relatively early, but we like the early trajectory of that.","On Charter, just one other comment, given the amount of alignment and how we both look at the business, this is just, I think, a really logical next step. And so, as Mike mentioned, it helps us reduce costs. But I think it's even more than that. It's a really \u2013 it has the potential to be a really good operational partnership. We're both focused on back-office operations, really critical to how you scale this new business. And having Charter at the table thinking through the right answers to how we scale it, I think, is going to be a good help.","So it reduces costs, it's efficient, it's a good thing. But I'm real pleased that we were able to bring this partnership forward.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Thanks.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Jonathan. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Goldman with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Scott Goldman - Jefferies LLC","Hi, good morning, guys. I guess, Mike, maybe just on the programming expense, probably a bit lower than most people were expecting. It doesn't look like you have a lot of major renewals going on this year. I know you've signaled that this year might be a little bit lower than perhaps the historical average. Wondering if that view has changed at all or how we should think about 2018 from a programming expense side of the equation.","And then secondly, just maybe talk a little bit on the video side, what you're seeing in terms of vMVPD competition. How effective is Instant TV? I know it's probably early there, but how effective is that in terms of targeting some of the competition there? Thanks.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","Sure. It's Mike. I'll start out. So as we said, we expected programming costs to come down to historical levels in this year after the couple of years of big renewals. So we're back in the land of regular escalators.","And as I said earlier, that combined with some of the shift in mix of our customer base and some of the reductions in subs deflates the growth rate down, as a result, a little bit below the historical levels. So that's programming.","We'll probably see trends similar for the remainder of this year, it's safe to say. And we'll come back next year with further annual guidance, but that's just on programming costs. And I'll let Dave comment on the competitive landscape on vMVPDs.","David N. Watson - Comcast Corp.","Well, no question, it's a competitive landscape. And don't see that changing, but we anticipated this as we saw it, thus your point on Instant TV, very much in line with our approach towards segmenting the marketplace. So still early on Instant TV.","But again, similar to the question on broadband, once you see a fundamental shift in competition and the new \u2013 the virtual folks as they build a little bit of scale and get some customers, you have a real opportunity to win them back.","And so our focus is to segment the marketplace. But our approach is to lead with the best-in-class video solution in X1 with broadband. We package, it gives the customer the best overall value when you do that.","But part of this anticipated new competitive \u2013 more competitive landscape in video, we've continued to shift towards our connectivity business. And that has been absolutely part of our planning. As we look at the shift, it drives growth, both business services residentially, business services growing at almost 12%. There are share opportunities. Our focus is very much centered on broadband. When we start a package sale, when we talk to customers, we lead with broadband.","And then we complete the package from that point on. This is how we're going to compete and win, I think, in the marketplace. And you look at the overall opportunity, we are generating nearly $24 billion in this connectivity business in annualized revenue. It's growing at 10%. This is where our focus is. We will not \u2013 we're going to continue to compete in video, and I think that we'll see how things play out. We're not going to just stop competing. We're going to absolutely be aggressive. But our focus has shifted towards the connectivity business.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Scott. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Two follow-ups. Dave, you mentioned the shift to connectivity. Was there any pushback on the broadband price in this increase this year or any more than usual?","And second, and if I can follow-up on wireless, can you talk about the contribution from bring your own device launching in the quarter and how effective that was? And what type of usage and spending are you seeing from customers, especially the earlier ones who have been around for a couple of quarters? Thank you.","David N. Watson - Comcast Corp.","So on broadband, Phil, in terms of rates, I would say at the highest level, we see that there is a real opportunity not just in share, but also in terms of how you reasonably price things. Our focus is to innovate. Just as we did with X1, we have really ramped up the ability years ago, focusing on mesh WiFi, great speeds, and then better control through the xFi app.","And so I think when you do all these things, it adds up to just a really compelling value proposition where you can reasonably price and then compete with a superior broadband product. So I think that, again, not all broadband networks are created equal. If you are providing a better solution in broadband, your pricing can reflect that. So we're getting share, we can price reasonably. We are comfortable with that approach.","And so in terms of wireless, I think it's too early. We just introduced the bring your own device. We like it. It's operationally working well. But it's a little early to go into any detail in terms of the usage metrics and the follow-up around that. But we'll get back to you over time on that.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. If I can do one more on 5G, Brian, you mentioned continuing to work on this. What's your interest in either the millimeter wave spectrum auction later this year or maybe the CBRS auction next year? Thanks.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Yeah, I don't think we have any news today on that. When we're ready to talk about that, we will. But I think Dave's answer was pretty complete earlier on our view of 5G. Thanks.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, Brian.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","All right. Thanks, Phil. We'll make this the last question.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. You mentioned in prepared remarks that you are offering the gigabit speeds in 90%, I think, of your homes. Can you talk about how many people are actually taking these speeds? Or is it still really, really early?","And then, secondly, one clarification on the Charter JV. This is clearly different than the agreement you signed last year. So I assume there is no renewal of the prior-year agreement and that this, whatever was announced, is all encompassing? Or am I wrong there?","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Well, first off, on gigabit, yeah, it is too early to talk about it. But we're primarily focused on just getting it rolled out. So that's the main thing, and putting it in a premium position. So it's a little early to talk about customers. On the Charter...","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So, I just want to clarify you are not offering it to customers yet? You're just...","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","No, we are. We absolutely are.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Yeah. No. It's launched and available 90%.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","So in terms of Charter, the aspect that you are talking about is still in effect and through May. But this agreement that we just talked is really for the operational partnership. And that's going to be the relationship that will carry forward.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Okay. And I just would add that I think great collaboration between ourselves and Charter and we'll keep informing you as that goes forward.

Brian?","Brian Roberts","Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. Across Comcast, NBCUniversal our company is executing at a high level and I'm proud to report fantastic results for both the fourth quarter and full year 2017. Starting with the fourth quarter Cable Communications, we continue to have strength in our connectivity businesses where we added 350,000 net new broadband customers and increased business services revenue by 12.2%, as well as continued improvements as results of our investments in the customer experience. At NBCUniversal we had a terrific quarter driven by robust affiliate fees and retrans growth, a successful holiday season at our Theme Parks capping off a great 2017 and record profitability at Filmed. Perhaps even better this exceptional performance in 2017 positions us well as we enter 2018. The recent passage of tax reform provides real and immediate benefits for our company that will further enhance our financial position and will in turn enable us to do more of the things that help us better serve our customers, our employees and the communities where we operate as well as drive value for our shareholders. This means continuing to develop the most innovative products and services, investing where we see high returns and opportunities to drive growth including in our broadband network, TV, Filmed and Theme Park offerings and continuing to deliver a healthy return of capital to shareholders. Based on this solid foundation and our confidence in our outlook today we're announcing a 21% increase in our dividend which is our 10th consecutive annual increase. We also expect to repurchase at least $5 billion in stock in 2018.","With that let me talk about a few of our achievements this past year. Our company has an excellent track record of delivering strong, consistent results and this continued in 2017 with EBITDA growth of 6%. At Cable Communications we look to balance subscriber growth with financial performance and we achieved this in 2017. We increased EBITDA by 5% and added 770,000 net new customer relationships. During 2017, we continued to direct more of our strategic focus toward our connectivity businesses which collectively generated over $20 billion in revenues and grew 10%. This includes broadband where we added 1.2 million net new customers. We continue to differentiate in broadband with the deployment of DOCSIS 3.1 enabling gigabit speeds in our footprint xFi platform which gives customers more control of their in-home Wi-Fi experience.","Business services exited the year at a $6.5 billion revenue run rate and what's particularly exciting is the room for growth ahead, as we have the opportunity to take more share in each of our customer segments. In 2017, we made an exciting new addition to our bundle with XFINITY Mobile and the service is off to a terrific start. After launching the business from ground up in May, we ended the year with more than 380,000 customer lines and real momentum. Customers have really responded to our unique By the Gig offering. The simple and intuitive ordering process and digital first customer experience.","With XFINITY Mobile now fully rolled out in our retail stores and new features like our recent introduction of Bring Your Own Device. We're enthusiastic about what's coming in 2018. 2017 also brought a new normal to competition in video including more aggressive offers from traditional and emerging competitors. While we remained disciplined and are not in the business of chasing volume at any cost. We more than held our own in this environment. With our culture of innovation, we're well equipped to compete in this evolving marketplace. Our X1 platform enables us to be the aggregator of aggregators of the content our customers love and we're continuously improving X1 to deliver and even better experience.","This past year we added many new features and functionalities to name a few, we integrated YouTube into the platform. Added new music experiences through Pandora and iHeartRadio and leverage the power of our amazing voice remote to give customers a unique way to vote on NBC's hit show the Voice. We now have nearly 20 million voice remotes deployed. Perhaps most significantly a cable, our ongoing efforts to improve the experience drove tangible benefits for our customers and to our financials this year. We were making measurable progress in many key areas and notably in 2017, we reduced calls handled by our agents by 10% and a percentage of customers interacting with us only digitally grew by double digits year-over-year.","It's been an outstanding year for Cable Communications which speaks to the strong leadership from Dave Watson for many years and particularly since he took the CEO position last spring. At NBCUniversal achieving double-digit EBITDA growth for the fifth consecutive year was one of many highlights of 2017. In Filmed entertainment we crossed $5 billion in worldwide box office for the second time in Universal's 105-year history driven by a wide range of theatrical releases including key franchises like Fifty Shades and Fast and Furious. Continued success in animation with Despicable Me 3 and hits like Get Out, Split and Darkest Hour, 2017 was our filmed businesses most profitable year ever.","In our Television businesses in an evolving media landscape having great content is critical and our portfolio of must see sports, news and entertainment stands out in this regard. In many instances we have more end users of our content than ever before. Our increased affiliate's fees in retrans resulting from successful distribution renewals as well as our strong content licensing growth in 2017 are evidence of the value of our portfolio.","In addition NBC continues to lead in ratings winning the 52-week season for the fourth consecutive year and is currently ahead of the competition by a wide margin in this new season. Telemundo also remains number one following its first [technical difficultly] 2016, 2017 season. At Cable Networks USA was number one for an unprecedented 12th consecutive year. I'd like to congratulate MSNBC which had an impressive year with record ratings in total viewers and in demo across every day part and had the fastest growth among any cable network with 36% prime growth in demo.","Finally our Universal theme parks continued to have great success in 2017 with 9% EBITDA growth driven by Harry Potter in Hollywood and new attractions like Volcano Bay in Orlando and Minion Park in Japan. I want to underscore how pleased we're with our Japan investment from just two years ago. As our 2017 performance across NBCUniversal demonstrates our wonderful team have put us in a position to succeed in these rapidly evolving media businesses in this changing landscape, not every company can say that. With the pace of change and the industry accelerating many of our peers are re-evaluating their strategies as we've seen recently. So along the way, there may be opportunities for us to create more value for our shareholders like we did with NBCUniversal. In this respect, it shouldn't be surprise that we study ever situation that comes along. We believe our shareholders expect this from us, but the bar's set high and we have been and will remain disciplined.","Now let me talk about some of the things we were looking forward to across our business in 2018 and beyond. We're excited to have the Super Bowl in NBC and the Winter Olympics just days away. There is no better example of how our entire company works together than the Olympics. We're so proud to be the company that brings the games to millions of Americans combining the incredible and heart-warming storytelling from NBCUniversal with the world class technology of Comcast Cable. This year Comcast NBCUniversal will deliver the most live, the most mobile, the most technologically advanced Winter Olympics ever. NBC will provide a record 2,400 hours of coverage more than the last two Winter games combined and the best place to experience this coverage will be through our Olympics dashboard on X1, with new and enhanced content and features that will enable users to customize and control their experience across platforms.","In our TV businesses with the Super Bowl and Winter Olympics as well as the World Cup on Telemundo later this year, we should further build on our ratings leadership from 2017. More broadly our strategy will continue to center on having must see content that drives mobile monetization streams from advertising to content licensing, to distribution on both traditional and emerging TV platforms.","At theme parks, I was just in Orlando a couple weeks ago and came away feeling even more bullish on our outlook for the parks. In 2018, we will benefit from the full year of Volcano Bay and Minion Park as well as new attractions that leverage our intellectual property like Fast and Furious in Orlando and Kung Fu Panda in Hollywood. We also continue to make progress toward opening our new Beijing Theme Park in the next few years and have exciting growth plans for Japan. Finally in Filmed, while we will not beat our 2017 performance, we expect 2018 to be a solid year with some of our best franchises returning including Jurassic World and Fifty Shades. We're also excited for 2019 and beyond when a more robust animation slate is planned.","Over Cable Communications, we expect another strong year in 2018 while video continues to evolve as I mentioned. We remained committed to innovating video and delivering the premier experience for customers through X1. And I'm really excited about our long runway ahead in high speed data. In 2018, we will continue to differentiate our product by providing gigabit speeds at scale, offering one of the most powerful gateways for the home and augmenting Wi-Fi coverage and control with xFi and the rollout of our fabulous little pods with connectivity increasingly at the epicentre of our relationship with customers. We have the opportunity to provide whole home solutions that integrate and help manage all of the devices our customers rely on.","In Business Services, we're still in the early stages of bringing our superior products to the large addressable markets in mid-size and enterprise customers. And lastly in 2018, we will look to build on and accelerate our early success with XFINITY Mobile. So our plan is to continue to invest in product innovation while we strive to make interacting with us simpler and more consistent and increasingly all digital. This will improve the experience for our customers and also help us continue to take cost out of the business in 2018 as Mike will discuss in more detail.","As we kick off 2018, I feel great about Comcast. We've significant momentum and we're building on our consistent investment growth and strength and look forward to an even more exciting future. Mike, over to you.","Mike Cavanagh","Thanks, Brian and good morning, everybody. I'll begin by reviewing our consolidated results on Slides 4 and 5. Revenue increased 4.2% to $21.9 billion for the fourth quarter and increased 5.1% to $84.5 billion for the full year. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $6.8 billion was relatively flat compared to last year and for the full year EBITDA of $28.1 billion increased 6.2%. Results for the quarter reflect healthy EBITDA growth of 4.2% and 6.4% for Cable and NBCUniversal respectively.","The corporate and other results include $171 million related to a special employee bonus following the passage of tax reform and negative $176 million of EBITDA from the launch of our wireless business. Adjusted earnings per share increased 8.9% to $0.49 for the quarter and 18.4%, $2.06 for the year. These results exclude $12.7 billion of net income tax benefits primarily associated with a change in our deferred income tax liability as a result of the 2017 tax reform legislation. Details of our EPS adjustments are provided in table four and our press release. And finally free cash flow was $2 billion in the quarter and $9.6 billion for the full year.","Now let's turn to Cable Communications on Slide 6. Before going into the details of the quarter I'd like to provide a couple of highlights for the year in the Cable Communications business. Our full year cable revenue increased 4.9% and EBITDA increased 5.3% while we grew customer relationships by 770,000 to more than 29 million. These results were driven by our connectivity businesses including high speed data and business services which totaled more than $20 billion in revenue which grew over 10% in 2017. We were focused on striking the right balance between strong financial results and growth in our customer metrics and we believe our results clearly reflect this effort.","Now let's dive into the details of our quarterly results. revenue increased 3.4% to $13.3 billion and EBITDA increased 4.2% to $5.4 billion in the fourth quarter. starting with our residential business, high speed internet continues to the largest contributor overall cable with revenue increasing 8.4% to $3.8 billion in the quarter. these results were driven by a net increase in our customer base adding 318,000 net new residential high speed internet customers as well as rate adjustments. Our customers continue to get more value with their subscriptions as they use our products more and benefit from our increasing speeds.","Our customers median monthly data usage was 131 gigabits per month for the second half of 2017 an increase of 48% year-over-year. And at year end, 75% of our residential customers received speeds of 100 megabits per second of higher compared to about 50% a year ago reflecting our efforts to lift baseline speeds across our entire customer base. We were focused on driving market share gains by continuing to enhance our competitive differentiation with improvements to speed, coverage and control. We head into 2018 offering nearly 80% of our footprint, gigabit speeds enabled by DOCSIS 3.1 and our new advanced wireless gateway.","In addition, we are rolling xFi pod extenders to increased Wi-Fi coverage in the home and our xFi app which offers an unrivaled level of control. With our current broadband penetration of homes and businesses past 45%, we believe we've plenty of runway for continued high speed data customer growth.","Switching to video, revenue increased 1.5% to $5.7 billion in the quarter primarily due to rate adjustments as well as customer subscribing additional services partially offset by the net loss of video customers. We had 38,000 residential video customer net losses in the quarter reflecting ongoing competition in the video marketplace. Our newest product for our cable customers is XFINITY Mobile which I'll comment on now even though the results are reported in corporate during the launch period of the business. We're off to a great start ending the year with over 380,000 customer lines having added 187,000 lines in the quarter. we believe XFINITY Mobile is a big opportunity to continue to drive the bundling strategy of the cable business.","Financially, we had a $480 million EBITDA loss for 2017 and in 2018 wireless EBITDA losses could be a $200 million higher reflecting our expectation of a successful ramp in subscriber acquisitions. Moving onto business services, which continues to be a top driver of overall cable results we delivered another strong quarter of double-digit growth with revenue increasing 12.2% to $1.6 billion during the quarter primarily driven by customer growth. We added 33,000 business customer relationships in the quarter and 135,000 relationships for the year and grew revenue per business customer relationship by 5%, all business services segments small, medium-sized and now enterprise are focused on connectivity and have substantial room for future growth.","Turning to Slide 7, cable expenses and margin. Our fourth quarter EBITDA margin was 40.7% up 30 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Our full year EBITDA margin of 40.3% was up 10 basis points compared to the prior year. for 2018, we believe our margins could be as much as 50 basis points higher than the 2017 full year results reflecting growth in our high margin connectivity businesses and our focus on cost controls. Programming expenses increased 10% during the quarter and 11.5% for the full year reflecting the timing of several contract revenues. In 2018 we expect programming cost growth to meaningfully moderate from the higher than normal years we experienced in 2016 and 2017.","Non-programming expenses declined 1.5% this quarter and were relatively flat for the full year. this reflects the benefits of the investments we made in customer experience initiatives as well as disciplined cost management overall. Notably, customer service expense declined 2% this quarter and 1.1% for the year, even as customer relationships grew by 2.7%. in 2018, we expect to see continued benefits from our customer experience initiatives and focus on disciplined cost management.","Now let's move on to NBCUniversal's results. On Slide 8, NBCUniversal's revenues increased 3.9% and EBITDA increased 6.4% to $1.9 billion in the quarter. Cable Networks delivered another quarter of strong growth with revenue increasing 7.5% and EBITDA up 9.1% to $1 billion. Distribution revenue increased 6.7% this quarter to $1.5 billion reflecting the continued benefit of previous renewals of distribution agreements partially offset by decline in subscribers at our cable networks. Content licensing and other revenue of $282 million increased 34.5% due to the timing of content provided under licensing agreements. Last, advertising revenue of $878 million increased 2.3% reflecting strong pricing that was partially offset by ratings declines and the impact of channel closures.","Broadcast television revenue increased 4.1% and EBITDA declined 26.3% to $194 million. These results reflect strong retransmission and content licensing revenue offset by lower advertising revenue and higher programming and production spending. Retransmission consent fees increased nearly 70% to about $360 million. Content licensing revenue of $632 million increased 19%. Offsetting this growth was 6.5% decline in advertising revenue reflecting strong pricing that was more than offset by ratings declines including the NFL and the absence of political advertising revenue at our local stations.","In addition, we experienced higher programming and production cost this quarter, driven by increased sports cost including an extra Thursday night football game. In 2018, we expect to start the year strong with the Super Bowl and Olympics. Additionally, we expect retransmission revenue to increase by approximately $200 million to $1.6 billion. Filmed revenue declined 5.2% but EBITDA increased 89.7%, $230 million driven by the carry over benefits of several successful films released earlier this year.","As Brian noted, filmed delivered its most profitable year in its history with EBITDA growth 83% to $1.3 billion. While these results set a high bar, we're excited to have the return of some of our biggest franchises with Jurassic World II and the third instalment of Fifty Shades in 2018. Finally theme parks revenue increased 8.7% and EBITDA increased 3.2% to $661 million. These results reflect relatively stable attendance and healthy growth in per capita spending despite unfavorable weather in Japan and having lapped [ph] reopening of Harry Potter in Hollywood. We're benefiting from new attractions like Minion Park in Japan and Volcano Bay in Orlando as well as the continued success of Harry Potter at each of the parks.","Partially offsetting these results with a negative impact of a weaker Japanese Yen and increased spending on a brand marketing campaign across our portfolio. In 2018, we expect to benefit from the full year of Volcano Bay in Orlando and Minion Park in Japan as well as new attractions opening like the Fast ride in Orlando and Kung Fu Panda in Hollywood.","Now let's move on to Slide 9 to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. Consolidated CapEx increased 5.4% to $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter and 4.5% to $9.6 billion for the year. at Cable Communications, capital expenditures increased 2.8% to $2.2 billion for the quarter and increased 4.7% to $8 billion for the full year resulting in capital intensity of 15.1% in line with the plan we outlined at the beginning of 2017. As expected investments in customer premise equipment including X1 and wireless gateways remained the largest components of our capital expenditures, but declined for the full year.","We increased the investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity and increased investments in line extensions to reach more business and residential customer addresses. For 2018, spending on customer premise equipment is expected to continue to decline. With X1 now deployed to nearly 60% of our residential video base, the pace of our rollout is started to slow. On the other hand, our spending on our network will continue to increase. As a result we expect cable capital expenditures overall to increase in 2018 although we believe our capital intensity could be favorable relative to 2017 by as much as 50 basis points.","At NBCUniversal fourth quarter capital expenditures increased 13.6% to $525 million and on a full year basis CapEx increased 3.4% to $1.5 billion reflecting investments in theme parks and infrastructure. For 2018, we expect to once again increase capital spending at NBCUniversal with the majority of the investment directed to our theme parks. Our formula to consistently invest in new attractions at our parks has driven very strong returns and we expect that trend will continue.","And now finishing up on Slide 10, let's cover return of capital. Let me start by spending a minute on tax reform and its impact. In terms of our gap tax rate without tax reform it would have been in the 35% to 37% range in 2018. With tax reform we expect our gap tax rate to be in the 24% to 26% range. For cash taxes, we expect an even larger impact as our cash tax rate will also benefit from the full and immediate expensing of our eligible capital spending for five years. So that's the impact of tax reform on our go forward gap and cash taxes.","In terms of what we're doing with the benefit of tax reform. Our first action was the announcement of a special bonus to eligible employees in December. Second, we've identified additional areas of capital investment back into the businesses that now makes economic sense post tax reform as I just discussed. And finally, we will augment our already strong capital return plan as I'll cover now. As I mentioned earlier, we generated $9.6 billion in free cash flow during 2017. We returned $7.9 billion of that shareholders comprised of $2.9 billion in dividends and $5 billion in share repurchases and we ended the year at 2.2 times net leverage flat compared to the prior year.","For 2018, we'll continue to execute our balance capital allocation approach that we've discussed many times. We're increasing our dividend 21% to $0.76 per share. this strong increase reflects confidence in the underlying health and momentum in our business coupled with benefits from tax reform. In addition, we expect to repurchase at least $5 billion of our stock in 2018. Any buyback we do above that minimum will be in the context of our balance sheet, which we want to be very strong given its strategic value. Expressing that in numbers, we've added net leverage ratio of around 2.2 times for a while now. Higher than the 1.5 to two times range that was in place as I've arrived several years ago. Since then we've bought the Japan Park in DreamWorks while keeping our dividend growing and our buyback steady.","Now given the higher conversion rate of EBITDA to free cash flow resulting from tax reform I don't expect we would need to see our leverage ratio declined below around 2.2 times in order to be very confident in the strength of our balance sheet. Hence the guidance of a minimum of $5 billion in buybacks in 2018. Now before we go to Q&A, I'd like to take care of one housekeeping item. By the end of February we plan to issue restated trending schedules to reflect the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard which was effective January 1, 2018. The impact for Comcast will primarily be in our cable business with adjustments across some line items that will result in both higher revenue and higher expenses but overall and importantly for Comcast there will be no material impact EPS or free cash flow; so that's all for that item.","So I'll end by echoing Brian's comments about our strong 2017 performance and optimism in our positioning and execution as we head into 2018. Now Jason over to you for Q&A.","Jason Armstrong","Great. Thanks Mike. Thank you Mike. Regina, let's open up the call for Q&A please.","Question-and-Answer Session","[Operator Instructions] our first question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Q - Ben Swinburne","Brian, you talked a lot about connectivity in your prepared remarks and I think the market is very focused certainly on your runway in broadband. When you look at your three-year or longer term products roadmap for connectivity in broadband. What are the things that you're most excited about to keep that business growing and specifically I'm wondering consumers use to pay just for access to the internet but obviously the number of devices is growing, coverage is more important, you've added mobile what are things that you think keep that business taking share and what does [indiscernible] maturing business and then I just had a quick follow-up for Mike.","Brian Roberts","Well let me start and then I'd like to kick it over to Dave Watson. First of all, it's absolute penetration it is about 48%, let me correct that, 40% growth opportunity and but the absolute penetration where are in broadband start with that, as an industry and where are we with our competitors. And how good is our product. I feel really good about the roadmap for that. number two, we launched a mobile product for our broadband customers we're really excited about that. we talked about the speed and pods and the connectivity and coverage. Then you've got smart home, you look at CES. Everything at CES is all about what's going to happen to the home of the future in the next three years, five years, 10 years. It's hard to know exactly when any of those items will explode, you look at our bit per home consumption rate and that is up again even more this year. so that's why we like the business so much and ultimately you boil it all down to that. we love all those bits to be our bits, but that doesn't matter. We want to give customers an incredible experience. We want to be the best and that requires investment and innovation and that's really I think the pivot that the company has been making over several years and this year's results and the fourth quarter results I think demonstrate real strength in this business. Dave?","Dave Watson","Well as Brian said I think there is the growth opportunities both in market share and rate. and if you look at the overall numbers of broadband, the overall broadband penetration being around 80% there is room just there. So home growth is solid in 2017, so home's past growing by 1.4%. the DSL base is still substantial so overall as you start there's room for growth. But what we're focused on is what's working. What's working is, this focus that Brian mentioned around innovation and we have a great scaled infrastructure, got 3.1 that's now at the end of the year at 80%. We'll complete that by the end of 2018, puts us in position to have very large scaled on gig rolled out.","So as consumption and usage continues to climb, we're going to be ahead of the curve in terms of capacity. So and then the big three for us are speeds, we continue to increase speeds we've done that consistently the 16 times at the last 17 years and the new thing is, is coverage the combination of great devices best-in-class gateway devices that in off themselves provide great coverage, you marry that with the new pods the Wi-Fi extenders and so coverage I think is a great answer that will help us drive the business and then last is, being able to control all these things. So connect that modest rate increases, you're focusing on disciplined approach towards multi-product discounts making sure that the extent they just want broadband and [indiscernible], we'll be disciplined in that approach and so - and also, as consumption goes, we're going to be very focused on providing the best tier of broadband service for the customer. So there's opportunities and rate and growth.","Ben Swinburne","That's helpful. And just Mike on your last point on leverage I think I heard you say 2.2 is sort of where you think the company should be. I think at $5 billion you would delever pretty decently in 2018, so are you suggesting then that sort of the upside of that number comes from managing towards 2.2 based on what other capital allocation opportunities come your way this year, is that sort of how we should interpret that comment?","Mike Cavanagh","Sure. You should think about the comments in context of our capital allocation framework which doesn't change. This team's priority to balance three things; one invest in the business to keep it growing and optimize earnings power [ph] over the long-term; two is keep a very strong balance sheet and three is to, do healthy returns of capital of the shareholders. So I think with the framework we've just described saying a minimum of five and anchoring that to around 2.2 times leverage everybody with their own forecast - what's going to happen that's how you would find there to be upside in the buyback during the course of this year. obviously depending on us executing the balance strategy I just described.","Ben Swinburne","That's helpful. Thank you both.","Jason Armstrong","Great, thanks Ben. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Phil Cusick","Brian, two quick ones if I can. Brian, can you talk about what the bar might look like for US and International M&A and given a lot of deals in the front of DOJ today. Do you want to see some better direction before getting involved? And then in wireless you mentioned the potential for acceleration in 2018. Are you now confident that the business is attractive and you have the right model and now is really the time to let it start to spin up? Thank you.","Brian Roberts","Let me kick over to Dave to start on the wireless question first.","Dave Watson","In mobile while it's early Phil that we're really pleased with the early stage results. we launched in May. As Mike said early, we achieved 380,000 lines so there is solid momentum as we approach. We like our game plan we like the fact that's connected to our existing business lines and it's a really simple product approach that can scale and so strong digital focus experience. What we're finding is, that By the Gig approach is very attractive to most of the customers are taking out, we still sell on limited but it's - I think in very unique position as we scale this to do both. So it's early still and just brandings kicking in and we're expanding distribution to our existing retail locations and we're going to begin to package it with our other lines of business including broadband so it gives us just real packaging optionality, so I think we're well positioned going into 2018 as we scale mobile.","Brian Roberts","Let me just reiterate as I said earlier. We always are looking for ways to create more value for shareholders from opportunities as Mike just described where we find capital to invest in the business or new businesses like Dave just talked about in wireless or what we're doing with the Olympics. At the same time, you look at in organic opportunities that come along and you have a bar. I think I say that there is nothing we feel we have to acquire and I think that's an important point to emphasize. So I think we set it high I don't know how to articulate that except to look to our track record and we've created value for shareholders for I think in almost every instance and that's certainly the goal when we do so. So our most recent example would be the Japan theme park and stay tuned, we'll see if we can execute but so far we feel terrific about that and obviously NBCUniversal as I mentioned before is the biggest example. So we don't talk about specific situations and I hope that helps to clarify.","Phil Cusick","Thanks Brian.","Jason Armstrong","Thank you Phil. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John Hodulik","Maybe one for Mike and one for Dave. First Mike some good data on the effective tax reform. Can you give us a better sense of sort of the dollar savings that you expect from if you're looking from 2017 to 2018 just to get a better sense of how much growth we're going to see off that $9.6 billion in free cash flow? And then for Dave on the video business, definitely some solid numbers from a subscriber standpoint. Can you give us a sense of what you're saying in terms of pressure from sort of live streaming providers? Does that change since we went from quarter-to-quarter? and then maybe an outlook on what you expect from a programming cost growth number for next year? thanks.","Mike Cavanagh","John, it's Mike. So I'll tell you how to think about the impact, but everybody has again got the wrong forecast rather than fixing numbers for you. What I said is about 11 points decline in the gap tax rate which will also improve cash taxes by the same magnitude, so use your own estimate of what our pre-tax income is next year and you'll get that. but then obviously on top of that, we get to immediately expense the eligible amount of $10 billion capital or so we're putting in and so you can take swag at that. It's meaningful obviously but those are the two key pieces that drive it.","John Hodulik","The CapEx you expect, vast majority to be expensable [ph]?","Mike Cavanagh","Yes.","John Hodulik","All right. Thanks.","Dave Watson","So John on the video side, it is definitely very competitive video environment then we really don't expect to level a competition to diminish. However, we're going to continue to aggressively compete for profitable video relationships and our approach what is working and we made some a very moderate adjustments as how we compete that, I think have helped us in Q4 but we're going to continue to segment the marketplace and we've introduced new services like Instant TV, which is our streaming cable network delivered product without a set top box, going to use that on a targeted basis. Our focus is going to be bundling, full bundles leveraging best-in-class X1 and broadband, that packaging it is working and so we feel good about Q4, it is competitive and so we're going to stay at it. But the thing that I think is important to note, that we've seen this adjustment coming in terms of this marketplace. The intensity over the top new entrants and based on that while we're going to compete aggressively across the board for good video customers. We have transitioned more and more towards broadband and so broadband is a centerpiece for us. We're going to have good balance on profitable growth, leveraging broadband. We expect to compete aggressively in video and leverage some of the new things we're doing, but we just don't see the environment shifting too much from what we saw at the end of last year.","John Hodulik","All right, thanks guys.","Dave Watson","To last point on programming cost. I think as Mike said it was to expect moderate decrease and so I think some of the timing of the relationships are focused around this is margin and we stay extremely focused on overall margin programming is one piece of it but because you know we're very focused on the experience taking transactions out and you look at things like to the extent that we're adding which we are, customer relationships and the fact that we've taken out just lots and lots of transactions out, that's as importance as anything, but programming cost we do expect to moderately decrease.","Mike Cavanagh","And obviously it's Mike to chime in there. That translates into the as much as 50 basis points improvement in margins for cable for 2018.","John Hodulik","Great, thanks guys.","Jason Armstrong","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jessica Cohen","I almost don't know where to start but I guess first sort of combined Cable NBCU question. At CES few weeks ago, Comcast Cable and NBCU seemed to be front and center of the industry for addressable advertising both in terms of the platform and the services you're offering. And Marcien Jenckes, Linda Yaccarino were right there. And seem to be an industry leading position. So can you just talk a little bit about where do you think the industry and company is within that in terms of regaining dollars lost from traditional media to the newer platforms. Can you just give us any color on what you're doing or what you're expecting? And then for NBCU specifically, can you talk a little bit Steve. I know you're on about the integration of DreamWorks animation and does that help you in your efforts and consumer products. And if I can just throw in one for Brian as a follow-up to the M&A topic. There seems to be some really clear opportunities in both media and distribution amid an obvious restructuring or coming restructuring of the industry. But there are also so many different forces playing out right now with the same companies are investing so heavily in premium video in ways we've never seen yet you have this unpredictability in Washington and what can get approved and not approved.","So can you just give us color on how you're thinking of getting, are you getting pushed in one direction or another in terms of media content or distribution?","Steve Burke","So I'll answer two of your four or five questions and then pass to Dave or Brian, but and let me start with DreamWorks. We bought DreamWorks 18 months or so ago and have completely retooled the flow of releases. We actually have a slow year this year and then next year in 2019 we'll have couple releases and then should have two releases every year thereafter and if you combine that with a couple of releases from Illumination, we should have four animated films and good full throttle a year. we're very happy with the progress we've made at DreamWorks and you can imagine a year when we have four great animated films what that will do to our films OCF.","At the same time, we very much believe that we need to have the ecosystem of new IP, strong consumer products and then appearance in our theme parks and we've got that cranked up now. We've made a lot of investments and seen a lot of growth in consumer products in the last couple of years, those results are embedded in the record year that our filmed group that and you're going to see that continue in the future. The ultimate pay off being when you've created enough IP to really leverage that consumer products capability, that capability is worldwide. We're opening offices overseas, taking back agent relationships, with employee relationships. I think consumer products is a big upside for NBCUniversal.","In terms of the advertising, it's impossible not to see the strength particularly of Facebook and Google really the dominance of Facebook and Google in terms of digital advertising and a lot of the growth in ecosystem is going toward digital and we're not participating in that growth to the degree that we should be given the span of our assets. The good news is television advertising is roughly flat, if you combine the negative effect of ratings decline and the positive effect of CPMs. Depends on the company, depends on broadcasting cable, depends on the quarter. but television advertising is holding its own. Our dream and it should be the dream of anybody who's got assets like ours is to take our television advertising and make it more targetable, more addressable and have more the characteristic that digital has and then overtime have more of our advertising be effected by the technology that digital provides. We've made a lot of progress on that, we've made a lot of investments in Vox and BuzzFeed and Snap. We've made a lot of progress in terms of how we monetize online and how monetize on the VoD platform particularly with Comcast Cable but there's a lot more to do and I think what you heard at CES is the number of plans that we have. We've rolled out - Linda probably has four, five different products that she's currently in the market selling that have aspects of interactivity and overlaying Comcast data and markets and there is a lot more to go as far as that goes.","The good news is television advertising I think is holding its own and as we head off to the Super Bowl and the Olympics it's not lost on us, that if you're a big advertiser and you want to launch big brands and really make a material change in the way consumers think about you, you have to be in a big events on TV and we've something like two-thirds of all the big nights on broadcast television in the next 12 months. We think we're well positioned for the ecosystem where it is, but we're hard at work creating the ecosystem that should be there, that gives television all the positives that digital has.","Dave Watson","And Jessica, Dave. As Steve said one of the things on the cable side that we're focused on. Is being able to pull together the platform that could pull together all the content and our first wave that Marcien is helping us stay very focused on is VoD. So the VoD addressability is up and running having success with that. but really our - the transition continues to stay focused on VoD linear online all coming together. I think cable and distribution we have a unique opportunity to pull all these things together. So Marcien has done a nice job pulling together the platform elements that put us in position to make these things happen.","Brian Roberts","Just to the other question. I think probably we covered it a little bit in theory in my prior conversation and I think it's an interesting time and the business opportunities are being created, some of those opportunities are negative and some are positive. I think our jobs are to study and understand where to grow. And I think Dave acknowledging that we saw changes in video coming as for instance and put our innovation efforts around broadband it's just - but an example that I think the emphasis on theme parks which we didn't anticipate when we bought NBCUniversal but we saw opportunities there as for instance. So let's leave it that for now, it's kind of the thing we'll talk about overtime some of your prediction of restructuring of the industry let's see if that all plays out that way and there will be more information in the quarters ahead.","Jessica Cohen","Okay, thank you.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks, Jessica. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Marci Ryvicker","I've two questions for Mike and then one for Steve. So first Mike, it's sounds like XFINITY Mobile is staying in corporate. I guess at what point you put this in Cable Communications, do you wait until this is profitable? And then secondly it sounds like the programming costs are driving, the majority of the 50 basis point improvement in cable margins, so are we interpreting that correctly. And then for Steve you have a very unique portfolio coming into the year in terms of advertising [indiscernible] Super Bowl and the Olympics. But do you have any sense what advertisers are going to do with their excess cash from tax reform on their own balance sheet? So are you hearing that anymore advertising dollars might come into the system and go towards [indiscernible].","Mike Cavanagh","Thanks, Marci. So it's Mike. The XFINITY Mobile expected to stay in corporate for all of 2018 probably if I had to guess all 2019 [ph]. The idea here is to obviously share the information, we do share you'll see everything that matters, but not to have the - as we're ramping that business. It's obviously would otherwise distort core business in cable. So we'll talk about and share it with you, but I think putting it where we put it is intended to be transparent and clear, so you can judge the business from a bunch of different angles, so couple of years would be my answer on that.","And then on margin improvement I'm going to make sure you get the number right. As much as 50 basis points I might have heard you say 15. It's really the sum of two things, it is obviously the easing of programming cost increases which we had two big years looking back to the years before this. Dave and team they have done a great job managing all parts of the cost base away from programming and that's continued. So I would give credit over a multi-year period say that it's the focus on being efficient in all categories that's contributing to this year's margin changes not just programming.","Steve Burke","So in terms of advertising, we're 10 days away from the Super Bowl and as we head into the Super Bowl, we're averaging about $5 million a unit which is up call it 15% or 20% we think from last year and we're essentially sold out. So if you're looking for sort of an immediate sign as to how hot the market is, as far as the Super Bowl goes, it's pretty hot. I think television advertising ecosystem has been strong for a while now probably two or three years or strength. It feels like it might be getting a little stronger now. I don't think there is necessarily a direct correlation from the tax cuts and having more cash and throwing that into advertising I think it might be more related to just overall business sentiment, but to the degree that business sentiment is slightly stronger now than it was six months ago or stronger now than it was six months ago. I think you can kind of feel that coming into the advertising market and as we look forward into the upfront, which is only a few months away by all accounts it's going to be a strong upfront.","Jason Armstrong","The only other thing I would add, another theory would be that because the Eagles are in the Super Bowl [indiscernible] strong, but I'm not sure.","Marci Ryvicker","Great. Thank you.","Jason Armstrong","Thank you, Marci. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Vijay Jayant","I just wanted to - for Steve. The virtual MVPD growth over the last year and you know the impact on the underlying subscriber trends and the affiliate numbers and retransmission number looks pretty good at NBCU's broadcasting cable. So any color on how the underlying subscriber trends are there and then just a broad question on net neutrality and the reversal of the Title II, is there anything different that's going to be done now given that's probably not an overhang anymore on the broadband side of the business. Thank you.","Steve Burke","So I think when you're think about virtual MVPDs or MVPD changes in general from an NBCUniversal perspective we're really talking about tenths of a percentage point, you were not talking about major, major changes and the virtual MVPDs are accelerating as more of them getting into the business and their business grow, some of them are accelerating, but it's a relatively minor effect across the board for NBCUniversal and if you look at the last two or three quarters you'll see changes in the tenths of a percentage point but not percentage changes overall.","I think we've said that we've supported free and Open Internet and we have been committed to enforceable Open Internet protection. We just thought Title II was unnecessary to guarantee consumers that Open Internet. So it's - we believe Congress will hopefully now have to put some enduring set of enforceable Open Internet protection that can no longer get revisited and reversed with different administration. So I do think it gave us the confident to make the statement that over the next five years we're going to have significant investment in our economy to the tuneable at least $50 billion. So we're moving forward investing and innovating and I think we look forward to someday putting this conversation behind us for everybody's sake.","Vijay Jayant","Thanks so much.","Jason Armstrong","Thank you Vijay. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Bazinet","I just had a question for Mr. Burke. I guess if you guys do M&A, I hope everyone remember how almost universally negative they were on the NBCU acquisition when you did it because when I look at my numbers back in 2010 it was about 20% of your EBITDA and NBCU was made up almost 50% of the EBITDA dollar change for the last seven years. I think we all understand you've done a great job on a number of fronts. Park Studio, Telemundo, retrans. My question is, what leverage do you see left? In other words are there still big leverage that you see over the next two or three years or do you think NBCU's growth will begin to more closely resemble sort of industry's growth. Thank you.","Steve Burke","Well I think we still have a lot of opportunity and it's very, very hard to predict. When we bought the company seven years ago. I think the operating cash flow was about $3.5 billion and in this past year was about $8.2 billion and we never dreamt seven or eight years ago that we would get that kind of growth. We saw opportunities but we weren't articulated about the degree of that opportunity and it's equally difficult as you look into the future. But I think we have a lot of opportunity still, if you look at MSNBC beating CNN almost every night and beating Fox many nights. Fox news and the fact that MSNBC makes a fraction of what CNN and Fox news make. If you look at Telemundo beating Univision last year in primetime and Univision making a lot more money than Telemundo, if you look at our theme parks which are fantastic and every time we open new attractions we're seeing very, very substantial jumps in attendances and we have room for thousands more hotel rooms.","If you look really across the board I think we still have a lot of opportunity. The fact of the matter is, NBC primetime is going from fourth to first and you can't be any better than first and Universal Pictures has had two out of three biggest years in its history in the last three years. So trees don't grow to the sky, but we still have a lot of opportunities. I think we have a great management team. We're allocating capital in a very rational way, we've a great culture. Everybody works together with symphony. So I'm optimistic we can continue to grow and we still have lots and lots of opportunities.","Jason Armstrong","Thank you Jason. Regina, we'll make this the last question please.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brett Feldman","Thanks for taking the question. And just a follow-up a little bit more on XFINITY Mobile. Mike mentioned that the EBITDA losses here I think we're a little greater than you had initially thought and there is going to be some incremental drag in 2018, it sounds like from his comments that the key variable there is just higher customer growth and therefore higher customer acquisition cost and I just want to confirm that's the right way of understanding that. and then you got to over 380,000 subs with pretty narrowing targeted distribution. I was hoping maybe if you could just expand upon what your plans are for this year particularly on the distribution standpoint in order to make sure you're able to keep that momentum going. Thanks.","Mike Cavanagh","Brett, it's Mike. [indiscernible] hand it over to Dave. So on this year's drag I'd say it's in line with what we had expected maybe a touch higher, but not meaningfully so and yes, what happens next year will very much be a function of the hope for ramping up subscriber acquisitions which obviously until we get to a level of sort of stability at a higher level than this, you'll be having increasing drag but that's a good thing as we're growing the business so we think it's going to be very valuable to the overall economics of the customer relationship.","Dave Watson","So from a distribution standpoint, one of the things we talked about early on, was our focus around digital. And having a great digital experience and through the sales process, through on boarding and so that's working. We're real pleased with digital as a channel. I mentioned retail, our existing retail locations don't feel we need to go a lot bigger, we have a long-term good plan, but we're introducing mobile into existing retail and we're having success there. It's early but I think a [indiscernible] scaled operations around retail experience and the last but not least, there's the introducing it, which we've done into our traditional inbound call centers which always do a good job with products. So I think you piece all these things together there is upside and opportunity as we expand distribution in mobile.","Brett Feldman","Thanks one quick question. I know you're targeting your existing base with this product. Are you finding that when you bring new customer relationships on, you're able to attach mobile at the box?","Dave Watson","As you just maybe heard, we just announced Bring Your Own Device nice new addition, so too early to give too much color on that, but it's a real opportunity both for existing customers and new customers being able to come in, bring their device and talk about transitioning over so, we're focused on balanced approach to existing customers but also more and more be reaching out to new customers and we'll talk about then the other lines of business in addition to not just mobile.","Brett Feldman","All right. Thanks for taking the question.","Dave Watson","Thank you all.","Jason Armstrong","Okay, thank you everyone for joining us this morning. We'll end the call. Regina back to you.","Operator","There will be a replay available of today's call starting at 12 o' clock PM Eastern time. It will run through Thursday, January 31st at midnight Eastern Time.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marlene Dooner. Please go ahead, Ms. Dooner.","Marlene S. Dooner","Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to our first quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call are Brian Roberts, Michael Angelakis, Steve Burke and Neil Smit. As we have done in the past, Brian and Michael will make formal remarks, and Steve and Neil will also be available for Q&A.","As always, let me refer you to Slide #2, which contains our Safe Harbor disclaimer, and remind you that this conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, in this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our 8-K for the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. ","With that, let me turn the call to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian?","Brian L. Roberts","Thanks, Marlene, and good morning, everyone. I'm really pleased with our start in 2012. In the first quarter, we had strong revenue and cash flow growth and record quarterly free cash flow of $3 billion. ","Cable had another outstanding quarter with real momentum in High-Speed Internet and Business Services and continuing improvements in Video results. ","Let's start with High-Speed Internet, which had a particularly strong quarter and customer growth with 439,000 net additions, up 5% from our strongest quarter last year as we continue to significantly outpace the net additions of our competitors. ","With 37% growth in revenue in the quarter, Business Services has become a significant engine for growth, and we have a mid-market opportunity that is still largely ahead of us. We're also pleased with our improving Video results. And although we reported 37,000 Video sub losses, we believe we can continue to make steady progress with our focus on technical and product leadership, and transforming the service experience and on accelerating innovation. ","Just in late February, we launched Streampix, which expands our Video offering with thousands of library movie and TV series available to stream anywhere. It's early, and the content choices will expand greatly throughout the year. But we now have a couple million customers who have access to Streampix.","Voice had a good quarter with 164,000 net adds, increasing penetration and improving performance as the quarter advanced. This year, we're launching a series of enhancements like readable voicemail and free text messaging, and launching Skype on XFINITY. All of these new features reinforce the value of our Voice product and highlight the growing number of ways in which consumers can communicate using our services. ","XFINITY Home is now available in 72% of our footprint, offering a compelling service that incorporates home security, home control and energy management, and expands our market opportunity beyond just security. It's clearly very early, and we're just getting started this year, but XFINITY Home adds another growth opportunity for Cable.","We're getting ready to expand availability of our X1 cloud-based user interface to hundreds of thousands of homes this year. And just a couple of days ago, we expanded the reach of our cross-marketing partnership with Verizon Wireless to 6 new markets. As you can see, we are focused on continuously enhancing our products, improving the customer experience and driving innovation, and all of this is bringing our XFINITY brand to life and trying to position us as the premier service provider for our customers. So whether you are measuring financial performance or operational excellence, Cable really is doing quite well, and we believe we can maintain this momentum.","We also had a good quarter and a nice beginning to the year at NBCUniversal with revenue growth across every segment led by the Super Bowl and 2 successful film releases, The Lorax and Safe House. The Cable Networks and Theme Parks continued to show reliable growth, and we're starting to make some progress in Broadcast. As we've said previously, there is and will be more business volatility and quarterly variability in the results of NBCUniversal than in the rest of the company.","Also in 2012, we have a more aggressive Film slate and special big events like the Super Bowl and the Olympics. But when you look through all of this, NBCUniversal businesses are performing well and we're very focused on continuing to execute to build the long-term value of its brands and franchises. We're investing in sports and original programming, and let me give you just a few examples of some of our early successes.","In the first quarter, Style's ratings were up double digits, and distribution increased by 18%. Syfy had its most-watched first quarter ever among total viewers and ranked among the top 10 cable entertainment networks in the quarter. At NBC Sports network, ratings for the first round of the NHL playoffs were the best in the network's history, up 16% from the same time last year. ","NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable are also working well together to launch new programs and innovative products, and we are looking forward to the Olympics to showcase some of our company's unique capabilities. We'll have a lot more to report on these efforts on our next quarterly call, which actually will take place during the Olympics. In the meantime, let me just wrap up by saying that we are very enthusiastic about the progress we're making driving financial and operational excellence across the company. ","Let me now pass to Michael to cover the first quarter results in detail.","Michael J. Angelakis","Thank you, Brian. Let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated financial results, starting on Slide 4. ","Overall, we are very pleased with our first quarter results, which reflect profitable growth and the fundamental strength in our businesses. First quarter consolidated revenue increased 23% to $14.9 billion, and operating cash flow increased 15% to $4.7 billion, reflecting strong organic growth in our Cable business, as well as consolidating 2011's acquisitions of NBCUniversal on January 28 and the remaining 50% of Universal Orlando on July 1.","Free cash flow for the quarter, which excludes any impact of the economic stimulus, increased 37% to $3 billion, reflecting growth in consolidated operating cash flow and some timing benefits in working capital including taxes, partially offset by higher capital and intangible asset expenditures.","Free cash flow per share increased 40.5% to $1.11 per share. Earnings per share for the first quarter grew 32% to $0.45 per share from $0.34 per share in the first quarter of 2011. Excluding NBCUniversal transaction and related costs of $0.02 per share in the first quarter of last year, our EPS increased 25% in the first quarter of 2012.","Please refer to Slide 5. Now let's take a look at the pro forma results of our Cable Communications and NBCUniversal businesses. Pro forma results are presented as if the NBCUniversal and the Universal Orlando transactions were both effective on January 1, 2010. As you know, we believe that pro forma presentation provides a more meaningful comparison of the operating performance of the businesses. ","For the first quarter of 2012, consolidated pro forma revenue increased 9.6% to $14.9 billion. Consolidated pro forma operating cash flow increased 9.6% to $4.7 billion. Included in pro forma operating cash flow for the first quarter of 2011 are transaction-related costs at NBCUniversal totaling $92 million. Excluding these costs, our pro forma consolidated operating cash flow increased 7.3%. ","For the first quarter, Cable Communications revenue increased 5.7% to $9.6 billion and represented 64% of our consolidated revenue, while Cable operating cash flow grew 5.5% to $4 billion and represented over 80% of consolidated operating cash flow. For the first quarter, NBCUniversal generated revenue of $5.5 billion, an increase of 18%, reflecting strong revenue growth in every segment, including the Super Bowl revenue of $259 million in the Broadcast TV segment. Excluding the Super Bowl in the first quarter of 2012, revenue increased 12.4%. ","NBCUniversal's operating cash flow increased 34.3% to $813 million. Excluding the $92 million of transaction-related costs I just mentioned, operating cash flow increased 16.6% at NBCUniversal. ","Please refer to the next slide, and let's review Cable Communications results in more detail. We had another strong quarter of financial and customer growth in our Cable Communications business. For the first quarter, Cable revenue increased a healthy 5.7% to $9.6 billion, reflecting growth in our Residential businesses, continued strength in Business Services and solid growth in advertising. ","We continue to effectively balance ARPU and customer growth. This quarter, total revenue per Video customer increased 8% to $143 per month reflecting rate increases, a higher contribution from Business Services and an increasing number of customers taking multiple products. ","At the end of the quarter, 73% of our Video customers took at least 2 products, and 38% took all 3 services versus 34% in the first quarter of 2011. We continue to experience real strength in our customer metrics. In the first quarter, combined Video, High-Speed Internet and Voice customers increased by 565,000. ","Our High-Speed Internet service continues to gain share as we are differentiating our product through service and speed enhancements. We added 439,000 new High-Speed Internet customers in the first quarter, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of HSI net add improvement.","In addition, we experienced continued improvement in our Video customer losses. In the first quarter, we lost 37,000 Video customers compared to a loss of 39,000 Video customers in last year's first quarter. We achieved these improved results even as our telco competitive footprint expanded from 36% to 38%, and we implemented rate increases to 62% of our footprint in the first quarter compared to 34% in the first quarter last year. ","While we continue to make progress with our Video results, we do want to remind everyone we are entering the second quarter, which is a seasonally slower period for our business due to the number of customers we have in college and vacation areas. However, as you can see in our first quarter results, we are executing well, and we are competing better with improved products and services. Our goal is to continue to focus on profitable growth and make improvements in our Video customer experience and performance.","As we look at our Service categories, first quarter Video revenue increased 1.6%, reflecting improved customer metrics, rate adjustments and an increasing number of customers taking higher levels of digital and advanced services. We added 243,000 advanced service customers in the first quarter and now have 11.1 million high-def and\/or DVR customers equal to 54% of our 20.7 million digital customers. ","High-Speed Internet revenue was a large contributor to Cable revenue growth in the first quarter. HSI revenue increased 10.3%, reflecting rate adjustments, continued growth in our customer base and an increasing number of our customers taking higher-speed services. Today, 26% of our Residential HSI customers take a higher-speed tier above our primary service. The addition of 439,000 new HSI customer in the first quarter resulted in the penetration of 35% of our network's homes passed.","With regard to Voice, revenue increased 2% for the quarter, reflecting continued growth in our customer base, partially offset by a slight decline in Voice ARPU. In the first quarter, we added 164,000 Voice customers and continued to see the pace of Voice customer additions improve, as we have increased our Triple Play sell-in metrics. In addition, as Brian mentioned, we are enhancing our Voice product with lots of new innovative features, such as readable voicemail and free texting through our XFINITY mobile app. ","Business Services continues its momentum and was a large contributor to Cable revenue growth in the first quarter with revenue increasing 37% to $541 million. Growth in Business Services continues to be driven by the small end of the market or businesses with less than 20 employees. In addition, Metro E and PRI Trunk Voice, which are now available in all of our markets, are making an increasing contribution to the Business Services results.","Please refer to Slide 7. First quarter Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 5.5% to $4 billion resulting in a stable margin of 41.2%. In the first quarter, total expenses in Cable increased 5.8%, primarily reflecting higher video programming costs, sales and marketing expenses, as well as continued operating expenses to expand the capabilities in Business Services and other new initiatives. ","Program expenses increased 5.5% in the first quarter of 2012 as we continue to increase the amount of content we provide to consumers across multiple platforms. As we have mentioned previously, we expect programming expenses to grow at mid- to high-single-digit rates. And in 2012, we expect program expenses to grow at the higher end of that range. ","In addition, sales and marketing expenses increased 11.7% as a result of higher overall media spend and a continued investment in direct sales to more effectively target customers and enhance our competitive position in both our Residential and Business Services segments.","Partially offsetting these higher expenses, we improved efficiencies in our operations as we focus on improving service, reducing churn and increasing customer satisfaction. As a result, customer service and technical operation expenses were relatively flat during the quarter. In addition, bad debt expense improved as we continue to improve our retention, collection and screening processes.","Please refer to Slide 8 as we'll review Cable Communications capital expenditures. In the first quarter, total Cable capital expenditures were stable at $1.1 billion, equal to 11% of Cable revenue versus 11.6% in the first quarter of 2011. This reduction in capital intensity reflects scale efficiencies, which helped offset higher investments in CPE, continued investments in network infrastructure and the ongoing expansion of Business Services. ","During the first quarter, CPE expenditures increased 3% as we deployed 658,000 advanced HD and\/or DVR set tops and another 1.3 million digital adapters, but benefited from lower average pricing. Our All-Digital project, which we completed last year, has been a terrific initiative that has provided significant operational benefits and product enhancements and has also generated strong financial returns. We continue to recapture remaining analog bandwidth in a number of our markets as we anticipate additional operating efficiencies and strategic benefits from fully digitizing our systems.","First quarter 2012 CapEx also reflects our investment to support the growth in Business Services, which totaled $146 million. Business Services continues to have positive momentum and generate strong returns well above our cost of capital.  In addition, we continue to invest capital on our network to ensure superior product leadership in High-Speed Internet and to fund the future expansion of new services like XFINITY Home, Wi-Fi and X1, which expand our product offerings and drive future organic growth. Overall, we are very pleased with our capital investment plan and our focus on strategic areas of growth that yield strong risk-adjusted returns.","Please refer to Slide 9, so we can review the pro forma results for NBCUniversal. For the first quarter of 2012, NBCUniversal's revenue increased 12.4% excluding the Super Bowl, and operating cash flow increased 16.6% excluding transaction-related costs in 2011. ","As Brian mentioned, NBCUniversal has substantial volatility from a quarter-to-quarter basis from businesses like Film, which had a good first quarter and timing issues related to the launch of new programming across our Broadcast and Cable Networks. For the first quarter, our positive results are driven by improvement in Film, steady progress in Broadcast and solid results from Cable Networks and Theme Parks. ","Now let's take a closer look at the individual segments at NBCUniversal. For the first quarter, Cable Networks generated revenue of $2.1 billion, an increase of 5.8% driven by a 5.9% increase in advertising revenue, a 3.8% increase in distribution revenue and a 20.5% increase in other revenue, primarily due to increases in the licensing of content. ","Cable Networks operating cash flow decreased 1.4% to $805 million, primarily reflecting higher sports programming costs due to a shift in a number of NBA games to the first quarter of 2012 after the NBA lockout was settled.  In addition to sports programming, we continue to invest in original programming, and we're seeing positive results, including USA maintaining its position as the #1 Cable network and good progress at our entertainment and sports networks.","With regards to our Broadcast segment, first quarter Broadcast Television revenue increased 36.9% to $1.9 billion and included $259 million of revenue generated by the Super Bowl. Excluding the impact of the Super Bowl in the first quarter, Broadcast revenue increased 17.7% reflecting higher primetime ratings primarily due to the success of The Voice and higher content licensing revenue from a licensing agreement signed in the second quarter of 2011. First quarter 2012 Broadcast operating cash flow decreased $30 million to a loss of $10 million, reflected increased programming and marketing costs to support the mid-season primetime schedule.","Moving on to Film. First quarter revenue increased 22.3% to $1.2 billion, reflecting higher theatrical revenue from the strong box-office performance of The Lorax and Safe House, as well as higher home entertainment revenue due to more DVD titles being released compared to last year's first quarter and the success of Tower Heist and Hop. First quarter Film operating cash flow improved by $152 million to $6 million, primarily reflecting higher theatrical revenue.","Switching to our Theme Parks segment. We had a strong quarter as Theme Parks generated revenue of $412 million, a 5.7% increase driven by higher per capita spending at the Orlando and Hollywood Parks, which continue to benefit from the success of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction in Orlando and the King Kong attraction in Hollywood. We continue to have healthy attendance in both Orlando and Hollywood as both parks benefit from strong growth in international visitors. First quarter operating cash flow increased 17.1% to $157 million. ","Please refer to Slide 10 for an update on our 2012 financial strategy. As I mentioned earlier, we generated consolidated free cash flow of $3 billion in the first quarter, an increase of 37%. Free cash flow per share increased 40.5% to $1.11 per share. The first quarter is typically our strongest free cash flow quarter as we pay federal cash taxes in the second, third and fourth quarters. ","I think I've mentioned this before, but I think you know that we manage Comcast and NBCUniversal as 2 distinct pools of cash flow generation and funding capacity. As you can see on this slide, Comcast, which includes both Cable Communications and Corporate and Other, accounted for $2.2 billion or 72% of total free cash flow. And NBCUniversal contributed $851 million or 28% of consolidated free cash flow. NBCUniversal's free cash flow and cash is retained to build capacity to fund future equity redemptions by GE while Comcast Cable allocates its free cash flow to consistently return capital to shareholders.","We view our strong balance sheet as a strategic asset and are committed to remaining a strong investment-grade issuer. At the end of the first quarter, we had $37.8 billion of debt on our consolidated balance sheet and had gross debt to operating cash flow leverage of 2x. ","We are executing on our 2012 financial plan that we outlined in our year-end earnings call. And during the first quarter, we returned $1.1 billion of capital to shareholders, including share repurchases totaling $750 million and dividend payments totaling $304 million. Overall, our consolidated operating and financial results mark a strong start to 2012. We are progressing according to our internal plans and are continuing to execute on our strategic opportunities. ","Now let me turn the call over to Marlene for Q&A.","Marlene S. Dooner","Thanks, Michael. Operator, let's open up the call for Q&A, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with Sanford Bernstein.","Craig Moffett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Since there's been so much attention to the seasonality trend in basic Video subscribers this quarter, I wonder if maybe, Neil, you could just go through the math a little bit of why we didn't get as large a sequential seasonal swing in basic Video subscribers that we've historically gotten. Was it something in the fourth quarter? Was it something in the first? Just help us understand what happened.","Neil Smit","Craig, I don't think there was really a seasonality impact that was different than previous years. I think the difference was that, as Michael stated, the percentage of our footprint that experienced a rate increase was up from 34% to 62%. I think the size of this footprint that received the rate increase resulted in more customer service calls and slightly higher churn. I think our goal is to continue to improve on Video losses quarter after quarter. This is the sixth consecutive quarter that we've done that. I think without the increase, we would have had better net gain numbers. However, it's great to have this rate increase event behind us, and I think I was pleased that we were able to reduce losses while increasing ARPU 4% on Video and 8% overall.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just have a question for Mr. Roberts. I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit on Streampix in terms of how you plan to position that in the marketplace and how long you think it will be before it's ubiquitous across your footprint.","Brian L. Roberts","Well, I think let me start. Neil, you can jump in if you want. It's a good beginning. As I said, we have ubiquitously across the footprint available, we have over couple million who now have access to Streampix. We're beginning to advertise it. You'll probably see some of our ads. They're terrific. The biggest thing is we're going to be increasing the quality and the quantity of the content as we secure more rights and as we put into the servers the rights that we've already got. It's also increasing our On Demand usage, and just in the month of March, we saw real usage right out of the box. So I think it's a nice addition. Neil, you want to add anything to that?","Neil Smit","Yes, I think the intent of it was to fill out our content portfolio, it's complementary. So we have the recent content in the form of linear, the VOD content and now the library content. We're seeing good uptick on usage. It's on both VOD and as a premium. And we also are bundling it with a Video package and broadband as a way to extend our -- off our footprint of HSD-only in DBS households. And that's been well received. So it's a complementary Video product, and we can use it to bundle with other products.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jessica Reif-Cohen with Bank of America.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Well, I'll interpret that as one question on each division. So first on SME, I just wanted -- I think Brian mentioned at the beginning of the call that you're about to go full force into the mid-sized market. Can you just talk about what impact that will have on growth? Is it steady as you go or will growth accelerate as you really ramp up? And on the NBCU side, I mean, it seems like your team is solidly in place. I'm just \u2013 and ratings are stabilizing at NBC. What's the next step? Is the goal to drive in-house production? Where is the real next driver of value here?","Brian L. Roberts","Jessica, I'll take the SME question and then pass it over to Steve. I think we're getting most of our growth with SME and now Metro E and mid-sized are starting to come in. We're offering 3 products really on the mid-sized. It's both -- it's the Metro E product, the Ethernet, it's PRI, PBX equivalent and now a hosted Voice solution. I think we also have backhaul. We have about -- we've increased the number of installed towers by about 79% since 2010. So I think the growth will continue to ramp in Metro E, and I think the growth rate will remain relatively steady because we're growing it on a larger basis. We think the overall opportunity is $20 billion to $30 billion. We're at about a $2.2 billion run rate now. So that's only a 10% penetration.","Stephen B. Burke","Regarding value drivers at NBCUniversal, I think we have a lot of them. I would start with Broadcast. We're underperforming our peers. And if we got up to the level of our peers, if you look at Broadcast as an ecosystem that includes the network, the owned stations and syndication, we're hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of opportunity just getting to average in that business. And I think we're starting to make some progress, but there's a long way to go. We're headed out to look at pilots, and of course, we have the upfronts coming, and we're optimistic and have made some good progress. Revenues were up 11% for the quarter, not including the Super Bowl. The Voice clearly is going to be something that we can use to build on. So I think Broadcast is a big opportunity. And by Broadcast, don't forget we also have Telemundo, which I think represents opportunity. The Cable channels are really the heart of current cash flow and continue to do well. And we're investing in them, and I think those represent an opportunity over time. Film represents a real opportunity as we have a much stronger slate this year, in my opinion. We'll see whether that translates into increased profitability this year and next, but we're hopeful. And then we've got the Theme Parks, where we've invested and continued to be very bullish about Orlando, where you've got Harry Potter over a year old and doing great, and Hollywood is doing well as well. So we have a lot of different places where we're optimistic about the future. It takes time. As you mentioned, we have our team in place. We've started to make the investments, and we think we had a solid quarter on our way to a good year. But there's a lot of opportunity at NBCUniversal for years to come.","Brian L. Roberts","I just want to add, Jessica, to that, that I also think that the working together between content and distribution adds additional value to our company, but over time, the trend has suggested that really great content is going to be worth more value to distributors with more technological ways to distribute. So as we look forward in the years ahead, not just in the quarters ahead, I think we're sitting on one of the great libraries and one of the great set of brands in the industry. And I believe we'll find ways to monetize that as the technology continues to make it more attractive to consumers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs.","Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a question on broadband. There's sort of a fear more broadly that we're nearing saturation from an industry perspective. Your results obviously don't suggest that you're accelerating growth in net adds in the business. Maybe just help us think through the outlook and how you think about balancing volume growth versus the pricing power that you probably could exercise to a greater extent here.","Brian L. Roberts","Jason, I think that we were very pleased with the quarter at 439,000 net adds. And as you said, we continue to drive strong growth quarter after quarter. I think it's fundamentally because we have a -- we feel we have a better product where we continue to increase speeds on top of our DOCSIS platform. I think from a -- there's always a balance between rate and volume. We think we've met that balance pretty well. We increased ARPU 4% this quarter in HSD and drove that sort of growth. So we feel there's still some pricing power as long as we're continuing to improve the product and meet the customer demand.","Operator","Our next question will come from Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Neil, a clarification. If price increases drove higher churn in 1Q, are fewer price increases causing you -- or price increases in fewer markets causing you to see better churn in 2Q? I'm just curious, any comments you'd have on changes you're seeing in the competitive environment or the economy. I mean, for example, this quarter the phone companies talked a bit about backing off their DSL product. I think Verizon even said they weren't marketing anymore. And FiOS talked about one of their primary goals is also to drive margins now, which makes it sound like promotional activity will be stable or maybe even improve going forward. So any thoughts around the environment and churn will be helpful.","Neil Smit","Yes, I think, as you know, in the second quarter we -- and I think Michael mentioned we have seasonality, both in the college towns, as well as the snowbirds down in some of our Southern markets like Florida. So seasonality does take effect, and it has in all the previous years. I think in terms of competition, I think it varies for each of our services. We always seek the right balance there. There wasn't anything that was significantly different this quarter than the different competitive offers we saw in previous quarters. I think Verizon came out with a relatively low-priced bundle in some markets, and DirecTV is doing some promotional activity around SUNDAY TICKET. But I think we see those kinds of things every quarter, and we feel we're competing very well primarily by innovating at a better rate. We're getting more products out as Brian mentioned. We launched Streampix this quarter. We increased speeds. We're getting more content out there. We've got X1 being launched in this quarter, the second quarter. So we feel good about the innovation, delivering more value to our customers.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","In terms of churn, Neil, I was thinking about year-over-year rather than quarter-over-quarter. Certainly, understand the seasonality. I was just thinking of 1Q churn was a little bit higher year-over-year that 2Q then might be a little bit lower year-over-year. Any thoughts on that?","Neil Smit","It was generally in the same range, and we don't -- had -- 2Q. The first quarter churn was generally in the same range. It wasn't substantively different. As I mentioned in the rate increases, there was slightly higher churn but not materially different. And the second quarter, I think, we don't generally project forward on churn.","Operator","Our next question will come from John Hodulik with UBS.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Neil, maybe just a follow-up to your comments on X1. Could you just talk a little bit about that? You said second quarter rollout here. Obviously, we know about the trial that I guess you did in Augusta. But how quickly will you be able to roll that across the footprint? And maybe talk about some of the benefits you expect to get, maybe lower churn or better gross adds and talk about the product a little bit. That'd be great.","Neil Smit","Well, as you know, it's a product with cloud-based user interface and advanced navigation. We have apps on it. It's an easier way to discover content, and we're very excited about the test we've been running down in Augusta. People seemed -- they get on the product and they begin to use it more and more. And so we're going to be rolling it out in one major market here this quarter and then it'll go out subsequently to other markets. I think the range we'll see this year will be in the hundreds of thousands. It's dependent upon hardware primarily. It can go on COAM devices and advanced set tops as well, the platform can. And I think the real advantage of it was we put so much of our information up in the cloud, it enables us to innovate more quickly. So putting our VOD content on the Xbox was very relatively simple and a much quicker launch because we had so much up in the cloud. So we're excited about it. I think the impact of it will be, hopefully, more customers wanting to subscribe to our Video service and less churn because they're more pleased with our product.","Brian L. Roberts","I just want to maybe just echo that, for me, if you're on a technological plan that all of your products have ultimate innovation and hopefully, superiority to their competitors, that's a business that you feel very good about. And so in the Video business, in particular to the question, I think what it begins to show is the 2-way network has tremendous advantages over some of the one-way networks like satellite. And we have to execute and make that happen for consumers. That word of mouth has to get out. We have to market it. We have to brand it. But first, we had to invent it and stabilize it to make sure it really was -- had that same experience. And I think that's what we're excited about and we've seen -- it goes across the whole platform. It's all devices, as well as easy to put on, as Neil said, third-party devices. So we think we're making real progress there long term, and I think that's going to be a differentiator. May not happen in a quarter or 2, but we will roll out this major market here the next few weeks, and we're very excited about it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a clarification and a question. On programming costs, Michael, I think you said mid to high and at the higher end of that for the year, so I just wanted to make sure it's fair to say Q1 was more mid, so you expect it to ramp through the year. And then question for anyone who wants to take it just on the spectrum sale. Obviously, a lot of focus in D.C. there. And I'm just curious if you'd comment whether if the spectrum deal with Verizon is not allowed, is the JV something that continues to be a possibility or are those 2 events tied together in your minds strategically? Because obviously, having a wireless partner is something that I think, Comcast values going forward.","Brian L. Roberts","Yes, why don't I take it. You're right, Ben, the programming costs for the first quarter are sort of in the mid-range. We do expect for the year that when you look at the entire year, that programming costs will be slightly higher than what was represented in the first quarter. We have some contract renewals and some other things that come into play that will boost those costs up a bit for the whole year. With regard to -- I'll take the one with regard to the spectrum sale. We're very optimistic that we'll get the transaction closed in the latter part of the year. I know Verizon Wireless and our folks on the regulatory side are working closely with the FCC and DOJ, and I think both parties are very optimistic we'll get the deal closed. And we'll get it closed, at least, our view is sort of towards the latter half of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stefan Anninger with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Stefan Anninger - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","My question is for Mr. Smit. I was hoping you could give us a sense of how many of your Video subscribers are actively using your XFINITY TV online product, and perhaps you could give us a sense of how important you think that product has been to improving your Video subscriber results. In other words, do you see that product as a key driver of your slowing Video sub losses?","Neil Smit","Our XFINITY TV app on the iPad, we've had about a little over 5 million downloads. The people who are using it interestingly are using it -- using the tools more than viewing the long-form content. The tools I'm referring to are search and remote. And we feel it is helping with our customers explore the content and get to the content of a -- in an easier manner. And therefore, our belief is that if customers can find our content and view it in an easier way and it's a great -- a better experience, that there will be more customers wanting to use our service. The other thing I'd say is that it has things like cross-platform search, and I think it enables us to go -- to leverage the advantage, one of the advantages we have, which is great content, linear, VOD, DVR and online. And we believe that's one of the key advantages that we have.","Operator","Your next question will come from James Ratcliffe with Barclays.","James M. Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just give us an update on My TV Choice and also the Internet Essentials program and to what degree, if any, they're contributing to subscriber growth?","Neil Smit","James, our My TV Choice is in test in 3 markets. As you know, it's a basic package with different genre bolt-ons. We found that it works well, especially in retention because it gives people choice, and that's what folks are looking for. We haven't made a decision of yet as to how to roll it out on a broader basis, but we're encouraged by the tests. In terms of Internet Essentials, it's not a material contributor to the HSD number, but we're very pleased with the program. It's been exceptionally well received by the market, and we're big believers in getting this service to people, extending the Internet to people who may not be able to afford the higher-priced product.","Operator","Your next question will come from Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a question on ARPU. What prompted the increase in rate in the quarter? Did the Disney contract have anything to do with the timing here? And then related, can you talk about the contribution from your Home Security business, if anything, to ARPU?","Neil Smit","Marci, it was really an operational decision. We had markets who were ready to take the increases, and we just -- it didn't have anything to do with the Disney contract. It was more operational in nature. With regards -- your second question, please? With regards to Home Security, we've now rolled it out about 73% of our footprint. It's been really well received. I mean, the churn on it is very low. People -- once -- we had to figure out how to best sell it. It's a more consultative sale. But now that we've figured that out, it's going very well in the markets that we're launching. We believe that it won't be a material contributor this year, but it's a great product going forward and will become more material over time.","Brian L. Roberts","And just to be clear, it didn't have really any impact on ARPU at all this quarter. The numbers are way too small.","Operator","Your next question will come from Mike McCormack with Nomura Securities.","Michael McCormack - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Maybe if you can just make a quick comment, Neil, on this issue regarding Sony and Netflix and the over-the-top offerings being subject to broadband caps and how the FCC might be viewing your side or their side of that. And then just, Steve, if you would, is there any chance you can quantify the impact of the NBA game shifts in the quarter?","Neil Smit","Right now, we don't have plans to introduce any usage-based pricing. I think our goal is to provide the best HSD experience, and I think by the results that we continue to offer in HSD, it's clear that customers are pleased with our thresholds. We review various forms of pricing and structures all the time. We put the instrumentation in place should we decide to go to a different form of pricing. And with regards to Sony and Netflix, I think Netflix articulated in their earnings call that our data thresholds don't really impact their Netflix users at this point.","Stephen B. Burke","So we're not releasing what the effect of the NBA lockout was precisely, but I will say it's one of the few things that happened during the quarter that made the Cable Networks look like they weren't growing. The reported growth was minus 1%. The actual growth was mid-single digits because of a few things like the NBA lockout that really depressed this quarter's growth rate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Eagan with Canaccord.","Thomas W. Eagan - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","I have a question on video-on-demand. It seems as though the service is finally becoming one that the cable operators can provide some kind of an advantage. So could you give us latest on the buy rates and on advertising on VOD?","Neil Smit","So we -- generally speaking, the usage of VOD continues to increase. We're up to about 400 million views a month. When we launched Catch Up Keep Up, which provides all the catch-up content for the past 4 episodes or in some cases, 5 episodes that the free content usage went up significantly, and that drove more transactional usage. In terms of advertising, as you may have heard, we are now doing dynamic ad insertion pre-roll, mid-roll and post-roll. And we feel that's a great opportunity for advertisers, programmers and distributors. So we'll be looking at -- we're in test with it right now with some different programmers, and we intend to roll that out on a broader basis over the next year.","Brian L. Roberts","Let me just comment that you can see the strategy through that question and Neil's answer, you've got -- we made real progress on OnDemand, I think, back 5, 7 years ago when we first started to get to 400 million users a month. Let's not just walk by that number. That's dramatic customer behavior. You then layer in that we made real progress with broadcasters, and now have a lot of the content to be able to have catch up and keep up. Then you have Streampix, which we've just created, too, as we talked about. Then you've got to be able to have a guide and a user interface that makes it easy to navigate this unbelievably broad set of choices. And that's where X1 kicks in, in addition to some of the improvements we've made on the guide, as well as what we've done with the iPad and on other platforms to be able to search and navigate, as Neil was talking about. And you really can begin as you brand it as XFINITY to see that's a different experience, and that is the trend that we're on. And if you really believe we're headed to an interactive world and each user, not even each household, has their own personal choices and their own control, I don't know that there's a better platform out there than what we've been building, and it's starting to really kick in. And I think we've taken a leadership on this, and it hasn't -- each little quarter, it's getting a little better. And I think we see a lot of progress with innovation happening the next couple years, and we're on a good road.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wonder if you can expand a little bit on the TV Everywhere progress, both on the Cable side maybe in the home, I think it's the Media Mover device. And then in the NBCU side, the potential to start getting paid for customers taking content like what Disney and Time Warner have started to do.","Neil Smit","So I'll take the TV Everywhere question then turn it over to Steve. I think it's important to begin with the definition of TV Everywhere, which is we believe it's having valuable content for our customers on multiple platforms in an authenticated model. Our belief is that we want to offer the broadest selection of content to our customers, the best TV shows and movies across multiple platforms. Right now, we have 35,000 choices on VOD, 225,000 choices online, 8,000 choices on the iPad app. So we've got a lot of choices out there. As Brian said, we're improving the navigation experience. And I think that with regards to programming deals, we've done, as you mentioned, a landmark deal with Disney. We've got TV Everywhere with a number of other programmers. I think we're beginning to bring the experience to life, and so we're very pleased with the progress, and we'll continue to deliver the content and the experience to our customers. Steve?","Stephen B. Burke","And from the content side, I think most of the big content companies now realize that TV Everywhere is important for content companies. And the fact of the matter is anything that allows customers to get what they want when they want it and get more value out of their cable or satellite subscription is good for a content company that relies on cable channels for a lot of their OCF. And I think particularly in a world where you're seeing real numbers come in from retransmission consent, it's important to have key broadcast product on a TV Everywhere basis as well, and you'll see us do a lot of that with the Olympics. How you actually get paid for that whether it's bundled in the rate or whether there's a specific charge I don't think matters too much. I think clearly, it's something that's providing more value for those cable channels, and we got to make sure that we continue to realize that's at least for NBCUniversal and really for all of the big cable companies, that's where a lot of the OCF comes from.","Operator","Our last question will come from Bryan Kraft with Evercore Partners.","Bryan D. Kraft - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just a question on the Cable Networks. It looks like the growth in distribution revenue is running at about 4% so far this year, and it's down from 10% last year. Just want to understand, is the 4% more indicative of what this year will probably look like? And what do you think the opportunity is to reaccelerate affiliate growth as contracts come up for renewal?","Stephen B. Burke","That number was affected by a one-timer in the first quarter of last year. So I think the real number is going to be north of 5% and not that 3.8% that we reported today.","Bryan D. Kraft - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And in terms of, I think when you announced the NBCU deal, one of the things you talked about was the opportunity to pry some of the Cable Networks more in line with some of the peers of comparable ratings. And just, Steve, as you go forward, how are you feeling about that opportunity to kind of reprice to market as we go forward?","Stephen B. Burke","I think we have a real opportunity. If you look at the strength of our Cable Networks, both in terms of ratings and just overall demand and then you look at our peers, I think there's no question that we have opportunity on the affiliate side, significant opportunity over time. We have opportunity in terms of retransmission consent, and then we have a major opportunity over time in terms of advertising. The fact of the matter is a lot of our Cable Networks don't have the CPMs that they should have relative to their peers. And on affiliate and advertising, it's going to take time. It just doesn't happen overnight. But the fact of the matter is I think given the ratings we have and the value we're providing, the consumers and viewers of our networks, we have real opportunity over the next few years to get paid more for that.","Marlene S.

In addition, in this call we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our 8-K for the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. ","With that, let me turn the call to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian? ","","Brian Roberts","Thanks, Marlene, and good morning everyone. I\u2019m really pleased with our results this quarter, and so far in the first nine months of the year. We have real momentum across all of our businesses, reporting strong revenue growth of 5.2% and cash flow growth of 10.5% when you adjust for the Olympics and pension termination costs.","We also generated free cash flow of nearly $2 billion, a record for the third quarter. Cable continues to execute really well, with solid financial and customer results. In the third quarter, we added 337,000 combined video, voice, and internet customers, a 15% increase from last year, once again driven by really outstanding growth in high speed internet and voice and stable performance in video, despite a larger competitive footprint.","We continue to focus on delivering the best and most innovative products, and on providing more value to our customers, all backed by a compelling brand message that attracts customers and potential customers alike. In fact, our XFINITY brand metrics continue to move up. Brand consideration reached its highest level this third quarter, and we have grown the rate at which non-customers would consider purchasing our services by 70% since we launched the XFINITY brand.","In high-speed internet, we are delivering some of the fastest speeds across devices, both inside and outside of the home. We have installed more than 6 million wireless gateways in our customers\u2019 homes and expanded our wifi coverage to now more than 350,000 hot spots.","In video, we recently expanded our partnership with CBS, adding to our already substantial on demand choices, and giving our customers even more opportunities to catch up and stay current with a bigger selection of shows. ","Real progress has been made in this last year, and customers now have access to the most comprehensive video experience no matter where they want to watch, with close to 50,000 on demand choices and more than 250,000 streaming options, including the full current season of more than 200 television series from all major networks, and nearly all of the top 50 rated shows on television. And customers love all this choice, as they have viewed on demand 30 billion times in the last 10 years and watched on demand 400 million times a month on average. ","Just like we have transformed our video offering by expanding our content choices and deploying all digital, we believe the X1 platform now represents another step function in the evolution of our service. X1 is deployed in more than 90% of our footprint and by year-end it will be available everywhere.","Based on the early, positive customer results, and the attractive returns of X1, you will see us accelerate the pace of deployment to customers and maintain the fast pace of innovation as we deliver X2 and integrate even more apps and new features. ","NBC Universal also delivered solid results in every one of its business segments, with healthy growth in revenue, and when you adjust out for the Olympics last year, this is the fourth quarter in a row of double digit cash flow growth.","So far, we\u2019re off to a great start with NBC early season leadership in broadcast television. For the first five weeks, including and excluding sports, NBC has grown in ratings, and is the number one broadcast network. \u201cThe Voice,\u201d \u201cSunday Night Football,\u201d and now \u201cThe Blacklist\u201d are all helping to power this improvement. Our film studio has enjoyed tremendous success from \u201cFast 6\u201d and \u201cDespicable Me 2,\u201d and we\u2019ve had steady growth in all of our cable networks and the theme parks as well. ","Even more impressive is that these businesses have grown cash flow by more than 50% since we announced our acquisition in 2009, while making significant investments for the future. I could not be more pleased with the progress and see lots of growth ahead.","We\u2019re also excited about the winter Olympics, and expect that this will, once again, help support all of the company\u2019s momentum, as it did in London. And all parts of Comcast NBC Universal will be behind the Sochi Olympics, and then just a few months later, we\u2019ll do it again with the opening of the much-anticipated Harry Potter 2 in Orlando. ","We\u2019re constantly looking for new and varied ways to innovate. One recent example is our announcement with Twitter, which combines our technology platform and our content. We will debut in November a new feature called See It that in effect creates an online remote control. We believe this new feature may help drive Twitter users to live TV, and also give NBC Universal another way to add to our broad array of programming assets with its advertisers.","So as you can see, we\u2019re executing really well on so many different businesses, and with this strong quarter and first nine months of the year, we are really optimistic about the future. Let me now pass to Michael to cover the third quarter results in detail.","Michael Angelakis ","Good morning, and thank you, Brian. Let me begin by briefly reviewing our third quarter consolidated financial results, starting on slide four. Overall, we are very pleased with our third quarter performance, which once again demonstrates consistent execution, profitable growth, and the fundamental strength of our businesses.","Excluding the impact of the London Olympics, which generated $1.2 billion of revenue in the third quarter of 2012, consolidated revenue for the quarter increased 5.2% to $16.2 billion. On a reported basis, third quarter consolidated revenue decreased 2.4%.","From an operating cash flow perspective, again excluding the impact of the Olympics last year, and costs during the quarter associated with the termination of a pension plan, consolidated operating cash flow increased 10.5% to $5.4 billion. This performance reflects strong organic growth in both our cable communications and NBC Universal businesses. On a regular basis, operating cash flow increased 6.4%. ","Free cash flow for the third quarter increased 30% to $2 billion and free cash flow per share increased 32.1% to $0.74 per share in the quarter. This growth was primarily driven by increases in our consolidated operating cash flow, some benefits in working capital related to the performance of our film slate, as well as favorable comparisons to production spending and rights for last year\u2019s Olympics. These improvements in free cash flow were partially offset by higher capital expenditures and cash taxes. ","Earnings per share of $0.65 for the third quarter increased 41.3%, excluding gains reported in last year\u2019s third quarter, related to SpectrumCo\u2019s sale of wireless spectrum licenses and NBC Universal\u2019s sale of its interest in the A&E networks.","In addition, our third quarter 2013 earnings per share of $0.65 reflects a nonrecurring $0.11 gain related to the sale of our investment in Clearwire that was fully offset by other investment losses and the pension termination costs I just mentioned. Table 4 in our press release provides more detail. ","These are strong results for the company, and now let\u2019s review the results of our business units in more detail, starting with cable communications on slide five. We are pleased with our third quarter performance of healthy financial and customer growth in our cable communications business. In the third quarter, cable revenue increased 5.2% to $10.5 billion, reflecting solid growth in each of our residential businesses and continued strength in businesses services, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. ","Cable advertising revenue decreased 10.8% during the third quarter, reflecting lower political revenue and one less week of advertising included in this quarter. Excluding political and normalizing for the calendar, our core cable advertising revenue increased 3% during the third quarter. As a reminder, we generated $132 million of political ad revenue in the fourth quarter of 2012. This will make comparisons a bit more challenging next quarter. ","Our cable business continues to execute well and, excluding advertising, has delivered consistent financial results, as cable revenue increased 6.2%, which is consistent with the growth rate in each of our last six quarters as we carefully balance financial and customer growth. We are focused on driving sustainable, profitable growth and our total revenue per video customer reached $161 per month, a 6.9% increase.","This revenue growth reflects rate adjustments, growth in our customer base, an increase in the number of customers receiving higher levels of our service, and an increasing number of customers taking multiple products. We are clearly competing better, with improved products, with a focus on customer retention, and our triple play strategy.","At the end of the third quarter, 78% of our video customers took at least two products and 43% took all three services, a 400 basis point improvement over last year. We continue to experience strength in our customer metrics as well. Combined video, high-speed internet, and voice customers increased by 337,000, a 14.9% increase in net customer additions, compared to the third quarter of 2012, driven by strong high-speed internet and voice net additions, partially offset by video customer losses.","In the third quarter, we lost 129,000 video customers, which is comparable to the 117,000 of losses in last year\u2019s third quarter, despite a more competitive market with the telcos\u2019 expansion of an additional 1.5 million overbuilt homes in our footprint during this year. ","As we review the individual service categories, we reported healthy video revenue growth rate of 2.9%, driven by the impact of rate increases and an increasing number of customers taking advanced services. In the third quarter, we added 70,000 advanced service customers, and now have 12.1 million high-def and\/or DVR customers, equal to 56% of our video customers.","High-speed internet was again the largest contributor to cable revenue growth, with revenue increasing 7.9%, driven by continued growth in our customer base, as we added 297,000 new high-speed internet customers, an improvement over last year and increasing our penetration to 38% of homes past.","Also contributing to this growth was the increased number of customers receiving our higher-speed services. At the end of the quarter, 34% of our residential high-speed customers take a higher-speed tier above our primary service. We continue to invest in our network to improve and differentiate our high-speed internet service, and during the third quarter, we increased speeds for our fastest tier to 505 Mbps from 305 Mbps in some of our markets.","With regard to our voice service, revenue increased 2.6% for the quarter, which was driven by growth in our customer base, as we continue to focus on the value of the triple play. In the third quarter, we added 169,000 new voice customers, a 38% increase over last year, as we successfully converted single and double play customers to triple play and acquired new triple play customer relationships. At the end of the third quarter, our voice penetration was 20% of homes past. ","Moving from our consumer to our commercial businesses, revenue increased 26.4% to $836 million for the quarter. We continue to experience real momentum in business services as we offer a full suite of competitive products and are focused on execution. With only about 10% to 15% market penetration, we continue to be excited about the growth and profit opportunity in our business services segment.","Please move to slide six. Third quarter cable communications operating cash flow increased 6.2% to $4.2 billion, representing a margin of 40.5%, a 40 basis point improvement compared to the third quarter of 2012. This is excellent performance, as it also absorbs the impact from the loss of high margin advertising revenue during the quarter.","In the third quarter, total expenses in cable increased 4.5%, primarily reflecting higher program expenses. Program expenses increased 9.2% in the third quarter, reflecting higher rates and step ups related to certain agreements, increasing retransmission consent fees, and our expanding content lineup on multiple platforms. This is partially offset by the timing of certain network launches.","We are pleased with the management of these costs year to date, and while we expect the fourth quarter program expense growth to accelerate, we expect our full year program expenses to increase by high single-digit rates, lower than the 10% we had previously forecast. Excluding these programming costs, cable expenses increased 2%, reflecting higher customer service expenses as we roll out X1 and wireless gateways across our footprint, as well as costs related to the expansion of business services and XFINITY Home.","We remain very focused on expense management and further efficiency gains. In the third quarter, we reduced our truck rolls by nearly 1 million during the quarter. Customers also continue to elect self installations, which in the third quarter now accounted for 44% of our total installations, compared to 34% in the third quarter of last year. In addition, we now have almost one-third of our customers managing their counts online. ","In addition to these efficiency gains, an improving product mix, reflecting an increasing amount of operating cash flow coming from our high-speed internet, business services, and voice services continues to contribute to stability in our cable margins. Now let\u2019s move on to NBC Universal results, so please refer to slide seven.","Excluding any impact from the Olympics in 2012, NBC Universal\u2019s third quarter revenue increased 3.9% and operating cash flow increased 22.4%, with strong results across all business segments. On a reported basis, revenue decreased 14.2% and operating cash flow increased 9.6%.","Now let\u2019s take a closer look at the individual segments at NBC Universal. For the third quarter, cable networks generated revenue of $2.2 billion, an increase of 4%, driven by a 5.4% increase in distribution revenue and a 4.6% increase in advertising revenue, as ratings pressure at some of our cable networks was offset by higher pricing.","Cable networks operating cash flow increased 5.4% to $853 million in the third quarter, reflecting improved revenue performance, partially offset by a 3.8% increase in programming and production costs as we continue to invest in programming to enhance our franchises, including our launch of the English Premier League on NBC Sports Network. ","In the broadcast television segment, the success of the Olympics, the early start of the fall season, and higher political advertising last year drove some difficult comparisons. And as a result, revenue decreased 41% to $1.6 billion in the third quarter. However, excluding the Olympics, broadcast revenue increased 2.6%, reflecting higher retransmission consent fees and a 2.6% increase in advertising, reflecting lower political advertising revenue at our own stations and lower prime time ratings as last year benefited from the early start of our fall schedule.","Recall in 2012 we premiered our fall primetime shows earlier than normal, immediately after the Olympics. Excluding the Olympics, broadcast operating cash flow increased [$66] million to [$34] million in the third quarter, reflecting higher revenue and slightly lower programming and production costs. ","Moving on to film entertainment, our third quarter revenue increased 3.3% to $1.4 billion, and operating cash flow increased $117 million to $189 million, driven by higher theatrical revenue from the strong box office performance of \u201cDespicable Me 2\u201d partially offset by lower home entertainment revenue due to fewer titles released on DVDs compared to last year\u2019s third quarter.","Switching to our theme park segment, we had a strong quarter as revenue increased 7.9% to $661 million, and operating cash flow increased 8.6% to $343 million. This is the largest quarterly operating cash flow in the history of the theme parks, and was driven by increased per capita spending at both our Orlando and Hollywood theme parks and higher attendance at Orlando, fueled by the successful opening of the new Transformers attraction.","Let\u2019s move to slide eight to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. Consistent with our plan, in the third quarter, consolidated capital expenditures increased 9.1% to $1.7 billion, compared to $1.6 billion in the third quarter of 2012. And year to date, capital expenditures have increased 13.6% to $4.6 billion, reflecting increased investment at both cable and NBC Universal.","At cable communications, third quarter capital expenditures increased $68 million, or 5%, to $1.4 billion, equal to 13.6% of cable revenue versus 13.7% in the third quarter of 2012. The increase primarily reflects higher spending on CPE such as advanced digital boxes including X1 and wireless gateways, as well as the expansion of new services that will generate attractive returns such as business services and XFINITY Home. ","Year to date, cable communications capital expenditures have increased 6.3% to $3.8 billion, representing 12.1% of cable revenue. We continue to expect that for the full year of 2013, cable capital expenditures will increase by approximately 10% compared to 2012.","At NBC Universal, capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2013 increased $75 million to $284 million and year to date have increased $331 million to $807 million. This higher capex is primarily driven by the increased investments in theme parks as we build new attractions such as the expansion of Harry Potter in Orlando, as well as Despicable Me in Hollywood. We continue to expect NBC Universal\u2019s full year capital investment plan to total approximately $1.1 billion. ","Please refer to slide nine. As I mentioned earlier, we generated consolidated free cash flow of $2 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 30% compared to last year\u2019s third quarter. For the first nine months of the year, we generated $7.1 billion in free cash flow, an increase of 15.5% over the first nine months of 2012, and year to date, free cash flow per share has increased 17.9% to $2.64 per share. ","We are executing on our 2013 financial plan, and year to date have returned $3 billion of capital to shareholders, including share repurchases totaling $1.5 billion, and dividend payments, also totaling $1.5 billion. Our return of capital plan will be reviewed by management and our board in the next few months. We\u2019ll provide an update for 2014 on our earnings call at the end of January. ","Let me end by saying that we are very pleased with the operational and financial progress we have made during the first nine months of this year. We believe that our disciplined investments and our focus on execution will continue to generate healthy organic growth and yield positive results.","Now let me turn the call over to Marlene for Q&A. ","","Brian Roberts","Before we do that, actually, Michael, I just want to jump in here and say thank you to Marlene. This will be her last investor relations call. As many of you know, she\u2019s happily moving inside the NBCU family and joining NBC Universal to help lead our Hispanic entertainment and content efforts. Believe it or not, this is Marlene\u2019s 68th earnings call, and she\u2019s done a fabulous job. And on behalf of all of us, Marlene, thank you. ","And also, on a tough note, I wanted to acknowledge yesterday\u2019s announcement by [Glenn Grid] about his health. On behalf of all of us at Comcast, the industry, and his many friends, we just want to wish you, Glenn, the best as you battle that tough disease. ","Marlene, over to you, and thank you. ","Marlene Dooner","Operator, let\u2019s open up the call for Q&A please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America. Please go ahead. ","Jessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America ","I had two questions, one on cable and one on NBCU. First, on cable, could you talk a little bit more about the X1 impact? You mentioned, Brian, on the positive impact to the customer experience. Could you give us any details on what it\u2019s doing to churn and what should we expect in terms of cost, both in marketing and set top boxes, as you look at it over the next year or so. And then I\u2019ll follow up with NBC. ","Brian Roberts ","Let me just quickly start, and then turn it over to Neil. I think we\u2019re a few months into this, where we\u2019ve had significant scale, and we will be working a lot on coming up with really good detail. And our instincts and all our intuition suggests that there\u2019s a real positive IRR here on the business. And it\u2019s a healthy opportunity, and we\u2019re very, very excited. But Neil, why don\u2019t you try and go with those numbers that you\u2019re comfortable with.","Neil Smit ","Earlier in the year, we decided to increase the rollout of X1 from about 50% of our footprint to 100%. We\u2019re currently at about 90% deployed in the footprint. We\u2019re very pleased with the VOD results. VOD viewing is up about 27% and VOD transactions are up about 20%. ","I think the churn, we\u2019re seeing a meaningful impact on voluntary churn. And it\u2019s still in the early stages, but that\u2019s been a good surprise. And about 60% of the people are using apps weekly on the product. So we\u2019re seeing a lot of apps usage and [last nine] usage.","We\u2019re going to continue to ramp the product aggressively. We\u2019re seeing a good upgrade amount on existing customers as well as new customers on the acquisition side. So I\u2019d say we\u2019re very pleased overall. ","X2 we\u2019re going to begin to deploy at the end of this year, and we\u2019ll more aggressively market it into the beginning of next year. ","Jessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America ","Any comment on the cost side on set top boxes or marketing?","Neil Smit ","Over time, the cost will come down as we scale the product, and I think the whole home household CPE cost will come down as we deploy slave boxes or pucks that are smaller and less expensive for the additional outlets. So we think it will be a good CPE return as we move forward.","Brian Roberts ","And one thing we will do probably in the first quarter, as we have much more detail on how the deployment has gone, we\u2019ll provide, similar to what we did with the all-digital project, sort of the business case of how we see the X1 deployment, X2 deployment, and what the advantages are to the company. So we\u2019ll probably provide that sometime in the early part of next year.","Jessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America ","And then just on the NBCU question, I was just hoping Steve could elaborate. The theme park number was very impressive, and I was just wondering if you could maybe elaborate on the potential over the long term. It seems pretty clear that new attractions drive attendance, and it seems like rooms will increase, per-cap numbers were great. So how might the film plans play into this? Anything you could say on consumer products as well? Just some more color on theme parks.","Steve Burke","We obviously have grown increasingly bullish about the theme park business. When we closed the deal, the theme parks were generating about $400 million in OCF, and this year they\u2019ll be about $1 billion. So in three years, those businesses have grown dramatically.","I was just down in Orlando last week and saw the new Harry Potter 2 attraction, which opens next spring. We have a very large hotel complex called the Cabana Bay, which is 1,800 rooms, that opens right before Harry Potter, most of it. And we\u2019re making these investments because we really like the business. We think it\u2019s synergistic with film. ","We\u2019re opening a Despicable Me attraction in Hollywood. We already opened one in Orlando. And you\u2019ll see us continue to have that back and forth. We\u2019re just getting started in consumer products. But I think all of these sort of ancillary businesses we feel are really important, and really can contribute to making this company a very well-rounded media company and our initial experience with the theme park business couldn\u2019t have gone better.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank ","The dreaded capital return question for Michael. Let\u2019s try it this way. So, at the beginning of the year, if I remember correctly, you talked about flat free cash flow in 2013 and refreshing the balance sheet was limiting return capital in 2013. Free cash flow tracking reported $700 million better year over year. So first, is there anything so far this year that reverses in Q4? Or is something else happening in Q4 that would disrupt the free cash flow trend that we\u2019ve seen so far this year? ","And second, given the faster pace of free cash flow and healthy EBITDA growth, you could be at or below the top end of the 2x leverage target around year-end. So do you feel the balance sheet refresh is being completed this year?","Michael Angelakis ","We\u2019re ending this quarter at a roughly 2.2x leverage. So you have to add the preferred stock the way we look at it that\u2019s at NBCU Enterprises. We\u2019ll probably end the year around that 2.2x number. So we feel very good. When we closed on NBC Universal, that number was about 2.4x. so we\u2019ve come down a little bit, and we\u2019ve done it all organically.","With regards to free cash flow, free cash flow has performed exceedingly well this year. We\u2019ve had some benefits related to working capital. Some of that working capital is within the film and the Olympics side. So I think we feel very good about how free cash flow is going to perform this year. Don\u2019t really want to go into next year. We\u2019re finalizing our operating plans now for 2014. We\u2019ll see how working capital looks in 2014, but it\u2019s still a little bit premature.","When we think about return of capital, we are now going through that process. We go through a pretty comprehensive process. We have about $2 billion left on our share authorization, so as we go into the end of this year and the very early part of next year, we\u2019ll be sitting down as a management team, and with our board, looking at both our operating and our financial plans, and go through how we think about the buyback and what would be the appropriate financial plan related to the dividend. ","So we are a bit ahead of schedule. When we look at 2014 we\u2019re going to take a very hard look at working capital that happened this year, particularly around film and on the Olympic side. But, you know, so far the plan is being executed well. ","Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank ","Would you say the balance sheet refresh is something that could continue to happen over a period of time? In other words, just on a practical basis, if you end at 2.2x, you\u2019re going to be well below 2 by the end of next year. So you would think that there\u2019s excess capital next year, and it\u2019s just a question of how you deploy it?","Michael Angelakis ","I really don\u2019t want to go into next year yet, to be honest with you. I know that\u2019s where you\u2019d love to go, but we\u2019re in the middle of finalizing our operating plans. We have a lot of initiatives we want to pursue. We\u2019re finalizing our financial plans, which will take the next few months. So I really don\u2019t want to go into 2014. ","I can say we feel very good about the operating performance of the business, which is really the key part. And as we look at our strength and operating performance, that will flow into how we deal with our financial plan and our balance sheet management. But I would say we are trending a bit better, both on free cash flow and balance sheet management that we might have expected this year. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Bazinet - Citi ","Each year there seems to be an increasing blurring between linear TV as we think about it and the way you all are thinking about internet video. And recently there have been a few press reports about trials you\u2019re running with HBO, maybe without a pay TV requirement in the bundle, and also some comments on your Viper initiative. ","So I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about what you hope to accomplish with some of these trials, what you\u2019re hoping to see, and then if you could just step back and talk a little bit about some of the longer term investments that you\u2019re making and paint a picture for us in terms of where you see the video product going. ","Neil Smit ","I think first off, the Internet Plus product, which was recently announced, is a targeted offer to customers who are interested primarily in a good internet product, and secondarily in a light video product. It does require video, so it\u2019s not HBO without a video offering. It\u2019s basically a performance HSD product with a B1 video offering, coupled with Stream Picks and HBO.","We\u2019ve done these kinds of offers before. We offered Blast Plus and Blast Extra in the past. And they\u2019ve been successful in targeting segments such as Millennials. I think, as I look at the video landscape, we\u2019re seeing windows move around, and we\u2019re focused on making sure our customers get a complete offering of products, as well as current season. ","We think that VOD is a very powerful platform, and with the C3 window, we disabled fast forward with our programming partners, and C3 being measured now, it provides incremental advertising opportunity as well as ratings. We think that could be a better alternative than DVR. And you\u2019re seeing some of that in the news.","We\u2019re investing heavily in new innovations such as X1 and X2, and you know, it\u2019s very fluid, but we feel like we\u2019re leading the approach, and we\u2019re working well with our programming partners to come up with new ideas and target new segments.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ben Swinburne - Morgan Stanley ","I guess two questions. Michael, I\u2019d love any more color, if you have any, on the programming costs for the year. Curious if it\u2019s at all timing related. Maybe a deal didn\u2019t come up or didn\u2019t get done this year that\u2019s pushed it into next year. And anything you\u2019d say about your rights strategy on pulling on demand together and positioning XFINITY as really the premium on-demand experience, about negotiating rights that might have had an impact on that programming cost growth.","And then I\u2019m just curious, for Neil, I think in the prepared remarks there was a comment about the more competitive video footprint. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re talking about U-verse. Are you guys doing anything differently in the new U-verse footprint than the rest of the company, maybe more focus on X1 or some of these millennial platforms to try to sort of manage this process? Or is it sort of one of those situations you have to let it play out and then things tend to stabilize?","Michael Angelakis ","Why don\u2019t I take the first part of the question, and then I\u2019ll pass it off to Neil? With regard to programming costs, I\u2019ve just got to give kudos to the team, who I think have just managed our cost better this year than we\u2019ve anticipated. ","We do expect in the future to have another bump in programming costs, but we\u2019re going to end the year modestly below where we thought we would. We\u2019ll probably end the year just slightly below 10% growth for the entire year, so our view, the team, is really no structural changes, nothing that\u2019s been dramatic to affect that. It\u2019s really been, I think, the team just being able to manage costs significantly better. And we really did anticipate a bit of a higher increase in programming costs this year than what the end result will be. ","For premium VOD, and some of the other questions, I\u2019m going to pass it off to Neil.","Neil Smit ","On VOD rights, we are, as in all our negotiations with programmers, we\u2019re getting a very comprehensive VOD rights as well as in and out of home rights, and TV everywhere rights. Interestingly, I recently looked at the information on the XFINITY TV player app, and the viewing has gone from about 2 million hours to over 6 million hours. So it\u2019s getting a lot of usage. ","And concerning the overbuild situation, it\u2019s kind of a tale of two cities. We have a number of markets that are growing video net adds, and then we\u2019ve got some of the overbuild markets where you see a typical bubble, where there\u2019s initial losses, and then we come back and get win backs. ","So overall we feel good about the video business, considering the overbuilds. We\u2019re in about the same ballpark in terms of losses, and we\u2019re aggressively deploying X1 and we think we have a superior product, and we\u2019ll continue to market it. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ","Phil Cusick - JPMorgan ","You\u2019ve been running a couple of broadband tiering trials that we\u2019ve seen. I wonder if you can talk about your thoughts there, one how they\u2019re going, and two, how you think about monetizing broadband over the next few years.","Neil Smit ","We have a number of trials in place in markets. We\u2019re testing different types of usage-based pricing offerings. Thus far the consumer response has been neutral to slightly positive. We\u2019ll continue to monitor it. ","In terms of how we monetize HSD, we\u2019ve been successful in increasing our market share as well as driving RPU. We\u2019ve rolled out about 6 million gateway devices, which increased the in-home wifi fees, and that\u2019s gone very well, and we think there\u2019s going to be more people hanging more devices off of their wifi. ","We\u2019re deploying wifi as well. Every home we install is a new hot spot, and we think there\u2019s opportunity as we grow the wifi business. And then I think there\u2019s innovation we can add onto HSD over time, and as you know our XFINITY Home product runs off of the wifi, and that\u2019s a good example of something that we can run off of our network. ","Phil Cusick - JPMorgan ","Speaking of wifi, should we look for a significant acceleration in public wifi rollouts next year?","Neil Smit ","I wouldn\u2019t call it a significant acceleration, but we will continue to build out our wifi network. We\u2019ve done so in a number of cities, and we will continue to invest in the wifi side.","","Michael Angelakis ","Let me add to that. I think you know that as we deploy these wireless gateways, they have multiple SSIDs, so that actually increases the ability to have wifi hotspots. And then as Neil said, we are deploying more capital into wifi in the public areas as well. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Marci Ryvicker of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo ","Just a question for Neil. Can you talk about the difference in performance between your large and your small markets? And have you ever thought about rationalizing your portfolio, maybe taking a bigger focus on large markets by swapping smaller market clusters with other operators?","Neil Smit ","You know, our market performance, there\u2019s no significant difference between large and small markets. We get some efficiencies on the plant side out of a large market, because we have bigger head [ends] and can run the markets more efficiently, and you have a denser footprint, so there\u2019s less maintenance, for example, on the lines in the network. ","But our small markets operate very well. In many cases, there\u2019s less competition in the smaller markets, and we\u2019ve been in these markets for a lot of years, and we know how to run them, and we\u2019ve got great management teams who run them very effectively. So really, I think in terms of rationalizing the portfolio, we feel good with the assets we have right now, and continue to focus on efficient management of them.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. ","Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson","Two things, if I could. First, let me ask the same question that Marci just asked on the NBC side. Now that you\u2019ve had the assets for I guess three and a half years now, where are the opportunities for you to fill in and add to the portfolio, and what kinds of assets do you think would make sense to add to the NBC portfolio? And then just a quick question for Neil. There\u2019s been a lot of talk about licensing X1. I wonder if you could update that initiative.","Brian Roberts ","Starting with NBCU, we\u2019ve had so much organic growth, and we see so much more organic growth that we haven\u2019t spent any time at all thinking about adding to the portfolio. I think if you were going to create the perfect media company, it would look a lot like NBC Universal. We have 15 broadly distributed cable channels, we have broadcast, film, theme parks, Spanish language, English language, and we have broadcast and cable for news, sports, and entertainment. No one else does. And we have plenty of growth ahead of us. So we really are focusing on what we\u2019ve got and trying to make it better. ","Neil Smit ","And concerning the licensing of the X1 product, we\u2019ve had interest expressed by a number of MSOs and we\u2019re considering the opportunity. The benefit of scale is that we can invest in products like this and continue to refine them, and I think other operators like the product, and we\u2019ll continue to have conversations. We have no immediate plans, but we think it\u2019s a great product and we think it would be good to get a larger footprint of X1 from just being able to continue to invest in the product perspective.","Operator","Our next question comes from [Kanan Binkat] with Barclays. Please go ahead. ","[Kanan Binkat] - Barclays","First is there were some news recently about Netflix being in conversations with the MSOs on coming through the set top box. Just wanted to get your thoughts on all the over the top content potentially at some point sitting in the set top box and coming through that, and how you think about that. And also, on the home gateway front, if I heard correctly, I guess you guys mentioned 6 million home gateways but 350,000 hot spots. Given that you have multiple SSIDs, does the gap between the two start to close any time in the near future?","Neil Smit ","Let me take the questions one at a time. On the Netflix side, really there\u2019s nothing to report. It\u2019s been, frankly, incredible to me the amount of press coverage this has received. Our customers can receive Netflix in a number of ways, so it\u2019s not really a high priority for us. We\u2019re open to putting apps on our X1 platform. We have, for example, Facebook and Pandora there now. But at this point, we don\u2019t really have anything to report on the Netflix front.","Concerning the gateways, yeah, there\u2019s going to continue to be, in both SMBs and the home, so in hotspots, that will make our wifi network denser. And as the wifi federation between the different cable companies expands, it provides wifi coverage to our customers, for example, in New York City or Philadelphia or Boston, as the partnership continues to expand wifi hotspots. So we think it\u2019s a great consumer benefit, and we\u2019re seeing a lot of usage uptick in our wifi in the cities where we\u2019ve deployed extensively.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Kraft from Evercore. Please go ahead.","Brian Kraft - Evercore Partners","The standards for using consumer data in the internet advertising world are much lower than they are in the TV world, including these set top box data. Do you have a view on whether these standards will converge over time? And if so, how would you envision this actually playing out?","Neil Smit ","We do have set top box data from a number of markets, and whether or not it will converge, I think is a regulatory question that I wouldn\u2019t offer any conjecture on. I think that this information can be valuable to us from both a marketing and programming perspective, but we\u2019ll obviously be very sensitive to the privacy issues that are inherent.","Steve Burke ","I think on the content side there is some upside in the not too distant future that could be foreseen related to interactive advertising. Neil is rolling out a technology called Digital Ad Insertion into VOD Streams. And what we\u2019re also finding is when you eliminate commercial skipping in VOD, you make it very convenient for consumers to get large amounts of programming, but also you make it very good for a programmer to get C3 ratings. And we have a lot of our shows now that are getting a noticeable jump because of that, in effect, conversion from DVR viewing to VOD viewing. So I think the technology side of the business is going to make it better for a content owner as companies like Comcast roll out more of this technology.","Brian Roberts ","One last point that I think draws it all together, it may not be totally about set top box data, but about our experience now as one company, by having more on demand consumer behavior, we\u2019re beginning to see a lot of statistics where people know they can get a show, so they don\u2019t need to record it. That\u2019s in the interest of the programming side of the company, and that is in the interest of cable, because of our robust two-way platform, versus other platforms. ","And then if you have X1 as the way to be able to navigate and know what\u2019s on demand, it all comes together. And eventually, you get to advanced advertising or working on joint initiatives between the two parts of the company on that as well. So a lot of good things around that area that are happening. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Amy Yong with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Amy Yong - Macquarie ","I have two questions. First, on housing, are you seeing any pockets of strength in your footprint? And then the second is, could you just elaborate on your partnership with Twitter, both from the NBC and cable angle. Should we think that it\u2019s going to help drive ratings at NBC and help drive premium services on the cable side? And then how do we think about this as it gets offered to other MVPDs like DirecTV?","Michael Angelakis ","I\u2019ll take the housing side. The best way to describe housing is sort of slow and steady growth. We have a lot of different data points internally, whether it\u2019s vacancy rates or housing starts, but one thing we do utilize a lot is sort of what is our construction spend. ","And as we look at \u201913 and sort of where we think \u201913 will end up, construction spend is still a fraction of what it was at its peak. And it\u2019s up actually a little bit from 2012, but we\u2019re not seeing meaningful housing growth or meaningful tailwinds related to housing at this point. ","So it\u2019s kind of slow and steady growth. I don\u2019t think the impact to us has been meaningful. As we look at \u201914, I think we\u2019ll see a little bit more in construction spend in \u201914 than we did in \u201913, which is up from \u201912. So the trend is going in the right direction right now, but it\u2019s certainly not meaningful to us. ","Brian Roberts ","Let me take a shot at Twitter. I think our mandate is to try to be innovative and lean forward and try to find new ways to experiment. And in the case of Twitter, and in others, we want to promote live television. That\u2019s really good for NBC Universal. We\u2019re going to have more advertising inventory that we can monetize. At the same time, can you access live content through other means than just starting with our guide? ","And all these things are things we want to try. Whether that will really move ratings, I don\u2019t know. We\u2019re going to try to do a lot of initiatives, but I think it\u2019s important that we try to lead, and that we try to experiment and innovate, and this is a great example of that, and hopefully it will be really successful. ","Operator","Our final question comes from Vijay Jayant from ISI Group. Please go ahead.","Vijay Jayant - ISI Group","Verizon mentioned that they were terminating their long term partnership with cable, broadly. Can you just talk about is your current wifi buildout strategy sufficient? Or do you think you probably need an MVNO strategy longer term? And then second, just a topic that\u2019s gotten a lot more press is ARIO, and you guys are on both sides of the equation there. I just want to get your thoughts on that.","Neil Smit ","I\u2019ll answer the Verizon question, then turn it over to Steve for the ARIO question. I think the Verizon partnership, what we announced was really about the JV structure for R&D. And what we found was that we didn\u2019t need a formal structure to innovate and develop technology. We developed, for example, an app called Test Drive where people in the Verizon Wireless stores can see preloaded video, and it drives data usage from them and it drives subs for us, who experience the XFINITY app on Verizon Wireless devices. ","In terms of the wifi buildout, we don\u2019t right now have any plans to launch MVNO relationship. We continue to build out wifi and as I said previously, we\u2019re seeing good usage on our wifi network, and it\u2019s an added value to our customers on the data side.","Steve? ","Steve Burke ","In terms of ARIO, we and others are suing ARIO, so obviously we think what they\u2019re doing is unlawful. I also think that any content company that has multiple assets is going to look at that technology and someone circumventing the need to pay for retransmission consent in a negative way. So we\u2019ll see what happens with the lawsuit, but we think it\u2019s a clear violation of the law. ","Marlene Dooner","Thank you Vijay, and thank you all for joining us this morning.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded.","I would now turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Jason Armstrong. Please go ahead, Mr. Armstrong.","Jason S.

Brian and Mike will make formal remarks and Steve and Neil will also be available for Q&A.","As a reminder, as part of the FCC's anti-collusion rules for the broadcast incentive auction, we cannot discuss or answer any questions related to the auction or spectrum today.

In addition, in this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our 8-K for the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.","With that, let me turn the call to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian?","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report terrific operational and financial results during the third quarter. Consolidated revenue and operating cash flow were up 14% and 11%, respectively, driven by broad-based strength across the company. And for a company of our size, this is a tremendous result. From our perspective, three things stood out in the quarter: our results in video, which were the best for a third quarter in the last 10 years; in broadband, which were the best in seven years; and our successful broadcast and distribution of the Rio Olympics.","Let's start with Rio, which again validated that the Olympics are the most valuable and most consumed property in media. NBC won all 17 nights of primetime, and the NBC Sports Network was the number one sports cable network in primetime over the 14 days that it presented live coverage of the games. In fact, in the 18 to 49 demo, NBC's primetime's ratings more than quadrupled the other broadcast networks combined and were nearly five times greater with Millennials. Moreover, that lead widened versus prior Olympics. The audience for the Rio Olympics was enormous, encompassing almost 200 million Americans on television alone, not to mention those who also engaged on our other platforms.","Rio was also very strong from a financial perspective, significantly exceeding our prior results and we believe it will continue to be a big success going forward. One of the key reasons for our outstanding performance with the games is that our teams from across Comcast, NBCUniversal worked so well together. We partnered closely, innovated quickly, and as a result, delivered the most comprehensive and technologically-advanced Olympics coverage in history.","In our TV businesses, the Olympics drove our exceptional performance during the quarter and were a great way to wrap-up our 2015-2016 television season. NBC finished the season as the number-one broadcast network for the third year in a row and was also the number-one broadcast network for the sixth summer in a row. And the fall season is off to a good start with This Is Us as the highest-rated new series and Saturday Night Live kicking off its 42nd season with its highest rated premieres in three years.","Telemundo is another bright spot in broadcast. It was the number-one rated Spanish language TV network in Monday-to-Friday primetime for the quarter. We have fundamentally repositioned this network through investments in original content, infrastructure and talent, and it's working.","Our Cable Networks delivered solid cash flow growth. We had a lot of successes in entertainment, sports and news in the quarter. MSNBC's ratings were up 95%, we also announced an exclusive deal in which all eight of the Harry Potter films will begin airing on USA and Syfy beginning in 2018. Plus, we have rights to air the films across our other television properties too. We believe we are taking the right steps and remain on a trajectory to continue to grow this business.","At Film, we completed the acquisition of DreamWorks and we're happy to welcome the team to the Comcast, NBCUniversal family. In animation, The Secret Life of Pets from Illumination was a huge hit during the quarter. It had the highest-ever opening in the U.S. for an original animated movie, and importantly, gives us another valuable franchise. Looking ahead, we're thrilled about our new original animated film, Sing, which opens in the U.S. in December. I believe this is one of the best movies that Chris Meledandri and the team at Illumination has ever made.","At Theme Parks, we also delivered fantastic results. We continue to be extremely pleased with the opening of Harry Potter in Hollywood.","Now over at Cable, the team continue to expertly balance improvement in the financial and customer results. We generated strong growth in revenue and operating cash flow, while also achieving some of our best customer metrics in nearly a decade. We ended the quarter with 28.3 million customer relationships, adding 216,000 during the quarter.","In video, we added 32,000 customers in the quarter. We now have added 170,000 video customers in the last 12 months. We also delivered great results in high-speed Internet, adding 330,000 customers during the quarter. Across all of our product categories, better customer retention was a key driver of our performance.","So how are we doing this? Well, we've shifted the culture of our company to put the customer truly first, and that's driving the focus of our product and technology innovation, and also, our customer service. A perfect example is Netflix, which we have now integrated into X1. Our agreement with Netflix highlights the flexibility that we have in our platform and what a fantastic showcase X1 is for different types of content, all in an elegantly-designed and integrated experience. We did the same integration with live sports with the Olympics.","Similarly, in high-speed Internet, we're increasing speeds and continue to deliver the fastest in-home Wi-Fi. Earlier this year, we launched a new residential Internet service that delivers gigabit speeds to customers using DOCSIS 3.1 technology.","We're also leveraging our position in the home to offer new services, and this was true of voice when we introduced it, and more recently, our home security product. And as we announced last month, we're planning to bring a wireless service to our customers in mid-2017 as part of an attractively-priced multi-product bundle. Stay tuned and we'll have more to tell you about this at a later date.","Finally, we continue to make significant strides with customer service. Our efforts are focused on three areas; first, serving our customers faster; second, improving and simplifying the experience, particularly in onboarding, billing and repair; and third, fixing issues the first time, and when we fall short, making it right. So all-in-all, I'm really proud of the performance in the quarter and we're encouraged by the momentum that we have in our businesses. Our teams are executing well and also working well together, and we're excited and optimistic about our future.","Mike, over to you.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everybody. I'm starting on slide four for those following the presentation online. Our third-quarter results reflect consistent execution and broad-based strength across our businesses. Consolidated revenue increased 14.2%, and operating cash flow grew 10.5% for the third quarter, reflecting solid growth in our Cable business and strong growth at NBCUniversal, partly driven by the success of the Rio Olympics.","Earnings per share was $0.92, a 15% increase compared to a year ago, and free cash flow was $1.4 billion in the quarter, a decline of 48.5%. This decline was driven by higher working capital, primarily related to the Rio Olympics. We will go into greater detail on these results on the slides to come.","Now let's start with Cable Communications on slide five. Cable Communications delivered strong third-quarter results. Revenues increased 6.9% to $12.6 billion, as we increased customer relationships and grew total revenue per customer relationship by 3.6% to $148 per month. We added 216,000 customer relationships, driven by two product customer additions and a reduction in churn across all products. In fact, we have improved churn in video and high-speed data for 32 consecutive months, as customers increasingly recognize the value of our X1 platform and superior high-speed data product. And we make meaningful strides in improving customer service.","High-speed Internet continues to be the largest contributor to overall Cable revenue growth. Revenue increased 8.8% to $3.4 billion in the quarter, reflecting an increase in our customer base; rate adjustments, which were more modest compared to the prior year; and customers subscribing to higher levels of service. Our customer momentum continued as we added a combined 330,000 residential and business customers in the quarter, up 3% over last year's net adds, and we added 1.4 million combined customers over the past 12 months.","We continue to benefit from growth in the overall market and gain market share as customers respond to our product differentiation. We've increased Internet speeds 17 times in the last 15 years. About 80% of our residential customers take speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher. And we have over 15 million Wi-Fi hotspots for our customers to access, which combined, greatly increases our customer value proposition and competitive differentiation.","Video revenue increased 4.5% to $5.6 billion in the quarter, primarily due to rate adjustments as well as customers subscribing to additional services and growth in our customer base. Our rate adjustments are primarily from broadcast TV and RSN fees, as we've noted in previous quarters, are the most significant sources of our programming cost pressure.","In terms of volume, we have consistently improved our video customer metrics for several quarters. In the third quarter, we continued the momentum and added a combined 32,000 net video customers, an improvement of 80,000 versus the year-ago quarter, and as Brian noted, making this our best third-quarter result in 10 years.","Driving these impressive customer metrics is improved customer retention, as our X1 platform proves to be a real competitive differentiator. X1 combines innovative technology with a breadth of content that is easily searchable and customers are clearly responding. As we expand our X1 customer base, the positive customer benefits continue.","X1 customers have higher customer satisfaction and better retention rates. In addition, X1 customers compared to non-X1 customers have three times higher activations of DVRs, more outlets in the home, and spend twice as much on pay-per-view. As a result, the overall ARPU of an X1 customer is higher. We've been adding about 5 percentage points of X1 penetration each quarter this year, and we kept that pace this quarter. We added 948,000 net new and existing customers, with nearly 45% of our residential video customers now having X1.","Voice revenue declined by 2.4% to $878 million in the third quarter, as combined customer net additions of 2,000 were offset by a modest decline in ARPU. Our back-to-school initiatives were heavily focused on double-play this quarter, driving a greater increase in two-product video\/high-speed data customer relationships versus the triple-play that includes voice.","Let's now turn to business services, which continues to deliver excellent results. Revenue increased 15.5% to $1.4 billion, with the small business segment accounting for over 70% of our revenue and 60% of our growth, driven primarily by the net increase in customers. Revenue for the mid-size business segment has a higher growth rate, fueled primarily by additional Ethernet sites as we continue to invest in expanding that business.","Cable advertising revenue increased 7.7% to $634 million, reflecting higher political revenue related to the upcoming elections. Excluding the political contribution, our cable advertising revenue decreased 2%.","Turning to slide 6, second quarter Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 5.5% to $5 billion, resulting in a margin of 39.7% compared to 40.2% in the third quarter of 2015, driven by higher expenses primarily related to increases in programming costs and the investments we are making to improve the customer experience.","Programming expenses grew 11.4%, reflecting the timing of programming contract renewals. The underlying growth continues to be driven by higher retransmission consent fees and sports programming costs. For the full year, we expect programming expense growth to be slightly above 10%.","Non-programming expenses increased 5.6%, reflecting higher expenses to continue the rollout of X1, planned investment to improve the customer experience, driven primarily by increased technicians and service personnel, and an increase in advertising, marketing and promotion costs.","Year-to-date, our Cable operating margin is down 40 basis points, and that is roughly where we would expect to end the year.","Now let's move on to NBCUniversal's results. On slide seven, you can see NBCUniversal's revenues increased 28.3% and operating cash flow increased 31.5%. Adjusting to include the acquisition of Universal Studios Japan in last year's results, pro forma revenue increased 22.5% and operating cash flow increased 19.2%. These exceptional results were driven in part by the success of the Rio Olympics, which added $1.6 billion in revenue, of which $1.2 billion is related to advertising revenue and is included in the Cable Networks and Broadcast segments.","In addition to the Olympics, NBCUniversal results reflect a strong performance at Parks and Broadcast, as well as the theatrical success of The Secret Life of Pets.","Cable Networks' revenue increased 22% to $2.9 billion, including $432 million of revenue associated with the Rio Olympics. Excluding the Olympics, revenue increased 4.1%, reflecting higher distribution and content licensing and other revenue, and relatively flat advertising revenue. This was primarily driven by distribution revenue, which increased about 6%, driven by contractual rate increases and contract renewals, partially offset by a slight decline in subscribers at our Cable Networks.","Advertising revenue was relatively stable, reflecting strong pricing, offset by audience rating declines at our Cable Networks. Operating cash flow increased 7% to $893 million, reflecting a profitable Olympics and increased sports programming costs, as well as our continued investment in original program.","Broadcast Television had another strong quarter with revenue growth of 56.6% to $3.1 billion, including $1.2 billion of revenue associated with the Rio Olympics. Excluding the Olympics, revenue declined 3.6%, reflecting lower content licensing revenue, partially offset by higher retransmission and advertising revenue.","Content licensing revenue declined 32% due to a difficult comparison to last year's results, which included new Law & Order syndication deals. Excluding the Olympics, distribution and other revenue growth of 21% was driven by a 52% increase in retransmission revenue. Last, advertising revenue increased a healthy 4%, reflecting a strong scatter market.","Broadcast operating cash flow increased by $228 million to $378 million, reflecting a profitable Olympics and growth in high-margin retransmission consent fees as well as lower programming cost compared to last year.","Film revenue declined 7.9% to $1.8 billion and operating cash flow declined 6.1% to $353 million. These results include DreamWorks from its acquisition date of August 22, including $50 million related to severance. Excluding this charge, operating cash flow increased as the successful performance of the Secret Life of Pets and higher content licensing more than offset the difficult comparison to last year's record third quarter, which included Minions and Jurassic World.","Theme Parks' revenue increased 60.6% to $1.4 billion and operating cash flow increased 62.4% to $706 million in the third quarter of 2016. On a pro forma basis for Universal Japan, revenue increased 16.1% and operating cash flow increased 17.1%. These results reflect higher attendance and higher per capita spending, driven by the successful opening of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction in Hollywood, as well as the positive impact of a stronger Japanese yen, which accounted for about one third of the growth.","We are pleased with the performance of Harry Potter in Hollywood as it is trending in line with previous Potter launches at our other parks. Partially offsetting these results were higher costs associated with newer attractions like King Kong that opened in Orlando this past summer.","Let's move to slide eight to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. Consolidated capital expenditures increased 11.1% to $2.4 billion in the third quarter. At Cable Communications, capital expenditures increased 10.4% to $2 billion for the quarter and on a year-to-date basis, have increased 10.5% to $5.5 billion, representing capital intensity of 14.8% compared to 14.2% for the first nine months of 2015.","While the largest component of our capital spending continues to be customer premise equipment, including X1 and wireless gateways, the largest source of year-over-year growth in spending is our investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity. We believe this investment in scalable infrastructure enhances our competitive position in broadband by staying ahead of rapid growth and bandwidth consumption by our customers. In addition, we've extended our network to more customer addresses, primarily business addresses, through line extensions.","We continue to expect that for the full year of 2016, our Cable capital intensity will remain flat to 2015 at approximately 15%. At NBCUniversal, capital expenditures increased 16.3% to $336 million in the third quarter and increased 19.5% to $991 million on a year-to-date basis, driven by inclusion of Universal Studios Japan. We continue to expect NBCUniversal's CapEx to increase approximately 10% this year.","Now finishing up on slide nine; on a year-to-date basis, we generated $5.6 billion in free cash flow, a decrease of 23.8% over the comparable period of 2015, primarily driven by lower third quarter results. Consolidated free cash flow in the third quarter declined 48.5% to $1.4 billion, reflecting the 10.5% growth in operating cash flow, which was offset by an increase in capital expenditures, as we just reviewed, and higher working capital, primarily due to the 2016 Rio Olympics.","This is a timing issue and we will see a positive swing in Olympic working capital in the fourth quarter. In terms of capital returns, dividend payments during the quarter were $663 million, up 6.5% and share repurchases were $1.4 billion, consistent with our plan to repurchase $5 billion of our common stock during the full year.","We ended the quarter at 2.2 times net leverage, primarily reflecting the closing of the DreamWorks acquisition and payment of a deposit in the third quarter. So that concludes our summary of the quarter. I hope that everyone now has a good sense for how pleased we are with our results as well as our momentum. And now I'll turn it back to Jason to lead the Q&A.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Great, thanks, Mike. Regina, let's open up the call for Q&A, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. I have one multi-part question. In light of the recent industry M&A, and I guess a subjective point, many will view AT&T's transaction as similar to you buying NBCU, and subjectively, it just seems like you bought a distressed asset at distressed prices and had a video background. But that aside, the question is \u2013 a couple of questions. One, do you see yourselves as complete? Any there any holes? Part two, where are you in making progress towards addressable or targeted advertising? What will it take to get real traction in that area?","And then finally, with consumers moving increasingly to mobile video, whether on-demand or across multiple distribution platforms, how do both sides of Comcast, Cable and NBCU, prepare models that are profitable for Comcast, but also satisfy consumer needs?","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Okay. Well, thanks, Jessica. Let me start and then kick it over to Neil and Steve to talk just a little bit about the second parts. We're not going to discuss the other transaction, the proposed transaction with AT&T and Time Warner. We don't typically comment on other deals, and so just for everybody, we're not going to have any comments today.","We have a fabulous company, and what we are pleased to report today I think demonstrates that. The assets are great. They're working well together, adding customers, adding new products and real market leadership with, in almost every area, whether right from the Olympics right through to X1's integration of Netflix. So it's \u2013 couldn't be happier with this quarter and the momentum of this year. As we dig into things like advertising and what's happening in the market and changes that could happen, let me kick it over to Neil to start, and maybe Steve could comment as well.","Neil Smit - Comcast Corp.","Hi, Jessica. The advanced advertising area, we have a full roll-out of VOD, a dynamic ad insertion, which is becoming more and more effective. We have \u2013 we're testing linear addressable in a number of markets, and we've got that working. And we're able to leverage our data we collect, obviously with consumer privacy in mind, we collect from about 20 some-odd million set-top boxes.","Marcien Jenckes is leading the charge on getting the most leverage out of our \u2013 some of our recent acquisitions and our existing addressable advertising capabilities in FreeWheel, Visible World, Strata and Sticky Ads. So we think we're making great progress, and it's a growth business for us. Steve?","Stephen B. Burke - Comcast Corp.","So at NBCUniversal, we have a handful of advanced advertising products that are currently in the market, and we have about 100 advertisers that have bought these products. The most prominent one right now is called NBCU+ powered by Comcast, and it's a way of overlaying Comcast capabilities with the base national buy.","Advanced advertising has been around \u2013 people have been talking about it for a long time. It's not easy. It's hard to develop these products, but it's clear what advertisers want. They want to combine the data intensity of Internet advertising with the clear value and ability to change people's perceptions that you get with a television ad. So, it's a pretty important part of Neil and my agenda, and I think we're at the head of the pack in terms of delivering on it. But there's still work to do.","Neil Smit - Comcast Corp.","I will just add, Steve, that on the mobile video space, about 50% of our subs are currently using TV Everywhere. That's up from about 30% last year, and they view about an average of 10 hours monthly. So we're continuing to expand the offerings. We've got about 130 live streaming channels and more than 40,000 VOD selections. So we're really getting good traction in that area as well.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thanks, Jessica. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi. Good morning. I want to ask about your wireless strategy, if you will. You've said that you're \u2013 that you've notified Verizon about triggering the MVNO agreement. Can you make money as an MVNO operator or do you have to transition a large amount of the traffic to your Wi-Fi network and eventually your own facilities? And if the latter is the case, operationally, can you do that under the contract? And how do you think about how you manage the relationship with Verizon about trying to transition from a pure MVNO to something more like an MNO posture in wireless over time?","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Well, let me start, it's Brian and again have Neil maybe add a lot more detail. But at the big-picture level, what I said before is we're going to launch this next year, so part of it is we don't have any new news today. Stay tuned. As we get closer to trialing the product, we'll be learning in the marketplace and it'll be a process. We fundamentally believe we can make money for the shareholders through a wireless offering with the unique relationship that we have with the Verizon MVNO. We can't go into detail about that relationship for obvious reasons, but we have the ability to do things that we think put us in a position to make that statement come true and create real value for our shareholders along the way. Neil?","Neil Smit - Comcast Corp.","Well, we're going to do this because we believe we can add value to the customer relationships. We've seen other companies, Rogers, Telenet, Virgin have all reduced churn and increased customer lifetime value. In a way, we're already in the wireless business. We deployed millions of our wireless gateways and the Wi-Fi service in the household that's the fastest on the market. I think by leveraging the 28 million customer relationships, the 15 million hotspots and the MVNO, we can offer a really excellent service. We are going to have to include handset procurement as part of it, but we built that in the model and we think we can \u2013 Verizon's been a great partner so far in the wholesale relationship and we think that will continue and we have a great product that will add value over time.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thanks, Craig. Next question, please.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning. I'd love Neil and Steve's thoughts as you think about the video business in the U.S., both yours on the cable side and the subscriber trends driving the NBC Cable Networks. It seems like we may see a lot of new entrants next year, obviously DirecTV now with the release of new product and price point; Hulu. Google seems to be signing contracts. I guess, Steve, does that create the opportunity for subscriber trends to improve for the NBC Cable Network portfolio? You mentioned in the quarter, they were down again. I was wondering, if you look at all this new competition coming, could that turn that positive in your view?","And for Neil, the results in your video business sort of speak for themselves, and X1 is clearly working. But is there anything you're doing and your team are doing that you may bring to market or are thinking about operationally to help continue to compete successfully with more and more of these virtual offers as you head into 2017? Thank you.","Stephen B. Burke - Comcast Corp.","Let me start. I think there's about 20 million, something like 20 million homes in America that are not part of the cable satellite telco MVPD environment. And the real promise of some of these new over-the-top entrants is that they would deliver incremental subscribers, which obviously would be good for the content side of the company. I think we all have a healthy degree of skepticism that these new over-the-top entrants are going to create millions and millions and millions of subscribers any time soon.","I think if you look at the cable ecosystem, I've now been with Comcast for 18 years and for 18 years, Comcast earnings have been up every single quarter. And yes, as new entrants come in, they take fractional share away from the existing suppliers, but the fact of the matter is, most people find tremendous value and enjoyment in their cable or satellite subscription and are not looking to change. And there's all sorts of issues that over-the-top providers are going to have to deal with, including cost and service and everything else. So I think there could be a modest positive for NBCUniversal. I don't expect it to be material in the next year or two, but I think over time if some of those 20 million non-subscribers become subscribers, it would be positive.","Neil Smit - Comcast Corp.","And from the Comcast Cable perspective, we think that X1 is a great platform and witness the Netflix integration into the overall experience. We can integrate products and we can do things like we did with the Olympics in a very seamless way. I think that we understand how to target and how to segment. We've got products like XFINITY On Campus that targets a specific segment, X1 Double Play, stream, so we understand how to do that. And I think we've demonstrated we can do it over an ongoing basis.","Retention has improved for 32 consecutive months. And we see that trend as very positive. We'll continue to innovate on X1, and we think that we'll continue to innovate on market segmentation and targeting. And we've got what I feel is the best video product on the market. I think there's going to be more flavors and more competition, but we'll compete aggressively.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you both.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Ben, thanks. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you so much. I just want to follow up on the prior question for Neil. Given the prospect of a set-top box apps-based ruling, you have a hybrid QAM\/IP product in X1, X2. And so if that becomes the way of the world, can you talk about the product transition you sort of see there?","But also, you mentioned, I think Mike mentioned about scalable infrastructure investments continuing. And as we go into an all-IP world, can you just broadly talk about what's the optimal level of network requirement do you think, and where are we towards that to have really TV being consumed in all-IP? Thank you.","Neil Smit - Comcast Corp.","Well, as you mentioned, we'll be going to an IP-based video solution over the next, let's just call it, couple years. We have the product in the lab. It's working well. We'll continue to roll out new devices. We have the XB6, which is the fastest gateway out there. It's five times faster than our current version. We have Xi5 and Xi6 coming out, which will deliver video over Wi-Fi at excellent quality. And so we're going to continue to transition the product to IP.","Concerning the network, we've continued to invest over the years in our network capacity and we will continue to do that. Business services has brought fiber deeper into the network. We're going fiber direct to new developments and to some MDUs. So we will continue to invest in the network, but it's nothing new to our business. We've increased capacity, doubled capacity every 18 to 24 months, and that's been happening for the last 8 to 10 years. So we feel pretty good about our position.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","I just wanted to add one other thought. The consumer may not completely care whether it's all-IP or not. What the consumer wants is really great quality and ease of on-boarding experience and reliability. And that goes back to the emphasis Neil and the team are putting on customer service and customer experience.","So just take as a for instance, the Xi5 box, which is the first box we've ever had that is a Wi-Fi box. So you take this box, you plug it in, and you attach it if you want to your television with an HDMI, and that's it. And it doesn't have to have any cable in that room.","And the on-boarding of that box is so different than any other box we've ever had. And within two minutes, I think we're at 2:20 and we're trying to get to 2 minutes, you are watching video with a few simple keystrokes. It already figures out the Wi-Fi network. It is so intelligent and it's such a different experience than any other box we've had. And we only have just begun to launch this box. That's the kind of products as we go to an all-IP world that we envision that is just really simple, really seamless and better than any product on the market for that on-boarding.","Neil Smit - Comcast Corp.","And it takes a lot less time to install in the households.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","And you can do it yourself.","Neil Smit - Comcast Corp.","Right.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Vijay. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys. Programming cost growth has continued to accelerate throughout the year. Can you give us a sense for whether that will be the case again in 2017? And then on Cable margins in general, looks like we're seeing somewhat lower margins due to customer care costs and the X1 rollout. I mean do you see these and the impact on margins more as temporary or something that's getting built into the base? And given the shift to HSD, can you see your way to sort of margin stability or even margin improvement down the road? Thanks.","Neil Smit - Comcast Corp.","Hi, John. Programming expenses grew at about 11.4% in the third quarter and we expect the full year to come in around slightly above 10%. It's due to contract renewals and some lumpiness. We have some contract renewals that are up this year, so we'd expect next year to be slightly elevated. But following that, from what we can see in the trending, they'll be down at a lower level and over the years the 3, 5, 10-year trends have been in the 7% to 8% range. So we do see opportunity as we get through 2017.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","The overall margin, obviously, Neil's team \u2013 it's Mike, just chiming in. The focus on growth in the higher-margin businesses of business services and high speed data together with the very heavy focus on non-program expenses has been and will continue to be the source of protecting that margin. Like Neil said, we'll come back and talk about future margin for 2017 when we do the next earnings call. But the drivers of margin over time are those factors.","John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, John. Next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks. A question and a follow-up for Neil, if I can. First I'd like to ask about the business services side, which is certainly additive to growth but the continued deceleration while capital intensity is increasing is interesting. Should we be looking at this as a $200 million a year of incremental growth and the percent falling or is it hard to hold that dollars of growth? And is anything happening in pricing or competition? And then just following up on your churn comments, is video strength still mostly a churn-driven improvement or are gross adds up year-over-year as well maybe due to your segmenting efforts? Thanks.","Neil Smit - Comcast Corp.","Concerning business services, I mean in 2015, we added about $280 million in revenue growth and we think that 2016 will come in at about the same level. So it's kind of the law of big numbers where we're growing at the same amount, at the same level, but we're just on a bigger basis. It's a $5 billion run rate business now. Small and medium are still about 70% of the business and 60% of the growth, but we're seeing healthy growth from mid-size businesses right now and we're getting a number of enterprise deals in. We've got a large financial institution with about 2,000 locations, large health care provider with about 1,000 locations and a retail provider with about 2,000 locations. So we're starting to see the enterprise side of the business grow.","Concerning video, we are seeing growth on the connect side. We're seeing healthy growth on the connect side, primarily due to X1 and \u2013 but the surprisingly healthy number is on the churn side and that continues to index lower than the previous year. So, we're seeing relatively a larger impact on the growth on the churn reduction side, but we're still seeing healthy connect growth. The fourth quarter last year was a very strong quarter for both HSD and video, so the comps might be a little difficult but we feel very good about the business.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just a follow up on business. As you move up toward enterprise, are you seeing sort of higher capital cost projects and is that driving the higher capital intensity in that segment?","Neil Smit - Comcast Corp.","Not really. It's early to tell, but we think of them like a central office with a lot of branch offices, which would be like small businesses. And we know how to do the small business market very effectively and so I don't think you'll see a higher degree of capital intensity. We are doing hyperbuilds now where we go in \u2013 we used to go into an industrial park and we had to sign up the customers before we pulled the fiber in. Whereas now we know in these industrial parks we're going to get the customers. It's just a question of time before we get them on that and so we're building in, assuming we're going to get the customer base. It's a little bit more aggressive stance.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank, Neil.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Phil. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. I have two questions. The first, Steve, can you talk about the progress you're making with the affiliates as it relates to their inclusion or not in what we're calling the not-so-skinny\/skinny bundles? And then the second question is for Neil. How does political advertising at regional cable compare to prior years? We have heard that cable is gaining share at the expense of broadcast, so just curious if you're seeing that. Thanks.","Stephen B. Burke - Comcast Corp.","So on the first question, in terms of having the affiliates participate, I assume you mean in over-the-top bundles.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes.","Stephen B. Burke - Comcast Corp.","If you look at the success of broadcasters like NBC, the affiliate relationship is really important. So our feeling is that regardless of the technical means of getting the NBC signal to people, we should be having the same kind of sharing relationship that we have with our affiliates in the future, and we're working on that. It's complicated and lots of different things to work out, but the spirit of our approach is to try to make sure that all means of getting the signal out include the affiliates and we're working on that and believe that that's going to be the model that we use going forward.","Neil Smit - Comcast Corp.","And Marci, concerning political advertising, we have seen growth obviously in this election year. It kind of depends on the state that we're in. We're very strong in Florida, in Pennsylvania and states like that. The core is a little bit soft on the local side, but we're overall seeing a 7.7% growth in local advertising.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Marci. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. One of the recent storylines has been that some major sporting events like the Olympics and the NFL have seen ratings that are lower. And there's a lot of speculation as to why, but one of the things that frequently is cited is that more consumption of these events is happening online. You're a big partner with both of the examples I cited and you were very involved, obviously, in both the linear and the online distribution of the Olympics, and so it would seem that you have a unique vantage point. So I guess my question is, what do you think is going on here? Do you think that viewership of these events has actually declined or do you think it is correct to assume that more of it has gone to a streaming format so it's not being captured? And if that is the case, how do you make sure as you move ahead that you're able to monetize your role in those events properly?","Stephen B. Burke - Comcast Corp.","So, obviously, the Olympics and the NFL, they are two different stories. In the case of the Olympics, London was the biggest Olympics that we ever had in terms of primetime ratings. Rio was lower than London, but Rio was really on par with the previous three summer Olympics. And if you look at all the various ways of consuming, we had an extraordinary Olympics, financially, ratings, advertiser happiness, et cetera.","The streaming portion of the viewership was actually very low relative to television for the Olympics. Call it 1% or 2%. And I think the same numbers apply to the NFL. 1% or 2%, 1% of people stream NFL games. And by the way, the NFL, we had an extraordinary season last year, which everybody's comparing to. We're actually down versus last year, but down much less versus two years ago. I think it's very difficult to tell precisely what's happening on any sporting property, particularly in the case of the NFL because it's only been a half a dozen weeks. I do think there are a lot of different things that people are using to consuming on the Internet and spending their time on.","I also think there are seasons that are stronger than other seasons and we may be in a season, just speaking for Sunday Night Football, where the matchups aren't as good as they could have been. But if you step back, the Olympics and the NFL are the two highest-rated programs of the year in all of television, they dominate the nights that they're on, they dominate, as Brian mentioned, during the Olympics, we were four times the next highest rated show. Sunday Night Football is by far the highest-rated show on television and we have very, very good partnerships with the International Olympic Committee and the NFL that go out many, many years, and those are very profitable relationships. So we're watching it and obviously, you'd rather have ratings up than down, but having ratings decline modestly and still be very, very strong properties doesn't cause us too much concern.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for that color.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Brett. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Just a question for Mr. Smit. You guys put up pretty good video net adds that you talked about, but I noticed that the penetration rates have continued to fall in video, primarily just because home and business passenger growing, and you talked about passing more businesses. So my question is this. Is the penetration falling because the video attach rate is low among businesses? And how much headroom is there for business passings to continue to grow? Are you sort of in the second inning or is it the fifth inning; just any sort of color.","Neil Smit - Comcast Corp.","I think it's important that, as you did, Jason, to separate residential from business, because there is a lower business attach rate in video in general. They're more interested in the data product and we sell more data product to them. There is an opportunity, I think, in video going forward as well as there is in our XFINITY Home product to sell to businesses as well as there will be with our wireless product. So I see great opportunity in the business segment. We continue to grow customers at a good rate. We have about a 30% to 40% penetration in the small business segment; 10% in the mid-size, so I think \u2013 and we're just starting in enterprise. So I think there is great room for growth there and I think our product offerings will continue to be attractive.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","I just want to add that we're pretty \u2013 I just want to underscore if you wanted my one point of what's one highlight for this quarter, it's the video growth rate. And I don't know that we're looking at it that way. What we're looking at is the product, the service, the momentum, and it's hundred an \u2013 how many subs, thousand subs in the last 12 months?","Neil Smit - Comcast Corp.","170,000.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","170,000 subs in the last 12 months that we've added. And as Neil referenced, the fourth quarter, there's ups and downs in quarters, but I'm looking at it kind of on an annual basis, and I think we're ahead of even where we set our own plans at the beginning of the year where we think we'll end the year. And that's a result, not that there's new homes that we're getting to in driving it, but rather a better product that we're driving with.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Can I ask just one follow up? If your home and business passings are growing about 3% on an annualized basis, is it fair to assume that the home passings is just in-line with population growth, like half that level? Is that a reasonable...","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Yeah, I think...","Neil Smit - Comcast Corp.","I think that's reasonable.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thanks, Jason. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Good morning and thanks so much for taking my questions. One on NBCU; advertising in the quarter was flattish, ex-Olympics. I just wanted to get, Steve, maybe a little bit more color there in terms of the ratings versus CPMs. And then wanted also to follow up on pricing at high-speed Internet, so the ARPU growth seems quite strong, can you parse out rate adjustments versus expanded services for high-speed data and just talk a little bit about the sustainability of ARPU growth for your high-speed Internet business? Thanks a lot.","Stephen B. Burke - Comcast Corp.","So let me just start by saying the advertising market remains very strong. Scatter is as strong as it's been really in a long time, and that's a continuation. Really, we've had quarter-after-quarter of very strong scatter, and we had a super strong upfront in May.","For the quarter, our advertising for Broadcast ex-Olympics was up 4%. Our advertising for Cable ex-Olympics was about flat. And the up 4% is a sign of CPMs being high enough on the Broadcast side to go \u2013 to exceed ratings decline, and in Cable, they were about flat. Cable in the last quarter, there are certain quarters where we have more new launches and more things going on. And of course, the Olympics really took a lot of the advertising from the ongoing programs during the quarter.","Neil Smit - Comcast Corp.","And concerning pricing, our HSD pricing is related on both rate \u2013 and is based upon both rate and in some cases the device as we increase the speeds to the household.","Our rate was a bigger factor this year than it was last year, which was more device based. We continue to see ARPU upside. We're putting in the fastest Wi-Fi available. The faster speeds, we've increased speed 17 times in the last 15 years, and we're continuing to improve the product in terms of smart Internet where it's easy to integrate new devices into the home, whether it's a Nest Thermostat or a Lutron lights, we'll make it easy for the customer, as Brian said earlier, to use our services. We have to continue to increase the Wi-Fi capacity. There are about 11 devices hanging off our network now, and we'll continue to do that. But we see ARPU upside overall in the HSD side.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks a lot.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thanks, Anthony. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask Steve and Neil each a question, if I may. Steve, I was wondering if you could give us the State of the Union, for lack of a better term, from your perspective, on the industry's progress toward better audience measurement. How much consumption do you think is still falling through the cracks and has that gap between measured and unmeasured viewing become larger or smaller over the past year?","And then for Neil. Neil, I was wondering if you could maybe give us some color on where you are in the home security and home automation market and maybe talk about, if you can, where you are on number of subscribers, penetration, revenue, something that could give us a sense as to how the progress in that business is going. Thank you.","Stephen B. Burke - Comcast Corp.","Well, I don't think the industry is anywhere near where it needs to be in terms of monetization, and we were talking about the Olympics as a perfect example. Something like 100 million Americans consumed at least part of the Olympics online. It was a huge, huge phenomenon on Snapchat and Facebook and other places. And the inability for us to articulately walk in to an advertiser and talk about all that consumption in an aggregated way is a real problem. And it's a problem that obviously is going to get solved, but the progress is not as great as it should be.","I think what everybody wants is pretty obvious. They want to know what is the total audience delivery of a television show wherever it gets consumed, and they want it to be done by a third party in a way that is objective and quantifiable, and that's what we're all working to. I think the world is moving toward C7 from C3. I think the world is moving toward measuring alternative vehicles. And I think most advertisers understand when they buy a hit property, they're going to get a lot of consumption elsewhere and they sort of factor that in to the effectiveness intellectually, but you'd certainly love for it to be done in a quantifiable way by an unbiased third party and we're not making enough progress on that.","Neil Smit - Comcast Corp.","And, Bryan, concerning XFINITY Home, we think there's a big opportunity there. We're capturing share and growing it quickly. About a year and a half ago, we announced we passed 500,000 customers and it's grown significantly from there. What's interesting, I find the most interesting is that about 55% of the XFINITY Home customers are new to Comcast. So we're attracting new customers, new customer relationships, and about 60% of those customers have quad play. So it's a very sticky product. It continues to develop, and we're very optimistic on the upside potential.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Bryan. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Brian, just a couple of questions. The first is, it looks like the industry is moving more towards the Comcast model, more vertically integrated and so on with obviously the Time Warner deal, Verizon buying content and so on. So from that perspective, you guys have a unique vantage point given you've had NBC for a while. If you could talk a little bit about what the advantages of that model are and whether owning NBC as well as Cable on the other side of it provides a better business model from a consumer perspective as well as for the company as a whole.","And secondly, from the perspective of the X1 platform, obviously, it's an industry-leading platform, and the way the content is presented there is in a disaggregated format. From that perspective, in terms of the vision you have of how video can be packaged maybe 5 years from now, does the bundle in any form, I mean, skinny or non-skinny, make any sense in the next 5 years or 10 years, given how the industry is evolving and consumption patterns are evolving? Thanks.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Well, let me take a crack at the second one first, which, if I understand the question, when you say a disaggregated format, I'm not actually sure that I see it that way. What X1 does, from my perspective, our perspective, I think, is really help you with search, navigation, discovery and enjoyment of the content you end up deciding to procure. So if you just pick a movie star, you now talk to the remote, you say it, and then it gives you recommendations, and it tells you every episode now, whether that episode resides on Netflix or resides on a broadcaster or resides on a Cable network or if you've DVR-ed it. And then it's more like this and it gives you lots of choices.","So, in the case to your point, we'll be upselling Netflix as an example, and just as we upsell HBO and Showtime and others. So some content allows you to be show-by-show or network-by-network. But it's the breadth of all of the choices in the bundle that I think is what has powered this industry.","And clearly, as Neil said, we need to evolve and continue to progress, and we will. And we need to compete with whatever the future brings. But the investment that we've made and the innovation and the people we've recruited, I think sort of ties to your first question.","Very broadly put, Comcast NBCUniversal is a very special company and we've moved hundreds of people back and forth between different parts of the company in the corporate office. The Olympics, I think, are just a shining example of where all those live streams that Steve was just talking about were available on X1 and on the NBC Sports app, and you could get there through your voice remote or through your XFINITY mobile app.","And we call that symphony, and we've seen it whether it's talent wanting to work with the company, people wanting to join the company, or innovation that the company is doing. And could we do more and will we do more and innovate? Yes. But we've seen a lot of people want to use the X1 platform. There are other operators around the world in Canada and with Cox, and we've had others requesting to use the platform.","So we are \u2013 it seems to be resonating in almost every part of the ecosystem, the strategy we're on. And again, you get to a quarter like this and you see it really all working well together. So...","Stephen B. Burke - Comcast Corp.","Let me talk a little bit about NBCUniversal under Comcast ownership. It's been about 5.5 years. We've more than doubled operating cash flow. We're the fastest growing media company in the country. When we came, NBC was number four for seven years in a row. NBC is the starting the fourth season in a row as number one. We've had two record years at Universal Studios. Our Theme Park business has tripled or quadrupled.","We've really had a wonderful experience as part of Comcast and part of that is the culture that Brian and everyone at Comcast has created. Part of it is the willingness to invest, part is Symphony, which we call our special sauce. But looking back at the last 5.5 years, the Comcast element has lent a great, great, stimulus to NBCUniversal and I think the results speak for themselves.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thanks, Kannan. We'll take one last question.","Operator","Final question comes from the line of Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. With respect to the high-speed adds, obviously quite strong, just thinking where that share is coming from? I presume mostly DSL as opposed to fiber by the telcos? And I guess thinking forward, a lot of fiber-to-the-home investment going on, is there any risk as the telco aggression I guess in the fiber field continues to roll out, that we see a more tempered outlook on high-speed data? And then maybe just another quick one on 5G, whether you see that as a threat or an opportunity? Thanks.","Neil Smit - Comcast Corp.","Well, HSD, there is still 70% to 75% of the country has HSD, so we think there is market growth opportunity. We have about 6 million DSL customers still in our footprint, so we see that as a market share opportunity and we have about 43% penetration. So we see plenty of room for growth.","Concerning 5G, I think it's in the early days. It will be an exciting evolution of the wireless standards. There are limitations to it, such as propagation and the antennas it'll need to meet power and backhaul and we think that with these thousands of endpoints in the cities, in the city, you need space, power and a field force to enable the high bandwidth mobile connections. So we think we have a great set of assets that can bring significant value to the equation.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Okay.

Brian?","Brian Roberts","Thanks Jason, and good morning everyone. We\u2019re off to a great start in 2014.","In cable, we added video subscribers again this quarter; grew broadband subscribers at a continued industry leading pace; and we once again generated very strong growth in business services.","NBCUniversal was even better, with significant ratings, momentum at NBC Broadcast highlighting the quarter, along with really strong film results. Overall, revenue increased nearly 14%, operating cash flow increased 10% and we generated over $2.8 billion in free cash flow.","Starting with cable, we continued to focus on innovation to position ourselves for the future and our customer metrics are responding with meaningful improvement in Triple Play penetration.","In video, we added 24,000 customers, the second quarter in a row where we have added customers.","In high-speed data, we added 383,000 customers and grew revenues at our fastest rate in two years. And in business services, revenue growth remained strong at nearly 24%, impressive given that we are now approaching $4 billion in annual run rate revenues.","We believe our X1 operating system provides our customers an unrivaled experience, making it easier to discover and enjoy tens of thousands of content choices, while at the same time integrating apps and social media. And consumers really like this experience. Voluntary churn for our X1 customers is down 20% to 30% relative to our broader base, while viewing has increased in both, linear and through on-demand and the metrics continue to get better.","These positive early results reinforce our decision to accelerate our X1 deployment this year, and we are now adding 15,000 to 20,000 X1 boxes per day, which is double our rate of deployment from just six months ago. Additionally, we are now rolling out a new XFINITY TV app, which enables our customers to live stream virtually their entire television line up on any IP device in the home and watch DVR recordings in the home or on the go.","In broadband, we recently increased speeds again for the 13th time in 12 years. Doubling speeds in our Blast products to 105 megabits, while our Extreme tier moved up to 150 for customers in the Northeast. And we\u2019re not stopping there. Our focus on wireless gateway deployment is adding utility to our customers while at the same time helping us create the largest Wi-Fi footprint in the U.S. with over one million public Wi-Fi hotspots currently available to our customers.","We believe we are making real, tangible progress in customer service through simplifying the customer experience. In the first quarter, truck rolls declines roughly 500,000 or 8% compared to 2013. We recently launched the new My Account App, and early feedback has been very positive. The app allows customers to make payments, self-diagnose issues, manage devices and view technician appointments.","We are encouraged by progress we have made with customer service, but are going to stay vigilant and focused on further improvements over the course of 2014 and in the years ahead.","Over to NBCUniversal, the results were terrific this quarter. The headline is obviously the Sochi Olympics, which aired across our broadcast and cable networks and generated over $1.1 billion in revenues, and contributed positively to operating cash flow. Any way you look at the Olympics, it was a tremendous success.","NBC prime time averaged 21.4 million viewers during the Olympics, up 6% from the 2006 to Torino Olympics, the last winter games held in a similar time zone which is especially notable given the growth in live streaming hours. Speaking of live streaming, the Olympics generated 61.8 million visitors across all platforms, a 29% increase relative to the prior Olympics 2010 in Vancouver. And the experience was further enhanced for Comcast Cable customers, where for the first time Comcast offered the NBC Sports Live Extra app on X1, which enabled our customers to watch 500 extra hours of live streaming content on their television.","The broadcast story goes well beyond the Olympics this quarter. It is really an incredible turnaround story. Bob Greenblatt and his entire team have done a terrific job. The momentum we achieved in the fall has carried through into 2014, led in part by an amazing transition in late night with both the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and Late Night with Seth Meyers off to excellent starts. In fact, NBC is positioned to end the full season as the number one network in the coveted 18 to 49 demographics for prime time and late night.","We\u2019ve also made strong progress with our NBC-owned stations. I am now pleased to say that nearly 75% of our local newscast now rank one or two in the market, which is up from 50% just two years ago.","In cable networks, NBC Sports Network had its most watched quarter in the network\u2019s history supported by unprecedented live programming hours record viewership for the Sochi winter games, strong NHL viewership and the English Premier Leagues, three most watched months in U.S. cable history. Bravo also had its best quarter in network history among all key demos.","Our film division also had a strong quarter and is reflective of our focus this year on lower cost films with a much better financial risk-reward profile.","And the theme park segment saw a stable attendance despite the unfavorable shift in spring holidays in the first quarter which will correct in the second quarter. With the upcoming opening of Harry Porter 2 in Orlando and the added hotel capacity with the opening of Cabana Bay, the theme parks are setup for strong performance in the second quarter and beyond.","NBCUniversal has real momentum. And we believe this is sustainable throughout all of 2014. So all in all, I am really pleased with the operating results across our entire business.","I\u2019d like to spend a quick moment on our merger with Time Warner Cable. The more we get into the planning efforts on our side, the more confident we are about the potential and about the potential synergies. We see significant benefit for consumers in our ability to offer our innovative and industry-leading products to a larger residential footprint, along with opportunities in business services and advertising.","The opportunity in this merger remains very compelling. Time Warner Cable shareholders will get 23% stake in the combined entity, and share in the upside of a company with tremendous potential to create value for customers and shareholders.","In addition, there has been a lot of talk about potential divestitures, and Michael will detail how we see the opportunity to create value there as well. Our proposed merger with Time Warner Cable is an exciting and unique opportunity and we remain confident that the combination will strengthen a world class organization that will benefit customers, employees and shareholders.","So with more on the first quarter, let me turn it over to Michael.","Michael Angelakis","Good morning, and thank you, Brian. We begin 2014 with solid financial results, which reflect consistent execution, profitable growth in the fundamental strength of our businesses. Let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated financial results on Slide 4.","We are very pleased with our first quarter results which reflect profitable growth across all of our businesses. First quarter consolidated revenue increased 13.7% to $17.4 billion reflecting solid growth in our cable business and an exceptional performance in NBCUniversal, partially driven by the success of the Sochi Olympics.","For comparison purposes, when you exclude the $1.1 billion of revenue generated by the Olympics, our consolidated revenue increased at healthy 6.5% during the quarter. Consolidated operating cash flow was strong and increased 10% to $5.5 billion. This result includes $17 million of expenses related to the Time Warner Cable merger, which is included in our corporate and other segment.","Excluding these costs, consolidated operating cash flow grew 10.4%. Free cash flow for the quarter decreased 10% to $2.8 million. And free cash flow per share decreased 8.5% to $1.07 per share as growth in consolidated operating cash flow was offset primarily by higher working capital related to the Olympics and higher expenditures for film and TV production. Excluding this working capital impact, free cash flow growth would have been positive. We\u2019ll provide more detail on this topic later in the presentation.","Earnings per share for the first quarter increased 31.5% to $0.71 per share versus $0.54 per share in the first quarter of 2013. To provide a clear comparison, when you exclude gains on sales and acquisition-related items, our comparable EPS increased 33.3% to $0.68 per share.","Now let\u2019s review the results of our business units in more detail, starting with cable communications on Slide 5.","We are pleased with our first quarter performance of healthy financial and customer growth in our cable communications business. Before I discuss the details, I would like to highlight an important change we have made to our customer metrics. Beginning this quarter and as we have previously announced, we are changing our methodology for counting video customers from an equivalent billing units or EBU approach to a billable customers method.","This decision changed how certain establishments billed under bulk agreements are reported, such as apartment complexes, healthcare facilities and other multiple dwelling units or MDUs. Under the new billable customers\u2019 method, as Comcast has the ability to individually bill tenants for additional services not included in the bulk property agreement, the total number of units served at that property accounted as individual customers. If we are unable to provide additional service, it is counted as one customer.","Previously we had counted and reported these types of customers on an EBU basis, by dividing monthly revenue received under a bulk contract by the standard monthly residential rate. Because of the nature of the calculation, customer counts under the previously EBU method can artificially decrease or increase as residential rate changes occur in the markets.","In addition, the billable customers\u2019 method improves our customer transparency and aligns our customer count methodology with the rest of the cable industry. This change has also been incorporated into our trending schedules including review of these video customer metrics for 2013, making it easier to compare metrics as we report them.","Also we will now disclose the number of our customer relationships and our average revenue per customer relationship. So for the first time, we are disclosing our customer relationships of $26.8 million, which increased by $124,000 in the first quarter, indicating that we have a relationship with nearly one out of every two of the 54 million residential and commercial passing.","We continue to experience real strength in our customer metrics with positive net-additions across all of our products. Similar to our strong fourth quarter, our momentum in video continued in the first quarter. We added 24,000 new video customers in the first quarter compared to a net loss of 25,000 in last year\u2019s first quarter as we continue to execute with improved products, improved customer support and better retention efforts.","This growth is an accurate comparison using the billable customers\u2019 method for the first quarter of 2014 in \u201813. If we compared video customers using our previous EBU method, we added 4,000 video customers in the first quarter compared to a net loss of 60,000 in last year\u2019s first quarter.","Moving onto high-speed data. The service also continues to gain share as we differentiate our product to service and speed enhancements. We added 383,000 new data customers in the first quarter, and recently announced that we are increasing speeds again marking the 13th time in 12 years that we have increased speeds.","In addition, our voice customer base grew by 142,000 in the first quarter proving that voice continues to add value to the bundle.","First quarter cable revenue increased 5.3% to $10.8 billion, reflecting growth in our residential businesses, continued strength in business services and solid results in our advertising group. Total revenue per customer relationship increased 4.5% to $134 per month and reflects volume growth, rate adjustments, a higher contribution from business services and increasing number of our customers taking multiple products.","We are continuing to have success converting single and double play customers to Triple Play. And at the end of the first quarter, 68% of our customers took at least two products and 36% took three products, compared to 33% at the end of last year\u2019s first quarter.","As we look at our service categories, we reported video revenue growth of 1.3%, reflecting modest rate adjustments to about 69% of our footprint in the first quarter, and an increasing number of customers taking advanced services. We now have 12.6 million high-def and\/or DVR customers equal to 56% of our video customers.","High-speed internet revenue increased 9% during the quarter, making it again the largest contributor to cable revenue growth, driven by continued growth in our customer base, rate increases and increasing number of customers taking higher speed services. At the end of the quarter, 38% of our residential high-speed customers now take our Blast and Extreme products and received at least 50 megabits of speed.","Voice revenue increased 2.1% for the first quarter, driven by growth in our customer base as we continue to focus on the value of the Triple Play. We continue to successfully convert single and double play customers to Triple Play, and acquire new Triple Play customer relationships. In fact, we added 155,000 Triple Play product customer relationships during the quarter.","Moving from our residential to our commercial businesses, revenue increased 23.9% to $917 million and was again the second largest contributor to cable revenue growth during the first quarter. This growth is impressive considering business services now approaching a $4 billion run rate business. Our share continues to grow, but we have only captured about 20% of the small end of the market and about 5% share of the mid-sized business segment. Our optimism here continues as business services represent a large and attractive opportunity for the company.","Our cable advertising group also performed well as the first quarter revenue increased 6.2% reflecting higher automotive advertising and political revenue. Excluding this political revenue, our core cable advertising increased 3.2%.","Please refer to Slide 6. First quarter cable communications operating cash flow increased 4.3% to $4.4 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.9% compared to 41.3% in the first quarter of 2013, primarily driven by a lower level of rate adjustments and the impact of two one-time items, including weather-related expenses incurred during the quarter and the benefit from an NHL walkout rebate in the first quarter of 2013.","If we exclude these one-time items, operating cash flow would have been about one point higher and margins would have been flat. We are focused on maintaining stable operating margins even as our programming costs increased. And as we support new initiatives including the deployments of X1, the deployments of the wireless gateways and expansion of business services and XFINITY Home.","Programming expenses increases 8.8% in the first quarter of 2014, driven by increases in retransmission consent fees, higher sports programming costs, and step-ups for recently completed long-term agreements. We also continue to increase the amount of content we provide to our customers across multiple platforms.","As I mentioned previously, we still expect programming expenses to grow at approximately 9% to 10% for the full year of 2014.","We are effectively offsetting these higher programming expenses with an improving product mix as we add more high-speed data, voice and business service customers and upgrade existing customers to higher levels of services such as HD and DVRs and faster internet speeds. In addition, we also continue to gain operating efficiencies and as Brian mentioned, we reduced truck rolls by 500,000 or 8% year-over-year, even as we added new customers and upgrading existing customers to additional products.","Customers also continued to elect self-installations, which in the first quarter accounted for 47% of our total installations, up significantly from 38% in the first quarter of last year. In addition, we now have 36% of our customers managing their accounts online.","So as we begin the New Year, our cable communications business is off to a solid start and performing well on all fronts, financially, operationally enhancing the product, accelerating innovation and improving our customer support.","Now let\u2019s move onto NBCUniversal\u2019s results, which are presented on Slide 7. For the first quarter of 2014, NBCUniversal\u2019s revenue increased 28.8% and operating cash flow increased 37.6%. These exceptional results were driven in part by the success of the Sochi Olympics. Excluding any revenue impact on the Olympics, NBCUniversal revenue increased a healthy 8.1%.","Now let\u2019s review the individual business segments at NBCUniversal. For the first quarter, cable networks generated revenue of $2.5 billion, an increase of 12.6% and included $257 million of revenue associated with the Sochi Olympics. Excluding the Olympics, revenue increased 1% driven by a 4.4% increase in distribution revenue, partially offset by a slight decline in advertising revenue of 1.4% as increases in price were offset by ratings pressure at some of our cable networks.","Cable networks operating cash flow increased 4.2% to $895 million, reflecting higher revenue, partially offset by our continued investment in original programming and higher sports programming costs, including the impact of the Olympics and the launch of the English Premier League on NBC Sports Network.","With regards to our broadcast segment, first quarter broadcast television revenue increased 72.8% to $2.6 billion including $846 million of revenue generated by the Olympics. Excluding the impact of the Olympics, broadcast revenue increased 17% reflecting higher ratings due to the continued success of our prime time line up; more hours of the voice airing during the first quarter compared to last year; the strength of our news division including Today and Nightly News, and the impressive performance in late night.","Broadcast operating cash flow increased $157 million to $122 million for the first quarter, reflecting a profitable Olympics, higher advertising revenue from improved ratings and increased retransmission consent fees. Given NBC\u2019s rating improvement and strength across the NBC channel portfolio, we are anticipating that this will be a very successful upfront for our company.","Early client discussions have been very positive and suggest this could be a meaningful correction year where we can capitalize on our progress in rating success and hope to close the monetization gap we have mentioned in previous calls.","Moving onto filmed entertainment, this is clearly off to a great start with first quarter revenue increasing 11.1% to $1.4 billion and operating cash flow increasing $219 million to $288 million, reflecting higher theatrical revenue from the solid box office performance of our slate, including Ride Along and Lone Survivor and the international performance of The Wolf of Wall Street.","Switching to our theme park segment, revenue increased 5.4% to $487 million, reflecting increases in per capita spending and stable attendance despite the shift in spring holidays which occurred in the first quarter of last year, but will occur now in the second quarter. Operating cash flow decreased 1.5% to $170 million for the first quarter, reflecting higher operating costs to support new attractions.","In the second quarter, we are very excited about the opening of Harry Porter 2 in Orlando as well as having a spring holidays in full swing.","Now let\u2019s move to Slide 8 to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. Consistent with our plan, consolidated capital expenditures for the quarter increased 6.4% to $1.4 billion compared to the first quarter of \u201813 reflecting increased investments at both, cable and both NBCUniversal.","At cable communications, first quarter capital expenditures increased $51 million or 4.6% to $1.1 billion, equal to about 10.6% of cable revenue versus 10.7% in the first quarter of 2013. The increase was primarily driven by higher spending on CPE, including our new X1 platform and wireless gateways. The level of CapEx spend this quarter benefited from the timing of equipment purchases and will ramp throughout the year.","We continue to expect that for the full year of 2014, cable capital expenditures will increase with capital intensity increasing to approximately 14% of cable revenue compared to 12.9% in 2013 as we accelerate the deployment of X1, deploy additional wireless gateways, increase network capacity and continue to invest in expansion of business services and XFINITY Home.","So we move to NBCUniversal, first quarter capital expenditures at NBCUniversal increased $28 million to $291 million, primarily reflecting increased investments in facilities as well as theme parks as we build new attractions including new Harry Porter attractions in both parks and a fashioned attraction in Hollywood.","As I mentioned in February, we expect that NBCUniversal\u2019s 2014 capital expenditure plan will remain relatively stable to 2013\u2019s level.","Now let\u2019s move to Slide 9. As I mentioned earlier, we generated consolidated free cash flow of $2.8 billion in the first quarter, a decrease of 10% as growth in consolidated operating cash flow was primarily offset by increased working capital, which was mainly driven by ad sales receivables for the Olympics and net productions spent at our film and TV studios. Excluding the $636 million swing in working capital, free cash flow would have increased during the quarter.","We are executing on our 2014 financial plan and increased our return of capital to shareholders by 35% in the first quarter to $1.3 billion, including share repurchases totaling $750 million and dividend payments totaling $508 million for the quarter.","Let me now turn to Time Warner Cable. And as Brian mentioned, offered some thoughts on our return of capital strategy and potential divestitures. As has been reported, when shareholder approval for our acquisition of Time Warner Cable is obtained later this year, we intend to increase our repurchase plan by $2.5 billion. This is in addition to the current plan of $3 billion for Comcast, for an expected total of $5.5 billion in share repurchases during 2014.","In addition, as you know we have committed divestitures in our Time Warner Cable transaction. We do not comment on rumors, but I will outline our philosophy in financial perspective on this subject. There are a number of potential structures for us to evaluate, maximizing value for our shareholders who will guide our decisions. Some key considerations include amongst others; our ability to divest subscribers in the most tax efficient way possible; our ability to shrink our equity base and\/or deliver cash to our shareholders; and our ability to maximize our presence in our most strategic markets.","In addition, we anticipate that any divestiture plan will be leverage neutral event for Comcast. In other words, the extent that we sell properties for cash or spin properties any cash proceeds after neutralizing or maintaining our existing leverage ratio can be used for return of capital to Comcast shareholders.","This is complex and we believe value enhancing to our shareholders. There is a lot of work to be done in addition to the integration effort and we will provide regular updates as we continue to refine our thinking and analysis.","So let me wrap up by saying we are very pleased with our operational and financial performance this quarter. We have started the year off strong. We are making tremendous progress and are focused on continuing our momentum throughout the year. We are excited about the Time Warner Cable merger and the synergy opportunities it presents. We believe it will be accretive on a free cash flow per share basis and are confident that our disciplined investments and our focus on execution will continue to generate profitable growth.","Now let me turn the call over to Jason for Q&A.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks, Michael. Operator, let\u2019s open up the call for Q&A please.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jessica Reif Cohen \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thanks. I have a couple of questions. The first one, you mentioned on the call several times of adding wireless gateways and having all these hotspots. I was just wondering if you could give us your vision for Wi-Fi in the kind of longer term with and without Time Warner Cable. How different would your strategy be with our without them? And is this a value-add service to existing wireline HSD subs or is it potentially a stand-alone service?","Neil Smit","Hi Jess, it\u2019s Neil. I think Wi-Fi, we\u2019ve rolled out 8.3 million devices. We view it as a very important asset, both as an extension to our data product as well as the ability to launch new products like XFINITY Home. I think the Time Warner merger would extend the network further and the Wi-Fi network build out. We see about 75% to 80% of mobile data consumption happening on Wi-Fi in the home and in the office. So I think we view it as a very positive important asset and we\u2019ll continue to put in hotspots as we go forward.","Brian Roberts","Let me just add to that. I think that\u2019s exactly right. Short-term, it\u2019s a big adder to broadband. And longer-term and including our MVNO potential and other wireless assets that we have in the company, we\u2019re in a position to think about where wireless is going and how we can participate in a way to build value. And whether that\u2019s for existing products or new product, nothing but could things seem to happen by us adding Wi-Fi to the benefit of our consumers.","Jessica Reif Cohen \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","And can I just follow-up, Mike, you talked about capital returns and the potential divestiture close to approval. I just wanted to clarify something you said on the \u2013 when you announced the Time Warner Cable acquisition. You said that there would be $10 billion \u2013 I think the way you phrased it was, that there would be $10 billion in proceeds next year, or I mean in return of capital. Is that \u2013 if you divest those and argument like let\u2019s say it\u2019s roughly $10 billion in excess capital to be more or less. Is that in addition to the amount you announced at the time of Time Warner Cable or is that included in [indiscernible]?","Michael Angelakis","Thanks Jessica. Let me put a final point on it. So what we said when we announced the Time Warner Cable deal that, when the deal would close we would increase our authorization by $10 billion. Our view was if we had a $7.5 billion authorization at the beginning of the year and as we announce today, say we used $5.5 billion of that due to the original $3 billion, plus the additional $2.5 billion. That would leave about $2.5 billion worth of capability \u2013 $2 billion of the capability.","We would then when the deal closes, look to increase our authorization by $10 billion, that would be completely separate from any divestiture assets we\u2019re talking about.","Jessica Reif Cohen \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","That\u2019s right. Okay, thank you. And then if I could still one last thing. And you talked about closing the monetization gap. Could you or Steve, give us an update on what you think the potential upside is there? You seem \u2013 I mean your rates have been great. You seem bullish about the upfront. If you could just clarify, what do you think that is now, the gap is now? And then I\u2019m done.","Steve Burke","Well, I think we\u2019re going into the upfront with the best position we\u2019ve had in over a decade, primarily driven by NBC. Last year NBC came with 17% behind the leader which was CBS. This year we\u2019re estimating that we\u2019ll finish in first about 12% ahead of number two.","So if you look at that swing, it\u2019s a 29% swing, which we\u2019ve gone back to the beginning of people meters. We can\u2019t find any network that swung that much in a year. So that\u2019s going to give us I think a much stronger hand as we go into the upfront. And we\u2019re looking at this upfront as a chance to have a correction in that monetization gap.","It\u2019s hard to precisely say how much that is going to be worth to us, but it\u2019s going to be worth a lot.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks, Jessica. Operator, next question?","Operator","Next question will come from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Doug Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thanks so much. I guess two questions. Following up on wireless. The forefront is the concept that your Wi-Fi network obviously can offload much of the wireless data usage giving you a cost advantage of hybrid Verizon wireless MVNO, Comcast Wi-Fi network. If you can talk through your longer term aspirations in wireless and whether such a hybrid service could prove advantageous? Could you have a cost advantage over the incumbents in that business? And then Michael, just for clarification if I missed it. When would you expect to make a decision on divestitures? Thanks.","Brian Roberts","Let me just jump in first and say that I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve announced anything on wireless. It\u2019s premature question. I think what we\u2019re doing is building out hotspots, we\u2019re doing the routers with dual SSID, we\u2019re finding our customers enjoy, the technology is getting better where spectrum has been allocated to Wi-Fi.","And long-term I think that we\u2019re studying that market and we\u2019re encouraged by it. Neil, does that sound right?","Neil Smit","No, I think that\u2019s exactly right. We\u2019re focused on building out a network and adding value to the HSD product right now, while there has been some speculation on the combined Wi-Fi MVNO. We\u2019re focused on just building up the network right now and providing a great experience for the customers.","Michael Angelakis","And I\u2019ll take the last question. We actually don\u2019t have a particular timeline in terms of announcing the divestitures. Obviously there is a lot of work to do and this is very complex. So our view is let\u2019s be very methodical about it and get it right from a variety of perspectives and it will be announced in due course.","Doug Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank","So I mean Michael, the possibility could be early but not necessarily a plan for that?","Michael Angelakis","No, we don\u2019t have any particular plan as I just mentioned. Our view is there is a number of moving pieces related to regulatory, related to tax, related to a number of items. And our view is let\u2019s be very thoughtful about it. The goal is to maximize shareholder value, so there is no particular internal timeline. We\u2019re going to go at a pace that we\u2019re comfortable with to make sure that we do maximize shareholder value.","Doug Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And if I can just ask that, Brian and Neil, given your answer is, is the way we should think about it perhaps that first a product that you could offer is just a Wi-Fi voice, Wi-Fi only voice service just test up the capabilities with network. Is that possible?","Neil Smit","I think we\u2019re very preliminary in that thinking, Doug, and it\u2019s probably too early to say.","Doug Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank","All right, thank you so much.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks Doug. Operator, next question please?","Operator","Next question will come from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Phil Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi guys. I wonder if you can talk about price increases through the year, both what you\u2019ve done so far and how you think about going forward. I know there was some confusion over the last month or so about what\u2019s happening on the video side because of equipment increases or the lack of that this year. Do you feel like the equipment price increases are sort of tapped out given the prices already happening on the DTAs and the set-top boxes or is that a possibility of going up in the future? Thanks.","Neil Smit","Hi Phil, it\u2019s Neil. We did take lower rate increases in video this year overall than last year. We looked at the market and adjusted as we felt was appropriate. We target different segments with different price offers. I don\u2019t think the pricing is necessarily topped out as you say. I think it depends on the segment. It depends on the value the service we\u2019re offering.","What we\u2019re really focused on is driving out X1. We\u2019ve seen great results with the product as we\u2019ve gone into market and it\u2019s performing very well as Brian said, churns down 20% to 30%. The video numbers were driven by more upgrades and fewer disconnects this quarter and we feel pretty good about the video results we\u2019re achieving right now.","Phil Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan","Neil, if I could follow-up on your CapEx comment. Given the fairly low pace of CapEx on the cable side this quarter, should we anticipate that that 15,000 to 20,000 could accelerate pretty dramatically between now and the end of the year?","Neil Smit","Yes, as Brian also mentioned, we\u2019re selling 15,000 to 20,000 X1 boxes a day right now. And so that rate had doubled what it was six months ago. So it is accelerating, and I think that there will be some catch up in CapEx over the coming quarters.","Michael Angelakis","And let me just add in. Phil, with regards to the CapEx, we talked about that back in February. We\u2019re sticking to our CapEx plan in terms of percentage of revenue and you will see from a CPE perspective almost all of our set-top boxes are X1 type set-top boxes.","Phil Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan","Thanks.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks, Phil. Next question please?","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Craig Moffett \u2013 MoffettNathanson","Hi, good morning. Two questions if I could. First for Neil. Neil, you had tested a solution, as I understand if we\u2019re delivering the X1 user interface without requiring an IP chipset in the box. So ActiveVideo had done one. I think there are other vendors that are doing that. Can you update us on that? I mean we seem like there is a potential for a much lower CapEx profile with faster rollout if that works? And so I just wanted to see where we were on that topic? And then for Mike. Mike, when you did the transaction with all cash for Time Warner Cable, I understand that maybe very tax efficient, but is there any consideration separate and apart from maintaining the leverage after divestitures of potentially readjusting the leverage profile of the combined company after all is set and done?","Neil Smit","So Craig, I\u2019ll cover the X1 product. I think what you maybe referring to is the slave devices that act off of the main gateway. You still need an IP set-top box in the house such as the X1. And then you can run lower cost hardware off of that in terms of the additional outlets.","The X1, what\u2019s great about the product right now as we\u2019ve learned as we\u2019ve rolled out the new X2 interface, we can adjust on the fly and launch new products like EFT [ph]. But generally speaking, you need the master device in order to get the lower cost additional outlets.","Craig Moffett \u2013 MoffettNathanson","Neil, if I can just interject. Sorry, my understanding is that the solutions I was describing are the solutions that translate the IP interface back into MPEG for delivery to legacy boxes without having to replace boxes in the home.","Neil Smit","We have some backward compatibility. It\u2019s primarily with the advanced set-top boxes that we\u2019ll be rolling out overtime. We currently in our solutions rollout the X1 box and its additional outlets, the advanced set-top boxes, but there will be some backward compatibility overtime.","Craig Moffett \u2013 MoffettNathanson","Got it. Okay, thank you.","Michael Angelakis","Craig, let me just clarify the Time Warner \u2013 so you said all cash, the Time Warner Cable\u2026","Craig Moffett \u2013 MoffettNathanson","Sorry, I meant all stock, sorry.","Michael Angelakis","That\u2019s what I thought you meant. I just wanted to clarify. With regards to our leverage profile, when we do close a transaction depending on timing, we\u2019ll have approximately $70 billion of debt in our balance sheet in pro forma between 2.2x, 2.3x leverage depending on timing. I think the divestitures are going to be what I call leverage neutral that wherever we end up when the transactions are done, we\u2019ll end up at the same place.","I don\u2019t think we\u2019re revisiting our overall balance sheet profile. Our goal long-term, medium-term goal is to be between 1.5x and 2x. And that\u2019s going to take us several years to get to when given the magnitude of debt, given our air rating, given how we look at our balance sheet as a real strategic asset, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to re-look at the leverage ratios.","Craig Moffett \u2013 MoffettNathanson","Thank you.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks Craig. Operator, next question please?","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ben Swinburne \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you. Good morning. Neil, just coming back to the video revenue growth and rate adjustment comment you made. This is I think was the lowest quarter in about eight quarters on video revenue and a lot of that is probably timing. So just curious if you can add a little more color on whether you\u2019re seeing a market that you need to be a little more sensitive to price, or if this is just the normal kind of quarter-to-quarter timing of when price adjustments rolls through the business? And then, Brian in last call, you talked about X1. I think the comment was a majority of your customers in several years and it sounds like if anything, you\u2019re more excited and see more opportunity there. I just wondered if you had finer point on the timing or any more color on sort of the deployment schedule.","Neil Smit","Concerning rate increases Ben, we decided to take lower rate increases this quarter as we evaluated the market. I wouldn\u2019t read any trends into it. We took rate increases across the smaller percentage of our footprint this quarter than last year as well, but we target different offers to different customers and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing it topping out. In the competitive arena, the offers are in the same ballpark, the promo prices go up and down, but the destination pricing is fairly similar across these various competitors.","Brian Roberts","I think that in 90 days nothing has changed Ben on our view. I think we\u2019re more encouraged than 90 days ago. We\u2019ve now scaled it more. We\u2019ve ramped it, doubled the speed in six months of the rollout. Churns, pay-per-view revenue, customer satisfaction, all those statistics are headed in a good direction.","I think your previous question about how can we get it to more devices faster is always on our mind. Are there new technologies that can come along and help to speed that along? One of the things we are rolling out is an app, XFINITY TV, and it really looks like the X1 guide without a box. And it works on every iOS and every Android and every Kindle in your home.","So there are \u2013 real progress is being made on how to get this to more devices faster without having to spend more capital necessarily, but I think ultimately this is a fantastic product and we\u2019re getting it out there at measured pace. We started with Triple Play. Now we\u2019re Double Play. And we\u2019re constantly getting it to more available to our customers and we\u2019re trying different marketing things to make it \u2013 see how the response rates are and see how the customer satisfaction is. But so far so good.","Michael Angelakis","And let me just say one of the things on video revenue. I just want to make sure we\u2019re all level set. We have almost 70% of our customers take two services. And 36% take all three services. So we do look at it from a yield perspective with regards to rate adjustments across the entire base and you really have to look at not just video revenue, but high-speed data revenue is up 9% which is a terrific performance compared to prior years. And if you look at all of our recurring revenue, that\u2019s actually growing quite nicely as well.","So as we continue to have more Double and Triple Plays, the individual product revenue growth I think gets a little distorted.","Ben Swinburne \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks a lot.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks Ben. Operator, next question please?","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Marci Ryvicker \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thanks. Can you just outline the steps to closing the Time Warner Cable merger? We have the Senate House Committee or the Senate Judiciary Committee will have the house. Then the Time Warner Cable shareholder vote, DOJ, FCCs. Is there anything I am missing? And then just a follow-up. Do you know when the Time Warner Cable shareholder meeting is going to be?","Brian Roberts","This is Brian. I think you have most of the steps. We don\u2019t know when that vote is going to be. But you also have local municipalities and state franchising authorities and PUCs where certain business licenses exist. So there is probably even a few more steps than you mentioned but those are the basics.","Marci Ryvicker \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. And then just a follow-up on operations. Any thoughts about expanding Streampix or something else within over the top service? I think AT&T made an announcement this morning. We saw Dishnet [ph] and Disney, so any thoughts there?","Brian Roberts","Well Streampix has been a good product for us. We\u2019ve learned what customers consume and there is a lot of people who were using the product and even buying the product. I think the OTT model we found to be very difficult. However, as we tried to target different segments, we\u2019re open to the possibilities of including OTT.","Marci Ryvicker \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thank you.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks, Marci. Next question please?","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John Hodulik \u2013 UBS","Okay, thanks. I guess a follow-up to Marci\u2019s question. Last night on the Netflix call, Reed Hastings reiterated his desire to get his product on the X1 box. What is Comcast\u2019s view of lot of other content aggregated on the platform? That\u2019s number one. And then two, on the new buyback. Can you give us a sense of timing around the Comcast vote for the Time Warner Cable idea, of when you expect that to occur? Thanks.","Neil Smit","This is Neil. Concerning the Netflix opportunity to get on X1, we\u2019ve launched a lot of apps. We have Pandora and Facebook and Twitter and we have a number of partnerships. And where there is real win-win relationship and a win for the consumer, we\u2019re certainly open to the possibilities. I think that a number of the apps are getting a lot of use. We launched the Olympics app with Sochi and that got a lot of use and we\u2019re going to continue to integrate more functionality into the X1 experience to make it more personalized for the viewer.","Michael Angelakis","With regards to shareholder vote, it\u2019s hard to tell to be honest with you John. We have to go through the SEC review which we\u2019re doing now, but I would hope it\u2019s over the next several months we\u2019ll have that vote, but just difficult to pinpoint as Brian mentioned with Marci. So we\u2019ll have \u2013 obviously we have really two shareholders votes; ours as well as Time Warner Cable\u2019s. And right now we\u2019re going through that SEC review.","John Hodulik \u2013 UBS","Okay, thanks.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks John. Next question please?","Operator","Question will come from the line of Brian Kraft with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Brian Kraft \u2013 Evercore Partners","Hi, thanks. So two quick questions. First on high-speed data net-adds. And they\u2019ve been at a pretty consistent level in the first quarter for the past three years. We saw some deceleration this year. So the question is, is this indicative of any kind of slowdown in high-speed data net-adds, or was there something anomalous about the quarter whether it\u2019s weather or just resource allocation or some other reason? And then the other question is on the cable network ad revenue. Excluding the Olympics, it looks like it was down year-over-year. Just wanted to understand what that weakness is related to, is it just ratings, was there a pricing or make an impact too. And how do you see the outlook in 2Q and 3Q on the cable network side for advertising? Thank you.","Michael Angelakis","So let me start with the cable advertising. Actually you have to adjust out the closure of the Style Network or the shutdown of the Style Network. And Fandango, we moved from one category of the company to another company. If you exclude those two things, cable advertisement was up a couple of percentage points. And we are optimistic that we\u2019re going to have a good upfront in the next ensuing quarter, we\u2019ll do better.","Brian Roberts","And on the HSD side, we feel very good with the quarter, at 9% revenue growth, 383,000 subs. We feel it\u2019s a good quarter and I wouldn\u2019t read any deceleration into the business at all. We\u2019re capturing share and we continue to focus on and add value through things like speed upgrades and Wi-Fi.","Brian Kraft \u2013 Evercore Partners","Great, thank you.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks Brian. Next question please?","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Vijay Jayant with International Strategy & Investment Group. Please go ahead.","Vijay Jayant \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group","Hi. I have two questions. You talked about the video ARPU trends and how we should think about it. I wondered, can you just talk about how the skinny video flat broadband offerings are attracting and becoming a bit of piece of mix [ph] and are really resonating? And second for Michael, talked about after divestitures being tax efficient. Is that logical to assume basically that heritage about your assets generally have the highest step-up bases on it. So would it be most logical? Thanks.","Neil Smit","This is Neil. Vijay, with regards to Internet Plus product, it\u2019s been a very successful product in targeting millennials. It\u2019s a good margin product. And we will continue to use it to target that audience, but we\u2019re overall pleased with the results there.","Michael Angelakis","Honestly Vijay, I don\u2019t think we want to get to in the weeds with regards to tax bases and step-ups and those kinds of items. We have lots of assets between our company and obviously Time Warner. And we\u2019re evaluating a number of factors including tax bases is one of those factors. Other factors are how are we clustered within certain markets and how do we think about value and growth and all those other items.","So I don\u2019t want to leave you with the perception that there is only one factor or one set of systems. And I think it would be not quite right to go into specifics at this point.","Vijay Jayant \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group","Okay, thank you.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks Vijay. Operator, we\u2019ve got time for one last question.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Kannan Venkateshwar \u2013 Barclays","Thank you. The question I had was on the X1 side. When there is some opportunity in increasing the customer lifetime value because of the reduction in churn. Could you help us with what the revenue opportunity is in terms of the additional products that you are selling and how that is trending in the footprint that you have? And secondly on the content delivering networks side, is there any way to expand that to include other partners and offer differentiated services, which look like over the top services but are probably a different tier?","Neil Smit","This is Neil. Concerning the X1 product, I think the revenue comes in a number of forms. One is the X1 customers are more likely to take Triple Play. Two is we\u2019re driving more VOD revenue. Three is, we\u2019re monetizing better from an overall advertising perspective because they\u2019re spending more time watching on-demand where we have the C3 window, and as well as linear. So you\u2019re seeing a bump in both overall viewing of the product.","We\u2019ve launched EFT which has been very successful for us. We\u2019ve been the number one retailer in a number of movies we\u2019ve launched. So those are just the number of things that contribute to the revenue. I think the churn is very important because driving that churn number down that dramatically is going to be a big factor.","Concerning the CDN, we\u2019ve invested hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars of building our CDN. It\u2019s a very powerful asset. And I think that as we\u2019ve had people approach us to consider some sort of arrangement to share and we\u2019re open to those conversations.","Brian Roberts","Let me just wrap up \u2013 Mike did you want to add anything?","Michael Angelakis","Yes. Actually X1 customers take a much higher amount of DVRs as well, which is quite good for us and adds more revenue.","Brian Roberts","So, in just wrapping up, I think a really strong start to the year, terrific work at NBCUniversal and every business segment setting up for a continuation throughout the year. And I think in that last question what\u2019s exciting about cable right now is we have a product with the X1 platform that is going to lead for years and years for more innovation to happen. It\u2019s a game changer to put it in the cloud to be able to click a button and have a go to Denver and back faster than a click would have happen just looking at a television just a couple of years ago is creates really fantastic opportunity as we\u2019ve touched on some of them today and some that haven\u2019t even been invented yet, but it\u2019s an architectural change that we haven\u2019t seen in a long time.","And so getting that platform out in a measured way will be fantastic for our customers and open up to new businesses. So it\u2019s a great start to the year. And back to you Jason.","Jason Armstrong","Great. Well, at this point we\u2019ll wrap up here. And thank you everyone for joining us.","Operator","There will be a replay available of today\u2019s call starting at 12:30 PM Eastern Standard Time.

And on behalf of everyone at Comcast and I believe all the investors say thanks for a great run and we wish you terrific success in your new role as group Chief Financial Officer of Sky. Also I'd like to welcome Marci Ryvicker who's joining to take over Investor Relations. Marci's got a talented and successful past and welcome to Comcast.","2019 was a busy productive and exciting year for our company; capped off by a strong fourth quarter and we've already jumped right into 2020 with the debut of our exciting new streaming service Peacock. As you heard last week, it's a truly differentiated approach to streaming that leverages capabilities from all across our company.","As we look to the future, I am confident that the company we have built has all the necessary components to succeed and our guiding principles remain the same. The leaders in our markets continuously improve our products and experiences and build deep highly valuable recurring customer relationships. Our world-class teams are executing and operating at a high level all of which allows us to invest in our businesses and deliver consistent results.","The success of our strategy is demonstrated in our consolidated financial performance. We delivered another year of terrific results with growth in pro forma EBITDA of 5.9%, record free cash flow generation of $13.4 billion, growth in adjusted EPS of 14.7%, the 10th year of double-digit growth in the last 11 years.","These results were driven by Cable as the team successful pivot to a connectivity-centric strategy and investment in xFi continue to pay off. Cable delivered broadband net additions of 1.4 million, the best in the last 12 years, finishing off with an exceptional fourth quarter which included 442,000 net additions, a 26% increase over the prior year.","In addition, we continue to reap the benefits from our ongoing investments to improve customer experience setting all-time best for many key metrics including agent contact rate and first call resolution. We're increasing customer satisfaction and driving unnecessary costs out of the business. All-in, this drove 1.1 million net customer relationship additions in 2019, our best year on record, as well as outstanding EBITDA growth of 7.3% and net cash flow growth of 18% for the full year. Thank you Dave Watson and your incredible team you're doing a phenomenal job.","At NBC, our content continues to resonate with consumers. We were the most watched media company in the U.S. in 2019. NBC ended the 52-week season at number one in the key demo for the sixth consecutive year and Telemundo was number one for the third straight year in weekday prime.","Our film business grew EBITDA by double digits to $833 million making it the third most profitable year in Universal's history, providing further evidence that our strategic slate approach is working.","At Theme Parks, we had a challenging fourth quarter but overall it was a solid year during a particularly competitive period and we are looking forward to new attractions in parks to drive growth in the coming years.","In its first full year as part of Comcast, despite difficult European market conditions, Sky had a good year under Jeremy Darroch and his team, delivering healthy customer additions and 12% EBITDA growth on a constant currency basis.","Our exclusive sports and award winning original content are resonating with our customers in Europe with viewership up year-over-year. Sky has been a great addition year-over-year. Sky has been a great addition to Comcast and positions us to better compete in a world where global scale matters.","As I mentioned at the outset, we have all the pieces in place for long-term success. True to our guiding principles in 2020, we are leaning into investments that further improve our products and experiences across the company.","First, we'll continue to strengthen our already leading position in broadband. At Cable, we are launching our fastest gateway, delivering true multi-gig speeds with unprecedented Wi-Fi range and we're providing our customers with added protection by offering new features like xFi advanced security for free. At Sky, we are building on our success in broadband in the U.K. and Cable's continued success with xFi in the U.S. to launch broadband in Italy this year.","Second, we will focus on the emerging growth areas of streaming and content aggregation by launching Peacock and accelerating our deployment of Flex and Sky Q. Consumers are watching more and more video driven by growth in streaming. And as we highlighted last week, we believe that Peacock a premium ad-supported service hits the mark for both consumers and advertisers.","In this app-driven world, consumers increasingly are overwhelmed by content fragmentation and endless scrolling. So with X1 and Sky Q, we enable our customers to aggregate all their apps and linear channels under TV and seamlessly search access and view all their content.","At Cable, we leveraged X1 to launch our newest service Flex to better serve the segment of our broadband customers that prefer streaming only. Our early results with Flex show that our customers love it. In our first month we could not keep enough inventory and stock and we're deploying Flex as fast as we can.","Based on the proven success we had with X1 in the United States at Sky we're now accelerating the deployment of Sky Q getting to X1 like penetration levels as quickly as possible. This is good for our customers and generates very attractive financial returns.","Finally we have some exciting new investments in our park business. This year we will open Super Nintendo World in Japan with launches in the U.S. to follow in the coming years. Super Nintendo World combines one of a kind ride technology with iconic IP for a remarkable guest experience and we believe it has the potential to drive substantial incremental attendance at Universal Studios, Japan.","On top of that we are also investing for long-term growth with two amazing brand-new parks. We'll open Beijing in 2021, the largest park we have ever built and have started construction on Universal's Epic Universe, a new world-class park in Orlando opening in 2023. The parks business is set up for growth for years to come.","The scale, capabilities and talent across our company enable us to successfully execute our long-term growth strategy while also strengthening our balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. Earlier this morning, we announced that we are raising our dividend by $0.08 for 2020, up 10% over the prior year and our 12th consecutive annual increase.","Before I hand the call over to Mike I want to take a moment to personally recognize Steve Burke, whose contributions have been instrumental in shaping not only my career with the company that we are today. It's impossible for me to overstate what a terrific partner Steve has been.","His leadership first to Comcast cable and later at NBCUniversal have been a critical component of our company's growth and success. And maybe even more significantly his impact on our culture and personal integrity have been truly defining. Steve has built a great team at NBCUniversal led by Jeff Shell and I know we are in good hands going forward. Thank you Steve. Mike over to you.","Mike Cavanagh","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by reviewing our consolidated results on Slides 4 and 5. As a reminder, we completed our acquisition of Sky in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our reported results includes Sky from the acquisition date while pro forma results are as if the Sky transaction had occurred on January 1, 2017.","Revenue increased 2% to $28.4 billion on a reported basis and was consistent with the prior year on a pro forma basis for the fourth quarter. For the full year, revenue increased 15% to $108.9 billion on a reported basis and was consistent with the prior year on a pro forma basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased 3% to $8.4 billion on a reported basis and 2.1% on a pro forma basis for the fourth quarter and increased 14% to $34.3 billion on a reported basis and 5.9% on a pro forma basis for the full year. Adjusted earnings per share increased 9.7% to $0.79 for the quarter and 15% to $3.13 for the year. Finally, free cash flow was $2.5 billion in the quarter and $13.4 billion for the full year.","Now let's turn to our segment results starting with Cable Communications on slide six. For the full year, Cable revenue increased 3.7%, EBITDA increased 7.3% and net cash flow increased 18%. Total customer relationships grew by 1.1 million to 31.5 million, an increase of 3.7% year-over-year. On a per relationship basis, EBITDA grew 3.5% and net cash flow grew 14%. For the fourth quarter, Cable revenue increased 2.6% to $14.8 billion, EBITDA increased 5.4% to $5.9 billion and net cash flow increased 13% to $3.3 billion. We generated 372,000 customer relationship net additions in the quarter, a record for any quarter.","These results reflect our commitment to innovation, execution and driving profitable growth, including our continued focus on our high-margin connectivity businesses, residential high-speed internet and business services. Together residential and business services generated 442, 000 broadband customer net additions in the quarter and 1.4 million net additions for the full year.","In fact, on the residential side of the business, high-speed internet revenue was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth at Cable, growing 8.8% in the fourth quarter and 9.4% for the full year. We believe that our consistent and ongoing investment to extend our leadership in broadband through speed, coverage, control and now streaming, as well as through security and privacy is unique among our competitors and across the industry. We will continue to benefit from the growth in the overall market for broadband and we are taking share with a superior product.","On the business services side, revenue increased 8.8% to $2 billion in the fourth quarter, driven by a 4.1% increase in business customers year-over-year and a 4.3% increase in revenue per business customer, as we've added new products, including WiFi Pro and SecurityEdge.","We ended the year at nearly $8 billion in business services revenue, with an addressable market just in our footprint of approximately $50 billion. There's no shortage of new customers or additional revenue for us to capture in this margin accretive growth business. In 2020, we expect to deliver another year of well over $2 billion in highly margin accretive revenue growth in residential broadband and business services, on top of the $26.5 billion in revenue that we generated from these businesses in 2019.","Turning to video. Video is still valuable for us to attach to our broadband centric customer relationships, but only to the extent that it helps us increase the lifetime value of those relationships. We've consistently said that there is a segment of the market that either doesn't value a traditional pay-TV service or isn't profitable for us to serve. We're not chasing the segment of the market and we saw fewer new connects with these customers.","With the rate adjustments that we are implementing in 2020, as well as the ongoing changes in consumer behavior, we expect higher video subscriber losses this year. Within this environment, our X1 platform enables us to compete well for customers who want the most content and a premium experience, including their favorite streaming apps. And now with Flex, we're able to better serve the customer segment that prefers to stream over-the-top and we are prioritizing Flex as a key initiative in 2020.","Moving on to our wireless business, we continue to be happy with what we're seeing with Xfinity Mobile and its positive impact on the Cable business. We launched Xfinity Mobile two and a half years ago and we ended 2019 with more than two million lines including the 261,000 net adds in the fourth quarter.","We are pleased with the acceleration in net adds in the fourth quarter and we expect this momentum to continue in 2020. Our results to-date indicate that adding mobile improves broadband customer retention and increases prospective customers' consideration. And importantly, we continue to see a significant improvement in the financial performance at Xfinity Mobile. We reduced our quarterly adjusted EBITDA losses at Xfinity Mobile to $116 million, a 40% improvement compared to last year's fourth quarter and we expect Xfinity Mobile to be EBITDA positive for the full year in 2021.","And finally, advertising revenue in the quarter decreased 19.1% due to a comparison to record political spending in the prior year period. Excluding political, advertising revenue in the fourth quarter was consistent with the same period last year.","Moving now to Cable expense and margin on Slide 7, total Cable expenses in the fourth quarter were relatively consistent with the prior year, despite our record growth in customer relationships as we continue to benefit from cost management, our connectivity-centric strategy, and a lack of programming renewals.","On a per customer relationship basis, non-programming OpEx decreased 1.9% compared to the same period last year. We're clearly seeing the benefits of our ongoing focus on operational improvements as we continue to make progress in providing a better overall experience and eliminating unnecessary activity and transactions including through digital service tools. On a full year basis, non-programming OpEx per relationship improved by 2% and we expect continued improvement in 2020.","Cable EBITDA margins were 39.8% in the fourth quarter of 2019, up 100 basis points year-over-year and 40.1% for the full year, up 140 basis points. For 2020, we expect higher programming expense growth due to a number of contracts scheduled for renewal during the year with the increase in expense back-half weighted.","Despite this we expect to improve Cable EBITDA margin by up to 50 basis points for the full year benefiting from growth in our high margin connectivity businesses, continued operational improvements, better performance at Xfinity Mobile, as well as higher political advertising revenue.","We're also pleased with the efficiency of and returns on our Cable capital expenditures. CapEx decreased 10.5% to $6.9 billion for the full year resulting in CapEx intensity of 11.9%, 190 basis points of year-over-year improvement.","Looking ahead, we'll continue to invest in the business to extend our leading market position. However, based on the size and consistency of our past investment and our leading scale, we can continue to improve our capital intensity.","In 2020, we expect approximately 50 basis points of year-over-year improvement, reflecting continued decreases and video-centric CPE spending, partially offset by an increase in the level of investment in our network, consistent with the broader shift in our business towards connectivity. These are demand driven and success based investments and we're happy to make them. In summary, we feel great about Cable's results in 2019 and we're confident that the business will continue to deliver healthy growth in 2020.","Now, I'll turn to NBCUniversal's results on slide 8. NBCUniversal's revenue declined 2.6% to $9.2 billion and EBITDA declined 4.7% to $2 billion in the quarter. Cable Networks revenue increased 1.2% to $2.9 billion and EBITDA declined 1.4% to $1 billion in the fourth quarter as solid growth in advertising and content licensing and other revenue was more than offset by higher programming and production costs and subscriber declines.","Advertising revenue increased 2%, benefiting from the timing of returning series, Golf's Presidents Cup and improved MSNBC performance. Content licensing and other revenue increased 3.4%, reflecting continued timing related licensing comparisons to last year, which was more than offset by the performance of some of our digital businesses.","Distribution revenue was flat year-over-year as the ongoing benefits of previous renewal agreements were largely offset by subscriber losses that modestly accelerated in the quarter. Against the backdrop of continued subscriber declines, it will be tough to grow affiliate revenue until our next round of renewals starting in 2021.","Overall higher revenue in the quarter was more than offset by increased expenses, primarily driven by the timing of programming and a couple of new sports contracts that will continue to impact our first half 2020 results.","Broadcast revenue increased 2.1% to $3.2 billion and EBITDA increased 14% to $471 million driven by growth in retrans and content licensing partially offset by lower advertising revenue.","Advertising revenue declined 1.5%, largely reflecting a difficult comparison to record political advertising last year. Adjusting for this comparison, advertising would have been up low single digits, reflecting strong NFL results and the benefits of higher upfront pricing, partially offset by ratings declines.","Retrans increased over 10% to nearly $500 million bringing the full year total to $2 billion, up about 15% compared to 2018. Content licensing increased 5.8%, reflecting the delivery of content under our existing licensing agreements as well as new licensing deals. Last, we expect to benefit from a profitable Tokyo Olympics this summer and anticipate robust political advertising in the back half of the year.","Turning to film. Revenue declined 21% to $1.6 billion and EBITDA declined by $88 million to $91 million, reflecting a tough comparison to the size and timing of our slate in the fourth quarter of 2018, which included the successful releases of Grinch and Halloween.","Overall, we had a great year in film highlighted by key franchise animated hits including DreamWorks, How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World and Secret Life of Pets 2. The summer spin-off of our temple Fast and Furious franchise, Hobbs & Shaw. Successful original movies, such as Glass and Us, as well as Downton Abbey, which was focused features top title of all time. For the full year, film EBITDA increased 14% to $833 million.","Looking ahead to 2020, we are excited about our film business and outlook for growth, underscored by a continuation of our strategic slate strategy. Keep in mind, the first quarter will have a tough comparison to the release of How To Train Your Dragon but we have several exciting films opening later this year including more animated franchise titles with Trolls World Tour this spring, Minions 2 this summer and Croods 2 at the end of the year along with another summer installment in the Fast and Furious franchise.","Wrapping up the TV and film segments, we are confident and optimistic in our ability to continue monetizing our vast portfolio of new and existing premium content. As we've said before, we will sponsor a broad and varied distribution environment by continuing to license to third-parties when it makes sense and NBCUniversal went benefit from selling to new buyers of content including our very own Peacock.","As we discussed at our investor event last week, we believe that Peacock will be a fantastic product for consumers and advertisers alike and a new channel to better monetize our content. Theme Parks revenue increased 3.2% to $1.6 billion and EBITDA declined 4.5% to $636 million reflecting steady results at our domestic parks, offset by some softness at our Japan park.","Looking ahead, we remain confident in our outlook for growth in the parks business, which will benefit from our robust pipeline of new attractions. At our domestic parks, we'll have a new Jason Borne themed live-action stunt shows and over 2000 hotel rooms coming online in Orlando this year, as well as a Secret life of Pets theme ride in Hollywood. And we're especially excited for the opening of Super Nintendo World at Universal Studios in Japan, which will be opened and ready during the summer coinciding nicely with the Tokyo Olympics.","Pre-opening expenses for this new land in Japan will weigh on results in the first half of 2020 but we expect Super Nintendo World to be a meaningful driver of our parks results in the second half. We're also looking forward to the opening of our park in Beijing in 2021, which will be a major milestone for us and we'll see some pre-opening expenses throughout this year. Even longer term we're excited for Epic Universe, which will transform our already successful Orlando Park.","Now let's move on to Sky results on Slide 9. As a reminder, I will be referring to our pro forma results as if the Sky transaction had occurred on January 1, 2017 and growth rates on a constant currency basis consistent with what's reflected in our earnings release.","Sky revenue increased 1.4% to $5 billion as growth in direct-to-consumer and content revenue was offset by lower advertising. Overall, macro headwinds have persisted but Sky continues to perform well in a challenging environment. Direct-to-consumer revenue increased by 2.3% to $4 billion, driven by growth in customer relationships. Sky added 77,000 customers during the quarter, ending the year with 24 million total customer relationships and average revenue per customer remains stable.","As expected, we delivered improvement in net adds compared to the third quarter. Sky delivered customer growth in all three territories in the fourth quarter and continue to make good progress in growing key products, including broadband and mobile. Content revenue grew by 2.7% to $371 million, with growth driven by the wholesaling of programming.","Importantly, viewership on Sky channels was impressive. In the fourth quarter, total viewership on Sky's branded channels was up 5%, while total TV viewership on non-Sky channels was flat. Viewership across Sky sports channels was up 8%, driven by the performance of Formula 1 in Italy and the Premier League in the U.K.","On advertising, the market remains soft across all of our territories, reflecting continued macro weakness, as well as the impact of a change in legislation related to gambling advertising in the U.K. and Italy, which began impacting our results in 3Q, 2019. Against this backdrop, advertising revenue in the quarter declined by 4.1% to $647 million.","Sky's fourth quarter EBITDA of $765 million was consistent with the prior year, as revenue growth was offset by higher costs, in part driven by our efforts to accelerate the deployment of Sky Q. In 2020, we'll continue the accelerated deployment and we are coming out of the gate quickly.","As a reminder, like X1, Sky Q enabled the aggregation of streaming apps and other advanced features, functionality that's not available on our legacy platform. Our Sky Q customers have higher viewership, better retention levels, better product attachment and higher ARPU and therefore, we want more of our customers to have it and quickly.","We're pleased with the progress Sky is making by delivering growth in customer relationships and creating award-winning popular content. We expect these tailwinds to continue in 2020, but keep in mind, we also expect our results will continue to be impacted by the challenging macroeconomic environment and changes in gambling legislation. All in, before the few hundred million dollars of investment we've previously outlined for Sky Q and broadband in Italy and using today's foreign exchange rates, we expect Sky's 2020 EBITDA to be consistent with our reported 2019 results.","I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on slide 10. We generated a record $13.4 billion in free cash flow and paid $3.7 billion in dividends to our shareholders in 2019. We also made great progress in leveraging, ending the year at 2.8 times net leverage down from 3.3 times at the end of 2018. Deleveraging will remain a top focus for us in 2020, which we will balance with the key investment priorities we have outlined across Cable, NBCUniversal and Sky.","On return of capital, as Brian mentioned, we raised our dividend by $0.80 to $0.92 a share, a 10% increase, marking our 12th consecutive annual increase. And in 2021, we expect that we will be well positioned to resume share repurchases. In summary, 2019 was another fantastic year for Comcast and the fundamentals of our business remains strong. We feel good about our outlook for 2020 and expect our overall performance to accelerate through the year.","Jason over to you.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks, Mike. Let's open up the call for Q&A please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ben Swinburne","Thanks. Good morning. Two questions. Brian you mentioned in your prepared remarks sort of the benefits of global scale across the company. And I think there's certainly a debate in the market about that a bit. So, I was curious if you could sort of touch on it in two ways. One, how does this scale out Comcast to grow faster over time? Obviously, we've seen some very strong results across the company recently, but I'd love to get more thoughts from you on how that plays out?","And secondly, how do you assess sort of the optimal level of scale? I'm sure there's a lot of interest from shareholders about where you think about future acquisition opportunities? Or how you think about deploying capital longer term?","And then while you think about that Mike you mentioned some comments about free cash flow at a conference last year. Comcast delivers pretty consistent double-digit earnings growth and you've raised the dividend consistently double-digits. Should free cash flow over time generally follow earnings and the overall dividend growth? Because obviously you guys are in a pretty heavy investment year this year and I think people are obviously interested in the free cash flow profile over time. Thank you. Thank you, both.","Brian Roberts","Well, let me begin. Thank you, Ben. I do think we have consistent growth across all parts of the business Sky was a unique asset. And I don't want to look backwards more than just for a moment here to your question. And I think it happened. I'm really thrilled we bought it. I feel better about that decision today the nature of our company; we displayed a great technical team at the Peacock Day, the ability for Cable to help with broadband, Jason going over to be CFO. The gentleman running Germany, who is our Head of Strategy there's -- it's -- we're a better company. And it's a longer conversation, happy to have it.","But I think the essence of your question if I might -- might be well do you feel you have to go to other countries and what are you thinking about? And one of the points we tried to make throughout this year is that if you take the four countries; U.S. plus the three principal U.K., Germany, and Italy where Sky principally operates, that represents 50% of the world's broadband and video revenues and that's pretty extraordinary.","So, our strategy with now $60 million or $55 million or so relationships and growing those relationships and we had a great year in growing customer relationships with a terrific ARPU north of $100 these are exceptional opportunities. So, I don't want to say we won't look at other things and consider other things but it's -- there was nothing quite like Sky. It was unique. Mike?","Mike Cavanagh","So, Ben on free cash flow, it's certainly our stated objective and belief that we can healthy -- get healthy growth of free cash flow over the long-term. Said that before at the recent conference and continue to believe that's the case. We don't focus on it on -- in the near-term and this year coming up obviously we talked about the many investments in organic growth that will benefit that long-term free cash flow growth trajectory.","So, we'll have that pressure in some Olympics working capital in 2020. But the dividend increase is absolutely an indication that we feel very confident in the long-term growth trajectory of free cash flow.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you, guys.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks, Ben. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of the Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Doug Mitchelson","Thanks so much. I wanted to focus on streaming so both Flex and Peacock. For Mike or Dave with -- Mike, you talked about prioritizing Flex in 2020, sort of, what specifically does that mean? And for you both what's your vision as to what that service will look like in a few years? And I guess I'm thinking not just your everything that you bring to bear but also third-party apps and how they're authenticated integrated into Flex as well?","And then for Steve on Peacock, I think the Peacock Analyst Day was well received but I'm getting the question a lot as to what the difference will be between the premium and free tiers? And I'm also getting the question that if it's free what would the friction be signing up other distributors other than Cox? Thank you all.","Dave Watson","Hey Doug this is Dave. So let me start with Flex. And I think Flex shows and in particular the Flex and Peacock combination just shows how uniquely positioned we are for streaming. And Flex is a natural extension of two things; our broadband innovation and also the fact that we've been investing steadily in X1.","So we're -- Flex is going to help fuel broadband over time. Comes with it's free as Brian has said and we'll continue to innovate around broadband. So you look at what's coming up. And we have tons of apps that are available right now. We're pleased with the road map ahead, good progress coming up for Flex in terms of content, Hulu, we talked about CBS All Access we'll be the first to do that.","But we in particular we're really excited about the prospects of Flex and Peacock together. So that's -- that is I think a real opportunity. In addition down the road and of course the main consideration is broadband growth with Flex. But I think it opens up other opportunities whether it's app participation or -- and\/or advertising. It's a great long-term platform for us.","Mike Cavanagh","So if you include Dave's broadband business plus Flex and Peacock, I think our company is better positioned as the world moves to streaming than any other company in the world. And I think you could argue in the next 10 or 20 years, if you look at all those three businesses combined, we could make more money in streaming than anyone else by a lot.","If you then move to Peacock, the idea behind Peacock and Matt Strauss mentioned Spotify. It's a little bit like Spotify. We have an entry level of Peacock, which is about 7,500 hours, which is completely free for anyone. We then have a 15,000 hour version of Peacock that costs $5 if you're not a member of a participating cable or satellite company that provides multi-channel video. That universe is still about 80%. So 80% of the people in America I think eventually are going to be able to get that $5 product for free.","As to your question about other cable companies and satellite companies it's such a great value to be able to give all of your customers a product that's $5 a month in value or $60 a year for free that I think eventually we will get the vast majority if not all of cable and satellite it will take some time. And a lot of times the Peacock discussion will be tied to the ongoing MVPD discussion and we have a lot of big deals up in this year. But I think by the end of this year, you're going to see the $5 Peacock product be offered for free to a lot of cable and satellite customers.","Doug Mitchelson","Thank you both.","Jason Armstrong","Thank you, Doug. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jessica Ehrlich with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Jessica Ehrlich","Thanks. I have I guess three questions for the three divisions. On Peacock, can you talk a little bit about how you see \u2013 what will the impact be on your legacy businesses including TV stations, Cable Networks and I guess other Comcast businesses? Going back to Flex, it's such an interesting product. You're keeping customers engaged on the Comcast platform. Can you talk about a little bit more detail about what the benefits would be for I mean, it seems like there might be benefits for advertising as well as other parts of your business?","And then on Sky this $300 million or so step-up in investment, can you talk about how that will drive growth in the various businesses in 2020 and beyond? If there's anything more specific you can say about growth? That would be great.","Brian Roberts","Let me start with Peacock's effect on the other businesses. If you imagine a television show where 70% of the viewing comes from some place other than linear television. What Peacock is designed to do is to go after that 70% get it on our platform in a place where we're ad-supported and we get 100% of the ad revenue. That's the intent.","And if you look at it from that perspective, I think Peacock is going to be very good for our company. We're going to make more money from the television ecosystem and that will allow us to continue to invest in the linear platform. So if I were talking to an affiliate, if I were talking to a cable company, I would say Peacock is a way to make us a better stronger competitor in a way that's good for all of our businesses not just streaming.","Mike Cavanagh","So in regards to Flex, Jessica, the \u2013 it starts with our strategy. And I think it gives us real choice in the marketplace. And we will continue to compete I think very well for the many segments that value X1 and everything that that brings. But for this growing streaming segment, it really positions us well.","It's a great proposition being able to use all the attributes of X1, the voice capability, the integrated data being able to find what you want very quickly. So in terms of the drivers, your point is a good one. You look at the first one is going to help us compete \u2013 continue to do well with broadband. So we're going to look at broadband share growth and Flex will be part of that one of several things that we're doing.","You do look at additional revenue opportunities, whether it's everything from the \u2013 when we sell an app on this platform we participate in that economically. There is going to be a long-term a platform. You can think about advertising. And in addition there's syndication. We have great partners that we have with X1. And I would anticipate that we'll continue to make progress in syndication with Flex with these partners.","So I think it's \u2013 we will use it as a growth platform primarily focused on broadband but we'll be opportunistic going forward in these other areas?","Dave Watson","Yes, sorry. And then on Sky, the investments we're making here. So Sky Q look we think that's the best TV service here in Europe. So we want to accelerate its penetration in our base. We're actually pulling costs forward really rather than spending additional cost \u2013 pulling costs for in our plan to get Sky Q penetration more quickly.","The benefit is really a twofold the short-term benefits or purely financial really. As Mike alluded to we see lower churn, higher viewing, higher ARPU. And of course as we sell Sky Q into our customer base basically gives us the opportunity to cross-sell another product or more products at the point in which we do that.","And then the second thing to say is, we had Sky Q in the base now for some \u2013 good line of sight in terms of the financial returns that flow from those investments and whilst the number aggregate, so it's all customer by customer. So if you don't get the customer from the \u2013 if you look at the benefits, you don't get -- you don't spend the cost up front. If you see what I mean.","The second one that is broadband in Italy. Obviously, that's a big new adjacent category for us, about a $7 billion market in Italy. We've got a very strong and credible brand. We know that, in Italy, to step into the broadband market. I think, we've got all the skills that we need across the company to be able to do that.","The longer-term investment profile, a very strong one again, given that it's a new category. And then, beyond that, I think, the real benefit, as we've seen here in the U.K. is that's a business that we think we can grow the significant scale over time. It was probably the single biggest thing we did in the U.K. to step change our business growth in the U.K. So I think the tail of growth we'll see from broadband and the ability for broadband to reset the size of our business in Italy is pretty strong.","And then, the final thing I'd say, just operating in Europe. One of the great things about being part of the broader Comcast group, from my point of view, is of course we can keep our foot on the gas and accelerate these investments while we see strong returns profiles at a time when many in Europe are probably being a bit more cautious in a more challenging consumer environment. So, I think, this is a good example of how, as part of the broader group we can really think about the medium-term returns from Sky and drive those hard. And we'll see those benefits progressively come through in 2020 then into 2021.","Jessica Ehrlich","Thank you.","Jason Armstrong","Thank you, Jessica. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John Hodulik","Great, thanks. Maybe some questions for Dave. Dave, you've had some solid results this quarter and this year in your connectivity businesses, maybe first starting with broadband. The 1.4 million subs accelerated second time in a row on a year-over-year basis. Is that a decent number for 2020?","And can you talk a little bit about the pricing power that you may have in that business, given that the deceleration we're seeing in high-speed data revenues. And then, over in wireless, again, another solid quarter. You talked about momentum continuing into 2020. What's driving the growth there? Is it improved distribution? Is it handset availability? I think your pricing has been the same, but the sub numbers continue to beat our view. So some commentary there would be great too. Thanks.","Dave Watson","Well, thanks John. And I won't give the specifics in regards to 2020. But I would say that the $1.4 million does demonstrate just consistency, broad-based growth strength across our entire area when it comes to broadband. So, pleased with the quarter, pleased with the year and pleased with momentum going forward.","So, yeah, it starts with that we're going to grow relationships with broadband. This is our top priority. It's what we focus on when it comes to innovation. I talked about Flex that we have many other examples of innovation, including the advanced security product that we are rolling out for free to those that lease our gateway device. Another example of that, speed increases we continue to do.","So very, very focused. We wake up every day thinking about how are we going to grow and sustain broadband. And so \u2013 and it's working. I think xFi, when you combine the best of speed, the best of control, coverage, Brian mentioned a great new gateway device. We're leading in regards to the gateway devices that are in the marketplace. We feel in terms of the combination of speed, Wi-Fi speed and Wi-Fi coverage and combine that with the pods that we have in the marketplace. So all these things, I think, position us well going forward. So, our game plan is to continue to lead with broadband. I think it is very sustainable. You look at the macro conditions the marketplace is growing. On penetration we have upside and we're taking share. So, -- and we're balancing this share growth with strong financial performance. For the year, we're pleased. One point in terms of the quarter-to-quarter revenue performance just to make sure there's some context there that we did move out a couple of rate increases of Q4 into the early part of 2020.","So, if you look on a go-forward basis, I think you're going to see good strong runway for growth in share, growth in revenue on a per subscriber basis and for the whole category. So, real pleased with our momentum going forward.","In Wireless I would say the keys there are a little bit of maturity. We talked about the reasons why we're doing it. We're real pleased with broadband retention. The area that's beginning to pick up that we're really pleased that we wanted to focus on is just growing consideration using wireless because I think it does help broadband. But getting people into retail stores they didn't really think about doing that think about doing that before beginning to see real traction in retail.","Most certainly when you see a solid product introduction like Apple that they had in other wireless devices, I think we benefit. We're in a good position for bringing your own device. I think we're uniquely positioned in the ability to have a combination of unlimited and by the gig pricing, so you add all those things up and we're really pleased with our overall wireless momentum as well.","John Hodulik","Okay. Thanks Dave.","Dave Watson","Thank you, John. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brett Feldman","Thanks. Actually I'm going to follow-up here on Wireless. Two questions. One the big national auditors are going to be increasingly making 5G a part of their marketing throughout the year. I'm interested if you can give us some context on how you're thinking about the 5G opportunity for your mobile business?","And then obviously the lines that you have to EBITDA breakeven next year is a key milestone. How do you think about maybe improving the profit profile of your wireless business even more from there? So for example how much of a priority if at all? Is it to get better MVNO terms or find more MVNO vendors?","And then you're going to have a few mid-band spectrum auctions coming up over the next couple of months and into next year. Are you interested in maybe looking to acquire spectrum to see if you can bring traffic onto your own infrastructure? Thank you.","Brian Roberts","Well thanks Brett. So, in regards to 5G, one of the great things about our existing relationship that we have with our partner that we have we will participate in 5G mobile as that market matures and they've start rolling it out in earnest. So, we're -- I think we'll be right there. And we'll evaluate that as it goes.","In regards to economics, we talked about -- we're right on track with the profitability trajectory that we talked about. So, we're absolutely pulling off what we thought we would in regards to the economics. And what I would say we're always going to be opportunistic when it comes to either a combination of the ability to do more with Wi-Fi and the LTE network and manage traffic flow between the two, we'll always be looking at that. We'll be opportunistic on any spectrum opportunity. But we like our capital-light MVNO approach today. It's accomplishing what we need to. We'll always be talking to our partner about opportunities, but I think we're in a really good position going forward.","Brett Feldman","Thank you.","Jason Armstrong","Thank you, Brett. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Phil Cusick","Hi, guys. Thanks. Cable EBITDA margin guide of 50 basis points growth is similar to what you said a year ago and it came in nearly three times that level. If I think about your price increase, which is similar to last year and the trajectory of declining mobile losses, it seems like this is fairly conservative. How should we think about programming as a headwind this year and next or anything else going on?","And then second if I can in Parks, can you talk about the environment for customer traffic overall? And any feel for share shift? And if we look forward to those new gates and parts in the next few years what should we think about for the cadence of both CapEx and revenue? Thank you.","Brian Roberts","Phil, I'll start off. As Mike mentioned earlier, as expected we're going to have a number of programming renewals in 2020. So we had a couple of years where it was a lower number and that is picking up in 2020. And in particular it will ramp more towards the back half of 2020. So despite that the part -- even with that, we expect to improve Cable margins up to the 50 basis points that Mike talked about for the full year. And the strategy and the expectations are built around our focus on the connectivity businesses, which are margin accretive. We're going to continue to drive that that pivot has happened and we're making great progress there.","We're going to continue to focus on the non-programming OpEx. We're going to be taking a lot of transactions out whether they're truck rolls or telephone calls, the customer experience improvement there's a big runway ahead for us to continue to take out those transactions. We're always going to be disciplined on cost control.","And I think you look at what we talked about earlier, Xfinity Mobile economic improvements. If you look there's going to be a pretty big year for political advertising, the tail end of this year all those things considered I think put us in a pretty good position to overcome whatever programming renewals that are going to occur in 2020.","So regarding parks if you look over the last five years, our EBITDA or OCF and the park business has almost exactly doubled, so about $2.5 billion as the parks are about one-third of NBCUniversal, 30% of NBCUniversal. And when you have that kind of growth you're used to parks being a driver of the overall NBCUniversal growth profile, which they were not this quarter. A big part of it and Mike mentioned this in his introduction was Japan where we faced a number of headwinds and actually went backwards.","If you look out, I think the next big thing on the horizon is Nintendo. Nintendo based on our research is one of the biggest potential drivers of attendance that you could have of any kind of IP. It's up there with Harry Potter, which in some of our parks Harry potter drove incremental attendance of about two million people. So Nintendo is in very rarefied air. And the attraction that we're building in Osaka is spectacular.","From a creative standpoint it's really unbelievable and that opens sometime -- midyear this year and then we're going to bring it to Hollywood and we're going to bring it, obviously, in the fourth gate in Florida. So I think Nintendo is going to be potentially a big accelerator both in the Theme Park business. And then once you get into 2021, we've haven't talked about it maybe as much as we should.","The fact that we're opening a park in Beijing and the fact that the park is so spectacular from a design and creative standpoint, I think is going to generate a lot of growth. And then Brian mentioned in his introduction the fourth gate, which opens in 2023.","So when you look at the capital side of it, these are all high-return projects that all make a ton of business sense. And I think if you look over the next five years it's likely our Theme Park business is going to be a driver of growth. Maybe not quite as much as it has been in the last five years because the growth has been so phenomenal and we're getting to a bigger base now. But I would look at the parks business as a real opportunity for us. We still don't have the share that I think we deserve given the quality of the experience we're giving our guests and it's a lot of opportunity over the next five, 10, 20 years.","Phil Cusick","Thank you.","Jason Armstrong","Thank you, Phil. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Craig Moffett","Hi. I wonder if I could return to the wireless business for a second. With AT&T having potentially open the door to at least have a discussion about MVNO terms, can you just talk about what that process is like? Are you engaged in discussions with other potential MVNO suppliers? And have any of the discussions with any of the wireless operators expanded to ways that they might leverage your wired infrastructure.","So as you think about how your wired infrastructure sort of brings value to wireless, there are all different ways you could do it, whether it's capitalizing yourself through retail or doing something at a wholesale level or using it to get better terms with your MVNO. Just how do you think about those opportunities?","Mike Cavanagh","Hey, Craig, so I think it starts with \u2013 that our very strong feeling that we are \u2013 the cable industry, Comcast we're a great partner for the wireless industry. So I think we bring share. We bring customers over to them. I think we're a great investment for the long term. So that's kind of how we start our thinking and that all the goals that I mentioned before.","From a process perspective, not much to talk about right now. We are always thinking about ways of improving an already good platform, a good approach to the business. If there are opportunities we'll explore them. And if anything does develop we'll let you know.","Brian Roberts","Yes. The only thing I want to add to that is simply that I think we've shown we can get some scale it's still early days. And that previous question about it keeps accelerating a bit. I think we're seeing that now throughout the rest of the industry and others coming into wireless. So I think I just want to echo that point that we have a successful beginning and hopefully a very long runway that we're just getting started.","Craig Moffett","Thank you.","Jason Armstrong","Thank you, Craig. Regina, we will take one last question.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Vijay Jayant","Thanks. I have two, one for Jeremy. Just wanted to understand in the U.K. Ofcom is pushing to reduce what I think they dubbed as the loyalty penalty, the difference between what new customers pay and what existing out of contract customers pay. Is there really any impact to your business from that regulation?","And then for Dave, at CES, I think you guys showed a new xFi advanced gateway that supports 85 megahertz mid-split, really increasing the upstream part of your network. Obviously, I just want to understand, what business opportunity and CapEx implications that may have as you scale there? Thank you.","Dave Watson","Jeremy, do you want to go first?","Jeremy Darroch","Sure. I think, not majorly for us. If you think of our business, we've really, I think, led the way over the last decade, really, around breaking out \u2013 breaking down the bundle, making pricing more transparent. We're a leader in service. According to Ofcom starts across all of our products, so not just pay-TV, but broadband and mobile and fixed line as well.","At the heart of that, we have a belief about trying to right-size customers to the products that they want and the price that they want to pay, because we think that's important and is the most durable way. And typically, therefore, we moved a long time ago to essentially offering the same deals right across our bases to deal for new customers typically available for an existing customer as well.","So there'll be some transition, obviously, within that, maybe some \u2013 there's been noise as the market quickly moved to that, but I don't expect it would have a big effect on our business.","Dave Watson","On the new gateway that we did talk about at CES, we're excited about this. I think, there are several steps forward with this gateway, in regards WiFi speed, the improvements in terms of coverage, both for the 2.4 band as well as the 5 band improvements, both in those areas, improvements in latency.","Across the board, it checks a lot of boxes. And so, like we do with a great new product like this, we'll package that in some of our higher tier packages. And on a go-forward basis, we'll compete. If you think about segments where this matters, it's an ideal product for the gaming segment. So, we're going to \u2013 we'll segment it and go after it. But, like the fundamentals of being able to provide the best speed, the best coverage, control, all those aspects, I think, this gateway helps us in our position very well.","Vijay Jayant","Yeah. Thanks a lot.","Mike Cavanagh","And let me just jump back in at the end here and echo Brian's. Thanks to Jason Armstrong for a great job he's done for all of us in the IR job and I know it will be a great add to the Sky team. I welcome Marci Ryvicker to the company and thank all of you for the support and joining us on this call as we get 2020 kicked off. So, thanks everybody.

This is a really special moment for our company with a number of exciting developments to tell you about today.","We are reporting strong results for the fourth quarter and the full-year 2012, accelerating the acquisition of GE\u2019s equity interest in NBC\u2019s Universal and demonstrating confidence and optimism in the future of all our businesses by increasing our dividend 20%, announcing our plan to repurchase $2 billion of our stock during 2013.","Let me begin with our strong financial results for both the fourth quarter and the full year which highlight our momentum and how we\u2019re benefitting from scale and from our focus on operational excellence.","These results demonstrate that our investments for growth and strategic differentiation, particularly in programming, technology and in new products, are helping us lead in innovation and strengthening our position in the market.  Michael will discuss the results in more detail but I want to provide a few highlights.","Let me start with cable, which capped accelerating performance throughout the year with a strong fourth quarter.","Every part of the cable business showed strength with revenue increases in all our residential products, business services and in advertising.  High speed internet led the way in both revenue and subscriber growth.  We added 1.2 million HIS customers in 2012, a 6% increase for the seventh year in a row of more than 1 million customer additions.","In video, we extended the trend of improving subscriber and revenue results.  The fourth quarter was the ninth quarter in a row of year-over-year improvement in video subscribers and we expect that excluding the impact of Hurricane Sandy we added subscribers in the fourth quarter.","Just as important, video revenue growth of 2.9% in the fourth quarter was the highest in four years.","Our triple play offering is driving a rebound in voice with strong customer growth in the fourth quarter and we reached a milestone of 10 million voice customers early this new year.","Last but certainly not least, business services was again the second largest contributor to cable\u2019s growth as it continues to expand its services to small businesses and its presence in the mid-size market.","So it\u2019s been a fantastic 2012 for cable and a great fourth quarter.  The XFINITY brand is taking hold and we\u2019re making steady headway in customer service and the cable team is delivering consistent and first rate operating performance.  Neil Smit is doing a fabulous job and so is his team.","Similarly, at NBCUniversal, Steve Burke and the NBCUniversal folks have had a very successful year.  NBCUniversal\u2019s 2012 results highlight in particular the improving performance of our broadcast businesses.","NBC\u201ds primetime performance this fall has been improving.  While we recognize it\u2019s early in the turnaround, this is driving a big swing in momentum which should continue to help the network.","Our cable networks continue to drive NBC Universal\u2019s profitability and there were some real highlights there too. \u00a0USA remained the highest-rated cable entertainment network for the seventh year in a row, Bravo had its seventh consecutive best year ever, and we also completed rebrands at E! and Style, and in terms of rating, Golf, Mundos, and MSNBC were three of the five fastest-growing channels on television all of last year. \u00a0NBC Universal\u2019s 2012 results also included stronger box office performance in film and outstanding results at the theme parks. So let me talk about now our future, since we\u2019re excited about our businesses and are going to continue to invest to reinforce our differentiation and to drive growth. \u00a0High-speed internet and business services continue to be the drivers for cable, and in 2013, we are investing to increase the speed once again of our high-speed internet services and to expand the deployment of wireless gateways that deliver the fastest in-home service and power the growing number of wirelessly connected devices in our customers\u2019 homes.We are also extending our network to business-rich areas to continue to gain share in small businesses and medium-sized businesses and to expand our Metro E products. \u00a0Our Xfinity Home service has exciting growth potential too. \u00a0It is now available across the entire footprint, and while it\u2019s still early and the numbers are relatively small, Xfinity Home is attracting new customers and working well as the fourth product in some of the bundles. \u00a076% of our Xfinity home customers are Quad Play, 22% are new to Comcast, and of those, 73% come in buying all four products. In 2012, we rolled out our first X1 service, our cloud-based, interactive guide and user interface, in six markets. \u00a0This year, we will expand the rollout of X1 to the majority of our footprint, and you\u2019ll also begin to see X1 more as a platform as we enable cloud-delivered applications to our customers.At NBC Universal, the Universal theme parks have been a real standout, and we see great potential in the years ahead. \u00a0And so we\u2019re investing in new attractions to continue to transform our parks into more must-visit destinations. \u00a0The new \u201cTransformers\u201d ride was an enormous success at Universal Studios Hollywood this past year, and we\u2019ll be opening in Orlando in 2013. \u00a0And we\u2019re expanding the hugely successful \u201cHarry Potter\u201d attraction, including working on bringing it to Hollywood.Now let\u2019s discuss the announcements we made last night regarding our acquisition of GE\u2019s existing 49% equity interest in NBC Universal. \u00a0Two years in, the strategic rationale for bringing together our content and distribution businesses and the opportunities for growth and value-creation available at NBC Universal are even stronger and better than we first anticipated. \u00a0We\u2019ve been hard at work inside these businesses for the last two years, and now have the knowledge and confidence to accelerate the buyout of GE.In effect, we\u2019re buying stock in our own company, and investing in businesses that we know well. \u00a0Our programming investments are beginning to pay off, driving strong early results at NBC broadcast network and a turnaround in ratings and financial performance at our local stations. We also successfully integrated the Comcast cable channels and regional sports networks and we\u2019re investing across our cable networks to strengthen the brands and to reinforce the value. \u00a0As a result, we are beginning to see improved affiliate fees for the cable channels and the benefits of retransmission consent fees for NBC and Telemundo. \u00a0We have achieved strong growth across the theme parks, and we\u2019re also reinvigorating our franchises in the film business. Finally, we\u2019ve demonstrated real value when we bring together our content and distribution businesses to support important initiatives for the whole company. We call that project \u201cSymphony,\u201d and whether you look at the success of \u201cThe Lorax\u201d or \u201cThe Voice,\u201d or in particular last year\u2019s Olympics, many of these successes were amplified because of our Symphony approach.So we\u2019re really pleased with the transition, have a great management team in place, and strong momentum, and we\u2019re bullish about NBC Universal\u2019s future.","This is also a good time to complete the acquisition since we are able to fund it through a combination of cash from operations, proceeds from the sale of non-strategic assets plus attractively priced public debt and seller financing from General Electric.","We now have a simplified structure and balance sheet and our goal is to continue to strengthen this balance sheet and achieve even stronger credit ratings over time while we continue to provide a sustainable return of capital to shareholders.","I believe we are uniquely positioned with great businesses and real opportunities for growth and aim to continue to strengthen our company.  As we start 2013, we have real momentum and we\u2019re maintaining our focus on execution and disciplined investment to build in each and every one of these exciting businesses.","Let me now pass it to Michael to cover the results and the transaction in greater detail.","Michael Angelakis","Good morning and thank you, Brian.  There is quite a bit to review today, including the NBCUniversal transaction and our 2013 financial strategy but I think most important is our strong operational performance and positive momentum in the fourth quarter and for all of 2012.","As Brian mentioned, we are very pleased with our results on Slide 4, which reflect sustainable and profitable growth and the fundamental strength of our businesses.","For the full year, consolidated revenue increased 12% to $62.6 billion and operating cash flow increased 9% to $20 billion, reflecting strong organic growth in both our cable communications and NBCUniversal businesses.","Free cash flow for the full year, which excludes the impact of the economic stimulus, increased 13% to $7.9 billion primarily reflecting growth in operating cash flow and improvements in working capital partially offset by higher cash taxes and capital expenditures.","Free cash flow per share increased 16% to $2.92 per share in 2012.  For the year, our cable free cash flow generated $6.2 billion or 78% of the total while NBCUniversal contributed $1.7 billion or 22% of consolidated free cash flow.","Earnings per share grew 52% to $2.28 per share for the full year from $1.50 per share in 2011.  Excluding gains from the SpectrumCo and A&E transactions, an income tax benefit resulting from a state tax law change in 2012, an NBCUniversal transaction and related costs and other non-recurring items in 2011, our adjusted earnings per share increased 22% to $1.93 per share.","Now, let\u2019s review the Pro Forma results of our cable communications and NBCUniversal businesses on Slide 5.","As you know, we believe the Pro Forma presentation provides a more meaningful comparison of the operating performances and businesses.  The Pro Forma results are only necessary for the full year and are presented as if NBCUniversal and the Universal Orlando transactions were both effective on January 1, 2010.","For the fourth quarter of 2012, consolidated revenue increased 6% to $15.9 billion and consolidated operating cash flow increased 7% to $5.3 billion.  Fourth quarter results reflect cable communication\u2019s revenue increase of 7% to $10.1 billion driven by growth in hi-speed internet, business services, video and advertising.  Cable operating cash flow also increased 7% to $4.2 billion.","At NBCUniversal, fourth quarter revenue increased 5% to $6 billion and operating cash flow increased 11% to $1.2 billion driven by strong results at our broadcast business.","For the full year of 2012, consolidated Pro Forma revenue increased 8.5% to $62.6 billion reflecting the inclusion of $1.2 billion of revenue generated by the Olympics and $259 million of revenue from the Super Bowl.","Excluding the Super Bowl and the Olympics, full-year consolidated Pro Forma revenue increased 6%.","Consolidated Pro Forma operating cash flow increased 7% to $20 billion including $120 million of operating cash flow from the Olympics.  Excluding the Olympics, the full-year consolidated operating cash flow increased 6%.","Cable communications revenue increased 6% to $39.6 billion for the full year and represented 63% of our consolidated revenue while cable operating cash flow grew 6% to $16.3 billion and represented 81% of consolidated operating cash flow.","For the full year, NBCUniversal revenue increased 13% to $23.8 billion and operating cash flow increased 9% to $4.1 billion.  Again, excluding the results of the Super Bowl and the Olympics, NBCUniversal revenue and operating cash flow increased 6% respectively.  Please refer to Slide 6 and we will review cable communication\u2019s results in a bit more detail.","For 2012, cable communications reported another year of strong financial results in customer growth with substantial year-over-year improvements reflecting growth in our residential businesses, continued strength in our business services and increased advertising revenue driven by political.","Contributing to cable\u2019s growth are rate adjustments, new customer additions and an increasing number of customers taking multiple products.","At the end of the fourth quarter, 75% of our video customers took at least two products and 40% took all three services compared to 37% in the fourth quarter of last year.  As a result, total revenue per video customer increased 9% to $154 per month in the fourth quarter.","We continued to experience real strength in our customer metrics.  In the fourth quarter we added 503,000 total video, hi-speed internet and voice customers, an 8% increase in net customer additions over last year\u2019s fourth quarter.","For the year, we added 1.5 million total customers, a 5% increase in net customer additions compared to 2011.","In the fourth quarter, even with the negative impact of Candy, we reduced video losses by 60% reporting a loss of only 7000 video customers compared to the 17,000 video customer losses in last year\u2019s fourth quarter.","And for the full year, we reduced video losses by more than 25% over 2011 as we continue to execute with improved products and customer support.","Video revenue increased 3% for the fourth quarter and 2.5% for the full year reflecting rate adjustments and a higher number of customers taking advanced services.","In addition to our improved video results, our hi-speed internet business performed well as we added 341,000 new customers in the fourth quarter and 1.2 million customers during the year.","Hi-speed internet revenue was, again, the largest contributor to cable revenue growth as revenue increased 9% for both the fourth quarter and for the full year, reflecting rate adjustments, continued growth in our customer base and 29% of our customers now receiving higher tier services.","With regard to voice, revenue increased 1% in the fourth quarter and 1.5% for the full year reflecting continued growth in our customer base.  We added 168,000 voice customers, a 15% increase in the fourth quarter and 613,000 customers in the full year.","Our voice penetration is now with 19% of homes past and our customer results improved throughout 2012 as we increased the number of triple play customers.","The momentum in business services continues with revenue increased 32% in the fourth quarter and 34% for the full year for total revenue of $2.4 billion 2012.","The small end of the market or businesses with less than 20 employees continues to be the primary driver of growth and accounted for 85% of business services revenue in 2012.","The mid-size business is established and growing rapidly and now represents almost 15% of this group\u2019s revenue.  As I mentioned, cable advertising also performed well in the fourth quarter with revenue increasing 19% and full-year revenue increasing 14%, including political revenue of $131 million in the fourth quarter and $239 million in the full year.  Please move to Slide 7.","In the fourth quarter, cable communication\u2019s operating cash flow increased 7% to $4.2 billion and full-year operating cash flow increased 6% to $16.3 billion resulting in stable margins for the quarter and the year.","During 2012, total expenses in cable increased 6%, driven primarily by three pressures, two of which we control and have positive ROIs.  First, we are absorbing expenses as we offer and expand new products like XFINITY Home and Signature Support.","Secondly, we have been increasing our sales and marketing spend in media, direct sales and new marketing channels to more effectively target customers and enhance our competitive positioning in both our residential and commercial segments. \u00a0These increased marketing efforts have had a positive impact on our core customer metrics. \u00a0Finally, programming expenses increased 7% in 2012, reflecting higher rates and an increase in the amount of content we provide to consumers across multiple platforms.As we look to 2013, we expect programming expenses to increase at low double digit rates, driven by several factors including the continued expansion of rights to multiple platforms, additional channel launches, continuing increase in sports cost, meaningful increases for retransmission consent fees, and step-ups for recently completed long term agreements.We have appropriately planned for these programming expense increases, and are confident we can effectively offset these costs through modest rate adjustments, further efficiencies, and improving product mix, as well as increasing the number of customers upgrading to higher tiers of service. \u00a0As a result, we expect to maintain relatively stable margins. In addition, we remain very focused and believe we can continue to gain further efficiencies in our customer service and technical operations. \u00a0In 2012, we reduced our activity levels by more than 4.5 million truck rolls and by 16 million agent calls handled in our call centers, even as we added 1.5 million total new customers. Our service is improving, and customers continue to elect self-installations, which accounted for 36% of our total installations at year end 2012, compared to 21% at year end 2011. \u00a0In addition, we now have 27% of our customers managing their accounts online. All these improvements reflect the innovative efforts we are making to increase customer satisfaction by giving our customers more choice and control, which results in lower activity levels for our cable operations. Overall, our Xfinity brand is building momentum, and cable\u2019s performance in 2012 clearly demonstrates that we are executing well and competing effectively with our improved products and services. \u00a0Please refer to slide 8 so that we can review our pro forma results for the segments of NBC Universal.For the fourth quarter, NBC Universal\u2019s revenue increased 5% and operating cash flow increased 11% as it was a strong fourth quarter that ended a solid performance in 2012. \u00a0For the full year 2012, NBC Universal revenue increased 13%, and operating cash flow increased 9%. These strong results was primarily driven by the success of the Super Bowl and the Olympics during the year. \u00a0Excluding any impact from these two events, NBC Universal revenue and operating cash flow each increased 6%, which was driven by strong results at broadcast television and theme parks, as well as solid results at filmed entertainment and cable networks. As we review the pro forma results of the individual segments in 2012, cable networks generated revenue of $8.8 billion, an increase of 3%, driven by a 5% increase in distribution revenue and a 2% increase in advertising revenue, as weaker ratings were more than offset by higher pricing.In the fourth quarter, distribution revenue increased 2.5%, but was negatively impacted by the NHL lockout. \u00a0Cable networks operating cash flow declined 1% to $3.3 billion, primarily reflecting higher programming and production costs, due to our continued investment in increased original programming. \u00a0In addition, we experienced higher sports programming costs, mostly driven by more NBA games in 2012 compared to 2011, due to the lockout. With regard to our broadcast segment, full year revenue increased 27% to $8.2 billion, reflecting the inclusion of $1.2 billion of revenue generated by the Olympics and $259 million of revenue from the Super Bowl. \u00a0Excluding the impact of both the Olympics and Super Bowl, broadcast revenue increased 5%, reflecting the strong primetime ratings at the NBC broadcast network and over $100 million of political revenue at the owned local stations. \u00a0This was partially offset by lower content licensing revenue from a library content agreement signed in 2011. Full year 2012 broadcast operating cash flow increased by $246 million to $369 million, and excluding the Olympics, operating cash flow more than doubled, increasing by $126 million to $249 million, reflecting higher revenue and a slight increase in programming costs.Moving to filmed entertainment, 2012 revenue increased 12% to $5.2 billion driven by higher theatrical revenue from the strong box office performance of Ted, The Lorax and Les Miserable, as well as higher home entertainment and content licensing revenue.","Film operating cash flow increased $55 million to $79 million reflecting the performance of the film slate partially offset by an increase in the amortization of film costs.","Switching to our theme park segment, 2012 was a terrific year.  Full-year revenue increased 5% to $2.1 billion and operating cash flow increased 10% to $953 million.  These solid results were driven by increased attendance and per capita spending at our parks which are continuing to benefit from the success of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction in Orlando and the new Transformers attraction in Hollywood.","Let\u2019s move on to Slide 9 to review our consolidated capital expenditures.  We strongly believe that operational excellence, strategic differentiation and attractive capital investment drive profitable growth and shareholder value.","Therefore, we have a disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy that is returns focused as we invest in our core businesses while maintaining a strong balance sheet and providing consistent and sustainable return of capital to shareholders.","Our first priority is to generate strong returns by investing in our businesses.  In both cable and NBCUniversal, we are continuing to reinvest to strengthen our competitive position and to support attractive organic growth opportunities.","For 2012, consolidated capital expenditures increased almost 8% to $5.7 billion compared to $5.3 billion in 2011.  At cable communications, full-year capital expenditures increased 2% to $4.9 billion equal to 12.4% of cable revenue versus 12.9% in 2011.","The increase in capital expenditures reflects the continued expansion of business services and investment in network infrastructure to ensure our product leadership.","Our capital investment plan is focused on strategic areas of growth that yield strong risk-adjusted returns.  Our investments in our network and in CPE to support strategic initiatives like all digital and (DOXIS) 3.0 and in new businesses like business services have yielded strong returns, enhanced our competitive advantage and contributed to a strong financial performance.","At NBCUniversal, we have a similar approach.  NBCUniversal\u2019s capital expenditures for 2012 increased $329 million to $763 million driven by increased investments in parks and facilities.","The higher facilities investment reflects the consolidation of operations and improvements made in our New York area and LA properties.  At parks, we have increased our investment in new attractions at both Orlando and Hollywood as we opened Despicable Me in Orlando and Transformers in Hollywood with great results.","We will moderately increase our 2013 investment in attractive growth areas for cable and NBCUniversal.  We plan to continue to increase hi-speed internet speeds, deploying new wireless gateways to deliver the fastest in-home WiFi, invest more aggressively in the midmarket with (MetroE), expand the rollout of X1 across our footprint and accelerate the expansion of XFINITY Home.","As a result of these investments, our 2013 cable capital expenditures will increase by approximately 10% with capital intensity increasing slightly or equal to 2011 levels.","We are excited about these initiatives to accelerate our product offerings, drive future growth and provide attractive returns.","At NBCUniversal, our 2013 capital investment plan will increase by approximately 25% primarily driven by our theme parks investment in new attractions including Transformers and other attractions in Orlando and Harry Potter and Despicable Me in Hollywood.","Investments in our theme parks over the last few years can actually reset the level of their performance generating strong returns and dramatically expanding the potential of our theme park business.  Please refer to Slide 10.","As we balance our capital allocation priorities, our acquisition of GE\u2019s remaining 49% common equity interest in NBCUniversal also demonstrates our disciplined investment approach.","We\u2019re buying stock and investing in businesses that we own and where we believe we have significant and attractive opportunities to build shareholder value.","As the slide outlines, we agreed to an accelerated acquisition of GE\u2019s 49% common equity interest in NBC Universal for $16.7 billion. \u00a0We are also purchasing NBC Universal\u2019s 30 Rockefeller Center and Englewood Cliffs facilities for $1.4 billion, which we consider strategic facilities given the amount of infrastructure and capital investment that has been made in both of these properties.The transaction values NBC Universal at approximately $39 billion of enterprise value. \u00a0We believe this value\u2019s NBC at approximately 9 times operating cash flow, exclusive of tax benefits, and in line with comparable media peers as attractive to shareholders relative to the business\u2019s trajectory and our estimates of value under the originally contemplated redemption structure.The transaction yields some meaningful tax benefits to Comcast, and generates strong returns, yielding double digit cash on cash IRRs and is immediately accretive to EPS. \u00a0In addition, we have conservatively planned for this event, as NBC Universal and Comcast have built significant financial capacity to fund part of this transaction. We will utilize $11.4 billion of existing cash on hand, which was generated primarily from operations, the sale of our A&E and Spectrum Co. assets and the issuance of $7.5 billion of long-dated senior notes since July of 2012. We will borrow $2 billion additional debt under our credit facilities, and will issue to GE $4 billion seller notes and $725 million of subsidiary preferred shares. \u00a0In addition, GE has made additional long term advertising commitments to NBC Universal.Based on this transaction, and on a pro forma basis, we will have consolidated debt of approximately $48 billion, and a debt to operating cash flow leverage ratio of 2.4x. \u00a0We view our strong balance sheet as an important strategic asset, and we plan to moderately delever over the next few years, with the medium-term goal to further strengthen our credit ratings.Given the magnitude of our balance sheet, we believe a new medium-term leverage target of between 1.5-2x provides the appropriate financial flexibility and liquidity to support our balance sheet and our long term operating and strategic plans. \u00a0Please refer to slide 11.Within the context of the NBC Universal transaction, which is an indirect stock buyback, and our long term leverage target, we remain committed to deliver a consistent and sustainable return of capital to shareholders, through a combination of dividends and buybacks. Today, we have announced a 20% increase in our dividend, to $0.78 on an annual basis, and plan to repurchase $2 billion of our stock in 2013. \u00a0The newly announced dividend represents 32% of our last 12 months net income, and raises our current dividend yield to approximately 2%, which we believe is attractive and in line with the S&P 500.Since the initiation of our dividend in 2008, and to our return of capital commitments in 2013, we will have returned $19 billion to shareholders, including $7 billion in dividends and repurchasing $12 billion in shares. \u00a0We strongly believe we can continue to balance investing in our business and returning meaningful amounts of capital to shareholders, even as we strengthen our balance sheet.So as we conclude 2012, the company is performing well, with a real focus on innovation and execution. \u00a0In addition, we are pleased with the start in 2013 and hope to build on cable communications and NBC Universal\u2019s momentum. \u00a0We are also very pleased that this momentum, our financial strength, and our confidence in the business is allowing us to invest for profitable growth and to provide a meaningful return of capital to shareholders.Now let me turn the call to Marlene for Q&A.Question-and-Answer Session","Marlene DonnerThanks, Michael. \u00a0Operator, let\u2019s open up the call for Q&A please.

Jason Bazinet - Citi Investment ResearchI just had two questions for Mr. Angelakis. \u00a0I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot of moving parts to the economic stimulus, and I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any changes with the full redemption of the NBC-U stake, but would you mind just outlining anything that you can on cash taxes for the next few years, on a percentage basis? \u00a0And then secondly, if you had to quantify what sort of assets there are, sort of on the NPV basis, are there any guideposts you can give us in terms of what folks should be thinking about for their evaluation?","Michael Angelakis","Is your second question, Jason, regarding to the tax benefits we\u2019re receiving as part of the transaction on an NPB basis?  I just want to make sure I clarify the question.","Jason Bazinet - Citi","Correct.","Michael Angelakis","So when we announced the transaction, the first part of the transaction back in December of \u201909, we articulated that we thought the NPB benefit of the taxes was approximately $1.5 billion.","We\u2019ve been fortunate in terms of how we structured it and other benefits where now we estimated that the NPB of those tax benefits is approximately $2.2 billion, so they\u2019ve gone up nicely over the last several years.","We expect to receive those benefits over really the next 10 to 15 years, which is several hundred million dollars a year of benefits to Comcast, so we\u2019re really pleased with how this has been structured.","With regards to cash taxes, they do move around a little bit related to gains and other kinds of things.  We don\u2019t anticipate any meaningful changes and I think you\u2019ll see that our effective tax rate on our P&L will probably hover around 38%, 39% as we go forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jessica Reif Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I had a question for Neil and Steve if each of you could just talk about the big three drivers for your divisions for the year ahead.","Neil Smit","I think the big drivers for our business are, number one, executing the growth our business, our hi-speed business and business services.  Those are our drivers of our profitability and revenue and I think we\u2019re very focused on those.","Number two is grow continuing to the improvement on our video business.  We\u2019ve seen, as you know, about nine quarters of improving results in video and I\u2019d like to continue that trend.","And number three is just executing well on some of the efficiencies we\u2019re finding in the business, reducing truck rolls, improving the call center performance and just overall improvement on the execution side of the business.","Steve Burke","And Jessica, on the NBCUniversal side, I would say if I had to pick three the first would be what I call the monetization gap or the entitlement gap.  I think our affiliate fees are not what they should be both in terms of the cable channels and retransmission consent.","And on the advertising side, our CPMs are lower than some of the other people in the business who have lower ratings than we do.","Secondly, I would say that the broadcast business continues to seem like a big opportunity to us, whether it\u2019s the NBC network, our local stations or (Telemundo).  I think all three of those represent a big opportunity.","And finally, theme parks, which is a business that we have come to really appreciate over time.  We\u2019re doing quite well in the theme park business and I think that growth will continue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Armstrong \u2013 Goldman Sachs.","Jason Armstrong \u2013 Goldman Sachs","First, maybe a question on content cost growth that you talked about in double digit range.  Where are we in the process of content step ups and authentication rights?  I guess what\u2019s included here is presumably box and I know ESPN at the beginning of the year.  Does this represent the later stages of the process and content cost?  Can you start to moderate \u2013 or growth and content cost and start to moderate after this year or are we still in middle stages of this process?","And then just related to that cable margin, you talked about stable cable margins in 2013 despite the content cost growth.  I guess in order for that to be the case, it looks like you probably have to accelerate revenue growth in cable.  Is that the right assumption?","Michael Angelakis","So on the cable margin, we\u2019ve done a great job over the few years keeping a relatively stable margin.  When you look at really the revenues of our cable business right now, roughly half of the revenues are the video side and the other half are other services, which from a product pick standpoint have better margins and are higher growth.","So a combination of increasing product mix and adjustments that will have on the pricing on our video side, some efficiencies that we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll be able to access, which actually help the customers and help our efficiencies, we think as we look to \u201913 we\u2019ll be able to keep pretty stable margins.","On the content side, in terms of where we are \u2013 and the Fox deal was announced yesterday \u2013 I\u2019ll let Neil answer that.","Neil Smit","On the content side, our programming costs, as you know, growing from about 7% this year to low double digits is what we\u2019re projecting. \u00a0With that, we\u2019re extending the terms. \u00a0We\u2019re getting more programming content. \u00a0We\u2019re getting it across more platforms in and out of house, and I think what we\u2019re doing now is figuring out how to leverage that content so we deliver more value to the customers, and that comes in the form of X1. \u00a0And X1 improves the ability to discover that content, and it also acts as a platform so that we can deliver more cloud services and applications going forward. So we\u2019ve got the most on demand. \u00a0We have the 80 authenticated networks on our online service. \u00a0What\u2019s driving the growth is a mixture of things. \u00a0One is we had a couple of step-ups this year. \u00a0We had sports [call] continuing to grow. \u00a0We have retrans fees coming in. \u00a0And we\u2019re just growing the overall content. \u00a0I think we planned for, and anticipated, these increases, and as Michael said, we\u2019re able to offset that with the efficiencies in the business and moderate rate increases. I think that the content, along with better marketing and execution, is delivering results. \u00a0We saw 27% reduction in video losses this year, and we\u2019ve also seen improved revenue growth. \u00a0Last year it was 1.3% for \u201911, and this year it was 2.5%. \u00a0And that\u2019s $490 million worth of growth. \u00a0So I think we can manage the programming increases. \u00a0We\u2019re going to continue to deliver great product, and I think that\u2019s our plan. \u00a0We want to drive share growth. Brian RobertsI just want to add one last point. \u00a0Each of these agreements, including the Fox agreement and the Disney agreement that Neil alluded to before, we\u2019ve signed long term agreements. \u00a0We always have some agreement coming up, but now with the majority of our relationships for the next several years, there\u2019s always a few here and there. \u00a0And then there\u2019s new things that get created, and we\u2019re always finding new ways to deliver content to consumers, so it\u2019s an ongoing dialog. \u00a0That being said, we did plan for this and expected this for 2013.OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank. \u00a0Please go ahead.Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche BankOne for Michael, one for Brian. \u00a0I guess I\u2019ll just ask them both up front, if that\u2019s all right. \u00a0Michael, the NBC price was cheaper than I expected. \u00a0I understand quite well the pricing mechanism from the original deal for GE\u2019s exit in \u201914 and \u201917. \u00a0But I would think GE would have held out for a nice premium to exit this early. \u00a0I mean, the price was right in line with Time Warner. \u00a0Viacom\u2019s trailing 9.5x multiple. \u00a0I think NBC, which [unintelligible] for something like 12x forward in this market. \u00a0Did Comcast provide any additional benefits to GE that convinced them to be so reasonable here on price and timing? And then for Brian, perhaps this is revisionist history, but I feel like you\u2019ve had a very clear vision for the past couple of decades. \u00a0So, in the 90s, you were building scale and a very strong belief in video on demand, and last decade, you were building out the pipes and building out a broadband and technology platform, and buying content. \u00a0Is the Comcast you were hoping to build now built? \u00a0What\u2019s the vision as you look forward the next five to ten years? Michael AngelakisWhy don\u2019t I take the price? \u00a0Listen, for NBC, for GE, I think it\u2019s a very good deal for them as well. \u00a0I think that they were expecting to receive half of the value of their ownership in 2014, almost two years from now. \u00a0That would have been closer to the end of 2014. \u00a0Then they really had to wait until the early part of 2018 to receive the other half. So I think from their standpoint they\u2019re going to receive a lot of cash, which we know they\u2019re going to deploy to other services. \u00a0And from our standpoint, I think it was an advantage to accelerate that, and I think we received a very fair price. \u00a0So we\u2019re quite pleased with the price, and how we\u2019ve structured the transaction as well. \u00a0So I\u2019ll pass it over to Brian for the answer to the second part of the question. Brian RobertsI appreciate what you said. \u00a0Not sure you ever have a perfect vision for a company at any one moment in time, but we have believed that the scale in cable was going to make a difference, and it\u2019s really starting to pay dividends. \u00a0You\u2019re seeing it in the innovation, the service, and frankly just the results that Neil and the team have done.","I think for content, we have always thought, for many years, that it\u2019s a great business on a standalone basis. \u00a0It\u2019s created a lot of wealth over a long period of time and we think we\u2019ll find ways to do so in the future.","Having both in one company makes us a really special company and I think now we need to execute and continue to find ways to have the two work together and apart and it\u2019s a very special day for the company and I think employees and that place where people want to come to work will be the last \u2013 my next goal would be to make it \u2013 continue to make it absolute home for where a young person coming out of school or somebody with their career says this is a company at the cross hairs of media and technology and all parts of this company make it where I want to spend my career.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik \u2013 UBS.","John Hodulik \u2013 UBS","First, a clarification and then a quick follow-up.  On the clarification, the CapEx guide on the cable side says 10% growth in CapEx equates to about 12.9% of sales.  Is it right to think that that suggests you\u2019re going to see cable revenue growth of close to or around 6% \u201913 or am I looking at that the right way?","And then in terms of CapEx, you\u2019ve got a meaningful step up here \u201913 versus \u201912.  Is this the right level, maybe for Michael, that you\u2019re investing in?  Should we think of that from a dollar standpoint as a good level going forward or is 2013 sort of an outsized year?","Michael Angelakis","I think on your first question we\u2019re not providing guidance.  Your math is directionally correct, so let\u2019s just leave it at that.","With regards to the 2013, we are actually excited about investing in the areas that we are articulated, both on the Comcast cable side and on the NBCUniversal side.  So we do look at intensity in terms of 12.4% of cable CapEx in 2012 and we articulated around 12.9% in 2013.","And really the difference is we are investing in high growth, high opportunity areas in both parts of the business.  So we\u2019ve got X1, Comcast Business Services, hi-speed Engine Net, Wireless Gateways, a whole variety of areas, XFINITY Home that we think are transforming the product set that we have on the cable side.","Neil\u2019s team has done an amazing job of how we deploy that, so those are all primarily variable type costs of how we successfully deploy really new products that we\u2019ve invested in.","Now on the NBCUniversal side, as Steve mentioned, theme parks has been terrific, really have reset the bar and the majority of those dollars are going into new attractions at the theme parks which really are, again, high growth, high opportunity dollars.","So we\u2019re really \u2013 we\u2019re not looking at multiple-year plans but for 2013 we wanted to step on the peddle in areas where we think there\u2019s some high growth, high opportunity areas for the company.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker \u2013 Wells Fargo.","Marci Ryvicker \u2013 Wells Fargo","I have two questions.  One, related to NBC and the transaction, can you help us with the accretion math?  We\u2019re hearing anywhere from $0.05 accretion to $0.30.  So any guidance on how to think about that would be helpful.","And then with regard to the programming cost guidance, can you just confirm that this is a P&L basis and not a (per sub) basis and does the incremental expense at all incorporate an assumption of positive video adds for any period of time in 2013?","Michael Angelakis","Let\u2019s be really clear about the accretion.  So on free cash flow there\u2019s really no accretion because we\u2019ve been consolidating 100% of NBCUniversal\u2019s free cash flow since we\u2019ve controlled 51%.","So on free cash flow, what the impacts will be, as we just talked about, we\u2019ll have a little bit higher CapEx, going to have a little bit higher interest expense related to the dollars that we\u2019re borrowing to complete the transaction but we\u2019re also going to have operating cash flow growth and we feel that we\u2019ll be able to keep relatively stable free cash flow for 2013, which the transaction itself isn\u2019t creating any kind of accretion.","On the P&L side, we are going to see EPS accretion.  So we\u2019re going to pay a bit more in taxes because now we\u2019ll pay 100% of the taxes related to NBCUniversal.  We\u2019re also going to eliminate the non-controlling interest which is in our P&L.","And net-net that\u2019s about a positive $550 million, which is about $0.19 to $0.20 of EPS accretion.  So that\u2019s a number that we think is immediately accretive on our P&L related to the transaction.","With regard to the second point on programming cost, it is all in with regards to the P&L. \u00a0So we look at our total dollars of programming to spend increasing in the low double-digits for 2013. \u00a0We\u2019re not providing any kind of view on what subscribers will do. \u00a0Obviously we\u2019re making progress, and I think that\u2019s the key part, is making progress with quality type customers.OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. \u00a0Please go ahead.Ben Swinburne - Morgan StanleyMaybe for Neil, some color on the investment areas for \u201913 that you called out. \u00a0First on commercial, obviously running at a 30%-plus clip. \u00a0I don\u2019t know if you could talk about what you\u2019re expectations are for \u201913 in that business given the capital you\u2019re putting behind it, what kind of market share you think you\u2019ll have. \u00a0And then on the residential side, any more color on X1 and the Gateway product. \u00a0What is the Gateway? \u00a0Is that purely a modem, or is that a residential set top combo? \u00a0And are the X1 markets performing better than your broader footprint? \u00a0I\u2019m just curious what kind of benefits you\u2019re seeing in the market.Neil SmitConcerning the business services, it is growing at a 30-plus percent clip, and we\u2019ve been very pleased with the growth. \u00a0[unintelligible] and his team have done a terrific job there. \u00a0The mid-market is really a lot of the investment that we\u2019re putting in now, with Metro E and hosted voice. \u00a0That\u2019s growing at a faster rate than our small business side, and it\u2019s already 15% of the overall revenue.Concerning HSI, we are investing, as you mentioned, behind the wireless gateway. \u00a0The wireless gateways are a combination modem and router, and that provides for efficiency in the install process and gives us a better look into the self-diagnostic look into the network. \u00a0So it\u2019s efficient as well as a better customer experience. \u00a0It takes some of our older modems, which perform at kind of a 22 MB throughput. \u00a0This takes it up to over 200 MB throughput. \u00a0So as people hang more devices off of their wifi, you\u2019re getting a better throughput of the device. \u00a0So we are excited about that.Concerning X1, it\u2019s preliminary still, but we are seeing lower churn and higher customer satisfaction within the X1 market. \u00a0So we\u2019re pleased with that and we are going to roll it out through the majority of our footprint this year based on those results. \u00a0And it also acts as a platform. \u00a0It gives us the ability, as Brian mentioned, to hang more applications and services off of it. \u00a0So it\u2019s great customer experience, and it gives us a platform for future growth. \u00a0\u00a0OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Michael [Sena] with Credit Suisse. \u00a0Please go ahead. Michael [Sena] - Credit SuisseJust a question in regard to NBC-U. \u00a0I know the growth opportunity a lot of media companies are investing in is internationally. \u00a0I was just wondering, with this transaction behind you, what the view is on a large-scale international M&A play, rated against the shareholder returns, or what the general international strategy is moving forward.Michael AngelakisI\u2019ll take the question. \u00a0I think that we are very focused on execution. \u00a0And I just really want to emphasize that. \u00a0The investment of $16.7 billion in NBC Universal I think really highlights our confidence in the business, but also where we think there\u2019s organic growth opportunities in the business. \u00a0And I think where our focus will be is clearly on organic growth opportunities that we think exist. \u00a0International is an important area, and we\u2019re continuing to study that, but we\u2019re excited about the organic opportunities we have. Brian RobertsAnd there\u2019s plenty to do organically. \u00a0If you look at some of our businesses, like film, right now, the majority of our revenues are going to come from outside the United States. \u00a0We have cable channels all over the world. \u00a0We have a very large television syndication business, and Jeff Shell, one of the senior-most Comcast executives we put in place as the deal closed, has a great team. \u00a0They\u2019re doing a great job. \u00a0There\u2019s plenty to do organically, and we should grow that business in the future.Marlene DoonerOperator, let\u2019s have this be the last question, please.OperatorOur final question will come from the line of Brian Kraft with Evercore Partners. \u00a0Please go ahead.Brian Kraft - Evercore PartnersJust had two quick ones. \u00a0One, since you\u2019re taking in the properties from NBC and Englewood Cliffs and 30 Rock, will there be some lease or rent savings that will positively impact NBC-U EBITDA, and if so, if you could maybe quantify that. \u00a0And I also wanted to clarify, is the $1.4 billion for the real estate in your $39 billion enterprise value calculation? \u00a0Or is that in addition to it?","Michael Angelakis","No, the $1.4 billion really has nothing to do with the 39.4 enterprise value. That value is just separate for the business.  A separate part of General Electric actually owned the real estate and we thought it was important to bring that into the transaction given what we considered to be both strategic facilities that we were fortunate enough to have both under one roof, one GE roof to be able to negotiate that.","So your first question, there will be some savings on EBITDA related to rent expense that we would have at both facilities that when the transaction closed that we won\u2019t have that.  So it\u2019s not that meaningful given the size of roughly $20 billion of operating cash flow but it certainly is going to help.","And we made the decision that it was strategic to buy these facilities as well as from an economic perspective it was a smart deal.  And you can look at a whole variety of real estate metrics to make that decision.","Marlene Dooner","Thank you all for joining us this morning.","Operator","There will be a replay available of today\u2019s call started at 12:30 pm Eastern standard time.

Please refer to our 8-K for the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.","With that, let me turn the call to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian?","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. I'm really proud of the company and our results this quarter, EBITDA increased by 5% and as you'll hear both parts of the company continue to perform really well and distinguish themselves with operational execution and focus.","Our third quarter results at Cable Communications once again underscored the impressive consistency in this business with 5% revenue and 5% EBITDA growth. Excluding the estimated impacts from storms this quarter, we added 150,000 new customer relationships and would have had 6% EBITDA growth.","We are on a path for continued balanced, profitable growth led by some of our highest margin segments as well as our ability to drive further operational improvements on the back of the investments we've made in the customer experience. We see lots of opportunity in our data connectivity businesses. Residential broadband and business services which combined generate over $20 billion in revenue per year growing right at around 10% and are accretive to our margins.","And these areas are increasingly where we are directing our capital in the form of hyperbuilds to serve businesses pushing fiber further into our residential network and enhancing the speed, control and coverage aspects of our WiFi offering through our new wireless gateways xFi app and new xFi pod network extenders. In broadband we expect a strong end of the year and are on track to add over 1 million net new customers for the 12th year in a row.","Our newest connectivity business, XFINITY Mobile really highlights the value of our broadband service by bundling access to the best high-speed Internet data with a unique wireless offering. We are pleased with the early results surpassing 250,000 customer lines in a short period of time since our launch in May, and we are poised to scale the product from here.","In video new entrants, changing consumer habits and aggressive video activity from incumbents continue to result in a competitive landscape. We are well equipped to compete. A cheat channel package, bundled with our best in class broadband and other services is still the optimal choice for the majority of our customers. At the same time, we continue to explore innovative and economical ways to reach additional segments that we can serve profitably through products like our new Instant TV service. We believe this approach focusing on profitable whole-home economics is the right one and differentiates us from others and sets us up well for the future.","So as the market for video shifts, I would make two observations. First, our broadband business is increasingly the epicenter of our relationship with customers and ultimately where we derive the majority of our profitability. Second, we are committed to the video business, we saw this evolution coming and think we have invested in the pieces that will ultimately define long-term profitable success, including X1, the best platform on the market with amazing features that really resonate with customers like our Emmy winning Voice Remote, the broadest aggregation of great content with the best in live linear and on-demand augmented now by the inclusion of Netflix and YouTube and others onto our platform. And if you haven't tried it lately you've got to because it gets better every month. In indication we offer an attractive and profitable relationship through packaging video with broadband.","And finally, our ongoing effort to improve the customer experience accelerated this year and will continue to be an important driver in the future. We are now seeing results from the investments we have made in data analytics and other technology to better anticipate and diagnose service issues and to give our customers more control with digital tools like the My Account App.","In the third quarter, we reduced customer calls handled by our agents by 4 million. We also increased the percentage of customer interactions completed digitally by double digits. So better service is not just critical for our customers, but is helping our financial performance and we believe there is a long runway for further progress. Mike will talk about this in more detail later.","Turning to NBCUniversal, the exciting momentum continued in the third quarter with EBITDA increasing by nearly 20% when you exclude the Olympics last year. In our TV businesses, our strategy is centered on must-see content which is more crucial now than ever and in an evolving media ecosystem great content is the foundation of everything from traditional TV bundles and new virtual MPVD services to second-run monetization opportunities that can provide a boost to current-season shows and extend the life of the best libraries. We monetize our content in a variety of ways from advertising, distribution to legacy and new virtual MPVDs and through licensing it to multiple outlets. In fact, in many instances we have more end users of our content than we've ever had, the result is that while there may be a shift in where contributions are coming from, we've sustained terrific momentum.","NBC finished the season ranked number one in primetime for the fourth consecutive year, winning by the widest margin of any network in six years. The network is in the lead for the new fall season as well driven by new shows like Will & Grace, and continued success including This Is Us and The Voice.","At Cable Networks, we had the number one new cable series of the season with The Sinner on USA and rounding up the must-have lineup we will have three of the biggest events in television airing across our networks in 2018, just like we did in Rio, we will put the full support of Comcast NBCUniversal behind the PyeongChang Winter Olympics in February and we couldn't be more excited. We're thrilled to have the Super Bowl on NBC and the World Cup on Telemundo in 2018.","At the Theme Parks, we had another excellent quarter with EBITDA increasing nearly 10%. This performance included strong results from Universal Studios Japan where the recently opened Minion Park attraction drove continued growth, a perfect example of leveraging our IP across businesses. Japan is having a record year highlighting what a terrific deal it has been for us since our initial investment in the park two years ago.","Filmed Entertainment again delivered strong EBITDA growth driven by the third installment of Despicable Me, which helped Chris Meledandri's franchise become the highest grossing animated franchise of all time worldwide. As well as ongoing contributions from our robust slate in the first half of the year.","Universal is on track to challenge and perhaps exceed 2015 as the most profitable year in its 100-plus year history, highlighting our successful strategy and great management team. Overall, I'm really pleased with the results this quarter. We have the right formula in place for continued growth through product leadership and financial discipline. Mike, over to you.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin by reviewing our consolidated results on slide 4. So, despite the impact of the hurricanes results in the third quarter were strong. Revenue of $21 billion declined 1.6% as reported and increased 5.8% excluding the Rio Olympics in last year's third quarter. Year-to-date, revenue increased 8.2% excluding the Rio Olympics.","Adjusted EBITDA of $7.2 billion grew 5% versus last year's third quarter and on a year-to-date basis, EBITDA grew 8.4%. Free cash flow was $2.3 billion in the quarter and $7.6 billion on a year-to-date basis. And finally, adjusted earnings per share increased 13% to $0.52 a share.","So now let's go deeper into the businesses starting with Cable Communications on slide 5. Cable Communications revenue increased 5.1% to $13.2 billion, and EBITDA increased 5.2% to $5.2 billion, resulting in a margin of 39.7%, flat to last year's third quarter. Customer relationships increased by 115,000 to more than 29 million, a 2.8% increase versus a year ago, and total revenue per customer relationship grew by 2.1%.","The healthy revenue growth and consistent strong EBITDA growth of this quarter and the year-to-date highlight the importance and strength of our growing high-margin business services and high-speed Internet businesses, and the ongoing benefit of our investment in customer experience. Further, the Cable Communications business is focused on profitable growth by striking the right balance between improvements in our financial results, and our customer metrics were clearly reflected in the quarter's results.","I'll spend a moment on how hurricanes Harvey and Irma impacted the cable business. First, our customer metrics were impacted as a result of the loss or severe damage to many homes we serve in these markets as well as a slowdown in new business activity during the storms.","Excluding hurricane impacts, we estimate that we would have added approximately 150,000 customer relationships relative to the 115,000 reported, and we would have lost approximately 105,000 video customers relative to the 125,000 reported and added approximately 240,000 high-speed Internet customers versus the 214,000 reported. Our third quarter results capture the storm impacts on our customer metrics, and we do not expect any further impact.","Second, the hurricanes reduced EBITDA by approximately $35 million, and adjusting for that, our EBITDA growth rate would have been a strong 6% increase versus the year ago quarter.","The impact primarily reflects customer credits and waived fees as well as additional labor associated with plant repairs and higher call volumes. Our teams in Houston and Florida have done an incredible job fixing hurricane damage, and they continue to work diligently to ensure our network and operations are running smoothly.","There's still a lot of work to be done, and we anticipate seeing a similar financial impact during the fourth quarter, after which we expect our operations to be fully back to normal.","So that's it on storms. Now, let's go into our residential business results in Cable. High-speed Internet continues to be the largest contributor to overall Cable growth. Revenue increased 8.9% to $3.7 billion in the quarter, driven by an increase in our residential customer base and rate adjustments.","We added 182,000 residential high-speed Internet customers in the quarter and added 1.1 million over the past 12 months, with our current broadband penetration of homes and businesses passed at 45%.","We believe we have a long runway for continued HSD customer growth for several reasons. First, the broadband market is expanding as more Americans adopt high-speed data. Second, our homes passed have been growing at a healthy rate. And third, we are driving market share gains on the back of ongoing investment and innovation in our best-in-class broadband product.","Customers are getting more value from their subscriptions with us and are using our product more and benefiting from increasing speed of our network. Specifically, median monthly data usage increased by 41% year-over-year and 55% of our residential customers now take speeds of 100 megabits per second or higher compared to 36% a year ago.","Our plan is to continue to invest to enhance our competitive differentiation by improving speed, coverage and capabilities. For speed, today, we're rolling out DOCSIS 3.1, which efficiently enables us to offer gigabit speeds. We expect to have this available to the majority of our homes by year-end.","And in terms of broadband coverage and capabilities, we've begun deploying our xFi advanced wireless gateways, the most powerful home gateway available on the market, capable of delivering gigabit WiFi speeds, empowering the most advanced connected homes. In addition, with our new xFi pod network extenders as well as the control features of our xFi app, we are further strengthening our WiFi experience and with it, our leading position in the broadband market.","Switching to video, revenue increased 4.2% to $5.8 billion in the quarter, primarily due to rate adjustments as well as customers subscribing to additional services, revenue associated with a Pay-Per-View boxing event, which added about 100 basis points of revenue growth, partially offset by the net loss of video subscribers discussed earlier.","As we have noted for many quarters now, there has been a continuous introduction of new entrants in the over-the-top video space. We've, obviously, known about and been expecting the impact of these competitors, understanding that customers will experiment with new services, especially in the early days when marketing and promotional activities by the new entrants are particularly intense.","The competitive effect of the OTT competition appears broad-based across our footprint and has moderately accelerated as some additional new OTT players have recently launched. We continue to believe that our best-in-class video product, particularly when bundled with our broadband product represents a great value to our customers.","Separately, but not unrelated to OTT competition, is the behavior of traditional competitors, with some responding more aggressively than others. In the third quarter, we experienced noticeable differences in our net customer metrics across the footprints of different competitors.","We are carefully monitoring the effects of traditional competition, and we'll adjust our own approach to the marketplace to address any sustained pressure through the lens of balancing profitable growth with market share as described earlier.","We believe our quality across every aspect of the video bundle gives us a competitive advantage. We have the most innovative video platform on the market with X1, which is now in 57% of our residential video customers' homes compared to about 45% a year ago.","We continue to innovate and improve X1, continuously adding more content, integrating apps like Netflix and YouTube, making it easy to search all this content with our Voice Remote and offering a compelling TV Everywhere experience with our XFINITY Stream app.","Finally, on the residential side, I want to emphasize our strategy of delivering great value through a bundled approach. That begins with our broadband product, coupled most commonly with video but we haven't stopped there.","We are investing in other services that bring value to our customers by leveraging our place in the home and the importance of our connectivity services. We have a continuous effort to innovate and develop services that add value to our customers and deepen our relationship with them.","We have good experience with this, having introduced Voice into 20% of our base in a relatively short period of time, and we see the next opportunity to expand our bundled customer offerings with XFINITY Home and XFINITY Mobile.","We now have over one million XFINITY Home customers, almost double where we were two years ago with 90% subscribing a three or four product bundles. More recently, we launched our wireless service, XFINITY Mobile, which is available exclusively to customers who bundle it with our high-speed Internet product.","As Brian pointed out, we are off to a great start, exceeding 250,000 customer lines in only a few months since our launch. Introducing these new products adds value to our customers as part of a multi-product bundle, deepens our relationship, thus improving retention and ultimately, benefiting lifetime customer economics for us.","Moving on to business services, which continues to be a top driver of our overall Cable results. We delivered another strong quarter of double-digit growth with revenue increasing 12.6% to $1.6 billion during the quarter, primarily driven by customer growth. We added 31,000 business customer relationships and grew revenue per business customer relationship by 5%.","The significant majority of business services revenue is centered on connectivity, and we have even more runway to increase share in our data product as we move to gigabit speeds throughout our footprint with the deployment of DOCSIS 3.1 and as we continue to push fiber deeper in our network.","We continue to augment growth through business applications and services right on top of our core connectivity business. These include our voice, video surveillance and advanced WiFi products, and additionally, as we grow into the mid-sized business and enterprise segments, our recently launched SD-WAN product and our managed enterprise solutions business will help unlock new opportunities to serve branch offices of larger multi-site businesses.","Turning to slide six. Programming expenses increased 12.4% during the quarter, including the additional costs associated with the Pay-Per-View boxing event. Year-to-date programming expenses increased 12%, reflecting the timing of several contracts that renewed at the end of last year.","Non-programming expenses increased 0.6% this quarter and increased 1.1% for the year-to-date. This reflects the benefits of investments made in customer experience initiatives as well as disciplined cost management overall. Notably, customer service expense is essentially flat this quarter and down about 1% year-to-date even as customer relationships grew by nearly 3%.","One example is the reduction in customer calls over the last year with general calls to agents down by 16 million or nearly 10% and calls from new customers during their first 90 days down by double-digit percentage. The investments in the customer experience are clearly working, and we believe we have the foundation in place to drive further improvement from here.","Lastly, on our Cable Communications, third quarter EBITDA margin of 39.7% was flat compared to the third quarter of 2016. Our year-to-date EBITDA margin of 40.2% is up 10 basis points compared to the same period in 2016 even with the higher rate of programming expense growth and the impact of the two hurricanes. And finally, we continue to expect the full year 2017 EBITDA margin to be flat compared to the 2016 margin of 40.2% despite the impact of the hurricanes.","Now let's move on to NBCUniversal's results. On slide seven, NBCUniversal's revenues decreased 12.7%, and EBITDA increased 6% in the quarter. Excluding the Olympics, revenue increased 6% and EBITDA was up nearly 20%. Cable Networks revenue declined 11.5% and increased 3.7% excluding the Olympics, driven by higher distribution and content licensing and other revenue.","Distribution revenue continued to drive our results, increasing 4% this quarter to $1.5 billion. But for the timing effects of certain sports-related fees and the impact of channel closures, distribution revenue growth would have been consistent with the high-single digit growth we reported in the first half of the year, which was due to the major renewals at the beginning of the year.","Content licensing and other revenue of $283 million increased 24%, reflecting the episodic nature of when deals are completed and content delivered under licensing agreements. Advertising revenue of $787 million declined 2.6%, reflecting higher rates that were more than offset by ratings declines. And finally, in Cable Net, EBITDA increased 1.5% to $905 million, reflecting the comparison with the Olympics last year.","Broadcast Television revenue declined 30.9% but increased 12.3% excluding the Olympics. Retransmission consent fees increased more than 70% to nearly $360 million. Content licensing revenue of $440 million increased over 20%. In addition, excluding the Olympics, advertising revenue of $1.2 billion was relatively flat, the result of strong pricing offsetting ratings declines, consistent with recent trends. And finally, EBITDA decreased 15% to $321 million, again, reflecting the comparison with the Olympics last year.","Filmed revenue was relatively flat, but EBITDA increased 11.9% to $394 million, reflecting the successful performance of Despicable Me 3, the carryover benefits of a very successful film slate in the first half of 2017 as well as higher content licensing driven by DreamWorks Kids TV. As Brian noted, film is on track to have one of its most profitable years in its history.","Finally, Theme Parks revenue increased 7.7% and EBITDA increased 9.8% to $775 million. These strong results were driven by the launch of Minion Park in Japan and Volcano Bay in Orlando as well as the continued success from Harry Potter in Hollywood, which opened more than a year ago. These results include the impact of Hurricane Irma and the negative impact of a weaker Japanese yen.","Now let's move to slide eight to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. Consolidated CapEx increased 1.2% to $2.4 billion in the third quarter. At Cable Communications, capital expenditures increased 0.8% to $2.1 billion in the quarter, resulting in capital intensity of 15.6%. For the full year, we continue to expect capital intensity to remain flat to 2016 at approximately 15% of total Cable Communications revenue. For the quarter, the increase in spending reflects a higher level of investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity and increased investments in line extensions, mostly offset by decreased spending on customer premise equipment.","At NBCUniversal, third quarter capital expenditures increased 5.4% to $354 million, reflecting the timing of real estate and infrastructure spending as well as continued investment of Theme Parks. For the full year, we continue to expect NBCUniversal's capital expenditures to increase approximate 10% versus 2016.","And now finishing up on slide nine. As mentioned earlier, we generated $2.3 billion in free cash flow in the quarter and $7.6 billion on a year-to-date basis. Our return of capital in the third quarter totaled $2.4 billion and $6 billion for the year-to-date. Dividend payments were $743 million in the third quarter, up 12.1% year-over-year and $2.1 billion year-to-date, up 10.5% year-over-year.","Share repurchases were $1.7 billion in the third quarter, approximately 60% higher than the quarterly pace of the first half of the year. For the year-to-date, share repurchases totaled $3.8 billion. We continue to plan to return approximately $7.9 billion to shareholders for the full year in 2017, including $5 billion in share repurchases and $2.9 billion in dividends.","And finally, we continue to be pleased with the health of our balance sheet ending the quarter at 2.2 times net leverage. So that concludes our summary of the quarter. We're clearly very pleased with our continued strong performance as well as our momentum heading into the fourth quarter.","Now, I'll turn it back to Jason to lead the Q&A.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Great. Thanks, Mike. Regina, we'll turn it over to you for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi, thank you. I want to sort of dig into a little bit sort of the transition that's going on from video-led to broadband-led financially. So when you lose a double-play or a triple-play customer and they become a single-play customer, can you sort of walk through all the different things that happen as that transition happens? How that customer's pricing changes and then what costs, besides just programming costs, shift? And so sort of what is that economic transition look like for your business? And how should we think about it going forward?","David N. Watson - Comcast Corp.","Hey, Craig, this is Dave. So let me take that. And look, there has certainly been a fair amount of work out there on this very issue. I read your perspectives, specifically on it, and I agree with your point of view that as there is an economic shift when that happens in terms of if a customer selects broadband-only, there are higher margins in that, there's a higher rate for standalone service and a lower cost to deliver that product. So margins improve.","But having said that, I think we're very different in that our definition of packaging is to profitably put together great products that drive engagement and usage. So we'll continue to stay very focused on X1 and broadband.","But to the extent somebody does take broadband-only, the way we look at it and the way it breaks out, we take a very disciplined approach towards a premium product, which we're constantly raising the speeds for them. And we will charge more for on a stand-alone basis, so there are some bundling benefits to the extent that they don't take it then we charge more for on a stand-alone basis.","Secondly, I also agree that there is upside economically and being able to go to that customer that may be enjoying video, over-the-top, whatever they're doing, and being able to upgrade them to higher tiers. So we also have good opportunity in terms of the cost of service, so there are improved economics in terms of the operating expenses. So this will drive ARPU, this improves margin.","But again, let me also say that there's a broader opportunity. We're very different in the broad portfolio of products that we have being able to package whether it's mobile, whether it's home security, different tiers of service. Our general approach is to profitably package a wide variety of opportunities. And by the way, we will continue to focus on video. And we think there's a good opportunity to do that with broadband. But the economics, I think, are very encouraging to the extent that they do select broadband-only.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","I just want to add one other observation, which is, as this shift is occurring, the utility of broadband to the consumer is going up every year. So the bits per home in the last nine months or so appear to be about 40% more usage. So people are relying on the speed, the WiFi coverage, the video, whether it's our video or some other video, consumption has never been higher. NBC gets paid for a lot of that video consumption in different ways, in different models, which we can talk about. And then you don't have different CapEx requirements. So you add it all up.","We've anticipated this shift that's coming. I think we've taken our innovation machine and pointed it as well now to broadband and broadband-only homes, and I think you'll see more of that coming in the future. We just launched YouTube, for instance, on X1. You're able to enjoy more video than ever. If you take our video, I think you're able to enjoy more video than ever if you don't take our video, but our broadband is the center, and that's why we're 25 million broadband, 22 million video. We saw the shift coming, we're pretty focused.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Great. Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Craig. Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I have a question for Brian and then for either Dave or Mike, whoever wants to take it. Brian, on the mobile side, you guys now are in the market, you talked about how many customers you have and the iPhone 10 or X, whatever it's called, is a week away. Plus there's a lot happening in fixed, I know you guys have been sort of exploring 5G and other opportunities. Can you just maybe step back and tell us how you're thinking about wireless strategically longer term now that a sort of company-wide deployment of wireless is sort of right here?","And then, just picking up on the last conversation about the broadband business and the shifting model. Dave or Mike, when you think about that shift, I think everyone understands, it's probably accretive to margins. Can you just talk about capital needs for the data business? You talked a lot about hyperbuilds and more fiber and line extensions. What are the CapEx needs as you guys try to really push your advantage in data versus the kind of spending we've seen at Cable over the last couple of years?","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Well, I like our wireless strategy a lot. Wireless revenue is going backwards for a couple of companies that reported, and cash flow is the same. So that's a business where we have 0% market share. And so as we begin, and 250,000 subs is a great achievement, but its 250,000 subs, so we're very small. We're using wireless to help our very valuable broadband business.","You can only get wireless if you take our broadband. And it's an extension of our broadband to what I was just commenting on earlier. And yet we've been able to say when we hit a certain scale, hopefully, the next year or so, we will then be able to be in a position where every sub is profitable on its own merits, and that's the nature of the wholesale relationships that we've made.","And third, we have a very compelling offer to the consumer. You literally take money off your bill in almost every instance, you have tremendous flexibility and it's super simple and it's all digital. And you can get the newest devices as you alluded to. So I think it's a way for us to reinforce the strategy of the company that we were just talking about, which is to make that broadband relationship as increasingly useful and valuable and something as important as your mobile device.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","And then Ben, it's Mike. Thanks for the question. I'll start and Dave can finish. So on capital we'll, obviously, be back next call and talk about future outlook for CapEx in the Cable business.","As we said, we'll be flat this year to last year at around 15% capital intensity. I think the important thing about the broadband business is yes, in-home equipment will be cheaper in a broadband model than a video model, and we've got the decline in X1 as we've been talking about. But on the other side, we are making sure that we invest increased speeds and make sure we innovate and add value in our broadband product given everything Brian just described about how important that is to the future of the company.","David N. Watson - Comcast Corp.","It is very consistent with our current CapEx plan, investing in the network. We've been doing that. We anticipated it. So as we make this pivot, it's very consistent with our current capital program.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you both.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Ben. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. I have a Cable and NBCU question. On the Cable side, obviously, a lot of the focus of this call is on broadband and you've discussed your strategy with speed coverage and capabilities. But do you think that's enough or how do you differentiate to consumers the product enough to drive pricing, particularly in light of so much competitive promotional activity? And then, I guess, the NBC question \u2013 do you want to answer that \u2013 and then I'll go to NBC?","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Go ahead, go ahead, Jessica.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then NBC, there's so many parts to it that it's hard for you guys to talk on the call or in the press release about some of the drivers, but one of the little gems seems to be Telemundo, which has had phenomenal ratings success. Can you give us some color on kind of where you've been and where you think you can go or how quickly you can take share? And then if there's any comment at all on China given the recent elections and the political environment, is there any change to your strategy in that country whether Theme Parks or Film?","David N. Watson - Comcast Corp.","Let me start, Jessica, with the broadband point. So I think our operating strategy with broadband as we make \u2013 continue to make this pivot and really focused innovation around a superior broadband experience kind of goes down into three buckets. One, we constantly focus on improving speed. We've been working for many years now on developing best-in-class gateway devices, so we improve coverage when we do that. And then with xFi, really, the first one out to develop an in-home superior control.","So we're scaling 1 gig, but the widest footprint available out there in terms of 1 gig within our footprint. And so I really think when you combine speed with best-in-class WiFi, it really does point towards just a better answer for customers. And I think \u2013 as Mike said, I think there's a lot of runway left to grow the customer base, there's a runway on rate given our competitive differentiation around all those key areas. So I think there's still good opportunity.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","So on Telemundo, when we talk about broadcast, we always talk about NBC being number one for four years and This is Us and Sunday Night Football, but a real gem inside our company in terms of broadcast is Telemundo. And for those of you who don't follow it closely, for decades Univision beat Telemundo in primetime night after night after night by 1 million, 2 million people in the demo. And in the last broadcast year for the first time ever in primetime, Telemundo beat Univision. And if you look more recently since this new season started, we're winning almost every night, sometimes by 20%, 25% margin.","So Telemundo is a big opportunity. Monetization tends to lag ratings performance. We saw this with NBC when it first started to return. So don't expect the same kind of jumps in terms of monetization immediately at Telemundo, but if we keep beating Univision, we should, at some point, catch up to Univision in terms of monetization and that would be a big swing from where Telemundo was just a few years ago.","In terms of China, China we think is a very, very big opportunity for our company. We made virtually no money in China 5 years ago. This year, we'll make a couple hundred million dollars of OCF in China, primarily film and some SVOD and consumer products. We're spending a lot of time and attention getting a park in Beijing open where the visitation numbers, the tourist numbers in Beijing are just phenomenal. And we will be the only major US theme park in that area of China. And when that park opens, I think as a company, it's not unrealistic to assume we're going to make well over $1 billion in OCF. So from zero five years ago to over $1 billion in just a few more years once we get Beijing open.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Jessica. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Mike, can you just clarify the comment you made on the fourth quarter? You mentioned competition is accelerating. I know you don't give guidance for that. Are you implying that sub-losses are accelerating from the third quarter, either absolute or year-over-year? And then the second question that we've gotten is as you've gone from gaining video subs to losing video subs, what kind of subs are you losing? Is it broad-based across your platform? Is it lower tier? Are they X1? Any color would be great. Thanks.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","Well, I'll just say, no implication of acceleration there, but Dave can comment further. But really it continues to be competitive in the video space. But we've got quite a good set of tools in the video product with X1 and the like that while we continue to see the competitors out there, we're in a position to compete for the best customers out there.","David N. Watson - Comcast Corp.","Let me offer, Marci, a perspective on video. Given the \u2013 I think, again, we're very different in regards to not only broadband but video, as I mentioned before. If you look at the whole market in terms of the entire video market if it contracts people will pin it where it will be, but we're quite different. Yes, there'll be some pressure as more OTT competition comes in in different stages as they launch. But primarily because of X1 and our focus around innovation, I just think we're very different in our ability to compete. We have the best video product combined with the best broadband. And so you look at \u2013 we gained X1, we are up to now 57% penetration. And when you look at the performance of X1, it consistently delivers better churn results across, really, literally every tenure-based customers. So we see usage benefits, everything that we see around X1 continues to be positive.","So while there is overall pressure, competitive pressure, I don't think the video market has settled overall. We like our position. And when you look at also, another validation around X1 as others select X1 including \u2013 we've talked about it before, whether it's Cox, whether it's many Canadian companies, the fact that they are taking in, and we've heard very good results from them as well, it's very consistent. So we're pleased with X1's overall performance, and I think it makes us a very different video competitor.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Marci. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Maybe you could talk about competition in broadband, obviously, you've seen a bit of a slowdown in terms of net adds. Is there a way to tease out sort of what the competitive backdrop is? Are you seeing \u2013 is it a function of more competition in terms of pricing on the DSL side, the expanded fiber-to-the-home footprint? Or maybe an attachment issue as it relates to video? I mean, you guys have added about 1.3 million subs the last few years, and you talked about adding a million. Are we looking at a different run rate and a different competitive backdrop? Thanks.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","Well, I think, certainly, it's a unique competitive environment in that I mentioned there certainly are a handful of over-the-top folks that have entered the market in a relatively short period of time.","I think when you have something like that, and you have legacy competitors that respond in different ways to a competitive environment. And on top of that, one telephone company added a little bit more broadband footprint on the low end. So when you have all those things together, yeah, there's going to be a little bit of shift competitively.","As always, we've gone through competitive cycles. We make adjustments based on the competitive climate. And again, our focus is smart packaging and very focused leveraging our best products. And while there's some pressure on it, you look to the overall balance, you look to the overall cash flow performance that we have and even in a slightly tougher competitive environment, I like our results.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","So let me just add to that because the last point is obviously how we're managing the company for that balance, and we always can adjust that as we see things. But you also want to look a little longer term and say, what is your \u2013 what's your strategic long-term advantage.","I think that's been embedded in some of the questions on broadband, particularly. And we're out with 1 gig is a big focus. We said a minimum of a million this year. We're off to a nice start in the fourth quarter in broadband.","And the question is how good is the runway. And what I look at is 25 meg is the new DSL or something like that, is that just nice but not enough for what you want to do as you do shift your video behaviors and your Internet usage, and all the innovation coming from Silicon Valley and elsewhere is driving that 40% bit rate increase per home per year. And that's why we've increased speeds 12 years in a row.","So we see a runway. We like our competitive advantage. People build new footprint that we've see these ups and downs come. You have to have a longer-term view and try to be steady and consistent, and that's what I think the way Dave is managing the company.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. If I could ask one quick follow-up on XFINITY Instant, you talked the launch of Mobile, but how has the launch gone for Instant TV? And is there a chance that over time that can help support and even drive broadband given the attachment there?","David N. Watson - Comcast Corp.","Well, we launched it fully throughout the footprint end of September. As we mentioned before, I think Instant is a unique opportunity, really, going after a segment. And we take very segmented approach as to breaking down the marketplace. Without a set-top box, customer doesn't want it, it can deliver better margins. We're going to use it surgically.","It's a good retention opportunity as well, being able to talk to customers that wanted to talk about their choice and their options. But it's not something \u2013 our go-to-market full approach is best of video X1, best of broadband, but we will use this surgically, and it's way early but pleased with just out of the gates response to it.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thanks, John. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. A question on margins in Cable. Can you talk, one, are we still headed to programming numbers headed more to the mid to high-single digits next year? And second, non-programming OpEx has been decelerating. And on a per customer relationship basis it's actually declining at an accelerating pace. Can this decline continue next year? And how do you think about that? Thanks.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Well, so we feel very good about what we've done this year in margins. So we'll be at flat to last year at 40.2%, which is for the year, and that's going to be inclusive of the storms and better than flat to 50% (46:35) when we started the year. And so, on your second point non-programming, I think Dave and team have been very focused on just driving better customer experience which is helping take cost out, a lot of reduction in calls and interactions, both for new customers, a lot more digital interactions, which are lowering cost as well.","So I'd say on a non-programming expense side, it's just continuous focus on improvements, no one-offs and anything we've done in these past couple of periods of high programming cost increase. So I think Dave and team continue to be focused on that. We'll come back and talk about margins for next year when we get to the next call. But then on programming, we did say that next year, we start to see, and we do continue to expect to see significant relief the programming cost growth.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","So beyond that, the key focus that we have is around just expense discipline and really focusing on the customer experience. The best way, I think, to drive transactions out is continued focus on investing in the customer experience, and the benefits are just not a one-time event. So you look at, especially, as we are driving customer relationships, we're improving customer relationships, yet our non-programming OpEx continues to improve. So it's just a better answer for the customer and a better answer financially.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. Thanks, guys.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Phil. Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Just had a question for Mr. Roberts. In your press release, you talked about the broad range of growth opportunities. Now, it's just writing down sort of obvious ones from mobile to security, to the opportunity Mr. Burke talked about in China. If you could just rank order for us, maybe over a five-year period, what are the ones that you're most excited about in terms of driving EBITDA?","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Well, I would start probably by saying if you've lumped, and I tried to do that a little bit earlier, and you call it broadband connectivity, both residential and business, that's now a $20 billion a year business. That is a big portion of our company. That's growing at double-digit revenue growth, and it's very accretive to our margin.","So over the next five years, do I think broadband has opportunities to go to Internet of Things to smart home, to smart grid, to more consumption, whether it's video or 4K or virtual reality, augmented reality, pick your excitement and your probability and say will it be a good place for us to spend money to build capabilities that other companies don't have, fiber, backhaul, et cetera. So clearly, that would be on the list.","I think in content, one of the things \u2013 Dave used the word differentiate. I think what Steve and the team have done at NBCUniversal, we have the fastest-growing media company by my observation by a lot, and we're a leader in a lot of categories. So there's \u2013 whether it was Telemundo or China or the theme parks in other places like Osaka, making us more of a global company, using our content to grow and to take advantage of new platforms and to study the changing landscape, are we going to be advantaged by that? I think so and in animation.","What sometimes happens is you get so focused on the areas that decline that you forget to talk about the areas that grow. And so I very much think it's important to balance that. You can't ignore areas as they mature, but there's a culture in our company, it's very financially disciplined, and we look for profitable growth, and we keep using that phrase.","And I think everybody in the company understands what that means. And the last point I would make is we have completely transformed ourselves in terms of innovation. And it's just unfortunate that most of you live in New York and some live in L.A. who make the content and they don't get to play with X1. But when you see the Olympics on X1 coming out in a couple of months, you will see a set of capabilities to help content reach consumers in a way that is unprecedented anywhere in the world on any platform.","And if you want the best products, and you want increasingly the best service, you're going to come to our company and with the best content. And so I think we have a very unique, very special company.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Unknown Speaker","I'm obviously biased.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","All right. Thank you, Jason. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Thanks. I think what would be really helpful just in terms of the questions we're getting from investors is to understand in the areas where you're seeing competition, how much of that is coming from AT&T going from 1 million fiber homes to 6 million fiber homes in the course of a very short space of time?","We know they're taking share in those \u2013 in that portion of their footprint, in general, it would be great to know to what extent that's impacting trends in your business. Because that trend over the sort of the next three to four years, I think, was really was anticipated by the Street. Although it might not have been in 3Q numbers, it was a trend that we all knew that AT&T was going to 12.5 million or 14 million homes. And so how much of the impact is that versus really aggressive pricing for low-end products, would be really helpful.","And then sorry to pile on, but to the extent that \u2013 in that portion of your footprint, if we could get some color on how much X1 impacts the competitive dynamics and what you might be able to do to increase X1 penetration in that footprint to stave off losses, that would be really helpful.","David N. Watson - Comcast Corp.","Okay. So let me start with broadband and AT&T. So there's no question they've added some more footprint in regards to some more, what I would call more low-end broadband. And so when you do that, you see some impact. Our game plan, we anticipated this, we, obviously, see some of this coming. And our view is to deliver the best product. And we will constantly increase speed, that's why we've been so focused on WiFi, we believe your broadband experience is defined on how great WiFi is, and that's why we've put as much effort into the best gateway device and including innovation like mesh WiFi capability in the home with Plume devices that really I think help us stand out.","We always \u2013 we evaluate competition, we look at competition and whether it's slightly ebbs and flows a little bit more HSD only, we make adjustments, modest adjustments all the time. We're never going to chase low-end. Our general approach, we provide superior products, we differentiate around that, we'll continue to do so. So on X1, I mentioned before that it really is I think does make a difference. We're very different in regards to video competition. And I think the results reflect that. And if you look at the overall video market performance, for us to come in at perhaps 0.5 point, that's very different. And I think to some extent it's driven by X1. And so we look at the benefits of X1, how we compete in terms of acquiring customers, how we retain customers, there are churn benefits and there's revenue opportunities we continue to see. So our view is that X1 continues to give us a good answer in how we compete and we will remain disciplined going after better, more profitable video customers.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you Jonathan. We'll take one last question please.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore-ISI","Thanks. I'm going to \u2013 I think it's for Dave. I think one of the key things that we're trying to figure out, obviously, we know that broadband margins on a contribution basis is higher, but there's a lot of shared cost below across multiple products, but when you start to look at truck rolls and what the main reasons for that are and the calls coming in, what the main reasons for that are. So we had to sort of disaggregate the product that's been bundled unfortunately that's what we're trying to do. Any help on what those share cost mix is between the various products would be helpful? Any color on that? And then just very simply on Comcast has the best broadband offering in terms of speeds and capabilities, but if we price that product lower, would subscribers be higher, in the sense is there a real elasticity for subscriber growth if you price your product lower? Thank you.","David N. Watson - Comcast Corp.","Well, thank you. So we really don't breakout cost, but we do compete if we go after either low-end broadband offers and again, a good example of that is Instant TV, where you accompany a product that does not have a video set-top box being able to deliver it, or if it's HSD-only, it's easier to deliver through the self install kits that drive down cost, easier for customers to activate it on their own. So there are opportunities to drive down operating costs, but we don't break that out across the different product lines.","So in terms of elasticity, we compete across a wide variety of broadband business. And our view is always that lead to a strength that we are different. We lead with the best product, put them together with great video. And we think, over time, we're going to have in terms of broadband performance, you've got to look at the entire year in terms of what we're doing, again, consecutive years we're going to deliver over 1 million broadband net customers and we just consistently do that over and over again. And as Brian said earlier, strong finish to the year is expected. And we think our ability to compete with what we have the best product is the answer.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Let me just say that without breaking out the cost that a majority of Cable's cash flow is broadband, not video, and that is because of programming costs and all the things that we've been talking about. We have now more subs.","And let me just end by, again, going to one number that I'm proud of that, that for the first nine months, we're up 8.5% cash flows. I think we've got a balance between units, innovation, financial performance and great content and leadership in our two businesses. And we thank you for your support.","Jason S.

Roberts","Thanks Jason and good morning everyone. Our second quarter results continue our strong progress in 2014. This is an important time as we focus on gaining approval for our Time Warner Cable transaction. So it\u2019s just as important that the team stays focused on operations, and we believe that\u2019s apparent in this quarter\u2019s results.","Excluding transaction related costs, we grew operating cash flow 7.8% and as you will see there are several bright spots across the company. Let me start with NBCUniversal. They had a great first half and we are really happy with the performance of our team, and we believe this strategically and financially positions us well in the content business.","For the second quarter, results were very strong with operating cash flow growth of over 20%. At NBC Broadcasting, the team has done a terrific job and we ended the season ranked number one in the important 18 to 49 demo and we\u2019re the only network to deliver ratings growth versus last year. This ratings momentum translated into a very strong upfront for us where we made solid progress in closing the monetization gap we have relative to our peers, specifically we were able to achieve approximately 80% in CPMs which was substantially higher than the rest of the market.","In cable networks, we have a great set of assets and channels that are generally under monetized relative to our peers that give us a lot of confidence in our position. In this quarter, NBC Sports Networks had its most watched prime time quarter ever driven by the Stanley Cup playoffs and Bravo continued its claim and is now ranked as the number seven cable entertainment network in the 18 to 49 demo.","But there is no better example of the power of bringing together our broadcast networks, cable networks and strength of our X1 platform in Cable than the Olympics where we were able to leverage the positive experience customers received at the Sochi Olympics to negotiate an extension with the International Olympic Committee whereby we acquired the rights to an additional six Olympic games.","Sports rights are so valuable and we believe these rights are both unique and compelling, and together, we now have the right to the Olympic Games running through the year, 2032. In parts, we have been investing behind what we see as a significant opportunity. We recently opened Harry Potter 2 in Orlando, and the work is creative and authentic, imaginative and the attention to detail is incredible. Many of us were recently down in Orlando and got to experience the new attraction. It was amazing, and the whole team deserves a lot of congratulations. When you combine this with the increased hotel capacity with the also imaginative Cabana Bay beach resort, the parks business is set up for a strong trajectory.","In film, we had a relatively quiet theatrical quarter, we have benefited from recent successful films hitting home entertainment and content licensing windows and so our focus now is building towards a strong slate in 2015 and beyond. So all-in-all NBCUniversal had a terrific first half of 2014 and since we brought the company, we\u2019ve had terrific growth in cash flow and we believe that this progress that we\u2019ve made with ratings of broadcasting success at the upfront and with the new Harry Potter in Orlando NBCUniversal is positioned to continue this momentum.","Our Cable division also delivered impressive results. We operate in a vibrant and competitive market, one that forces us to constantly innovate and improve the customer experience. There is no better example; there\u2019s been our X1 operating system which provides customers an unparalled experience. Our focus is on embedding the best content and technology from the X1 platform, so in the content side for the first time we now offer four of the top 100 Nielsen rated broadcast shows on On Demand.","On the technology side, we are now deploying Cloud DVR and currently have it available in 31% of our footprints. And our customers are responding very favorably to X1. We are so pleased with the impact that we\u2019ve accelerated our pace of deployment. Our X1 additions nearly doubled this quarter, and we are looking again at further increasing the eligibility.","In high-speed data, we now have 47% of our base receiving a 50-megabits or greater products which is up from 38% at the end of the first quarter. Customers now have access to over 3 million Wi-Fi hotspots and we are targeting 8 million by the end of this year, offering customers increased reach in the form of a network of millions of additional hotspots at no extra cost, while offering us the potential for new business opportunities overtime.","For both video and high-speed data, this was the strongest second quarter customer results we\u2019ve had in the past six years. Additionally, in business services revenue growth remains robust at 22% this quarter as we approach a $4 billion revenue run rate. The mid-market segment in business service represents our fastest growing segment and we believe there is a significant opportunity with Time Warner Cable to add to our capabilities in this market and ultimately deliver customers more choice.","We firmly believe that our operating improvements are rooted in providing customers a better experience. And while we are making progress with better service tools and online tools and improved service levels, we are also very cognizant that there is ample room for further improvement and this is a top priority for us. We do feel confident that there are measurable improvements in the experience we are offering customers. This includes faster broadband speed, best in home Wi-Fi where content choice is on more devices and what we believe is the best user interface and guide experience in the market and maybe in the world.","As I said initially, this is an important time for Comcast with lots of opportunity for distraction. So I am so pleased these results demonstrate that our company is focused on operational excellence and once again delivered strong results across all segments. Let me now pass to Michael to cover the second quarter in greater detail.","Michael J. Angelakis","","Good morning, and thank you, Brian. Let me begin by briefly reviewing our second quarter consolidated financial results starting on slide four. We are very pleased with our second quarter results which once again reflect sustainable profitable growth and strength across our businesses.","Second quarter consolidated revenue increased 3.5% to $16.8 billion and operating cash flow increased 7% to $5.8 billion reflecting strong organic growth in both our cable and NBCUniversal businesses. This result includes $44 million of Time Warner Cable and Charter transaction related costs which were included in our corporate and other segments.","Excluding these transaction cost, consolidated operating cash flow increased 7.8%. Year-to-date consolidated revenue increased 8.5% to $34.3 billion and consolidated operating cash flow increased 8.4% to $11.3 billion. If we exclude $1.1 billion of revenue related to the Olympics in the first quarter and $61 million of transaction related cost in the first six months, consolidated revenue increased to 5% and consolidated operating cash flow increased 9%.","Earning per share for the second quarter grew 16.9% to $0.76 per share versus $0.65 per share in the second quarter of 2013. To provide a clear comparison, when you exclude a gain on an investment and the transaction related cost I mentioned, our normalized EPS increased 15.4% to $0.75 per share.","Year-to-date our earnings per share increased 23.5% to $1.47 per share versus $1.19 per share in the prior year, again, excluding gains on sales and acquisition related items our normalized year-to-date earnings per share increased 23.3% to $1.43.","Free cash flow for the quarter decreased 40.7% to $1.2 billion and free cash flow per share decreased 39.7% to $0.44 per share as growth in consolidated operating cash flow was offset by higher working capital due to higher expenditures for film and TV production as well as increased capital expenditures and cash taxes. For the first half of the year, we generated $4 billion of free cash flow, a decrease of 21.8% over the first half of 2013. Year-to-date free cash flow per share has declined 20.5% to $1.51 per share. I will discuss free cash flow in a bit more detail later in the presentation.","Now let\u2019s review the results of our businesses in more detail starting with cable communications on slide five. Our cable communications business continues to execute well and we are pleased with our second quarter performance of healthy revenue and operating cash flow growth along with improved customer metrics. As Brian mentioned, we had the best second quarter customer results for both our video and high-speed internet services in the past six years. The second quarter is always our weakest due to seasonality and we lost 144,000 video customers but this is a 11% improvement from last years second quarter.","In high-speed internet we added 203,000 new customers, an increase of over 8% year-over-year and as we continue to add value to our product through speed upgrades and the deployment of wireless gateways.","Voice remains a valuable component of the bundle and we increased the voice customer base by 137,000 customers in the second quarter with the highest Triple Play selling in over three years. While total customer relationships declined 25,000 reflecting the typical second quarter seasonality which I mentioned, our customer relationship result are a 62% improvement over last years second quarter driven by our improved products and improved customer support.","Second quarter cable revenue increased 5.4% to $11 billion reflecting solid growth in our residential businesses, driven by strong high-speed data results, continued strength in business services and healthy growth in advertising revenue. Total revenue per customer relationship increased 4.5% to $137 per month driven by rate adjustments, a higher contribution for business service and increasing number of customers taking multiple products. At the end of the quarter, 68% of our customers subscribed to atleast two products and 36% subscribed to three products a 200 basis point improvement compared to last years second quarter.","Moving to our product categories, video revenue increased 1.2% reflecting modest rate adjustments in an increasing number of our customers taking advanced services. We now have 12.7 million high-def and\/or DVR customers which equals 57% of our 22.5 million video customers.","High-speed internet was the largest contributor to cable revenue growth in the second quarter with revenue increasing 9.7% driven by continued growth in our customer base, rate adjustments in an increasing number of our customers taking higher speed services. At the end of the quarter, 47% of our residential high-speed customers received speeds of 50-megabits or greater as we have doubled the speeds included in some of our bundled plans.","With regard to voice, revenue increased 1.3% for the second quarter, driven by growth in our customer base as our bundling efforts continue to drive Triple Play penetration. We are successfully converting single and double play customers to Triple Play, and acquiring new Triple Play customer relationships resulting in a net addition of 152,000 Triple product customer relationships during the quarter.","Moving on to our commercial business, second quarter business services revenue increased 22.4% to $965 million and was again the second largest contributor to cable revenue growth in the quarter. The small end of the market or businesses with less than 20 employees continues to have strong growth, while the contribution from mid-sized businesses is increasing. We continue to experience real momentum in this business and are focused on competing effectively in gaining share.","Cable advertising revenue increased 7.5% primarily reflecting higher automotive advertising and political revenue as we are beginning to benefit from advertising for the upcoming mid-term elections. Excluding this political revenue, our core cable advertising increased 3.2%.","Please refer to Slide six. During the second quarter, cable communications operating cash flow increased 5.3% to $4.6 billion, representing a consistent margin of 41.4%. In the second quarter, total expenses in cable increased 5.4% primarily reflecting higher programming expenses and advertising marketing and promotion expenses as well as additional cost related to the deployment of X1, Cloud DVR and wireless gateways as well as the expansion of our business services and XFINITY Home.","The second quarter programming expenses increases 6.7% reflecting increases in retransmission consent fees, higher sports programming costs, and step-ups for recently completed long-term agreements. We expect programming expense growth to accelerate in the second half of 2014 due to the timing of network launches and mid-year step ups and certain long term contracts. We now expect our full year programming expenses to be slightly lower than the 9% to 10% we had previously forecast.","Advertising, marketing and promotion expenses increased 8% in the second quarter due to timing as well as increased investments to enhance our competitive position in both our residential and commercial businesses resulting in a positive impact on our core customer metrics.","We remain focused on gaining efficiencies in our customer service and technical operations, however, we have experienced modest expense growth as a majority of our Triple Play connects are X1 and as we deploy Cloud DVR, wireless gateways and XFINITY Home across our customer base. We are not only committed to offering the best products, we want to support them with a great customer experience and in some cases that means investing more time at the customers home or answering additional questions on a customer service call. However, overall we continue to experience reduce truck rolls and Asian car volumes and 44% of our installations are now completed with self installation kits. Our expectation is this number will grow as we are beginning to offer X1 self installations.","We are effectively off-setting some of these higher expenses with an improving product mix with more high-speed data in business service customers and increasing number of our customers upgrading to higher level of services such as high-def DVRs, faster internet speeds and modest rate adjustments.","Overall, our second quarter and year-to-date cable results prove that we are balanced in our strategy, and we continue to execute well and deliver strong financial customer and operational performance. We are focused on delivering the best and most innovative products and providing more value to our customers. Now lets move on to NBCUniversal\u2019s results which are presented on slide seven.","For the second quarter of 2014, NBCUniversal performed very well as revenue increased 0.3% and operating cash flow increased 20.4%. Now let\u2019s review the individual business segments at NBCUniversal. For the second quarter, cable networks generated revenue of $2.5 billion, an increase of 2.6% driven by a 14.3% increase in content licensing and other revenue and a 4.2% increase in distribution revenue. However, if we adjust with the closure of the Style Network, distribution revenue would have increased 6%.","Advertising revenue declined 2.2% as increases in price were offset by some ratings pressure, however, when adjusted again for the closure of Style and the movement of Fandango from our cable networks group to our film group, advertising revenue would have increased 1%.","Cable networks operating cash flow increased 6.3% to $914 million, reflecting higher revenue, partially offset by higher sports programming costs, including a new long term relationship with Philadelphia Phillies on Comcast SportsNet and a continued impact of a launch of English Premier League on NBC Sports Network.","With regards to our broadcast television segment, revenue increased 4.9% to $1.8 billion in the second quarter, reflecting increased retransmission consent fees and the impact of new content licensing agreements.","Advertising revenue was down slightly at 1.7% due to the timing of the voice which aired significantly few hours in the second quarter compared to last year. Year-to-date advertising revenue is up 5.8% excluding the impact of the Sochi Olympics which is more indicative of the rating strength in the broadcast segment.","Broadcast\u2019s second quarter operating cash flow increased 16.2% to $240 million reflecting higher revenue and a modest increase in operating expenses. We are really pleased with the overall performance of the broadcast business. In just three and a half years, we have improved from fourth place to ending this past broadcast season in first place in a 18 to 49 demo. This rating success, as well as the strength across our portfolio of cable networks help us make meaningful progress in closing the monetization gap both on the broadcast side and on the cable side.","For Broadcast, we had double digit growth overall with CPM increases of 8% leading the market in both rate of change and volume growth. As we move to filmed entertainment, second quarter revenue declined 15.3% to $1.2 billion driven by difficult theatrical comparisons to last year which included Fast 6, and the international performance of Despicable Me 2 partially offset by an increasing in content licensing revenue driven by Despicable Me 2 and Fast 6 as well as the home entertainment performance of successful films like Ride Along and Lone Survivor.","Second quarter operating cash flow increased $162 million to $195 million as this year\u2019s reduced theatrical slate recorded significantly lower marketing and advertising cost compared to last year.","Switching to our theme park segment, revenue increased 12.8% to $615 million, reflecting increases in per capita spending in guest attendance at both our Orlando and Hollywood Parks, which benefited in part from the spring holidays occurring in the second quarter this year, compared to the first quarter of last year. Second quarter operating cash flow for the parks increased 5.6% to $244 million reflecting higher revenue, partly offset by increased marketing and training expenses to support the successful launch of the new Harry Potter attraction in Orlando which opened on July 8.","Let\u2019s move to Slide eight to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. In the second quarter, capital expenditures are tracking to plan an increased 19.4% to $1.8 billion compared to the second quarter of 2013 which is driven primarily by increased investments at cable and a modest increase at NBCUniversal.","At cable communications, second quarter capital expenditures increased $253 million or 20.4% to $1.5 billion, equal to 13.5% of cable revenue versus 11.9% in the second quarter of 2013. The increase was primarily driven by higher spending on CPE, particularly for X1 and Cloud DVR as well as our continued investments in network infrastructure to increase our network capacity.","Year-to-date cable communications capital expenditure have increased 13% to $2.6 billion representing 12.1% of cable revenue. We continue to be very pleased with our X1 rollout. We\u2019ve almost doubled our X1 net additions in each of the past two quarters and the positive customer results have continued. More customers are subscribing to DVRs and additional outlets upgrading the Triple Play, increasing video-on-demand usage and we continue to see reduced churn levels among these customers.","As planned, our cable CapEx spend will accelerate in the second half of the year as we continue to deploy more X1 platform boxes and wireless gateways and we continue to expect that for the full year of 2014, cable capital intensity will increase to approximately 14% of cable revenue compared to 12.9% in 2013.","Second quarter capital expenditures at NBCUniversal, increased $38 million to $298 million and year-to-date have increased $66 million to $589 million. This higher CapEx is primarily driven by increased investments in facilities as well as the theme parks as we build new attractions including the Harry Porter attraction, in both parks at a Fast & Furious attraction in Hollywood. We continue to expect that NBCUniversal\u2019s 2014 capital expenditures will remain relatively flat at 2013\u2019s level.","Please refer to Slide nine. As I mentioned earlier, we generated consolidated free cash flow of $1.2 billion in the second quarter, a decrease of 40.7% as growth in consolidated operating cash flow was primarily offset by increased working capital, which was mainly driven by net production spend at our film and TV studios as well as higher cash taxes and capital expenditures.","For the first half of the year we generated $4 billion in free cash flow, a decrease of 21.8% over the first half of 2013 and year-to-date free cash flow per share has decreased 20.5% to $1.51 per share again, primarily reflecting increased working capital. As I indicated on our fourth quarter earnings call compared to a modest film slate in 2014, we have increased our film production spending as we prepare for a larger 2015 film slate, which will pressure free cash flow during 2014. Saying that, we would expect second half working capital comparisons in 2014 to be more favorable than what we have experienced in the first half of this year.","We are executing on our 2014 financial plan and year-to-date we have increased our return of capital to shareholders by 33.5% to $2.6 billion, including share repurchases totaling $1.5 million and dividend payments totaling $1.1 billion.","Turning to our acquisition of Time Warner Cable and our related transactions with Charter, we remained focused on our regulatory and share holder approvals as well as our integration planning. We are pleased that the FCC has started its 180-day review clock as of July 10. In addition, we are progressing towards a share holder vote on the Time Warner Cable merger as quickly as possible realizing that the divestiture transactions with Charter have added some complexity to the normal SEC review of our S4 filing. ","At this point we currently believe a reasonable estimate for the timing of our shareholder vote would be in the fall. This does not have any impact on the FCC or Department of Justice review processes and is not expected to impact the timing of the closing of the deal. As we have mentioned before, we remain committed to repurchasing an additional 2.5 billion in shares following our shareholder approval for the transaction.","So all-in-all we\u2019ve had a strong first half of the year in both cable and NBCUniversal. We are pleased with the financial and operational momentum we\u2019re showing in all of our businesses and we are focused on continuing that momentum throughout the year. We are making meaningful progress on the integration planning of the Time Warner Cable merger and the Charter divestitures. We remain excited about the strategic benefits these transactions bring to Comcast and the value they create for our customers and our shareholders.","Finally, we remained confident that our ongoing investments along with our focused and disciplined execution will continue to yield positive results and profitable growth.","Now let me turn the call over to Jason for Q&A","Jason Armstrong","Thanks, Michael. Regina, let\u2019s open up the call for Q&A please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now begin the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ben Swinburne - Morgan Stanley","Thank you. Good morning. This is really for anybody who wants to take it. I wanted to revisit the X1 trends which obviously sound encouraging. I\u2019m wondering if you could spend a little more time telling me what that\u2019s doing to the business and particularly what the Cloud DVR means to the consumer experience, to the economics of the product and whether the success you\u2019ve had has changed. How you view the ultimate adoption of that product in your base.","And I\u2019m wondering if it impacts your broadband business. You\u2019re putting up double-digit revenue growth this far into the penetration curve. Is the X1 helping sort of the other products in the bundle as well?","Neil Smit","This is Neil. So the X1 rollout we are very pleased with. We\u2019re in 100% of the footprint right now. It\u2019s brought down churn 20% to 30%, VOD usage up 25%, and VOD transactions up 20%. Additionally, you\u2019re getting two times the DVR take rate on it and you\u2019re getting more additional outlets.","So the ARPU of the product once it\u2019s deployed has gone up very nicely. It\u2019s still not having a material impact on the video results, because that hasn\u2019t been deployed to a large portion of our base yet. We\u2019re about 50% of the Triple Play packages that we sold had X1 in them and where that\u2019s been deployed its worked well.","In terms of the impact on the HSD business, I mean, I think bringing internet functionality to video experience will help lift the -- both products and our Triple Play sell-in was at the highest rate ever. We\u2019ve got more -- 68% of our customers on two products or more. And so we are selling well in the Triple Play and X1 is a great part of that. I think there is some really interesting new product developments. I mean, if you think about it, we\u2019ve launched EST on that over the last six months and that\u2019s been a very successful product. And I think there is more to come on the platform.","Brian L. Roberts","On the Cloud DVR part, it\u2019s Brian. We\u2019re very encouraged by what that product means. It basically means that inside your home any device whether it\u2019s a mobile phone or a tablet or a Kindle by any of the different providers, can become a television set without a box. And then you can use -- see all the channels, as well as access your DVR. And then it gives you a feature to download and take with you certain shows from that DVR. So, the Cloud has tremendous promise not just for the guide interface but for the user\u2019s functionality.","The other thing, and one of the reasons I think the results Neil just talked about are so encouraging, is you also get a whole home DVR with the X1 experience of any of our customers. So just everything gets better, the -- those of who that have the product, if you just look at On Demand in the last week, there is a whole new series of ways to see what\u2019s on television.","Its \u2013 the guide just gets better and better every few weeks, not every few years. And right now, we have all sorts of categories that are being stunted, so you can see the Top 10 types of shows you like every single night of the week, the best shows of the day. Really it\u2019s very programmer friendly, because it encourages people -- you don\u2019t have to DVR, its basically right there for you On Demand now that we have Top 100 shows.","Ben Swinburne - Morgan Stanley","Thanks for the color.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks, Ben. Let\u2019s move to the next question, please.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thank you. On NBCUniversal I guess two-part question. You obviously had a great relative upfront performance, but the ad market was down. And so I would love your views on how -- if the advertising market, what\u2019s going on in advertising for Broadcasting and Cable? Do you see the decline is cyclical or secular? And if it\u2019s even somewhat secular how are you positioning your assets differently?","And also on NBCU, given the likely consolidation in content, how are you positioning your assets differently. Do you need to bulk up?","Stephen B. Burke","We certainly don\u2019t think we need to bulk up in content. We\u2019ve sold all of our Broadcasting and Cable assets together in the upfront and I think that was a major reason why we had such a successful upfront relative to rest of the industry.","If the industry was down call it 5% in the upfront, we\u2019re not sure of the precise number, but that\u2019s what we gather is pretty close. If the industry was down 5% and we were up 10% that\u2019s a 15% difference versus what we would have done -- had we done exactly what the industry did. And you apply that to a base of $5.3 billion and it\u2019s a swing of $750 million.","And the reason why that occurred is because we made the investments in programming, NBC was number one. People came to us first and we sold together. So that\u2019s $750 million improvement we think goes a long way not all the way, but a long way to closing what we\u2019ve always refer to as the monetization gap. We\u2019ve always said that the other broadcasters are on the order of $1 billion better off than we are.","So we closed $750 million of the gap. We think we\u2019re about half way and so we can continue to count on closing that gap providing the fact that our ratings are good and we continue to bundle the properties and sell appropriately.","In terms of the overall market, I think the real question is what is scatter? And if scatter ends up being strong, this could end up being a very good year for advertising, and if scatter ends up weak that will obviously not be the case. So, we don\u2019t put too much into the down 5% in the upfront. I think the year is going to play itself out and we\u2019ll see where we end. There is some shift to digital. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s the majority factors here. That\u2019s a minority factor. And I think the real question is what\u2019s going to happen as the calendar and broadcast seasons play out","Jessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Can I -- I want to just ask one follow-up for Brian. You said the eligibility of X1 is increasing. Can you just clarify, what do you mean?","Brian L. Roberts","Neil, why don\u2019t you do that?","Neil Smit","Yeah, the X1 product is currently available to all Triple Play customers and it\u2019s available in the Retention Q as well as to some of the double play customers depending on their packaging.","Brian L. Roberts","So what we mean by that is you can then go to more Double Play customers or other or even Single Play. So it\u2019s just who can get the product in the beginning. We had inventory issues and also we\u2019re looking at the ability to use it as a sales tool. But we have not put out -- the rate of installations continues as I said earlier, continues to increase each quarter and its scaling really well. There haven\u2019t been any big hiccups at all and frankly just the opposite.","Neil Smit","Yeah, I describe it as ramping up the business right now. The last two sequential quarters we\u2019ve doubled the number of boxes we\u2019ve deployed. So, I think we\u2019re seeing it ramp up and it\u2019s been very stable, the platform has been.","Jessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Do you want to use this as an opportunity to say how many boxes?","Neil Smit","","No. Thanks.","","Jason Armstrong","","That\u2019s okay Jessica. We\u2019ll go to the next question.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Phil Cusick - JPMorgan","Hey, guys. I guess following up on Jessica\u2019s questions fairly quickly. Can you help us quantify the remaining discount to peers on advertising, sort of where NBC should be versus where you are? I think you said 50%, but can you help us quantify that?","Stephen B. Burke","What we\u2019ve said before that, if you at NBC and then you look at USA, sort of our biggest cable channel that they were trading at about a 20% discount on CPMs to our competition. And really when you look at it, it\u2019s not as precise as just looking at number. You also have to factor in volume. But we think if you take volume and rate and you look at them both, we were at about a 20% discount and we\u2019re now at about a 10% discount.","Phil Cusick - JPMorgan","Okay. And then also on the X1 side, just a quick follow-up, you said it\u2019s available to Triple Plays and some Double Plays, why not widen that availability to everyone, what are the gating factors?","Neil Smit","Well, we\u2019re basically trying to maximize the return on our capital, and we want to make sure that we\u2019re rolling out the product to customers where we know there is a good return. And also as Brian said we initially had some inventory issues, those have since been resolved. But put it -- I describe it as we\u2019re ramping as quickly as we can and the product has been very well received.","Michael J. Angelakis","The only thing I would add to that, Phil, is really as we rolled it out early, we really wanted to use it as a premium product and we had a lot of folks who were wanting that product, so, we want to go to those folks who have the highest customer lifetime value and that\u2019s both in terms of higher ARPU, more services and lower churn.","Phil Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan","Thanks, guys.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks, Phil. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Jason Bazinet - Citigroup","Yeah. Can I -- just back to the Mr. Burke for a second. You mentioned the upfront -- I guess your estimate upfront down 5%, you said the shift to digital is not the majority of what\u2019s going on. Do you mind elaborating and what you think is the majority and what causes you to draw that conclusion? Thanks.","Stephen B. Burke","I think -- and by the way this is not a science and we don\u2019t have perfect information on every single participant and what\u2019s going.","Jason Bazinet - Citigroup","Sure.","Stephen B. Burke","But when you look at the ad dollars that are related to video, the shift to digital doesn\u2019t -- in our opinion doesn\u2019t represent the majority of why the upfront was down 5%. We think the majority reason why the upfront was down 5% is because of broad array of advertisers and their agencies decided to be less aggressive in the upfront and they will show up in scatter.","Jason Bazinet - Citigroup","Okay.","Stephen B. Burke","Okay. Now that maybe wrong, but that\u2019s our analysis.","Jason Bazinet - Citigroup","Okay.","Neil Smit","I think, Jason, from the Cable perspective as an advertiser, while we\u2019ve seen a movement towards digital has not come generally speaking at the expense of our media spend.","Jason Bazinet - Citigroup","Understood. Okay, thank you.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks, Jason. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John Hodulik - UBS","Thanks. Maybe question for Michael. Just a clarification on the buyback with the shareholder vote getting push back a little bit. You guys have changed the guidance to $5.5 billion, but that was I think under the impression that the shareholder vote will take place in the middle of the year.","Now is it happening let\u2019s say end of third quarter, does that slide back the $5.5 billion. I mean, should we assume that you do sort of $2 billion in the fourth quarter then maybe $2 million in the first -- how should we think of the sort of timing of that?","And then I guess for Neil on the broadband side, the numbers were I think stronger then we expect in terms of the net ads. Can you give us a sense of what you think from a competitive standpoint? Did you see any less competitive pressure than you have in the past maybe from some of the larger telcos? Thanks.","Michael J. Angelakis","I\u2019ll take the buyback one. Really, we don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll have the shareholder vote. Our hope is we\u2019ll have it in the fall. And really the plan has been that between the shareholder vote and when the deal actually closes we will execute an additional $2.5 billion of buyback.","So our teams are ready to go, but obviously we need to get through the SEC, get the S-4 filed and go through a variety of other things. Our hope is we\u2019ll get it all done this year including closing of the transaction. We\u2019ll have to see how that all plays out both from a shareholder approval perspective and obviously from a regulatory perspective. But I think the key point is between shareholder vote and when closing we\u2019re going to try our best to executive on an additional $2.5 billion.","Neil Smit","And on the competitiveness of the data market, it\u2019s still very competitive. We\u2019ve been upgrading our customers to higher speeds. We now have 47% of the residential customers get at least 50 megabits per second versus 33% last year. So its -- we\u2019re getting customers on to better higher speeds. We\u2019re investing heavily in the best fastest in-home Wi-Fi, but it is a very competitive market.","John Hodulik - UBS","Great. Thanks, guys.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks, John. Next question please.","Operator","Your question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson","Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask a couple of questions about Wi-Fi if I could. Neil, I think you said you\u2019re going to have 8 million hotspots. How many of those are public hotspots versus dual SSID? And can you updates us on your thinking about whether the Wi-Fi business would become a retail strategy or whether it\u2019s continued to be tied to your terrestrial broadband product?","And then last, can you talk about how you think about spectrum as it relates to Wi-Fi would you like to have license spectrum -- or a license LTE component of \u2013 that would sort of substitute for Wi-Fi with better interference? Or do you see it as an unlicensed product entirely?","Neil Smit","With regards to the hotspots we have about 3.6 million hotspots across the in-home network right now. Of the 8 million we\u2019re going to, the majority of those close to 7 million will be in-home versus out of home. We\u2019re currently extending the out of home markets at a pretty aggressive pace and so the network will fill out. And you would add to those in-homes, those SMB locations where we have dual SSIDs.","In terms of spectrum and how we think of it. We think our Wi-Fi network has a lot of potential. We\u2019re not buttoned down totally on how we\u2019d like to deploy that. But there\u2019s lot of opportunities for example, the XFINITY home product we launched across the Wi-Fi network and there are other products that Wi-Fi can be the foundation for.","So we\u2019re going to continue deploying it. We have the fastest in-home Wi-Fi routers and they\u2019re going to keep developing that product. And I think that we\u2019re seeing 75% to 80% of data usage -- mobile data usage, its happening either in the home or in the office, so we think we\u2019re well positioned going forward.","Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson","And can you talk about your strategy for a wireless replacement product versus a terrestrial supplement product?","Neil Smit","We haven\u2019t finished our planning yet, but as you know we do have some MVNO relationships and those -- if we elected to, could play a role.","Craig Moffett \u2013 MoffettNathanson","Thanks, Neil.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks, Craig, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with ISI Group. Please go ahead.","Vijay Jayant - ISI Group","Neil, now that you have some more time to sort of evaluate the Time Warner Cable, its synergies, can you sort of give us any update on sort of how you feel about the $1.5 billion number on the cost side and any color on the revenue side? Thanks.","Neil Smit","Yeah, we feel very good about the cost synergies. They are in duplicated areas or in operations and we\u2019ve gone through quite a bit of detail, the make up of those synergies, the cost synergies and feel very good about them.","In terms of the revenue opportunities, we\u2019ve also been through those and I think the opportunity to up sell and penetrate to a greater rate on the resi product is an interesting opportunity, as well as the opportunity to go into the enterprise base with commercial or of a more advanced advertising products across the broader base. So we feel -- net-net we feel good about the synergies on the cost side and the CapEx side which were about $400 million and we also feel positive about the revenue upside.","Michael J. Angelakis","The only think I would add, Vijay, I think you know we did these divestiture transactions and even with the divestiture transactions we\u2019re reconfirming what we think our operating expense savings will be through the synergies and obviously the vast majority of those don\u2019t come from the programming side. So, when we did the original transaction we set a target and even after the divestiture transactions we\u2019re confirming that target is something that we think make sense.","Vijay Jayant - ISI Group","Great. Thank you.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks, Vijay. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Bryan Kraft with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Bryan Kraft - Evercore Partners","Hi. Thanks. Michael, I had a working capital question. Whatever the working capital use ends up being this year for Film and Television, would you expect essential a full reversal of that next year as this production investments at the box office and television? And I don\u2019t know if you could provide any range for what you expect the net working capital use to be this year that would be really helpful? Thanks.","Michael J. Angelakis","So obviously working capital was a large factor in the first half of this year with regards to investing in more film and more TV, but I think a little bit of it normally is actually more in 2013 than in 2014 or 2015.","If you really look at our 2014 slate, it\u2019s a relatively modest slate and we really didn\u2019t invest that much in film related in 2013 and I think as you we talked about, we have quite a bit of positive working capital in 2013 that obviously helped out. There\u2019s been some reversal of that in the first half of 2014 where we are building up a more meaningful slate in 2015.","We actually have a great slate plan for 2015 and we\u2019re investing in that. As we look at all of 2014 I think you\u2019ll see a bit of a swing to more normalization in the second half of the year. And our expectation is really that 2013 and a little of 2014 were a bit of anomalies given how we managed the film slates, but 2015 should normalized. I don\u2019t want to get too much into 2015, but we feel that really what we\u2019re seeing is in 2014 is what actually was in effect in 2013 versus next year. Is that helped you, Bryan?","Bryan Kraft - Evercore Partners","Yeah, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks, Bryan. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays","Thank you. A couple of questions. The first is on dynamic ad insertion. I mean, we have seen some deals this year on dynamic ad insertion, but the way I understand it is there has to be backend support, especially from Comcast, just given the technology component of this. So just from a structure perspective, how are these contracts structured between you, the advertiser and the content company on the dynamic aspect?","And secondly, as we look at the asset base post all the transactions which are outstanding right now, are you right now at a stage where you expect this to be the steady-state? Or should we expect a few more asset swaps and so on to fill out some of the holes that you have especially in regions like New York?","Brian Roberts","","I\u2019ll take the dynamic ad insertion. We basically do that through Canoe. We\u2019ve done deals with all the programmers where we almost told the programmers where we disabled Fast Forward in exchange for full VOD line up. And then we \u2013 the programmers were able to with Canoe insert those ads dynamically in the pre post and mid row. We haven\u2019t disclosed the nature of the financial transaction though.","Michael J. Angelakis","","I mean, we really don\u2019t see any further activity. We have quite a full plate and we are very focused on integration and obviously we\u2019ve got to spend that we are going to be doing so. I think that we\u2019re really focused on our business and the reality is that we are very excited about having those assets come to us from Time Warner Cable and from Charter and the clustering will do so, I think our plate is quite full.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays","Thank you.","Brian Roberts","Thanks, Kannan. Regina lets take our last question, please.","Operator","","Our final question will come from the line of Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Mike, your line maybe on mute. And that question has been withdrawn.","Brian L. Roberts","Okay, lets try one more then.","Operator","Okay, Amy Yong with Macquarie, your line is open.","Amy Yong - Macquarie","Thanks. I was just wondering if you could talk about the impact of the AT&T DTV merger. How does this change your view as a competitor of perhaps different product sets including a quad play or mobile video? And then you can talk about how that might change the longer-term regulatory picture? Thanks","Brian L. Roberts","Well this is Brian. I think, first of all they are two wonderful companies with wonderful products and you know the reality is last six years they both have been part of the reason that we have lost video subs and that\u2019s why you are seeing some of the competitive response and the progress we are making which I am very pleased about, but it\u2019s a very powerful combination and you know its sort of for me validates the changing and dynamic nature of the market that we are living in, the technological changes, the consumer behavior changes that are happening at very fast speeds.","And so, you have to look at each situation differently and individually one of the things that I like about our transaction from the regulatory standpoint is that the nature of the cable business is you wire up an entire community and then you see what customers you can get, other technologies whether from the Cloud or from satellite you know are ubiquitously available by a different technology. So we do not overlap in any market as you know with Time Warner Cable hence there is no diminish competitive choice for any consumer.","So each situation is different. I think long term we are assuming it and we always did assume that the world is changing who your competitors are, what their capabilities are, whether its quad play or other things. And I think our company is really well positioned and that\u2019s why we are excited about the proposed transaction. But as I started the call right now the main focus of this company is to execute well quarter after quarter, and as we end this call, I just want to say that everybody I think we did that again this quarter and we hope to do it again next quarter. Thank you. We\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks everyone for joining us.","Operator","","There will be a replay available of today\u2019s call starting at 12:30 PM Eastern Standard Time.

At this time all participants are in a listen only mode.  Please note that this conference call is being recorded.  I will now turn the call over to Senior Vice President Investor Relations Ms. Marlene Dooner.  ","Marlene Dooner","","Welcome everyone to our second quarter earnings call.  Joining me on the call here in Philadelphia is Michael Angelakis and joining us from London are Brian Roberts, Steve Burke, and Neil Smit.  As we have done in the past Brian and Michael will make formal remarks and Steve and Neil will also be available for Q&A.

At NBC we\u2019re achieving record breaking ratings and as you know we have significantly expanded our coverage so viewers have more choices than ever to watch the Olympics across nine broadcasting cable channels, on TV, and online in English and in Spanish.  If you\u2019re a Comcast Cable custom we\u2019re making it available every minute, every medal, on every screen, really making TV everywhere a reality for our customers, many for the first time.","We\u2019re seeing record numbers on every channel, on demand, on the Internet, and on mobile.  This reality is a huge technical undertaking and I have to say I\u2019m thrilled so far.  I\u2019m equally pleased to report solid operating results for the second quarter driven by another outstanding quarter in cable.  With revenue and operating cash flow growth of about 6% and cable free cash flow of $1.3 billion.","High speed Internet and business service continue to add power to cable growth in the second quarter and we kept up the trend of improving year-over-year customer performance.  We reduced video subscriber losses by 62,000 which is our best second in four years and the seventh quarter in a row of improving video results.  We believe we can continue to make steady progress on subscribers with our focus on technical and product leadership, on transforming the service experience and by accelerating innovation.  ","High speed data net adds of 156,000 grew 8% and voice had a really good quarter with 158,000 net adds as well.  Cable also maintained its momentum in new product deliver.  Our Xfinity Home product is now available in 95% of the footprint adding another growth opportunity for cable.  We\u2019re now also marketing Skype on Xfinity nationwide.  We more than doubled the reach of our cross marketing partnership with Verizon Wireless to 21 markets.","In June we expanded our X1 cloud based guide to our first major market Boston and just this week we are launching in Atlanta with the plan to be in five major markets and deployed in hundreds of thousands of homes by the end of this year.  We\u2019re also continuously enhancing our existing products increasing the video content choices available on products like Streampix which now offers twice as many titles as we had when we just launched in February and increasing the speeds of our high speed services at no additional cost to our customers.  The seventh increase in nine years where we have done this for our customers.","By enhancing our products, improving the customer experience, accelerating the pace of innovation we\u2019ve been putting our new Xfinity brand to life.  We are now ready for the next phase of Xfinity which will highlight new innovations, [work horse] platform functionalities and even better user experience and so we launched our new Xfinity advertising campaign during the open ceremony of the Olympics really defining for our customers and non-customers the Xfinity brand promise.  As we deliver new entertainment and communication experiences we call it Xfinity the future of awesome.  We think this will resonate because it reflects how our customers will use, enjoy, and respond to our products.  ","Let me now switch to NBCUniversal where we also continue to be very positive about the future whether it\u2019s the cable channel or broadcast, theme parks or films, our goal is to make all of these businesses more valuable.  Clearly there is more quarterly variability in our results of NBCUniversal than the rest of the company and for the second quarter NBCUniversal\u2019s results came in as we anticipated.  ","Michael will take you through all the details but after a 34% increase in cash flow in the first quarter, a combination of tough comparisons related to content licensing, program expense timing, and disappointing performance in our film business resulted in a 15% decline in operation cash flow for the second quarter.  So when you look beyond the quarterly fluctuations to the first half of the year NBCUniversal grew revenue by 8%, operating cash flow by 2% and generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow.","So the entire company is actually doing really well across a lot of different businesses but I guess being here in London I feel ever better about the future of our company.  Ad sales are strong and we\u2019re having absolutely record breaking Olympics.  Affiliates are pleased and carrying our channels in more homes than ever before and the consumers are winning with Xfinity\u2019s new technologies and getting more value than ever for their subscriptions.  Comcast really is in a unique position to make all this possible.  ","Let me now toss it over to Michael to go into the financials of the second quarter in greater detail.","Michael J. Anglelakis ","Let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated financial results starting on Slide Four.  Overall we are pleased with our second quarter results which reflects sustainable and profitable growth as well as the fundamental strength of our core businesses.  Second quarter consolidated revenue increased 6.1% to $15.2 billion and operating cash flow increased 4.2% to $5 billion reflecting strong organic growth in our cable business as well as consolidating the remaining 50% of the Universal Orlando as of July 1, 2011.  ","Free cash flow for the quarter, which excludes any impact of the economic stimulus increased just over 2% to $1.6 billion reflecting growth in consolidated operating cash flow and improvements in working capital partially offset by higher taxes as well as higher capitalized software and intangible asset expenditures.  Our Cable Communications in corporate and other areas accounted for $1.3 billion or 86% of total free cash flow and NBCUniversal contributed $218 million or 14% of consolidated free cash flow.  Free cash flow per share increased approximately 6% to $0.57 per share.","Earnings per share for the second quarter grew 35% to $0.50 per share versus $0.37 per share in the second quarter of 2011.  Excluding a $137 million non-cash non-recurring income tax charge in the second quarter of last year, our normalized EPS increased 19% in the second quarter.  ","Now, let\u2019s take a look at proforma results of our Cable Communications and NBCUniversal businesses on Slide Five.  As you know, we believe the proforma presentation provides a more meaningful comparison of the operating performance of the businesses.  Therefore, proforma results are presented as if NBCUniversal and the Universal Orlando transaction were both effective on January 1, 2010. ","For the second quarter 2012, consolidated proforma revenue increased 3.5% to $15.2 billion and consolidated proforma operating cash flow increased 1% to $5 billion.  Year-to-date our proforma revenue increased in excess of 6% to $30.1 billion and proforma operating cash flow increased 5% to $9.7 billion.  ","For the second quarter Cable Communications was the primary growth driver as revenue increased 6% to $9.9 billion and represented 65% of our consolidated revenue while cable operating cash flow grew 5.5% to $4.1 billion and represented 82% of our consolidated operating cash flow.  ","For the second quarter NBCUniversal had relatively flat revenue of $5.5 billion and NBCUniversal operating cash flow decreased to 15% to $982 million.  As Brian mentioned, and I\u2019ll detail later, second quarter NBCUniversal results were impacted by difficult comparisons related to the timing of content licensing in sports programming as well as the underperformance of our film segment.  However, on a year-to-date basis NBCUniversal\u2019s revenue increased approximately 8% to $11 billion and operating cash flow increased just shy of 2% to $1.8 billion.  ","Let\u2019s move to the next Slide to review Cable Communications\u2019 results in more detail.  We had another strong quarter of financial and customer growth in our Cable Communications business.  For the second quarter cable revenue increased 6% to $9.9 billion reflecting growth in our residential businesses, continued strength in business services, and solid growth in advertising.  As a result, total revenue per video customer increased 8% to $149 per month.","Also contributing to this growth is an increasing number of customers taking multiple products.  At the end of the quarter almost three quarters of our video customers took at least two products and almost 40% took all three services versus 35% in the second quarter of last year.  Despite the typically second quarter seasonality in many of our cable markets, we experienced strong growth in our customer metrics and continued to show year-over-year improvements in our results.","Combined video, high speed Internet, and voice customers increased by 138,000 a 40% increase in net customer additions compared to the second quarter 2011.  As Brian mentioned, we once again reduced our video customer losses.  In the second quarter we lost 176,000 video subscribers a 26% improvement from the second quarter of last year despite a telco competitive footprint that is increased and now stands at approximately 40%.","Our second quarter video revenue increased 2.8% reflecting great increases in an increasing number of our customers taking higher levels of digital and advanced services.  In the second quarter we added 67,000 advance service customers and deployed 563,000 advance boxes and now have 11.2 million HD indoor DVR customers equal to 54% of our 21 million digital customers.","In addition to the improved video results we added 156,000 new high speed Internet customers during the quarter marking the 12th consecutive quarter we have gained share by differentiating our products and services and speed enhancement.  High speed Internet revenue was the largest contributor to cable revenue growth in the second quarter with revenue increasing 9% reflecting rate adjustments, continued growth in our customer base and an increasing number of our customers taking higher speed services.  At the end of the quarter our penetration was 36% of homes passed and 27% of our residential high speed Internet customers take a higher speed tier above our primary service.  ","With regard to voice revenue increased just over 1% for the quarter reflecting continued growth in our customer base as we added 158,000 voice customers and our performance over the last three quarters as improved as we have increased our Triple Play conversion metrics.  At the end of the quarter our penetration was 18% of homes passed.  ","We continue to see real momentum in business services which was our second largest contributor to cable revenue growth in the second quarter with revenue increasing 34% to $582 million.  The small end of this market or businesses with less than 20 employees now accounts for 85% of business service revenue and is a meaningful driver of growth.  Midsized business revenue now represents about 15% of revenue and is growing faster but off a smaller base.  Cable advertising revenues increased 7.6% reflecting higher automotive advertising and political revenue as we begin to benefit from advertising for the upcoming elections.  Excluding this political revenue our core cable advertising increased 4%.  ","Please refer to Slide Seven.  Second quarter Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 5.5% to $4.1 billion representing a margin of 41.4%.  In the second quarter total expenses in Cable increased 6.3% primarily reflecting higher video programming and sales and marketing expenses as well as additional costs to expand the capabilities of business services and other new initiatives.","Program expenses increased 7.9% in the second quarter as we continued to expand the amount of content we provide to consumers across multiple platforms.  For the first six months of 2012 our program expenses increased 6.7% and for the full year we expect programming expenses to grow at high single digit rates.  In addition, sales and marketing expenses increased 9.7% as a result of higher overall media spending to enhance our competitive position in both our residential and business services.","As we begin to market new products like Xfinity Home, Xfinity Signature Support and Streampix we have also increased our investments in direct sales to more effectively target potential customers.  We continue to offset these increased expenses through efficiencies and in proven product mix as well as increasing the number of our customers upgrading to higher tiers of services such as HD DVRs or premium Internet tiers.  In addition, we remain very focused and believe we can continue to gain efficiencies in our customer service and technical operations.  ","We have reduced our truck rolls by more than $8 million in the last two years even as we added 2.8 million total new customers.  Our service is improving and our customers are electing more self installations which increased by approximately 65% in the second quarter.  We expect that nearly 30% of our installations will be performed by our customers during this year.  In addition, we now have about 25% of our customers managing their accounts online and we expect our customers to log one billions self service transactions this year, everything from reviewing and scheduling appointments, getting self help information and tools, paying bills, or purchasing our services.  All of these improvements result in a better experience for our customers, lower activity levels, and efficiencies for our cable operations.  Overall, our second quarter results for cable clearly demonstrate that we are executing well and competing effectively with our improved products and services.  ","Please refer to Slide Eight.  In the second quarter total cable capital expenditures decreased 5% to $1.1 billion equal to 11.4% of cable revenue versus 12.6% in the second quarter of last year.  This reduction in capital intensity primarily reflects reduced spending in CPE as a result of scale efficiencies.  Year-to-date capital expenditures decreased 2.4% to $2.2 billion equal to 11.2% of revenue versus 12.1% for the first half of 2011.  ","The second quarter cap ex reflects our investment to support the continued growth in business services which totaled $162 million.  In addition, CPE expenditures decreased 13% as we benefit from improved pricing and near completion of the all digital project which recaptures analog bandwidth in a number of our markets.  In total, we have deployed over 25 million digital adapters since the inception of this project. As a result of this project, we continue to realize operating efficiencies and strategic benefits from fully digitizing our systems. ","We will continue to invest capital in our network to ensure product leadership in video and high speed Internet, and to fund the expansion of new services that generate attractive risk adjusted returns and drive profitable organic growth like business services, or Xfinity Home, Wi-FI, and X1.  For the full year 2012 cable capital expenditures are expected to be relatively flat in dollars when compared to last year but should be lower as a percentage of cable revenue.  ","Please refer to Slide Nine so we can review the pro forma results for NBCUniversal.  For the second quarter 2012 NBCUniversal\u2019s revenue decreased 1% and operating cash flow decreased 15% reflecting the underperformance in our film entertainment segment, the timing of programming costs and difficult comparisons related to a content licensing agreement which had a significant impact on last year\u2019s second quarter results.  ","If we exclude this content licensing agreement, NBCUniversal revenue increased 3% and operating cash flow decreased 6%.  For the second quarter Cable Networks generated revenue of $2.3 billion, an increase of 4% driven by a 4% increase in advertising revenue and a 7% increase in distribution revenue partially offset by the content licensing agreement signed in the second quarter of 2011.","Cable Networks\u2019 operation cash flow decreased to 7% to $788 million reflecting higher programming and production costs primarily due to higher NHL and NBA programming costs and additional investments in original program as we have increased the hours of original content in the second quarter by 13% compared to 2011.  ","With regards to our broadcast segment, second quarter broadcast television revenue decreased 9% to $1.5 billion largely due to lower content license revenue which I mentioned earlier.  Second quarter 2012 broadcast operating cash flow increased approximately 3% to $196 million reflecting strength at our owned local stations partially offset by increased programming investments.  ","Moving on to film entertainment, the second quarter has tough comparisons against lat year which include two very successful movies Fast Five and Bridesmaid compared to the disappointing box office performance of our second quarter films primarily Battleship.  As a result revenue decreased 2% to $1.2 billion and operation cash flow declined by $110 million to a loss of $83 million.","Switching to our theme park segment, we had another solid quarter as theme parks generated revenue of $539 million a 3.4% increase driven by consistent performance at both the Orlando park which continues to benefit from the success of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction, in the Hollywood park which has had strong attendance growth fueled by the successful opening of the new Transformers attraction in May.  Second quarter operating cash flow for the parks increased just over 4% to $235 million.  ","Please refer to Slide 10 so we can review our 2012 financial strategy.  As I mentioned earlier, we generated consolidated free cash flow of $1.6 billion in the second quarter, an increase of 2% and free cash flow per share increase of 6% to $0.57 per share.  For the first half of the year, we generated $4.6 billion of free cash flow, an increase of 23% over the first half of 2011 and year-to-date free cash flow per share increased 25% to $1.68 per share.  For the first half of 2012, Comcast Cable accounted for $3.5 billion or 77% of total free cash flow and NBCUniversal contributed $1.1 billion or 23% of consolidated free cash flow.  ","As you know, we manage Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal as two distinct pools of cash flow generation and funding capacity.  NBCUniversal\u2019s free cash flow is retained to build capacity to fund future equity redemptions by General Electric while Comcast Cable\u2019s free cash flow is allocated to consistently return capital to shareholders.","As we announced earlier this year on July 9th Arts & Entertainment Television Network agreed to redeem NBCUniversal\u2019s entire equity interest in the network for just over $3 billion which we expect to close later this year.  We estimate after tax proceeds, for this transaction to be approximately $2.6 billion which will remain at NBCUniversal.","We are executing on our 2012 financial plan and year-to-date we have returned $2.2 billion of capital to shareholders, a 38% increase which includes share repurchases totaling $1.5 billion in dividend payments totaling $743 million.  Overall, we are pleased with the progress we have made during the first six months of 2012.  We believe the investments we have made along with disciplined execution will continue to yield positive results. ","Now, let me turn the call over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from Douglas Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities.","Douglas Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","Two if I may, for Neil video subscription revenues accelerated the past three quarters even as video subscriber losses have improved I think for seven quarters now so it appears the improvement is not coming from discounting.  Would you say that the competitive environment is getting better, would you say this is due to better company execution, and has the low hanging fruit being captured with regards to improving the video business?  If not, what\u2019s the top execution efforts that you think will impact the business going forward?","For Michael, it appears NBC will be able to undertake repurchasing GE\u2019s stake in 2014 with almost just cash on hand given the A&E deal.  You\u2019ve given us some debt level ranges in the past for the company overall.  Since you were purchasing the lower end of that range should investors expect repurchases and dividends to move up to 100% or more of cable free cash flow next year to the extent you maintain the leverage at the low end of your target range?","Neil Smit ","I think on the video side it really comes down to better execution.  I think we\u2019re executing better on the product side, we\u2019re getting better product out there whether it\u2019s X1 or cross platform, or the apps.  I think on the service side we still have plenty of room for improvement but we\u2019re getting more self service done, we\u2019re getting reduced call time windows, we\u2019re doing more self installs, repeat service levels down, and I think we\u2019re targeting our marketing better and developing more channels whether it\u2019s the online channel, or the retention channel, or the [inaudible] channel.  I think that we\u2019re developing or beefing up our channels.","I don\u2019t think the competitive environment is materially changed one way or another.  I mean, I\u2019d like to see housing sort of come back a little bit and the economy come back but I don\u2019t think there have been material changes in the quarter.","Michael J. Anglelakis ","I think we\u2019re going right according to plan actually.  I think we\u2019re hopeful we can get the A&E transaction closed and as I mentioned, that cash will stay within NBCUniversal as NBCUniversal prepares for that redemption.  On the Comcast Cable side, the real goal is to, as Neil just said, to deliver great operating results that convert to meaningful free cash flow.  And as we are this year, we are providing the majority of our cable free cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.  ","We\u2019re now into the eight month of the year in the fourth quarter and early part of next year we\u2019ll take a look at our return of capital strategy for 2013 which obviously again, will include dividends and buybacks and we\u2019ll evaluate exactly where we are.  But we\u2019re executing really well on the operating side and I think we\u2019re generating the free cash flow had hoped to and we\u2019ve got a couple of nice benefits with the sale of the A&E asset as well as hopefully the close of the Spectrum Co asset sometime later this year.","Douglas Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","Would you say that your leverage target is still in that 2.0 to 2.5 times range?","Michael J. Anglelakis ","Yes.  As I said, we want to keep a conservative balance sheet and don\u2019t really look at the balance sheet completely connected to a return of capital because really return of capital to us is the payout ratio of free cash flow really in both pools.  So on the NBC pool of cash that\u2019s really a indirect equity redemption and on the free cash flow on Comcast Cable, that majority goes back to shareholders.  So we do want to stay at sort of the low end of that range, that\u2019s where our head is at, but don\u2019t want to really connect too much our leverage with our return of capital.  We really look at return of capital much more from a free cash flow payout ratio standpoint.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Jason Armstrong \u2013 Goldman Sachs.","Jason Armstrong \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Maybe a question and a clarification.  The question is we\u2019ve seen recent M&A in cable distribution at very healthy multiples.  I guess that services sort of a couple of things, first as the largest synergistic buyer you could, I think, generate more accretion from these deals than the legacy buyers.  Was there interest there on your part?  Maybe help us think through that.","Then I guess the second question that springs up is it highlights how inexpensive your stock is relative to at least what the transaction market is implying.  Does this point you towards accelerating buyback activity?  Then second just a clarification on the content licensing agreements, can you quantify the benefit you received last year maybe across the categories cable, broadcast, and film?","Michael J. Anglelakis ","Why don\u2019t we just go through there were three transactions.  Obviously, we do make it a goal to look at everything.  We think that\u2019s important to really evaluate all the assets that are out there and I think we\u2019re smarter investors and more educated so that if we do see something we like and it makes sense.  The price was a pretty healthy price and we have a pretty high bar on our IRR as well as we look at stock buy backs and other competing uses for capital.  We did not aggressively pursue those, we thought the price was pretty high in comparison to other areas we could utilize our cash.","It has always been sometimes a spread between private and public multiples so I think we have a plan where on buying back our stock we\u2019ve been really consistent in buying back our stock and have increased our buyback pretty consistently over the last years.  So I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to quote accelerate it based on several private market deals.  I think buying back 1.5 year-to-date is pretty good and significantly more than we did last year.  Our goal is to continue to buyback the stock when we think it\u2019s undervalued and be pretty aggressive on our return to capital strategy overall.","Jason Armstrong \u2013 Goldman Sachs","On the content licensing?","Michael J. Anglelakis ","We did have a content licensing deal last year in the second quarter, it was signed in the second quarter.  Obviously, those dollars did not flow into the second quarter of this year so that had impact primarily in cable networks and broadcasting for the most part.","Jason Armstrong \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Can you quantify what the benefit was last year so we know sort of what the headwind in Q2 12?","Michael J. Anglelakis ","You can really look at the content licensing side.  In our trending schedule it gives you some directional area but I don\u2019t think we want to go into specifics of what contracts were worth.  I think we\u2019re trying to be as transparent as we can on our trending schedules and it gives you some indicant of where content licensing was in the second quarter of 2011 versus now.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for us to go into real specifics on dollars and cents.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jessica Reif Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Two questions, on the Olympics it\u2019s obviously a really great promotional platform that seems to be going as well if not better than excepted.  Can you just talk to us about how you expect to benefit both short and longer term?  And is it all beneficial to NBCUniversal or is there any benefits for the cable systems?","Stephen B. Burke ","Let me start on the Olympics and we\u2019re five days into a 17 day event so it\u2019s by no means concluded at this point but we\u2019re off to a very successful start.  The first point I\u2019d make is that even before the Olympics started this year we were over $100 million ahead of our ad sales goal.  So there was a lot of demand I think for the time and we booked over $100 million more than our plan and more than we ever had booked before.","Now that the Olympics have started the second positive variance if you will is in ratings which are way up versus forecast.  We thought when we did the forecast for London that Beijing was sort of an A typical watermark.  Beijing had some very interesting characteristics.  Michel Phelps swam live during prime time, gymnastics was live, and so what we did was we went and looked at Athens and really budgeted closer to Athens than Beijing.","The reality is that if you take the first five days of London and you compare them versus Beijing we projected to be down 20% versus Beijing and we\u2019re actually up 9%.  The reality is we\u2019re up versus Athens 26% and we\u2019re about 30% higher than our estimate.  So really rating success pretty much across the board which all of you who follow this fragmented media landscape knows how A typical that is.  We think that is because of the way we promoted the Olympics during the 100 days leading up to the Olympics.  We think a lot of it is due to all of the effort inside NBC Universal which we call Symphony and also things that we\u2019ve done with Comcast Cable.  We also think that for the first time we have a strategy that embraces broadcast, cable, and digital so we have a lot of exposure all leading up to these great numbers in prime time.  ","When you boil all of that down when we were doing due diligence on NCB Universal, one of the issues the company had was every two years NBC Universal was losing a lot of money on the Olympics.  We think London is going to be right around breakeven and there was a time when we thought London would be as negative as $200 million.  So on a cash-on-cash basis, forgetting purchase price accounting and everything else, we are way ahead of where we thought we would be.","At the same time if you look at the benefits of other parts of the business, we\u2019re going to do a few things very unique in terms of launching the fall prime time schedule for NBC.  We\u2019ve got some shows literally launching.  For example, next Wednesday we\u2019re doing a new show called [Go On] commercial free right out of the end of the Olympics and also obviously, the Olympics are a chance to showcase our news properties and other parts of the company and really build up our sports cable channel.  I think now that we feel the P&L for the Olympics per say is about breakeven it\u2019s clearly something that is going to benefit our company very broadly.","Jessica Reif Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But longer term shouldn\u2019t it help you with affiliate fees and renewals?  I mean that kind of stuff will there be longer lasting benefits?","Stephen B. Burke ","I think so.  I think first of all given the trends, we stand a chance to make money on future Olympics, we\u2019ll see.  Obviously, the economy has a piece in that but I believe we made one of the biggest bets we\u2019ve ever made in terms of the right deal we did for the Olympics a little over a year ago and we feel very good because all the numbers that I just mentioned to you are significantly better than we projected in our deal.  As the world gets increasingly fragmented and it\u2019s increasingly hard to amass the kind of audiences we\u2019re amassing.  25 ratings at 11 o\u2019clock at night, those types of audiences are so unique that I think over time they\u2019re going to prove to be more and more valuable.","At the same time, any of you who\u2019ve watched our coverage on the NBC sports channel, you can see that we\u2019re basically wall-to-wall Olympics and getting the kinds of ratings on our sports cable channel that we\u2019ve never seen before which is going to make that more valuable both to advertisers and to our affiliates.  I think we feel great about what London is showing us the Olympics are capable of doing and long term we\u2019re delighted to have the asset.","Jessica Reif Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","My second question was more on the cable side.  Can you discuss what you expect with the Verizon JV?  I mean, what would be considered disappointing and what would be considered a really big positive?","Stephen B. Burke ","I think the JV is going very well.  We\u2019re launched in about 21 markets, 263 stores, it\u2019s been a terrific partnership.  From a regulatory perspective we anticipate approval of transaction sometime at the end of Q3 or Q4 and we\u2019ve been working very constructively with the regulatory agencies on this and we look forward to a speedy and destructive approval.","Michael J. Anglelakis ","Let me just add on to what Steve said.  Obviously, all the data is excellent coming out of the Olympics and we\u2019re really pleased with everything that\u2019s going on.  Getting a little granular just so folks remember, this was a legacy contract in terms of the Olympics and through purchase accounting the losses were eliminated, the losses that we expected out of this contract.  So now that we\u2019re over performing a bit, in the third quarter we\u2019ll have a slight benefit related to the Olympics\u2019 performance in our third quarter P&L which obviously is a nice positive to have compared to the previous Olympics that NBC Universal had.","In addition, the way the cash flows flow, they\u2019re a little bit different so we will have a negative impact in free cash flow in the third quarter.  But really, everything has just gone great and we\u2019re very pleased.  I just wanted to make sure folks understand a little of those finer details.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Craig Moffett \u2013 Sanford Bernstein.","Craig Moffett \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Two quick questions, given the incremental cash that comes in from A&E, does that change your calculus at all as to whether or not you would choose to buy in the last piece of NBC in 2014 as opposed to 2017?  Then for Neil, just given how important it is I wonder if you could give us any very early insights on the X1 rollout in Boston operationally in terms of marketing and retention and that sort of thing?","Stephen B. Burke ","I\u2019ll take the first one.  Not really, I think you\u2019ve got to take a little bit of a step back.  We\u2019ve been in a little bit of a cleanup mode in regards to NBC Universal.  If you remember, just about a little over a year ago where we bought out the other 50% with Blackstone with regard to theme parks and paid $1 billion for that so now that we own 100% of the Orlando theme park that was sort of a concerted effort to sort of look at an entity that we had that was a great deal and we\u2019re very pleased with it.","Then you look at A&E where we owned 15.8%, decided to sell it.  We\u2019re very pleased with the price.  Also recently announced was the MSMNBC.com transaction which was a 50\/50 relationship with Microsoft which we bought in that other 50%.  So we\u2019re really in a little bit of a cleanup mode and I think that\u2019s probably coming to an end.  Does it influence our decision in 2014?  I really don\u2019t know, it\u2019s two years away from now obviously a lot can happen then.  We\u2019re obviously pleased with how NBC Universal is progressing since we\u2019ve owned it for about 18 months or so, so I think that\u2019s going to be a decision we make in about two years and dependent on a variety of factors.  But all good news in terms of we\u2019re cleaning up some of the areas and I think we\u2019re benefitting nicely from cleaning those up.","Neil Smit ","So far the X1 has been very well received in Boston.  We\u2019re marketing it to HD Triple Play customers. We\u2019re launching during the Olympics our first marketing campaign targeted at acquisition.  Existing customers will get the X1 as requested subject to a one time installation fee.  Remember that right now we\u2019re using the new X1 boxes but we\u2019re going to be extending the X1 experience over to a high end set-top boxes as well.  As Brian mentioned in the call, we\u2019re going to be launching Atlanta this week and we\u2019ll be launching five markets, major markets during the course of the year.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Jason Bazinet \u2013 Citi Investment Research.","Jason Bazinet \u2013 Citi Investment Research","I just have a question for Mr. Burke.  A lot of the cable networks are investing more in original content but the aggregate ratings seem to have come under pressure sort of in the aggregate across the whole ecosystem and I was just wondering if you could share with us your thoughts on what might be going on?  Do you view it as something temporary and a function of the content that\u2019s out there or something that may have more duration to it?","Stephen B. Burke ","I think some of it is temporary or onetime.  Nielsen did an adjustment of the universe which I think most people would say was a one time -2% to -3% in terms of ratings.  But I think a lot of cable channels are making very significant investments in new programming.  There\u2019s a lot of competition a lot of fragmentation out there, a lot of DVR usage.  I think there\u2019s no question in terms of ratings it\u2019s a tougher environment than it was a year ago.  ","That having been said, we still love the cable channel business.  If you think about it, it\u2019s a dual revenue stream.  One of the revenue streams is completely unaffected by ratings, that being the affiliates fees.  Neil doesn\u2019t like this part of the business but the affiliate fee growth I think in the industry is probably about 10%.  We were 7% during the quarter but if roughly have your revenues are growing somewhere high single digits or double digits and then on the other side you\u2019ve got advertising where in the recent up front, the cable up front I think our cable channels averaged high single digits and we had USA and Bravo I think on a CPM basis leading the market.  If you put that all together it\u2019s a really good business.  That having been said, it\u2019s harder to get ratings today than it was a year or two ago.","Operator","","Your next question comes from John Hodulik \u2013 UBS.","John Hodulik \u2013 UBS","Just a quick question, a follow up on the X1 rollout, do you expect to be able to get the X1 platform rolled out across the footprint by the end of \u201913?  Then you talked about a number of offsets from a cost standpoint from efficiency and other cost cutting as you rollout X1 and Xfinity Home.  Do you expect any real sort of noticeable impact on margins or cable cap ex as this roll out proceeds?","Stephen B. Burke ","The X1 we haven\u2019t really finished our \u201913 planning yet but it\u2019s certainly the intent to roll it out broadly across the footprint.  As I said earlier, it\u2019s been a great product and the customer reset activities have been terrific so we\u2019re going to roll it out more widely but we haven\u2019t finished \u201913 planning.  In terms of efficiencies, we do see them across primarily the customer service side including the tax side and we\u2019re taking real noise out of the business.  ","We\u2019ve reduced $8 million truck rolls over the last two years while we\u2019ve increased RGUs $2.8 million.  That\u2019s an example of efficiencies.  We think we\u2019re going to do about a billion self service transactions this year.  Michael mentioned that, whether it\u2019s billing or FAQs or whatever.  But I think from a margin perspective we look at them as being kind of steady over the course of the year.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Benjamin Swinburne \u2013 Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Just on the cash flow outlook I think on one of the slides you point out that you\u2019ve returned about 64% to 65% of cable free cash to shareholders.  As we look at the rest of the this year I\u2019m imaging that the cash taxes will probably be a swing factor around to bring that sort of payout ratio higher towards closer to 100%?  I just wanted to know if you had any sort of color on the cash tax outlook or maybe the stimulus for the full year now that we\u2019re half way through?","Then I just wanted to come back, Neil you mentioned the JVs with Verizon wireless and how well they\u2019re going.  The fact that you\u2019ve moved forward with those should that lead us to the conclusion that the Spectrum sale and the commercial arrangements are really too different transactions and sort of two different strategies and not necessarily connected to each other?  I know the FCC DOJ seemed to sort of be looking at them a little bit together but I\u2019d love to get your perspective.","Michael J. Anglelakis ","You\u2019re right, as we look at sort of the second half of the year, as I mentioned in the comments, we will spend a little bit more on cap ex.  I think we\u2019ll end the year pretty flattish but if you look at where we are for the first half compared to last year and then you look at the whole of last year, we\u2019ll spend a bit more in cap ex.  In the second half of the year we will have some cash taxes and some working capital so I think the number in terms of our payout ratio will trend upwards towards when you look at the full year versus just the first six months.  So we feel pretty good about it and it\u2019s running a bit ahead of plan which we\u2019re pleased with and we\u2019ll see how the end of the year turns out but your directional comments are correct.","BB","Let me just jump in on that second Verizon Wireless question.  Even though technically they\u2019re two separate contracts we\u2019ve always believed that the government is looking at it holistically.  I stand by Neil\u2019s hope that by the end of the third or early in the fourth quarter we could get both transactions completed and continue with the roll out.","Operator","","Your next question comes from James Ratcliffe \u2013 Barclays.  ","James Ratcliffe \u2013 Barclays","Two if I could, one to follow up on an earlier question, it does look like video ARPU accelerated Q-on-Q but [HSC] ARPU slowed a little bit.  Is that any indication of something fundamental going on or is this an allocation issue within bundles?  Secondly, any takeaways from the Google Fiber announcement and any indication that they\u2019re looking into expanding into any of the Comcast markets?","Stephen B. Burke ","I wouldn\u2019t read anything into the [HSC] ARPU.  I mean it grew 3% and we grew the [inaudible] at a healthy rate indexing at 108 so I wouldn\u2019t read anything into that.  Concerning the Google Fiber roll out we have about 65,000 customers in the Kansas City area.  It\u2019s not clear how significantly impacted that will be but clearly pulling fiber, building a fiber network is hard work and heavy lifting and we look forward to monitoring the results.","BB","I guess on a broader context on that last question, we don\u2019t really know but it kind of seems like a bit of a laboratory and all along when we showed our billion bip second demo in Chicago we were kind of hoping that there would be applications that continue to need more and more broadband.  That\u2019s fundamentally a really good thing for us. Obviously, there\u2019s going to be competition but we have a great network that has tremendous flexibility and capacity to offer more speeds than we offering today and we\u2019re constantly hoping that new applications and needs develop and that will be really I think positive development if we can help that happen.  If Google can be part of making that happen, it\u2019s part of what I think they\u2019re doing but I don\u2019t know for sure.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Stefan Anninger \u2013 Credit Suisse.","Stefan Anninger \u2013 Credit Suisse","Two questions if possible, Michael you talked a little bit about the cap ex efficiencies that Comcast has been gleaning this year and I think you\u2019ve done that for the last several quarters.  Can you just talk a little bit more about those, maybe provide a bit more color?  You talked about some of it on the CPE side.   And then your longer term optimism around sort of continued efficiencies in the cap ex spending and what we might expect going forward.  Then perhaps you could provide a little bit of color on how the local advertising trend are looking in the third quarter?","Michael J. Anglelakis ","On the cap ex side really my hat is off to the team, I think they\u2019ve done just a great job of really effectively managing cap ex and I would say at the same time really playing offense with regards to innovation.  Just look at all the different products we\u2019re talking about now compared to a year or two ago when we didn\u2019t have that.  So we\u2019re bringing capital intensity down basically both in terms of percentage and dollars.","There\u2019s been a number of projects, some come and go, a couple of years ago we had DOCSIS 3.0 and then we had all digital, and now we\u2019re spending some dollars on business services more aggressively.  The reality is I think we\u2019re hitting a stable sort of cap ex number. It may move up a little bit, it may move down a bit but when we look at a whole year capital plan we\u2019re pretty much coming into I think, stability because we\u2019re still investing in the network, as Brian said, to make sure we have the best network but we\u2019re also investing in new product areas and service areas.  ","I don\u2019t think from a dollars stand point you\u2019re going to see sort of that continuing trend down compared to several years ago.  I think from a percentage of revenue standpoint I think we\u2019re going to show some modest benefits in terms of that intensity.  There\u2019s a lot that goes into our capital expenditure plan at cable and I think they\u2019re doing a great job at how we manage it. ","With regards to local, I think that we\u2019re doing really well in local both on the NBC Universal side and on the Comcast Spotlight side.  On the Comcast Spotlight side up about 4% and obviously we\u2019re entering the political season.  So the core business seems pretty stable, automotive has come back relatively nicely and obviously we\u2019re going to benefit in third and fourth quarter with regards to political.","Operator","","Your last question comes from Marci Ryvicker \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC.","Marci Ryvicker \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Two questions, I think Q2 ARPU came in a little bit better than expected.  Is it conceivable for ARPU to accelerate as you roll out home security, Skype, etc?","Michael J. Anglelakis ","I think we were pleased with the ARPU, the lift this quarter at 8%.  I think it\u2019s too early to tell with the new products they\u2019re just beginning to gain momentum, we\u2019re just beginning to market them.  Home security we\u2019ve got rolled out to 95% of the footprint but it\u2019s in the very early days.  Certainly that\u2019s the intent, we add more products on to our network and build ARPU over time but I think it\u2019s too early to tell right now.","Michael J. Anglelakis ","I\u2019d just elaborate.  Obviously, we\u2019ve put on 400 to 500 basis points of new Triple Play customers.  So last year we had 35% to 36% of our customers taking all three services.  That number is now closer to 40%, that obviously helps with ARPU as well as all the event services that Neil mentioned.  So overtime we\u2019re hoping to continue to grow ARPU.","Marci Ryvicker \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Then in high speed data, any feedback from subs with your move to the higher cap of 300 megs and the related data usage plans?","BB","As you know we announced two different flavors of plans.  One was capacity linked with the tier that subs are buying into and two was just being able to buy blocks of capacity.  Caps are gone.  We raised the amount people could consume to 300 gigabytes as a base limit.  So we have not announced the markets for the roll outs yet but I would expect something shortly.","Operator","","There will be a replay available of today\u2019s call starting at 12:30 pm eastern standard time.

","In addition, in this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our 8-K and trending schedules for the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. ","With that, let me turn the call over to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian?","Brian Roberts","Thanks, Jason, and good morning, everyone. I'm really pleased with our strong second quarter results and the continued successful execution of our strategy. All of our businesses demonstrated significant growth, contributing to adjusted EBITDA of $8.7 billion in the quarter, an increase of 7.6%. We also delivered $0.78 of adjusted EPS in the quarter, an increase of 13% over the prior year. All in all, we generated $4.2 billion of free cash flow in the second quarter, resulting in a year-to-date total of $8.8 billion. ","The key driver of this sustained growth continues to be our market position with 55 million valuable customers in many of the world's most attractive markets, generating $111 in revenue per customer each month with high margin and strong retention. Across Sky and Cable, we added 456,000 new relationships this quarter and 868,000 in the first half of the year. In all the geographies in which we compete, we lead with superior products, content and technology. ","In the U.S., connectivity is the focal point of our customer relationships, enabled by our world-class network. Our connectivity businesses, again, generated nearly 10% growth in revenue and, collectively, are on track to deliver the 14th consecutive year of well over 1 million broadband net additions. In Europe, Sky's premium brand and exclusive content is the principal differentiation in our relationship with customers, driving net additions of 304,000 in the quarter. ","Importantly, across the company, we also have leading scale and premium content with a vast library of IP and new productions that are extremely popular across generations and geographies. At NBC, we're on a path to finish number one in the U.S. for the sixth straight year in the key demographic of adults 18 to 49. ","And at Telemundo, we're number one in Spanish language primetime. In Film, we are executing our strategic slate approach and look forward to the return of the hugely successful Fast and Furious franchise with the spinoff of Hobbs & Shaw later this August. And Sky continues to develop a strong lineup of original content, including their highly acclaimed Chernobyl, which debuted in the second quarter. On the back of this success, we launched Sky Studios to expand our production capabilities and more than double the investment in local original content. ","The popularity and scale of this premium content and advertiser's need for trusted brand safe environments drove NBCUniversal's upfront to record levels this year. Advertising is a core strength. And once again, we led the market on both volume and price. The overall portfolio volume was close to $7 billion, an increase of 10% over last year, and average price was similarly strong. We helped shift the marketplace to embrace all video, unifying all screens, platforms and content, breaking down the historic barriers between linear and digital, which is particularly important as we prepare to launch our ad-supported streaming service next year. To that end, we had record digital video sales, an increase of 50% over the prior year. ","So when you add the scale and strength of our customer relationships, premium content and advertising capabilities, we have a uniquely strong position to capture and profit from the growth opportunities in our markets. For example, in the streaming segment, we've already made significant moves to better serve viewers who want to consume content in and out of the home. Sky was ahead of the curve, launching NOW TV almost 7 years ago. That platform has proven to be incredibly durable and popular, evident in Sky's Q2 net additions. At Cable, Flex offers a new approach for our broadband customers to enjoy the most popular streaming apps on our X1 platform, including The Voice remote, without requiring a traditional linear content subscription. ","Finally, at NBCUniversal, we're making great progress on the direct-to-consumer streaming service that we announced earlier this year. We believe the strength of our assets and leadership across our businesses, combined with access to tens of millions of customers, will lower both our cost of entry and execution risk as we deliver a truly special offering. All in all, our strong operating and financial momentum continues. If you take a step back, there are significant competition and change in the ecosystem right now. But that said, for years, we've felt that video over the Internet is more friend than foe. We believe it plays to our strengths. We've got a great roadmap in each of our businesses and an even better outlook when you add it altogether. The fastest broadband married to world-class platforms as well as highly rated, relevant content. And we are the leading company in both of those businesses at scale globally. It's our scale that allows us to evolve and continue to invest, all while maintaining momentum and driving substantial growth, and this has always been our approach. In fact, if you look over the last 10 years, just to pick one stat showing our consistency during significant other transitions in our business, we've grown adjusted EPS by double digits in 9 of those 10 years, and we're pretty close in the 10th year. Our second quarter and first half results continue this trend of robust growth, and our outlook is for more of the same. ","Over to you, Mike.","Michael Cavanagh","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 4 with our second quarter consolidated results. As a reminder, we completed our acquisition of Sky in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our reported results include Sky from the acquisition date, while pro forma results include Sky as if the transaction had occurred on January 1, 2017. Having said that, on a reported basis, revenue increased to 24% to $26.9 billion and adjusted EBITDA increased 18% to $8.7 billion. On a pro forma basis, revenue increased 0.8% and adjusted EBITDA increased 7.6%, reflecting growth across all three businesses. ","As Brian mentioned, adjusted earnings per share grew 13% to $0.78 and free cash flow was $4.2 billion, bringing the first half total to $8.8 billion. Now let's turn to our segment results, starting with Cable Communications on Slide 5. Cable delivered another very strong, consistent quarter of growth, driven by healthy customer metrics on our connectivity businesses and continued success in controlling costs, while also making significant strides in the customer experience. We believe that the strength of our network, best-in-class products and customer experience improvements are a winning combination that will continue to drive profitable growth. ","Overall Cable revenue increased 3.9% to $14.5 billion in the second quarter. Revenue growth in the quarter was led by the steady increase in customer relationships for both residential and business services as well as higher ARPU. Total customer relationships increased 3.4% year-over-year to 30.9 million, driven by 209,000 high-speed Internet customer net additions across residential and business services in the quarter and 1.3 million over the last 12 months. ","Total video subscribers declined by 224,000 in the quarter as we continue to respond to change in consumer viewing preferences. We will remain disciplined in executing our connectivity-led strategy to drive customer relationship growth and total lifetime value of those relationships. Video will continue to play an important role in our strategy. But as we said before, we will not chase unprofitable video subs. The success of this approach is evident in our results, with our monthly adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship growing 3.8% year-over-year and our continued improvement in retaining customers, including best on record retention for broadband in the second quarter. Consistent with recent trends, our connectivity business, residential broadband and business services continue to drive the growth at Cable. Our revenue in these businesses, collectively, reached $6.6 billion in the quarter, up 9.5% year-over-year. ","In addition to the solid customer additions that I mentioned earlier, residential high-speed Internet ARPU grew 4% this quarter. Looking ahead, we expect to continue a healthy balance of both customer and rate growth. Our wireless business, Xfinity Mobile, is another important contributor to our growth at Cable. This still new business is already positively impacting retention, while also attracting new customers. And it's firmly on a path to positive standalone economics. We added 181,000 net customer lines in the second quarter, while we also reduced our quarterly adjusted EBITDA losses at Xfinity Mobile to $88 million, reflecting progress and scaling and fine-tuning our operations. While we expect this overall trend of improvement in Xfinity Mobile's financial performance to continue, we anticipate customer-related acquisition expenses will increase in the seasonally strong third and fourth quarters. ","Moving now to cable expenses and margin on Slide 6. Overall, total cable expenses increased 1.6% as we continue to see the benefit of our disciplined approach to controlling costs, while also increasing the total number of customers that we serve. Non-programming expenses slightly increased by 1.4%, but improved by 2% on a per-customer basis. Our ongoing efforts to continually improve the customer experience by reducing unnecessary transactions and digitizing many of the remaining transactions continue to drive cost out of the business. The company had its best performance on record this quarter across many of our key customer metrics. For instance, customer contact rate and truck rolls hit record lows as we continue to improve reliability and expand digital and proactive messaging to our base. ","On the programming side, we continue to benefit on the relatively low rate of expense growth, up only 1.8% this quarter, which reflects the timing of contract renewals. Putting it altogether, the strong growth in our connectivity businesses, the improvement in our performance at Xfinity Mobile and our ongoing focus on cost management enabled us to deliver a healthy 7.4% increase in adjusted EBITDA at Cable. EBITDA margin expanded by 130 basis points to 40.5%. ","Based on our performance in the first half of the year, and our outlook for continued improvement in the second half, we are increasing our prior guidance. We now expect the improvement in EBITDA margin at Cable for the full year to be slightly above 100 basis points compared to our 38.7% margin in 2018. This is an increase from our prior guidance of up to 100 basis points of improvement in 2019. Finally, cable capital expenditures in the second quarter decreased 9.8% to $1.6 billion, which resulted in CapEx intensity of 11% for the quarter. This primarily reflects lower spending and scalable infrastructure and line extensions in part due to the timing of plant construction and other investments we're making in our network. ","That said, consistent with the broader shift in our business toward connectivity, we expect to continue to invest in our network, which will enhance our competitive position in broadband by enabling us to stay ahead of customers' high and increasing expectations, evidenced by the rapid growth in data consumption. We now expect cable CapEx intensity for the full year to improve by at least 100 basis points compared to 13.8% in 2018. This is an upgrade from our original guidance of a 50 basis points improvement in 2019. This is driven, in part, by timing of network investment as well as the trend in decreasing CPE investment as the total number of video subscribers continues to decline and as the rate of our deployment of X1 has moderated. And while we don't provide specific multiyear guidance, and we could potentially adjust our plans if attractive new opportunities emerge, we expect the underlying video CPE trends that are contributing to the improvement in our full year CapEx intensity to continue beyond this year. ","In total, we're encouraged by the cable team's consistently strong performance and a great quarter and first half of the year. The formula is working. We're seeing healthy growth in total customer relationships and adjusted EBITDA with margin expansion driven by our strong connectivity results and focus on cost control, coupled with the decrease in cable CapEx intensity as the mix of our business continues to shift. Together, this drove a 22% increase in net cash flow at Cable in the first half of the year. ","Now let's move to NBCUniversal's results on Slide 7. NBCUniversal EBITDA increased 8.1%, with contributions across all of our businesses, clearly demonstrating the power of our premier content portfolio and IP. Cable Networks revenue increased 2.5% to $2.9 billion and EBITDA increased to 2.2% to $1.2 billion. Distribution revenue increased 3.4% driven by the ongoing benefits of previous renewal agreements, partially offset by subscriber losses in the 1.5% to 2% range. Advertising revenue was consistent with the prior year as lower ratings were offset by higher pricing. ","Finally, content licensing and other increased 5.1% in the quarter. We would note our content licensing comparisons become considerably more challenging in second half of the year due to the heavy level of programming license to third parties last year. ","Broadcast revenue increased 0.5% to $2.4 billion and EBITDA increased to 28% to $534 million. Excluding the comparison to Telemundo's broadcast of the FIFA World Cup last year, revenue was up mid-single-digits and EBITDA was up double digits, driven by growth in retrans and strong advertising. ","Retrans revenue increased 15% to $500 million. Excluding the World Cup, advertising increased mid-single-digits as lower ratings were more than offset by higher price, reflecting a very strong scatter market with double-digit price premiums as well as some benefit from an additional NHL Stanley Cup game and Copa America soccer in the quarter. ","Filmed Entertainment revenue decreased 15% to $1.5 billion, while EBITDA increased 33% to $183 million. Revenue reflects a tough comparison to Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom in the second quarter last year partially offset by the release of The Secret Life of Pets 2 this quarter. Theatrical revenue declined 53%, reflecting this tough comparison. Content licensing revenue increased 9.8% driven by the timing of when content was made available under licensing agreements. ","Theme Parks revenue increased 7.5% to $1.5 billion and EBITDA increased nearly 4% to $590 million. These solid results were driven by higher attendance, aided by the timing of spring break vacations and higher guest spending. We're excited about the future of our Parks business as we have a great runway in coming years with Nintendo World opening in Japan in 2020, Universal Beijing opening in 2021 and other significant opportunities to come soon. ","Moving on to Sky results on Slide 8 now. As a reminder, I will be referring to our pro forma results as if the Sky transaction had occurred on January 1, 2017, and growth rates on a constant currency basis, consistent with what's reflected in our earnings release. Sky was a strong contributor to our consolidated results with solid revenue growth, significant customer additions and double-digit EBITDA growth in the quarter. Sky added 304,000 customer relationships, ending the quarter with 24 million relationships. Customer growth mostly came from streaming subscribers, primarily driven by Game of Thrones and also from the debut of the Sky original breakout hit, Chernobyl. Both were exclusive on Sky Atlantic. ","Importantly, customers are choosing to watch more Sky content. The amount of time Sky customers spent viewing Sky channels increased by more than 20% year-over-year driven by our investment in sports and entertainment programming. As Brian mentioned, on the back of this excellent performance, we've now launched Sky Studios with the intent of doubling investment on local original content. This investment reflects our strategy to shift our mix towards more original content production. In a difficult macro environment in Europe, Sky revenue increased 2.4% in the quarter to $4.8 billion. Direct-to-consumer revenue grew 1.7%, benefiting from customer growth, but partially offset by the decline in average revenue per customer. The change in ARPU includes our previously announced rate increase in the U.K. as well as the record addition of streaming subscribers, which contributed incremental revenue to the business, but at a relatively lower amount of revenue per customer. ","Our investment in programming is driving top line growth. Sky's content revenue increased 28% to $376 million, reflecting the wholesaling of sports programming, including exclusive sports rights recently acquired in Italy and Germany, as well as the modernization of our slate of original programming. ","Finally, amid the challenging macro environment in Europe, including declines in our ad market, advertising revenue at Sky decreased 5.6% to $563 million. EBITDA at Sky increased by 20% in the quarter driven by the combination of revenue growth and operating efficiencies, plus a favorable comparison to prior year, which had contract termination cost and cost related to a settlement, which, together, more than offset the expected step-up in sports rights programming costs. ","Finally, wrapping up on Slide 9 with free cash flow and capital allocation. We made $954 million in dividend payments in the quarter for a total of $1.8 billion for the first half of the year. We also continue to make good progress in deleveraging. Pro forma net leverage at the end of the second quarter was 3.1x. Also we are exploring ways to monetize the embedded floor value in our recently announced Hulu agreements with The Walt Disney Company. Should such a transaction come to pass, we would anticipate using the cash proceeds realized to accelerate our deleveraging efforts by paying down Comcast debt. We remain focused and on track to meet our deleveraging commitments. ","In closing, we are very pleased with our results in the quarter and throughout the first half of the year. We continue to execute at a high level, consistently generating significant free cash flow, which, we believe, drives growth and intrinsic value and, in turn, over time, strong total shareholder returns. ","So with that, I'll turn it back to Jason to lead our Q&A.","Jason Armstrong","Okay. Thanks, Mike. Operator, let's open up the call for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne","I have two questions. One, around the outlook for broadband growth and the second around the NBC streaming strategy. Maybe for Brian or Dave or who wants to take it, when you think about continuing to drive broadband net adds at the level we've seen over the last couple of years, can you just talk about the sort of product and service pipeline that you're focused on? Do you think you can deliver continued market share gains in a market that is, obviously, maturing, particularly if you think about 5G arriving at least someday down the road? And then on NBC, maybe for Steve or -- and\/or Jeremy. I'm just curious, we saw the move of The Office from Netflix to NBC. We've seen shows like Chernobyl do really well. How do you think about the cost of building this streaming business in terms of content spend or licensing loss relative to the opportunity down the road? Are you convinced that this sort of the upside is worth whatever dilution you expect to come? And I know you're still formulating your plans, but it seems like every media company is doubling their programming spend, so there's a lot of incremental investment going on. I'd love to hear your updated thoughts there.","David Watson","Ben, this is Dave. So in broadband, everything starts with a steady, consistent investment in the network. So I think we are delivering -- we'll continue to deliver the most efficient and effective way of supporting the high-bandwidth applications, whether it's gaming to Internet TV. Our network is built for those applications. So we'll continue to do that in ubiquitous way throughout our footprint, and it really comes down to 3 big areas that we will stay focused on. One is speeds. We're going to continue to match capacity. And we have a strong track record, 17 times, 17 years. We now have 100% of our network where we have 1 gig available. So we're going to continuously very focused on that. ","WiFi in the home is just critical for all the different devices. So our gateway, I think, is the best gateway in the marketplace. We have pods that we have brought into marketplace. And we make it easy through the app being able to optimize it. It's so easy to install the pods. And then, over time, they're automatically and proactively optimized to make sure that the coverage is continuously improved. ","And last but not least is control, and this is how do we help devices get attached to the network, how do we manage applications and, increasingly, over time, how do we help customers with security. So all of those things kind of add up to xFi. xFi is the brand in which all of these things kind of come together. ","And you look at the performance, as Brian said, this is the 14th year we're looking at. For 2019, we'll add over 1 million net broadband customers, and we're balancing share gains with strong revenue. So as we do this, I think we're delivering good value. The ARPU is growing. Broadband revenue is growing, and it's margin accretive, so it's helping the EBITDA growth. So overall, I think we have a solid pipeline for broadband innovation. This is -- we start with this category.","Brian Roberts","The only other thing I would add, I think that's a very complete, thorough description of the strategy and great execution by Dave and his team is this latest product that we keep referring to, Flex. Because we want to deepen the relationship with that broadband customer, and we'll have more to show and talk about in the months ahead, but in a nutshell, we see this pivot to consuming video, leads right into your second question, consuming video in other ways. And we want to make sure that, that relationship is made simple and easy and has value-add by subscribing to our broadband. And I think the team is off to a -- got some really great ideas there. But Steve, you want to answer the second questions, then Jeremy can weigh in?","Stephen Burke","So we're hard at work on our streaming plans. We're planning on announcing more details as we get closer to the launch. Our goal is to launch the service next April. We have over 500 people working on the service at present. We're using the NOW TV platform that has worked so well in Europe as really the platform foundation. We believe we have a very innovative way of coming into the market that is very different than anything else in the market and, we believe, has very attractive financial aspects versus other ways to get into streaming. ","The Office was important to us because, according to Nielsen, The Office is the number one show on Netflix. It's about 5% of all of Netflix's volume, which, obviously, a show that was on NBC and is tied to the DNA of NBC. And we see The Office as being one of the tent pole programs on our platform. So we'll have more to talk about. I think for competitive reasons, we believe we've got some ideas that are innovative and don't really want to share those until we get right close to launch, but we're very pleased to have The Office and very optimistic about our streaming plans at this point.","Brian Roberts","Jeremy, maybe talk about Sky Studios and, a little bit, the strategy there, if you wouldn't mind to the question he made about Chernobyl.","Jeremy Darroch","Sure, Brian. So a couple of things, Ben. It's just on your first point, remember, in Europe, particularly we're buying content for the market as a whole. So we can use our content very efficiently, either of the DTT service over a streaming service. So it's one of the reasons, whilst revenue from our streaming brand, NOW TV, tends to be lower, our cost basis is much, much lower as well. So it's -- we were thinking of it efficiently on an incremental basis. And the more we can do that with technology, as Steve described, of course, the more that effect can apply across the company. ","In terms of Sky Studios, really, our focus is on own originated content and European content. And I think this is going to be extremely powerful for us because, I think, there's a big opportunity to develop European stories at a scale that we've never really seen before. It's no surprise to me that both Game of Thrones actually, but also Chernobyl did particularly well here. Game of Thrones essentially was shot in Europe. It had a lot of European actors. And of course, Chernobyl, a difficult subject, is one of the great sort of European stories over the last few decades. ","So I think there's a real spot for us to drive into now Sky Studios. It will be the vehicle that we'll use to do that and that will complement all of the acquired programming that we are getting from around the world, but will be very, very different as well because it will be essentially European. So it fits really very well with us. And of course, we'll displace some of the acquired program -- programming with more of our own originated content as part of our investment thesis.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.","Craig Moffett","Two questions, if I could. First, can -- I know you are hesitant to give long-term guidance, but margins have climbed as high as almost 50% for some of the kind of video-light competitors, if you will, in the cable industry. I'm wondering if you could just -- are there any real differences between those companies and your own other than simply video mix? And then second, Brian, just strategically, as you think about NBC and the video strategy at Comcast being sort of to let video customers go if they want to go and the pressure that, that puts on NBC, can you just talk about how you think those two strategies can comfortably coexist?","David Watson","Craig, this is Dave. So let me start with margin. And you're right, we don't give long-term margin guidance. But let me start with our focus, and I think that gets to the fundamentals that will continue to impact margin. The main areas, I think we've been very consistent on this, that we focus on total relationship growth, EBITDA per customer relationship and net cash flow per customer relationship. These are -- nothing is going to change in regards to the consistent strategy. So -- and that all starts and it impacts margin by focusing on the connectivity businesses, both residential and business services, which are both of those are margin accretive. So that's the first part. ","Second part, and as Mike mentioned earlier, a ton of focus around improving the customer experience and just taking out the unnecessary noise in the business, the unnecessary transactions, a lot of focus around the digital experience and the customer experience, so these are fundamentals that I think are impacting this quarter, but will continue beyond. ","So I mean, there's a lot of runway had in terms of improvement and as we stay focused on the connectivity businesses. I do think you have in the balance of the year -- the second half of the year, you'll have cycles, like sales activity, mobile sales, that picks up. And we expect certain new product introductions could impact margin a little bit and\/or just the tough comp politically with political advertising. So there'll be a couple of things that could go from quarter-to-quarter. But overall, the fundamentals, I think, are rock solid in terms of our approach towards margin. And so don't give really anything beyond this year, but feel very good about the fundamentals.","Brian Roberts","On the other thing, look, we -- this is why we think Comcast\/NBCUniversal is such a dynamic company. We -- there will be changes in one segment or another. We've been pretty consistent. Steve's been pretty vocal that cable nets will see some pressure on subscriber losses. We're benefiting from that and then selling a lot of content to streaming services. We're building our own streaming service. Our Broadband business benefits from that tremendously. And -- but that's why we have a Parks business, and we have seen great results at Broadcast division this quarter. And the Cable nets grew. So -- and that's where having more global footprint will allow us to create one production and sell it all over the world, if that's what we choose to do. So I think it's pretty much what we've anticipated. We've positioned the company and shifted our strategies accordingly. And on the margin between one division or another, there may be slightly different emphasis. But part of the uniqueness that Steve was just talking about of some of our ideas, which is to really support the ecosystem as we see it and take advantage of this change that we're all living through and make it a positive on the other side. And that we've seen, as I said in my opening, time and time again. And we've managed with really great leaders to have products that have yielded many years of growth for this company and we see that for the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jessica Reif Ehrlich","I have questions for Steve and also Jeremy. Steve, can you talk a little bit about this really strong upfront advertising market, especially in the face of lower ratings, but like an onslaught -- a coming onslaught of non-advertising supported streaming services? When do you begin to sell your own AVOD direct-to-consumer service? And then Mike kind of threw in when you've talked about NBCU that there is more opportunities in Theme Parks. So maybe give us some color on that. And for Jeremy, do you expect -- just to maybe follow up on Ben's question, but do you expect a pullback of programmings -- programs like we've seen in the U.S. or we're seeing -- going to see in the U.S. from Disney and Warner and others? And if yes, how much money do you think that will free up for your focus on doubling originals? And I guess, like, just as part of that, is there a secondary market for programming? Or will you -- is the plan to keep it all on your own platform?","Stephen Burke","So we had a record upfront. For the last seven years, we've been selling all of our channels together at the upfront. And pretty much, for the last seven years, we've been leading the upfront. We're the first company that does business, and we sell more television advertising than anyone else in the country. This year was particularly robust. Our volume was up 10%. I think our average pricing was up close to 10%, maybe 9%. NBC and primetime was up about 13.5%. And we saw a variety of things that drove that. Maybe the most interesting is that now the biggest category of advertising are upfront is from companies that are digital-native companies, the FAANG companies, Peloton businesses, streaming businesses, businesses that basically exist on the Internet. And ironically, those are the businesses that are putting some pressure on our ratings. But interestingly, those businesses find television advertising very, very effective. And because they're so data-oriented, they can measure the impact of television advertising. ","So well over $1 billion this year came from digital-native companies that literally didn't advertise 4 or 5 years ago. And that's what happens when an advertising market is in good shape. You need a good economy and then you need some new advertisers. We were fortunate enough to have both. Our digital ad sales -- our ad sales on our digital platforms, digital products, have also surpassed $1 billion. So you've got kind of an all-screen approach to the market as opposed to just selling linear television. So the advertising market is very, very healthy and that's part of the reason why we're still very optimistic about the future of broadcast and cable channels.","Brian Roberts","Jeremy?","Jeremy Darroch","In terms of -- sorry. Yes, sorry if I missed it. Just in terms of your question, I think we're going to be -- we remain a really fantastic partner for the companies you mentioned or anybody else who wants to develop a D2C or a business in Europe. I mean, typically, it seems to be when most people land, the first question they're going to have to ask themselves is where all the Pay TV customers. And on the hole, that was Sky. So I would hope that with our historic relationship, the relationship we have, that we'll continue to be able to work with many, many people to help them and us be successful. ","However, as you would expect, we deliver lots of -- we develop lots of options on our business. So our investment in Sky Studio isn't really predicated on anybody else. We'll double the amount of original programming we have. We have the capacity to take that further quickly if we so want to. We're seeing great results from that. So just this quarter, viewing the Sky's own original programs was more than double what it was a year ago. And it is -- there is a secondary market. We are monetizing it well. We're either selling it in market to other retailers. So for example, we've got relationships with all the telcos, the cable businesses in Europe to sell our content to their customers. And our revenues are up something like 30% in terms of content sales year-on-year. So I think we've got a lot of good options available to us, and we'll just have to see how commercial negotiations pan out.","Stephen Burke","Just looping back to Parks, which was part of your question, Jessica. We continue to remain very bullish on the Parks business. And obviously, we're investing in Beijing. We're investing in our domestic parks. We think there's a lot of opportunity down in Orlando. We built a lot of hotel rooms. We'll be talking more about investment in the state of Florida. And it's now about 1\/3 of NBCUniversal's total operating cash flow. And we continue to love the business and think it fits very well with our animated movie business and other things that we're doing.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.","Brett Feldman","As your Cable business becomes increasingly connectivity driven, it certainly seems like the margin profile is going to keep improving. And as Mike alluded to, the CapEx profile is also likely to continue improving as well. And so what that implies is that, that business' natural ability to delever is probably going to be greater in the future than it has been in the past, and that could maybe get you back to your pre-Sky leverage profile a bit quicker. But I think that, really, on a recurring basis, it implies that business might just be creating more excess capital over the long term than we've seen. So it's really a question about capital allocation. As you get back to that pre-Sky leverage profile, how do you think about where your capital allocation priorities go? Particularly, how do you balance the opportunity to return to a share repurchase program versus reinvesting in some of the growth opportunities you were talking about over the course of this call?","Michael Cavanagh","Thanks, Brett. It's Mike. So I totally agree with the kind of the outlook for -- what the profile of the Broadband and connectivity businesses imply for the long term. Great cash flow generation profile of that business. And so we love owning it, and we'll keep investing in it in the way that Dave described. ","In terms of priorities, on -- delevering is priority number one right now. And so we've said to the rating agencies, we'd get back in line with our rating within 24 months of doing the Sky deal. And so we've made, obviously, good progress thus far on that. And I would say we're nicely on track to accomplish that. ","On the other side of getting back to where we need to, we'll talk about what to do from there. But I would say, the fundamental principles of making sure we invest steadily in our existing businesses and maintain a very strong balance sheet, while returning ample cash to shareholders through our dividend, which this year will be north of $3 billion, $3.3 billion or so, 10 years in a row of increasing the dividend, that principle, together with likely healthy buybacks, as we did prior to Sky, in the future -- is the likely future, but we first have to get ourselves back to where we said we would.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John Hodulik with UBS.","John Hodulik","Okay. Great. Maybe for Brian, could you give us an update on your view on the M&A landscape? It seems like whenever there's a telecom or media asset up for sale on a global basis that the Comcast name is at the top of the list. And then as a follow-up to that, there's a lot of changes, obviously, going on in the -- potentially changes going on in the U.S. wireless industry. Given the increased focus on connectivity in the Cable business, do you see the need to eventually own assets in the wireless market here in the U.S.?","Brian Roberts","Thanks. We're pretty focused on what we have right in front of us and very excited by it. What drove our appetite for Sky was -- began with Sky being in play and being put in the market and then pushes you to make a decision. So there's not anything at this point that I see that the company doesn't have that we're not pleased with on a big-scale basis. ","And second, what Mike just referred to about our priority to return the balance sheet to its historic levels as quickly as possible is our number one, number two and number three focus. And so we're trying to execute well, which, I think, this quarter, the first half year did. I think, to your wireless question, we're really pleased with the wireless, Xfinity Mobile, the first several years, we've been in business. Team, around 1.5 million customers, I believe. And really, we're offering a great suite of products with value to our best broadband customers. It's got a strategic focus for how we're operating the company. And now it's beginning to have real volume and scale and getting us closer to that point where, economically, it's not a drag and it's a contributor. So I don't know why we would change direction. And things could always change, but we're pretty satisfied that we have a great product and it fits with the suite of products we offer to customers.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Philip Cusick with JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick","I guess, two follow-ups. Dave, following up on your comments earlier on broadband, I'm curious what you see out in broadband competition. And as Mike pointed out through the quarter, Broadband had a tough year-over-year comp in 2Q, but was similar to better than the few years prior to that. Any reason to think that second half broadband momentum wouldn't be consistent with those last few years? And then second, on wireless, if I can just follow up on a comment, I think, Mike, you made about getting on that path to standalone economics. How do you think about the scale needed there and also the benefit you've seen so far in cable churn from those customers?","David Watson","So it's Dave. So on broadband momentum and -- it's -- we don't give longer-terms specific guidance. But most certainly, our approach is to continue to focus on the connectivity side of things, both residential and commercial. So we're -- I think we're doing both. We're adding -- we're gaining share. We are -- we have a good balance in terms of financial performance revenue. And it really does start with broadband. So our approach very much starts with being a standalone broadband, packaging broadband with X1, with other products, and we'll continue to do that. Our -- we have record churn in broadband. We continue to do, I think, a good job delivering good value. So everything I said earlier around the product pipeline is going to continue to help us in the back half of the year. So like our momentum, this is -- Q3 is always around back to school and other opportunities in broadband. But I -- we're looking at, as we said, another year, we're going to have over 1 million broadband net adds and this is really solid momentum that we have there.","Michael Cavanagh","Yes, it's Mike. I'll just add in on broadband, exactly right. We see another very strong year. Second half will --in fact, the first half, second quarter had a tough comp to last year's best ever. But when you put the first half together, it's basically in line with the last couple of years we've had or thereabouts. And so I feel very good about the remainder of year outlook in broadband adds. ","On their wireless question, we were quite pleased with the beginning to see churn reduction benefit caused by -- in the mobile space overlapping with what Dave just described in broadband. So quite pleased with what's going on there. In fact, in terms of the 1.8 million lines now, about 180 adds in this recent quarter, but you look at it on a quarterly basis, in our footprint, we're taking a very meaningful portion of the opportunity in terms of net adds available to the entire wireless market. So we like the scale we're at. ","In terms of economics, the loss of $88-or-so million in this quarter has substantially improved from last year. We need to get into the mid- to high single-digits penetration of our broadband base to achieve the neutrality on the economics. But we're on track to do that. It'll take a little bit of time. But most importantly, we just like the momentum we have in the business as it exists for the reasons Brian and Dave both pointed out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Douglas Mitchelson","Two questions. First, for Steve, understanding you do not want to provide too many details on the OTT service, I do want to explore the concept of originals versus library programming with you as a driver for the service. The Office, obviously, stands out. But Netflix believes that these new originals that drives new subscriber activations, while library content is more of the glue that keeps customer satisfied and the value of a service. Do you embrace that view that exclusive originals are a key driver for OTT services, like the one you're launching?","Stephen Burke","Well, first of all, our service is very different than Netflix. I do think when Netflix started, it was all acquired programming. And I believe, today, acquired programming is something like 80% of Netflix's volume. The vast majority of our volume, I expect to be acquired. We are spending some money on originals. And we've announced that we're doing another year of A.P. Bio. And we have another -- we have a number of originals that are actually tied to libraries that we currently own. But I would expect the vast majority of the consumption in the beginning would be acquired.","Douglas Mitchelson","Okay, I appreciate that. And Dave, when you look at AT&T's difficult programming negotiations where they're attempting to bend the cost curve, as they say, and lower the pace of programming cost growth, does that change your expectations that Comcast Cable for cost growth? And you might not want to share it, but it would be helpful when you look for the few years to know whether you're programming renewals are lumpy or spread out more evenly on an annual basis.","David Watson","Well, Doug, we haven't -- we don't give longer-term guidance, as you know, in programming. We have certainly said that we are -- these -- that last year, this year, in as cycle where there's less activity -- deal activity. So we'll be into lower programming increases. So -- but having said that, I do think we are very different in a couple of different ways. One, that we have X1. X1, I think, gives us strategic flexibility as we approach this new environment and that we combine the best of live, on-demand DVR applications. And so as we approach relationships -- important relationships with us, we're just giving consumers unprecedented options for them to simply get what they want. So we are -- we will approach it. We'll very aggressively look at data, every single deal that we will look at engagement. But we will offer up X1, and X1 will continue to be a really important platform for us in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Jayant","This is only for Jeremy. Obviously, in the U.K. and Germany, you're a reseller of the incumbent phone company's broadband network. There's probably some opportunities to get partnerships with companies that have faster speeds and\/or be partners with new build-out opportunities for broadband given Comcast DNA on connectivity. Can you just talk about, is there a real opportunity to drive subscribers broadly given the potential of faster broadband speeds in your footprint?","Jeremy Darroch","Yes. Look, I think from a customer point of view, that's only -- and actually, our business is already trading up to faster speeds. About half of our customers in the U.K., for example, now are already taking Sky Fibre. So I think, on the back of that trend, there's nothing sort of dramatic happening in Europe but a consistent trend we can grow. We get good access to higher-speed broadband in the markets in which we compete. ","Our launch in Italy, which will be probably the start of next year, later this year, sort of next year is actually a good example of our partnering with Open Fiber being a particularly helpful contract with them that gives us flexibility to just start with fiber to the premises from a get-go. So I think our position today is a good one. You can see that, of course, in the success that we've delivered in the U.K., where we become very strong number two in the residential market. We'll build a similar position in Italy. It will big new business for us to build. And then we'll be open to, can we work more closely with network providers in all those markets. And if we can, we will, but I don't think it's going to constrain us. And I don't think it's a prerequisite for us to continuing to grow.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wolfe Research.","Marci Ryvicker","I think we all understand the connectivity message, but I think we're still trying to get a little bit of clarity on the video strategy. So 2 questions related to this. Number one, are you still investing in the video product? And I think from all of the comments on the call so far, the answer would be yes, but just want you to confirm that. And then sort of following up to Doug's question, if you're, in a sense, deemphasizing video, have you become indifferent to affiliate fee increases as you renew this carriage contracts because if you pass the increases on the customer, and if they leave, they leave or you're still going to fight the fight to keep programming cost down?","David Watson","Marci, Dave. So I think you had to break that down in two ways. One, there's a marketing focus and there's a product focus. From a marketing perspective, our focus is -- we talked about connectivity, but we're also -- video is an important packaging element to the segments that are profitable, that want the best video platform there is in X1. So we'll continue to emphasize our approach towards segmentation and leveraging X1 with broadband, so you get the best-in-class combination of the 2. So we're not going to chase low end. You look at the last quarter, a lot of that are -- actually, our video churn was relatively stable to last year's second quarter. It's just less emphasis on going after lower end. But overall, X1, we will continue to market into those segments. ","From a product perspective, we will invest and are investing in X1. We're adding applications. We've talked about Hulu will be up next. The others that we're talking, we're excited about next year at NBC. There's a lot more in terms of what customers want. And as Brian mentioned, we are excited about and more to come on Flex. Flex is another -- is an extension of X1 that gives an opportunity to go after the streamer segment with a solution that kind of integrates, in an elegant way, the applications, the data. So you can use your voice, you can get to the content that you want for those apps. So more to come on that. But we will continue to invest where it makes sense on video.","Brian Roberts","Okay. Well, I just would add that I think it was a good first half of the year. And I think we had a pretty robust discussion this morning, so I don't have anything to add. It was a good answer, David. Thank you.","Jason Armstrong","Okay. We'll end the call there. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded.","I would now turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Investor Relations Mr. Jason Armstrong. Please go ahead, Mr. Armstrong.","Jason Armstrong","Thank you, operator and welcome everyone. Joining me on this morning\u2019s call are Brian Roberts, Michael Angelakis, Steve Burke and Neil Smit. Brian and Michael will make formal remarks, and Steve and Neil will also be available for Q&A.","As always, let me now refer you to Slide 2, which contains our Safe Harbor disclaimer, and remind you that this conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, in this call we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our 8-K for the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.","With that, let me turn the call to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian?","Brian Roberts","Thanks Jason and thank you everyone for joining us today. It's an honor to lead this wonderful company and 2014 was no exception. As you'll see we made very strong progress, last year was a great year strategically, operationally and financially. As our history has shown we take prudent risk and invest for profitable growth. Overall we grew revenue 6.4% in 2014 and operating cash flow by 6.9%. We generated over $8 billion in free cash flow and increased cash returned to shareholders by 64% all-in-all a terrific year. As we review these results and outlook with our Board we made the decision to raise our dividend by 11% marking the seventh consecutive annual increase. We've also increased our stock repurchase authorization to $10 billion and we plan to repurchase $4.25 billion of stock in 2015. In addition following the close of the Time Warner Cable merger and related divesture transactions, we intend to add in excess of $5 billion an incremental buybacks to this share repurchase total.","It\u2019s an incredible time in media and technology and for Comcast in particular. There is no shortage of change occurring in the competitive landscape, the breakneck pace of innovation and shifts in the regulatory climate we must navigate. That\u2019s why I keep coming back to how proud I am of the team\u2019s focus and execution in 2014. So let's talk about some of their achievements. In Cable we had another strong year of profitable growth we increased revenue 5.5% and operating cash flow 5.3%. We added 358,000 customer relationships a 67% improvement compared to the prior year and product innovation continues at a very rapid pace. We believe we have the absolute best products on the market thanks to our X1 platform, our content line up, Cloud DVR, fastest in-home Wi-Fi, voice control remotes and the list goes on. 2014 was a year in which we started to take these great new products to scale. The reaction to X1 from customers has been fantastic resulting in lower churn, more outlets connected and an increase in overall viewership led primarily by higher on-demand and DVR consumption. And it's bearing fruit in our operating results as video subscriber trends were the best in seven years.","In broadband we added over 1 million subscribers for the ninth year in a row and now have a Wi-Fi network that includes over 8 million hotspots. In addition Business Services remains a critical and profitable growth driver for us with revenue increasing 22% in 2014 off of a larger base and ending the year at over $4 billion revenue run rate.","At NBCUniversal the magnitude of the improvement has exceeded all of our expectations and the acquisition has already proven to be one of the best in our Company\u2019s history. Operating cash flow is up about 80% since we first announced the deal and 2014 was another year of strong progress as we grew revenue by 7.5% and operating cash flow by over 18%. In broadcasting we generated over 730 million in operating cash flow which more than doubled year-over-year. The network maintained its number one ranking in Primetime and saw terrific success in The Voice, Blacklist and Sunday Night Football as well as the highly successful launch of the new Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon and of course the Sochi Olympics which spanned our broadcast and cable networks and was highly integrated into our cable technology platforms really demonstrating the unique capabilities of our combined company and we\u2019re thrilled to have extended our Rights Deal with the International Olympic Committee in a deal that will make NBCUniversal the home to the Olympics through the year 2032.","Speaking of cable networks, they remain our largest source of operating cash flow at NBCUniversal and demonstrated another year of growth thanks to a diversified portfolio across sports, news and entertainment. USA and Bravo are both top-10 networks with USA ending the year at number one in total viewers for the ninth year in a row and we successfully launched CNBC Prime. There is no doubt the times are changing for cable networks but we believe our portfolio of channels is well positioned.","In film Universal Pictures produced the most profitable results in its over 100 year history on the success of Neighbors, Ride Along, Lucy and Unbroken, amongst others. The team including Jeff Shell, Ron Meyer and Donna Langley has done a terrific job. And last but certainly not least we had a terrific year with our Theme Parks. We grew revenues 17% and accelerated our growth every quarter during the year pacing at nearly 30% in the fourth quarter thanks to the enormous success of our new Harry Potter attractions in Orlando and the tremendous demand for Halloween Horror Nights in both Orlando and Hollywood.","Now turning to 2015 and beyond, obviously there has been a lot of discussion around broadband and the regulatory environment. So let me just say that our past comments on the unnecessary risks associated with applying 1930 style regulations to something as dynamic as the Internet remained the same. We are absolutely for a free and open Internet. We even agreed on what President Obama and Chairman Wheeler say should be in the rules, transparency, non-discrimination, no blocking, no throttling and no paid prioritization and we\u2019ve been consistent in communicating our agreement with those principles.","The disagreement boils down to what legal authority the FCC should use to put in place these rules. We think the Title II regulation is antiquated and has real downsides so our attention just like everyone else is on the actual text to the order, the upcoming vote, the strength of forbearance and ultimately the commission\u2019s focus on preservation of incentives for the private sector to continue to invest aggressively in broadband. Let\u2019s not lose sight of the fact that Comcast NBCUniversal is a wonderfully dynamic and diversified company, uniquely positioned at the intersection of media and technology, and we\u2019re up to a good start in 2015.","In cable we are aligned around a few critical top priorities, the first is to transform the customer experience. In short we want customer service to be our best product. We have not always lived up to that. But if we can reinvent and improve customer service we can make it easier for our customers to experience what we are confident is the best platform and the best content on the fastest network. We will continue to push the pace of innovation in cable and we will also remain focused on preparation for the integration of Time Warner Cable. We\u2019re excited about the merger and our ability to add value to customers and shareholders through the acquisition. Our integration planning is on schedule as we continue to work towards regulatory approval.","At NBCUniversal, we feel great about our media portfolio. In broadcast, we\u2019re off to a strong start most recently airing the super bowl to the highest ratings in history NSL\u2019s amazing 40th celebration we\u2019re excited about several new launches including A. D. and Odyssey on NBC and Dig and Royals on our cable networks as well as the return of NASCAR.","Our 2015 film slate is off to a terrific start with Fifty Shades of Grey and the rest of the year is packed with exciting releases including Fast 7, Minions, Jurassic World, Pitch Perfect 2 and Ted 2 just to name some. Impart the new attraction pipeline is robust especially in Hollywood with Fast and Furious and Harry Potter. We are continuing our work on a very large Theme Park in China. So altogether this is an exciting time at Comcast and we\u2019re looking forward to another great year. Michael?","Michael Angelakis","Thank you Brian and good morning everyone. As you can see form our results 2014 was a year of outstanding financial and strategic performance for the company and we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results which demonstrate consistent execution, a focus on profitable growth and the fundamental strength of our businesses. Let's review our performance for 2014 in more detail and begin with our consolidated financial results on Slide 4. For the full year consolidated revenue increased 6.4% to 68.8 billion and operating cash flow increased 6.9% to 22.9 billion reflecting healthy organic growth in both our cable and NBCUniversal businesses. For comparison purposes when you exclude the 1.1 billion of revenue and 105 million of operating cash flow generated by the Sochi Olympics in the first quarter the 237 million of year-to-date transaction-related expenses and the pension termination cost in 2013 our consolidated revenue increased a healthy 4.7% and our consolidated operating cash flow grew 7.2%. For the full year our earnings per share increased 25% to $3.20 per share.","However excluding adjustments our earnings per share increased 18.6% to $2.93 per share. Free cash flow for 2014 modestly decreased 3.8% to 8.2 billion and free cash flow per share decreased 2.2% to $3.12 per share. As our growth in consolidated operating cash flow was offset by increased capital investment and cash taxes as well as increased working capital related to additional spending for our film and TV production, now let's review the results of our individual businesses starting with Cable Communications on Slide 5. Cable Communications delivered another year of strong financial results in customer metrics. Revenue increased 6.1% in the fourth quarter and grew 5.5% for the full year to 44.1 billion reflecting solid growth in our Residential business driven by strong high-speed data results, continued strength in Business Services and higher advertising revenue fueled by political spending.","Total revenue per customer relationship and our total number of customer relationships are two important metrics that we use to evaluate our business and we are pleased with the positive trend in our results. Our objective is to focus on profitable growth by striking the right balance between financial growth and customer growth and 2014 was no exception. Total revenue per customer relationship reached $140 per month in the fourth quarter a nearly 5% increase that reflects a higher contribution from Business Services customers upgrading to higher levels of service, customer subscribing to additional products and rate adjustments. During the year we increased customer relationships by 358,000 a 67% improvement over the additions in 2013 and bringing our total number of customer relationships to more than 27 million.","We also continue to focus on bundling our products to provide the most value to our customers. At year-end 69% of our customers subscribed to two or more products and 37% subscribed to three products compared to 35% at year-end last year. We have an intensified focus on customer retention, growing our customer relationships and driving our value-added bundling strategy and our results reflect these approaches. With the assistance of our best-in-class X1 platform and industry-leading TV everywhere and on-demand services we continued our positive momentum with our video product. During the fourth quarter we added 6,000 video customers the third time we have gained video customers in the last five quarters. For the full year we reduced video losses by 27% to 194,000 the best result in seven years and during a period where the competitive environment has greatly expanded and intensified. In high-speed Internet we added 375,000 new customers in the fourth quarter and 1.3 million for the full year, the ninth year in a row that we've added more than 1 million high-speed Internet customers.","Our investments in our network and CPE are proving successful as our customers are recognizing the value we offer with speed enhancements, the fastest in-home Wi-Fi and our growing Wi-Fi footprint. Voice also remains a valuable component of the bundle and we continue to grow our voice customer base adding 123,000 new customers in the fourth quarter and 470,000 for the full year. The slowdown in voice net additions reflected the X1 availability that was specifically focused on triple play in 2013 making for a somewhat difficult comparison.","In reviewing our product categories in more detail, video revenue increased 1.2% for the full year reflecting modest rate adjustments and an increasing number of customers subscribing to event services. High speed Internet revenue increased 9.5% for the year reflecting continued growth in our customer base, rate adjustments and an increasing number of customers taking higher speed services. At year-end 58% of our residential high speed Internet customers received speeds of at least 50 megabits a meaningful increase compared to 2013.","With regard to voice revenue increased 0.4% for the full year as growth in the customer base was largely offset by a modest decline in ARPU. Business Services was again a large contributor to cable revenue growth with revenue increasing 21.9% for the full year to $4 billion. The majority of that revenue is generated by small businesses with less than 20 employees, but the contribution from mid-sized businesses is rapidly increasing and accounted for nearly 40% of business services revenue growth for the year. Business Services continues to have positive momentum and represents a large and attractive opportunity for the Company.","As I mentioned previously cable advertising also performed well as fourth quarter revenue increased 18.9% and full year revenue increased 11.5% including political revenue of 110 million in the fourth quarter and 224 million for the full year. Excluding the impact from political core cable advertising revenue increased 4.4% during the quarter and 3.5% for the full year.","Please refer to Slide 6. Full year 2014 Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 5.3% to 18.1 billion, resulting in a stable margin of 41% as we continue to effectively manage higher programming cost and absorbed additional expenses to support an accelerated deployment of X1, Cloud DVR and wireless gateways to our customers, as well as a continued investment in new business areas. Programming expenses increased 7.8% slightly below our original estimates but nonetheless reflecting meaningful increases in retransmission consent fees, higher sports programming costs and step-ups for certain long-term agreements.","As we look to 2015 we expect program expense to grow at a similar level to 2014\u2019s growth driven by continued increases in retransmission consent fees and higher sports programming cost. In addition we continue to be very proactive in expanding our rights for our On Demand and TV Everywhere platforms. We believe we are leading the industry by offering the most robust on-demand and TV Everywhere services providing us with a meaningful competitive advantage. We once again believe that we have appropriately planned for these program expense increases in 2015 and are confident we can effectively offset these costs.","As a result we expect to maintain relatively stable margins during 2015. To wrap-up the Cable segment, our growth and overall performance in 2014 clearly demonstrates that we are executing well and competing effectively with our innovative products and services that provide a great value to our customers. We are focused on improving the customer experience, having a best-in-class innovative product, and continuing to deliver strong financial and customer results.","Now let\u2019s move on to NBCUniversal\u2019s results which are highlighted on Slide 7. NBCUniversal delivered impressive results in 2014 as full year revenue increased 7.5% and operating cash flow increased 18.1%. Excluding any impact from the Sochi Olympics NBCUniversal revenue increased 2.9% and operating cash flow grew 15.3% which was driven by strong results at Broadcast Television, Filmed Entertainment and Theme Parks as well as solid results at Cable Networks.","Now let\u2019s review the individual segments at NBCUniversal. For the full year 2014 Cable Networks generated revenue of 9.6 billion, an increase of 3.9%. Excluding the Olympics revenue increased 1.1% driven by a 4.6% increase in distribution revenue. If adjusted for the closure of the Style Network distribution revenue would have increased 6% for the year. This revenue increase was partially offset by a 3.5% decline in advertising revenue as increases in price and volume were impacted by ratings declines. However when adjusted for the closure of Style and the movement of Fandango from Cable Networks to our Film group the Cable Networks\u2019 advertising revenue would have essentially been flat. Cable Networks\u2019 operating cash flow increased 2.5% to 3.6 billion in 2014 and excluding the Olympics operating cash flow increased 2.2% as the increase in distribution revenue and cost controls was offset by advertising pressure and our continued investment in original and sports programming costs.","With regards to our Broadcast Television segment, full year 2014 revenue increased 20% to 8.5 billion and operating cash flow increased from 345 million in 2013 to 734 million in 2014 driven by growth in advertising revenue, retransmission consent fees and content licensing revenue. Excluding the impact of the Olympics revenue increased 8.1% and operating cash flow increased 272 million or 78.6%. Advertising revenue increased 4.6% for the full year and 3.1 for the fourth quarter. These results reflect the success of our primetime line up and the higher CPMs we secured during upfronts as well as our impressive performance in late night.","Moving to Filmed Entertainment, 2014 revenue decreased 8.2% to 5 billion reflecting a decline in theatrical and home entertainment revenue due to difficult comparisons with the strong performance of Despicable Me 2 in the second half of 2013. Despite the difficult revenue comparisons to last year full year 2014 operating cash flow increased 47.3% to 711 million driven by the very successful 2014 film slate with the majority of the films delivering strong cash-on-cash returns in a successful carryover performance of the 2013 slate.","Switching to our Theme Parks segment, 2014 was a terrific year. Full year revenue increased 17.3% to 2.6 billion and operating cash flow grew 16.4% to 1.2 billion. Even more impressive fourth quarter revenue increased 29.9% and operating cash flow grew 37.6% driven by the continued success of Orlando\u2019s Harry Potter, Hollywood\u2019s Despicable Me and the success of Halloween Horror Nights at both parks.","Let\u2019s move to Slide 8 to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. We strongly believe that operational excellence and strategic differentiation drive profitable growth and shareholder value, so we have an operating strategy that is execution-focused and a financial strategy that is focused on risk adjusted investment returns. Our strategy support these goals by investing in our businesses with our attractive opportunities maintaining our strong balance sheet and providing consistent and sustainable return of capital to shareholders.","Our top priority remains generating strong and sustainable returns by investing in our businesses in both Cable and NBCUniversal we are investing to strengthening our competitive positions and to support attractive organic growth opportunities. As we had planned 2014 capital expenditures were 7.4 billion compared to 6.6 billion in 2013 reflecting increased investments at Cable and slightly higher spending at NBCUniversal. At Cable Communications full year capital expenditures increased 751 million to 6.2 billion equal to 13.9% of Cable revenue and in line with the plan we outlined at the beginning of the year.","This increase primarily reflects higher spending on CPE including the deployments of X1, Cloud DVR and wireless gateways, continued investment in network infrastructure to ensure our leadership in video and high speed Internet as well as continued investment to expand business services and launch new services such as XFINITY Home. We are very pleased with the success of the X1 rollout. We have completed year one of a three year plan to roll it out to a majority of our customers and at year-end X1 accounted for nearly half of our video connects. Even as our X1 customer base expands now representing a quarter of our play base the customer benefits we have previously highlighted continue.","More customers are subscribing to DVRs in more additional outlets, there is increased video on demand usage and we continue to see reduced voluntary churn levels among these excellent customers. Based on these positive customer results and strong returns we will continue to aggressively deploy X1 in 2015. In addition to X1, we plan to continue the deployment of Cloud DVR to our entire base deploying additional wireless gateways to enable our customers to receive the fastest in-home Wi-Fi and continue to invest to expand business services. As a result our 2015 cable capital investment plan represents a growth oriented strategy that will generate attractive returns it will modestly increase it to approximately 14.5% of cable revenue. At NBCUniversal capital expenditures increased 61 million or 5.3% to 1.2 billion during 2014 primarily reflecting increased investments in Theme Parks.","In 2015 NBCUniversal\u2019s capital investment plan will remain relatively stable at 2014\u2019s level with over half directed to our Theme Park segment as we continue to invest in attractions including Harry Potter and the Fast and Furious, attractions in Hollywood and a King Kong attraction in Orlando. Investments in our Theme Parks are clearly generating strong returns as we drive increased attendance and per capita spending. We are transforming our parks into must see destinations and are very enthusiastic about their potential.","Please refer to Slide 9, as we have said in the past we remain committed to delivering a consistent and sustainable return of capital to shareholders through a combination of dividends and buybacks. In 2014 we\u2019ve returned a majority of our free cash flow over 6.5 billion to shareholders including 2.3 billion in dividends and 4.25 billion in share repurchases. Earlier today we announced our 2015 financial strategy including an 11% increase in our dividend to $1 per share on an annualized basis an increase in our stock repurchase program authorization to $10 billion and a plan to repurchase 4.25 billion of our shares consistent with our 2014 share repurchase plan.","Our 2015 share repurchase plan includes the remaining 1.25 billion of the 2.5 billion buyback we committed to repurchasing before the close of the Time Warner Cable transaction. Our expectation today is at when the series of transactions with Time Warner Cable and Charter close we will generate additional liquidity. As we have previously stated we are committed to a leverage neutral transaction meaning that any excess capacity that results from the cash proceeds and debt reduction will be returned to shareholders and will be in addition to the 2015 repurchase plan announced today. Our current expectations is at the additional return of capital will be an excess to 5 billion. Now this is an addition to the value of the Greatland Connections and Charter equity distributed in the spin off.","We will provide more specific details following the completion of the Time Warner Cable merger and the divesture transactions. In the meantime we are very focused on regulatory approvals we remain optimistic that the deal will close in early 2015. We continue to make great progress with the integration planning of the Time Warner Cable merger and related divesture transactions we remain excited about the opportunities and the value they will create for our customers and our shareholders. In summary 2014 was a successful year for the Company in an environment with plenty of room for distraction our teams across the company remain focused on execution and it shows in the results. As we begin 2015 we are optimistic and feel confident about our ability to execute our financial strength in a positive operating momentum.","Now let me turn the call over to Jason for Q&A.","Jason Armstrong","Thank you, Michael. Regina, let\u2019s open up the call for Q&A please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jessica Reif Cohen","I have two questions. The first is an NBCUniversal question. You've had such a stunning turnaround, as Brian mentioned. I was just wondering if Brian or Steve could talk about what some of the biggest levers are over the next three years and have you changed your views at all on cable network upside?","Brian Roberts","So we are very diverse, NBCUniversal is a very diversified company. We are in really 15 different businesses and obviously some of the businesses will be running from a financial point of view and some of the businesses will be not running as much. Right now it's really running are the Theme Parks, broadcast, the movie businesses is on a roll and looks like that roll can continue with a very-very strong slate in 2015. We still think there is a lot of upside we're up our OCF is up something like 75% since we did the deal four years ago and we still believe that we have significant upside and that upside resides in a lot of our businesses. But right now I think one of the big drivers is Theme Parks and Films is a driver as well. In terms of the cable network business I think what we're finding is throughout the entire industry is that the ratings pressure is greater than it was a year or two ago which means it is going be a tougher business to grow we still think it is a growable business very healthy business. You've got a lot of different revenue streams you've got affiliate fees you've got SVOD, you have international, you have other digital businesses in addition to the advertising but whereas that was a double-digit growth business I think it's probably more as single-digit growth business in the future still a good business. But the growth prospects as we mentioned in the last call are unlikely to be as good in the next five years as they've been in the last five. But as a whole we feel very comfortable that NBCUniversal is a segment of Comcast that has tremendous growth potential in the future.","Jessica Reif Cohen","And my second question was just on the buyback. Can you maybe give us a little more color on why -- we understand that you're going to come back with an incremental buyback post the deal, but why no underling increase in 2015? Our estimate is that you will be levered at roughly 1.6 times with the new buyback adjusting for CapEx, the increased CapEx. So how should we think about your views on leverage and why hold back?","Brian Roberts","Well I think our target leverage has not changed for a long time Jessica. We've said we would like our target leverage to be between 1.5 and 2 times and it would take us quite a few years to get to that range. When you look at 2014 we actually increased the buyback by 1.25 billion to deal with the Time Warner Cable side. As we look at '15 we're at 4.25 billion that does include the 1.25 billion. But what we're really looking forward to is getting Time Warner Cable closed and the divesture transactions and we think the buyback for the full year 2015 could come in at close to $10 billion. In addition if we do get Time Warner Cable closed our leverage will pop up it will probably -- because we said this will be leverage neutral transaction which will probably put us in the 2 to 2.1 range which is slightly above what our target has been. So we're really looking at this somewhat as a two staged process for us and that\u2019s really what the focus of our buyback has been. In addition from a dividend perspective we looked at it both in terms of our company today and if we are able to get to the merger complete obviously we will issuing some shares and those will have dividends as well. So we feel very good about our return of capital we think it's pretty aggressive for 2015.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Phil Cusick","So given the announcement from Cablevision on Freewheel and recent chatter about Google's plans, I wonder if you can give us updated thoughts on how you think about just Wi-Fi both on the existing business where you are ramping that out, where does that go and then the potential for mobility later over the next couple of years? Thanks.","Brian Roberts","We think Wi-Fi is a great asset. We have 8.3 million hotspots now including the in-home and outdoors. We think we are working on how we monetize that asset and bring it to market. As you know we have MVNO relationships with Sprint and Verizon and the use of Wi-Fi continues to go up about 70% of in-home and office it goes over Wi-Fi. And I think given the recent spectrum auctions, it shows that wireless seeks wired and just from a cost perspective and should we do believe in the asset and we will be working on the ways to bring it to market over the coming months.","Phil Cusick","Can you give us any idea what that might look like versus what is out there today?","Brian Roberts","No, I think we are still assessing possibilities and we will announce when we have got the product well refined and developed.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Craig Moffett","Two questions if I could. First, just in terms of timing on the transaction, can you just elaborate on whether you have entered the negotiation phase on conditions with either the DOJ or the FCC or that's just sort of an ongoing dialogue that happens all the time? And then second, if you could just talk about the capital intensity for a minute, Michael. Have you changed your view at all about the long-term capital intensity on the cable side of the business? Charter is moving to a much more set-top box-light model. It sounds like with your capital intensity still rising a little bit that that presumably is not part of your plan. So I just wondered if you could elaborate a little bit on that issue.","Brian Roberts","Why don\u2019t I take the CapEx side the reality is I know we call it capital intensity but all CapEx is actually bad CapEx. If you go back to 2012 and look at our capital investment plan compared to 2014 about 75% of that increase is gone into what we call growth capital and that growth capital has just terrific return on invested capital for us. We look at it on a risk adjusted basis, we look at it on CLV, we look at it on just pure cash-on-cash and we are investing pretty heavily in some offensive areas like expanding business services great returns, deploying X1 great returns, putting additional Wi-Fi and wireless gateways as Phil mentioned which have a great returns on their own and I think sees us for different businesses that are attractive going forward. So we really look at where is the capital going, is the capital going to areas that are defensive or are they going to areas that are offensive and have terrific cash-on-cash returns.","That being said there are some trends in our favor, we don\u2019t give guidance long-term where you could see equipment cost coming down, you could see how the household architecture becomes less expensive but what we are really focused on right now is business services and X1 and a variety of areas that we think have just great cash-on-cash and great growth areas for us going forward. So to go from 13.9% to 14.5% with the vast majority being success oriented and growth oriented, we are pretty excited about making those investments which also has similar aspects to NBC on the Theme Parks we are delighted to make the investments in Theme Parks and the results speak for themselves.","Michael Angelakis","Let me just finish on that with one other thought that I think the hardware cost in household are coming down overtime, we are seeing terrific capability increases, we are putting very capable devices and what\u2019s happening is then fantastic response from consumers. In fact when I go to New York and LA people say how fast can I get X1 I wish I had it and that takes me to your second question, your first question which was the regulatory process. And all we can say is pretty much as we have said all along which is they are shot clock at the FCCs due to expire at the end of March lots of information gathering has been taking place and we continue to believe this is an approvable transaction and this week they will be dealing on the open Internet order as everyone knows and hopefully they will be able to turn attention to our transaction right thereafter.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ben Swinburne","Brian, going back to your comments on Title II, I am curious, some of your telecom competitors have talked about the implications of this regulatory approach to the appetite to invest, how they think about the returns of the business. Maybe for you and Michael, do you see any major implications based on what we know today? I realize we will know more, in theory, in a few days, but based on what we know today, do you think -- does this change how you think about the broadband business return profile or your willingness to spend capital on that business?","Brian Roberts","Look I think and then Michael can comment as well, my view is until we see the order it is premature to speculate obviously my comments I just made about our view that we don\u2019t believe Title II was the right answer, but if that is indeed what happens we will have to appropriately adjust and reflect on what the words are, what the specific details are, we are here heartened that there is at least the desire to forbear from things that would be a disincentive to invest but until we see a fine print I think we have to reserve judgment.","Michael Angelakis","The only thing I would add Ben is obviously the uncertainty that Title II may provide I think does provide us with the opportunity for a higher degree of scrutiny on capital and broadband we really as Brian said need to look at the details but there will be some internal scrutiny here in terms of what our investment plans look like with broadband.","Ben Swinburne","And if I could ask just one follow-up, you mentioned customer service I think first as one of your key areas of focus for 2015. Maybe Neil, if you want to comment, what have you seen so far recently on your initiatives there and is that paying off in lower churn? What should we be looking for in the business results in 2015 to say that your investments are paying off?","Neil Smit","Well Ben, we\u2019re very much focused on the on boarding process where our churn is 2 to 3 times higher the first 90 days and we want to get that experience right for the customer. We\u2019re making things more convenient for the customer so we recently announced the UPS deal and I think boxes have then returned now to 90% of their 4,400 stores so the consumers are using that convenience. And we\u2019re improving the tools that our employees are using so we rolled out Tech Finder we\u2019ve got a customer effort index where we can look at how many times customers called or had service calls so we have got a lot of efforts going. The good news was in Q3 that our video results were driven primarily by reduced retention and Q4 excuse me and so we\u2019re seeing retention improving and we\u2019re going to keep driving the customer experience as our top initiative and it will be our best product.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Vijay Jayant","Just continuing on the Title II front, obviously it appears that it is probably going to get challenged legally, so I think some investors are concerned that, as part of concessions on the merger, that you may give up your legal right to challenge that. Is that any risk at all in your thinking? Thank you.","Brian Roberts","I would differ till we see the order but I think we do not want to be different than any other company in the industry and one of the things that we\u2019ve said from the beginning is that the right place to have a review of broadband even if we don\u2019t agree with the outcome of that review in all cases would be to effect all industries and all providers so that are on a level playing field as we go forward. So in our view our business is not in the same geography as Time Warner Cable we\u2019re in different markets and the right way to look at the business I think is to look at the whole industry and look at all providers.","Vijay Jayant","If I could add one more, please, which is with the new definition allegedly on broadband speeds of 25 by 3, and allegedly the concentration that Comcast pro forma for Time Warner Cable will have, can you talk about does that matter, especially in an environment where the regulators telling you how you are managing that, both at the interconnect and at the customer level. Does concentration matter, in your mind?","Brian Roberts","That is in my understanding of 25 is an aspirational goal it\u2019s something that we have been fortunate to be investing all these years to bring fantastic broadband I think our results today and for the last several years have shown that that investment pays off and we\u2019re hoping that when it\u2019s all said and done there is going to continue to be incentives to want to make new investments and I think our motive had never been for some aggregation benefit actually in the broadband business but rather to continue to give consumers more and better usage. So when you go to the Consumer Electronics Show what you see are Internet of Things, Internet of Devices, you hear all the consumer electronics companies that they make smart devices that attach to intelligence in the cloud and if we can continue to have more bits be demanded by consumers that\u2019s a great thing for those of us who are in the business of trying to innovate and build more capacity. And I think that\u2019s the aspiration and I think that\u2019s what our company has done well and we\u2019re going to continue investing in that way if we\u2019re able to.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brett Feldman","I'm going to try to follow-up to what Phil was asking about earlier. I know you are not prepared to roll out what the big wireless strategy is, although it sounds like we will get more color on it later this year. But maybe just bigger picture, as you work on the strategy behind the scenes and assess what the opportunity is, are you ultimately looking at mobility as something that might end up being an attractive feature? Meaning it would be cool if you could mobilize products you already offer. Or are you looking at this more holistically to think that this could be a business and that investors should be thinking more about Comcast getting into a new business, potentially, through mobility?","Brian Roberts","I think it could be either one or both we think it\u2019s as I said a great asset, clearly the world is becoming more mobile. We have our apps our video apps out in the mobile space and they're getting a lot of usage our My Account app for customer services had 41% of our customer relationships visitors in December. So we view the mobile world expanding as well as we're assessing the business opportunity clearly Wi-Fi is a great asset it's got a lot of carrying capacity and that as Brian just said the more bits that are travelling over a network the more buyable that Wi-Fi network connected to a wired network becomes. So it could be both of what you stated.","Michael Angelakis","The only thing I would add Brett is when you think about all the investment we've made in the Wi-Fi over the years and everything on our Cloud DVR and our TV Everywhere platform. The real goal has been that our customers can access their video any time anywhere whether in the home or outside the home. And we think Wi-Fi is a great delivery mechanism to expand that product. If Wi-Fi can also develop into a different type of service than that\u2019s an added benefit to the Wi-Fi investment.","Brett Feldman","And just to clarify is it safe to assume that your CapEx guidance for the year incorporates whatever extent you are investing in the wireless business this year?","Brian Roberts","That\u2019s correct our CapEx guidance includes our Wi-Fi deployment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Bazinet","Just have a question for Mr. Burke. There is a view on the buy side that because of the measurement issues for cable networks that there may be sort of a catch-up trade in terms of ratings and ad growth. And I just wonder if you could comment on that in the context of your single digit revenue growth rate commentary.","Steve Burke","I think there clearly is room for improvement in terms of measurement. As more and more people watch in more different areas online and often those areas are un-rated. There is also a catch up in terms of monetization to give you an example we think about 70% of the views of Jimmy Fallon and The Tonight Show occur online and that the majority of those views are un-monetized completely un-monetized. So here you have one of the hottest shows on television where 70% of the views are in an area that we don\u2019t get credit for it. That\u2019s not going last forever. So clearly there is going to be an improvement that having been said cable ratings are under pressure because there are so many new shows, so many people are watching SVOD, so many people have DVRs there are a whole variety of reasons why cable ratings are under pressure. But I do think at the same time there is reason for cautious optimism that both measurement and monetization is going to get better.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. ","Marci Ryvicker ","I have two. The first, it feels like Time Warner Cable is a lot stronger today than when you announced the transaction initially. Is that what you are seeing as you go through your integration process? And then the second question is really for Stephen or Brian. You mentioned a theme park in China. At what point do you start building that out and does that impact the financials?","Brian Roberts","I'll take the Time Warner Cable one I mean I think that the team over there have a plan obviously we diligence that plan a while ago and it appears to us like they're trying to execute that plan. So obviously we don\u2019t have as much insight as we would like. We hope they are successful in executing on their plan.","Steve Burke","So in terms of Beijing we're talking many years out. We're talking after 20-20 a park that opens and we haven\u2019t even completed the final design process and much of our arrangements with Beijing. So I think we're ways before capital becomes anything that you would call material.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Kannan Venkateshwar","Just a couple from my side, the first is on the Wi-Fi side. You guys are in a unique position given that you have broadcast spectrum, especially with the intent to auction coming on next year. So when you look at your Wi-Fi deployment plans and the wireless plans that you have, how much does the spectrum that you own fit into that plan in addition to the MVNO agreement that you have with Verizon and Sprint? And then, secondly, on the dynamic ad insertion front, there has been a lot of conversations about how that will become more important over the course of the year, but is it fair to say that a big part of the back end is actually owned by the cable distributors when it comes to inserting these ads dynamically and how do the economics work for dynamic ad insertion in that case? Thanks.","Brian Roberts","Why don\u2019t I take the first one I know we've had a couple questions related to Wi-Fi or wireless and really I don\u2019t think this is the point that we would want to be too open with what our wireless plans are going forward. We are investing in Wi-Fi, we think Wi-Fi has many benefits to our customers and we'll be pursuing that whether it can be mobile or how we think about the broadcast spectrum I think that\u2019s still very much a work in process in our organization I think we have a lot of work internally to do to appropriately evaluate that. So I don\u2019t want to spend too much time on it because from our standpoint we are working through all those issues and technologies internally.","Michael Angelakis","And concerning DAI capabilities the back-end that inserts the ad dynamically was actually built by a cable consortium called Canoe the rates they charge are fairly immaterial because the primary objective was to get it to be used across all the networks. So we currently have the majority of the networks involved in it, and it\u2019s gone very well and it is kind of found inventory where we can insert as pre post mid roll and we will continue to focus on improving DAI and getting more programming through it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Mike McCormack","You've talked about margin stability in the cable side as we go into 2015. I am assuming the programming expense offset would be some sort of rate adjustment. Just trying to get a sense for your thoughts on price elasticity, where you might be able to take some price. And then also maybe a comment about AT&T U-verse, it seems that they have been pulling back. Have you seen a change in the competitive landscape? Thanks.","Brian Roberts","I will take those in reverse I think the competitive landscape remains generally the same. There is quite a bit of promotional activity going on but we feel we are very competitive and I think our results show it. And we are competitive in terms of product we are offering as well as the offer itself and we are very focused on the retention end. Concerning the price increases, I think there will be modest price increases in line with previous years. I think in terms of maintaining margin a bigger factor is the mix of products where we get higher mix of business services HSD and those are higher margin products. So we feel we can offset the programming increases by improved mix and modest rate adjustments.","Mike McCormack","I guess, Neil, just thinking about subs in 2015 between DirecTV talking about going negative and maybe U-verse pulling back even though you say it's competitive, what is your view on sub counts as you look out on 2015 for video?","Neil Smit","I think we don\u2019t put out numbers on what we project for itself but we will continue to try and balance the sub volume mixture with the rate increases and I think that\u2019s the delicate balance we are always trying to maintain which is rate and volume. And we think we are doing a pretty job of it I mean video loss has decreased 27% this year and we are going to keep focusing on balancing rate and volume.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of James Ratcliffe with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","James Ratcliffe","Two if I could. First, can you just update us on thoughts on over-the-top video products and particularly out of your footprint? Even with TWC, you are only going to cover about half the country and if there's interest in potentially exploring the other offerings I think to the other half. And secondly, on Business Services, can you talk about how much of growth is footprint expansion at this point versus increased penetration of the footprint you already have and the customers you already have? Thanks.","Brian Roberts","Neil you want to take or Mike business services for a second for a bit.","Neil Smit","Business services, we don\u2019t put out what the mix is of network expansion versus just growth on the network but about we are penetrated about 25% in SMB and 5% in mid market. Mid market growing at a increasing rate relative to SMB and we continue to expand the network as Michael said because it\u2019s a great investment and then we try and put as many businesses on the network as we can, to get it denser. So overall we will continue investing in business services expansion and continue driving our mid market and SMB.","Michael Angelakis","But as you can imagine it\u2019s a combination of both James, just probably 18 month ago we had literally zero penetration in the mid sized sector, so we invested in that area. Now we are still pretty small at 5% but growing nicely, so it\u2019s really a combination of both.","Brian Roberts","On the OTT out of footprint, I think what we have said previously we don\u2019t have any new news today which is our focus is in footprint investing in networks, having direct relationship with customers having tens of thousands of people in the field to come to your home and service you and then add devices in your house and grow that relationship over the years. And if you step back in the year 2014 I think we grew cash flow close to 7% as a full company, 18% is NBCUniversal outstanding year over 5%-5.5% at the cable division while as Neil just said increasing customer relationships by 358,000 which is the big increase over 2013. And then when you roll it up financially we have been able to have a 11% dividend increase, $10 billion authorization buyback from the Board, setting us up to continue to the momentum that I think this company has and investing in capital areas where we are excited by the opportunity led principally by business services and the X1 rollout and some of the Theme Parks activity. So all-in-all really pleased, we stay focused good solid strong year and a great beginning to 2015 and thank you all.

Please refer to our 8-K for the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.","With that, let me turn the call to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian?","Brian L. Roberts ","Thanks Jason and good morning everyone. Our third quarter results continue our optimism and momentum in 2014. Our businesses are well positioned and producing strong financial results. During the third quarter we grew operating cash flow by 7% and increased free cash flow to $2.5 billion. And year-to-date operating cash flow has increased more than 8%. There were several significant achievements across the company.","In Cable, we generated solid revenue and operating cash flow growth each of which was over 5%. Highlights include a notable improvement relative to the prior year in both broadband and video subscriber results. In fact, our video subscriber result was the best for the third quarter in seven years and our 315,000 broadband net adds was the best third quarter result in five years. Additionally, strong growth in business services allowed us to surpass a $4 billion annualized revenue run rate in that segment.","At NBCUniversal operating cash flow increased over 13% thanks to a continued turnaround in broadcast the opening of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Diagon Ali in our Orlando theme park, some good successes in film along with consistently strong cash flow production from our Cable networks.","As we look at our key initiatives, that will drive future growth through a number of exciting developments in this quarter. Starting with NBCUniversal, our third quarter results are a great example of how the investments we\u2019ve made in the businesses are paying off and positioning us well for the future.","In broadcast NBC continued its momentum throughout the summer ending the full 2013, 2014 season ranked number one among adults 18 to 49 which was the first full season win we\u2019ve had in 10 years.","Now the new fall season has just begun and NBC is off to another strong start ranked number one in the same demo through the first several weeks of the season. The team has done a great job making NBC vital and profitable once again. In Film, Lucy was the world wide success in the third quarter, infact while 2014 included a smaller slated universal, we\u2019ve had some great successes as \u2013 films so far this year achieved the number one slot at the domestic box office, and we continue to invest for an exciting slate in 2015.","With our Cable Networks ratings have been under pressure industry wide as the market continues to be very competitive with more original programming and time shifted viewing than ever before. However, Cable Networks continue to contribute very strong cash flow with NBCUniversal and we have a diverse portfolio of channels with entertainment sports and news. USA was number one Cable Network in the third quarter and is on track to be the most watched Cable Network for the ninth consecutive year in total viewers.","Brave and Sci-Fi are now top ten networks as well. And CMBC is the fastest growing network in prime time among adults 18 to 49 and 25 to 54. As we have said before our Cable Networks are generally under monetized compared to our peers, which gives us a strong relative positive for future growth.","In Parks, as I mentioned we opened a new Harry Potter attraction in Orlando, which combined with added hotel capacity led to a record summer attendance and a record labor day. The new attraction is off to an amazing start driving double digit per capita growth and a significant lift in premium park-to-park ticket sales. Even more encouraging our guest satisfaction has been overwhelmingly positive with scores well above 90%. Our confidence in the parks has led us to a recent announcement in which we agreed to form partnership in China where over several years we will be developing a park in Beijing. Expect more on this in the future. So Steve Burke and the team at NBCUniversal have made great progress so far in 2014.","Turning to Cable communications, Neil Smith and the team once again delivered strong results and in an environment with plenty of room for distraction they clearly remain focused and are executing at a very high level. Consumers viewing and consumption patterns and the competitive landscape are evolving at a very rapid pace as evidenced by the recent announcements over the past week. We understand content company\u2019s attempts to look for new ways to grow their businesses. We believe we have been a leader in working with content owners with our development of TV Everywhere, X1, Cloud DVR, light packaging and streaming amongst other things.","With our breadth of content right both in and out of the home, and on notable devices along with our investment in new platforms and user interfaces. Comcast Cable is uniquely positioned to continue to innovate and lead this evolution. A good example of this is our new XFINITY on campus product we launched during the third quarter with six schools with several others currently in trial. The service lets college students watch live TV and On Demand content on the IP enabled devices including laptops, tablets and smartphones while on campus.","With this younger generation more and more viewing is happening away from the traditional TV set and we\u2019ve evolved our product and services to better engage with them. At the same time, we continue to aggressively deploy our X1 and Cloud DVR technologies in our broader subscriber base.","We believe our X1 operating platform offers customers an unrivaled experience. We recently surpassed 5 million X1 boxes deployed, a significant achievement in a such a short time frame.","And now we are rapidly rolling our Cloud DVR which allows customers to stream it download DVR recordings out of the home to any device, as well as stream live TV to any device in the home.","In Wi-Fi, we continue to extend our reach. A scale of our efforts in Wi-Fi is attracting new partners in further enhancing its reach and enhance the value that we provide to Comcast subscribers.","We\u2019ve recently announced an agreement with Liberty Global where subscribers of the two companies will gain access to each others Wi-Fi networks. For Comcast customers, the deal provides access to more than 2.5 million Wi-Fi access points in various countries in Europe.","This is a terrific new benefit that we are excited to provide our customers with additional reach and capabilities in the years ahead. Finally, I want to spend a minute on our overall customer experience.","Our customers deserve the best experience every time they interact with us. While we have made progress, we need to do a better job in ensuring consistent excellence in our interactions.","When the moment of customer orders new service to the installation, to the way we communicate and respond to any issues. Over the last few years we\u2019ve been incredibly focused on product innovation and delivering great content and technology experiences.","So now it\u2019s time to leverage those capabilities to deliver truly exceptional customer service. The way we interact with our customers on the phone, online, in their homes is just is important to our success as any other products that we provide. Put simply, customer service should be our best product.","That\u2019s why I\u2019m really pleased with our recent appointment of Charlie Herrin to lead our customer experience initiatives. For those who have not had the opportunity to meet him, Charlie in his most recent role led the design team behind the development of X1 and he spearheaded the company\u2019s initiative to deliver a consistent user experience across platforms.","Charlie in his team received the 2011 Emmy Award for outstanding achievement for the XFINITY, TV iPad app. A 2013 Emmy Award to the X1 user interface. We are all excited for Charlie in his new role and are committed to improving in this critical area.","Let me conclude with some brief comments on our pending acquisition of Time Warner Cable. This is an important and exciting time as we focus on gaining regulatory approval for our transactions.","We are very encouraged by the recent shareholders approvals on each side of this transaction as both our and Time Warner Cable shareholders boded overwhelmingly in favor of the merger.","Shareholders see it the same way we do. And its opportunity to give customers access to higher broadband speeds, a more extensive content line up and what we believe is the industries best operating platform in X1 and in the process create more value.","As I mentioned earlier, there is a lot going on with a lot of opportunities for distraction, but our teams on both sides of the business remained focused and are executing at a very high level and I believe it\u2019s evident in these results.","So let me now pass this to Michael to cover the third quarter results in greater detail.","Michael J. Angelakis","Good morning, and thank you, Brian. Let me begin by briefly reviewing our third quarter consolidated financial results starting on slide four. Overall, we are very pleased with our third quarter performance which reflects consistent execution and sustainable profitable growth.","For the third quarter, consolidated revenue increased 4% to $16.8 billion and operating cash flow increased 7% to $5.7 billion, reflecting healthy organic growth in our Cable business and an exceptional performance at NBCUniversal.","These results include $77 million of Time Warner and charter transaction related cost during the third quarter of 2014, which is a similar amount to the $74 million of costs associated with the termination of a pension plan in the third quarter of last year. Excluding both of these items, operating cash flow growth would remain at 7%.","Year-to-date consolidated revenue increased 6.9% to $51 billion and consolidated operating cash flow increased 8% to $17 billion. However, for compatibility purposes if we exclude $1.1 billion of revenue related to the Olympics in the first quarter, $138 million of year-to-date transaction related cost in the pension termination cost in 2013, our consolidated revenue increased 4.6% and our consolidated operating cash flow increased 8.3%.","Earning per share for the third quarter increased 52.3% to $0.99 per share versus $0.65 per share in the prior year, however when you exclude favorable tax adjustments in a transaction related cost I just mentioned our normalized EPS increased 12.3% to $0.73 per share.","Year-to-date, our earnings per share increased 33.7% to $2.46 per share versus $1.84 per share in the prior year, again, excluding the tax adjustments gains on sales and acquisition related items our normalized year-to-date earnings per share increased 19.9% to $2.17.","Free cash flow for the quarter increased 26.7% to $2.5 billion and free cash flow per share increased 28.4% to $0.95 per share. This growth was primarily driven by increases in consolidated operating cash flow, improvements in working capital and lower cash taxes which were partially offset by increased capital expenditures. For the first nine months of this year, we generated $6.5 billion of free cash flow, a decrease of 8.2% over the same period in 2013. Year-to-date free cash flow per share has declined 6.8% to $2.46 per share.","Now let\u2019s review the results of our businesses in more detail starting with Cable Communications on slide five. Our Cable Communications business continues to execute well delivering solid financial and customer growth in the third quarter. Cable Communications revenue increased 5.2% to $11 billion driven by continued strength in high speed internet and business services as well as higher advertising revenue due to political spending.","Total revenue for customer relationship increased 4.2% to $137 per month reflecting rate adjustments the higher contribution from business services and increasing number of customers taking multiple products. At the end of the quarter, 69% of our customers subscribed to two or more products and 36% subscribed to three products compared to 34% in the third quarter of last year. In addition to solid financial growth, we continue to deliver strong customer metrics. We increased total customer relationships by 82,000 in the third quarter more than three times the net additions versus last years third quarter.","Our X1 TV everywhere and On Demand platforms are clearly best-in-class, while X1 is still a relatively small portion of our overall video base its contribution is having a positive impact. Our X1 net adds continue to accelerate and accounted for more than one third of our video connects in the quarter, and we once again reduced our video customer losses. In the third quarter we lost 81,000 video customers, a 36% improvement from last years third quarter and the best third quarter customer result for video in the past seven years.","High-speed internet also delivered impressive subscriber results. We added 315,000 new customers during the quarter, an increase of 6% year-over-year and the best third quarter results in five years as we continue to differentiate our product with speed enhancements and the fastest in-home Wi-Fi with our advanced wireless gateways.","Over 50% of our high-speed data customers now have one of those new wireless gateways. We also continue to grow our voice customer base this quarter, albeit at a slower rate than last year, adding 68,000 new customers in the quarter. This slow down in net additions was a result as we focus on double play during the back-to-school season as well as X1 availability that was more focused on triple play customers last year making for a difficult comparison.","As we review the product categories in more detail, video revenue increased 1% reflecting modest rate adjustments in an increasing number of customers taking advanced services partially offset by a decline in pay-per-view revenue to the results of events compared to last years third quarter.","High-speed internet revenue increased 9.6% during the quarter making again the largest contributor to cable revenue growth driven by continued growth in our customer base, rate adjustments and increasing number of customers taking higher speed services.","At the end of the quarter, 50% of our residential high speed customers now receive speed of 50-megabits or greater, as we continue to increase the speed included in some of our bundle plans. With regard to voice, revenue decreased 0.5% for the third quarter, as the growth in customer base was offset by a modest decline in ARPU.","Moving on to business services, third quarter revenue increased 21% to $1 billion and was again the second largest contributor to cable revenue growth in the quarter. This rate of growth is especially impressive given that business services is now a $4 billion run rate business.","The majority of that revenue is generated by small businesses with less than 20 employees, but the contribution from mid-sized businesses is rapidly increasing and have accounted for close to 40% of business services revenue growth in the quarter.","Cable advertising revenue increased 12.3% primarily reflecting an increase in political revenue for November's mid term elections. Excluding the impact of political, our core cable advertising increased 3.1%. We expect advertising growth to remain strong in the fourth quarter, again, driven by political revenue given the upcoming elections.","Please refer to slide six. Third quarter cable communications operating cash flow increased 5.1% to $4.5 billion, resulting in a stable margin of 40.4% compared to 40.5% in the third quarter of 2013. Included in these results is a legal settlement that negatively impacted operating cash flow and reduced this growth rate by 40 basis points.","This is a strong financial performance as we effectively manage higher programming cost, and increasing advertising marketing and promotion expenses and absorbed additional expenses to support the deployment of X1, Cloud DVR and wireless gateways across our footprint, as well as a continued expansion of business services and XFINITY Home.","Programming expenses increased 7.1% in the third quarter, slightly below our original estimates, but nonetheless reflecting increases in retransmission consent fees, higher sports programming costs, and step-ups related to certain long-term agreements.","We are pleased with the management of these cost year-to-date and while we expect fourth quarter programming expense growth to accelerate, we continue to expect our full year program expenses to increase slightly lower than the 9% to 10% we had forecast at the beginning of the year.","In addition, advertising, marketing and promotion expenses increased 9.1% for the third quarter, reflecting higher overall media spend and continued investment to more effectively target customers and enhance our competitive position in both our residential and commercial businesses.","We continue to experience modest expense growth in our customer service and technical operations as we rapidly deploy X1, Cloud DVR, wireless gateways and XFINITY Home across our base. And as Brian said earlier, we are not only focused on offering the best most innovative products, but we want to support them with a superior customer experience.","We are effectively offsetting these increased expenses with an improving product mix as we add more high-speed data in business service customers and upgrade existing customers to higher level of services such as HD DVRs, and faster internet speeds, as well as we implement modest rate adjustments.","Overall, our cable group\u2019s third quarter and year-to-date results clearly demonstrate that we are executing well and competing effectively with our innovative products and services that provide a great value to our customers. We are focused on improving the customer experience, having best-in-class innovative products and continuing to deliver strong financial and customer results.","Now lets move on to NBCUniversal\u2019s results which are highlighted on slide seven. NBCUniversal has also executed very well, delivering double-digit operating cash flow growth in both the third quarter and on a year-to-date basis. In the third quarter, revenue increased 1.2% and operating cash flow grew 13.3% driven by strong results at Broadcast Television and Theme Parks.","Now let's review the individual business segments. For the third quarter cable networks generated revenue of $2.3 billion, an increase of just under 1% driven by a 5.1% increase in distribution revenue. If we adjust for the closure of the Style Network, distribution revenue would have increased 7%.","This revenue increase was partially offset by a 4.6% decline in advertising revenue as increases in price and volume were offset by a decline in ratings. When adjusted for the closure of Style and the movement of Fandango from cable networks to our film group, advertising revenue would have declined 1%.","Cable networks operating cash flow increased 1.8% to $868 million, reflecting higher revenue, and relatively flat overall expenses. As higher sports programming cost, including our relationship with Philadelphia Phillies and the launch of English Premier League on NBC Sports Network were offset by decreases in marketing and other operating expenses.","With regards to our broadcast television segment, third quarter revenue increased 7.7% to $1.8 billion driven advertising revenue growth of 4.4%, increased retransmission consent fees and higher content licensing revenue.","The growth in advertising reflects the rating success of our primetime summer lineup on NBC, as well as our continued strong performance in late night. As a result, we finished the summer rank number one, extending our number one status for the entire year.","With the first few weeks of the fall broadcast season now behind us, we are all off to a strong start and optimistic about our 2014 and 2015 schedule. Broadcast\u2019s third quarter operating cash flow increased $108 million to $142 million reflecting higher revenue and a slight increase in programming expenses. ","Moving to filmed entertainment as expected, third quarter revenue declined $213 million or 15.2% to $1.2 billion reflecting a decline in theatrical revenue primarily due to the strong box office performance of Despicable Me 2 in the third quarter of 2013. This was partially offset by an increase in content licensing revenue due to a larger number of strong titles compared to the prior year.","Third quarter operating cash flow decreased 20% to $151 as the lower revenue was partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of film cost and reduced advertising, marketing and promotion expense due to a smaller film played.","Our Theme Park had a remarkable third quarter as revenue grew 18.7% to $786 million, reflecting higher guest attendance and per capita spending driven by the successful opening of Orlando's Harry Potter Diagon Alley on July 8.","We are off to a strong start with record attendance levels per capita increases, the significant lift in park to park ticket sales. In Hollywood the April opening of the Despicable Me Ride continues to drive strong attendance and also per capita increases. Third quarter operating cash flow increased 16.9% to $402 million reflecting higher revenue, and an increasing operating cost to support the new attractions. ","Let\u2019s move to slide eight to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. In the third quarter, capital expenditures continue to track our plan and increased 13% to $2 billion compared to the third quarter of 2013 driven primarily by increased investments at cable and a modest increase at NBCUniversal.","At cable communications, third quarter capital expenditures increased $212 million or 14.8% to $1.6 billion, equal to 14.9% of cable revenue versus 13.6% in the third quarter of last year. The increase primarily reflects additional investment as we launched our Cloud base initiatives higher spending on CPE, as continue to deploy the X1 platform in Cloud DVR as well as our continued investments in network infrastructure to increase our network capacity.","Year-to-date cable communications capital expenditure have increased 13.7% to $4.3 billion representing 13% of cable revenue. We continue to be very pleased with our X1 rollout. We accelerated our X1 net additions in the third quarter compared to the second quarter and recently hit a milestone of having $5 million XI boxes deployed to our customers. As the deployment expands, the customer benefits have continued, more customers subscribe in the DVRs and take an additional outlets, there was an increased video on demand usage and we continue to see reduced churn levels among these customers. As originally planned, we anticipate that cable CapEx spending will accelerate in the fourth quarter and as a result we continue to expect at full year cable capital intensity will increase to approximately 14% of cable revenue compared to 12.9% in 2013.","Third quarter capital expenditures at NBCUniversal increased only a $11 million to $295 million, primarily reflecting increased investments in Theme Parks as we continue investing in new attractions, including the completion of Harry Potter in Orlando and the ongoing development of Harry Potter as well as the Fast & Furious attraction in Hollywood.","Year-to-date NBCUniversal CapEx has increased $77 million to $884 million. We continue to expect that NBCUniversal's 2014 capital expenditures remain relatively stable compared to 2013s level.","Please refer to slide nine. As I mentioned earlier, we generated consolidated free cash flow of $2.5 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 26.7% as growth in consolidated operating cash flow, improvements working capital, and lower cash taxes were partially offset by higher capital expenditures.","For the first nine months of the year we generated $6.5 billion in free cash flow, a decrease of 8.2% over the first nine months of 2013 and year-to-date free cash flow per share has decreased 6.8% to $2.46 per share, primarily reflecting increased working capital in the first six months of the year as we increased our production spending in preparation for a larger 2015 film slate.","We are executing on our 2014 financial plan and year-to-date we have increased our return of capital to shareholders by 33% to $3.9 billion, including share repurchases totaling $2.3 billion and dividend payments totaling $1.7 billion.","Now turning to our acquisition of Time Warner Cable and our related transactions with Charter, we received overwhelming support from our shareholders this month was more then 99% of the votes cast approving our merger with Time Warner Cable.","We also have strong momentum at the state and local level, having received consents from more then 90% of the 2500 plus franchising authorities covering more then 7800 franchise areas and communities. We remained very focused on regulatory approvals, as well as our integration planning. We continue to expect the merger to close in early 2015.","As we have mentioned before, we plan to repurchase an additional $2.5 billion of stock before we close the deal and we anticipate that the additional share repurchase will be split between the fourth quarter of 2014 and the close of the deal in early 2015.","Overall, we are very pleased with the operational and the financial progress we have made during the first nine months of 2014. And we are focused on continuing this momentum. We believe our strong focus on execution will continue to generate profitable organic growth and continue to yield positive results.","We are progressing with the integration planning of the Time Warner Cable merger and Charter divestitures. We remain very excited about the opportunities these transactions bring to Comcast and the value they create for our customers and our shareholders.","Now let me turn the call over Jason for Q&A.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks, Michael. Regina, let\u2019s open up the call for Q&A please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ben Swinburne - Morgan Stanley","","Thank you. Good morning. I have two questions although they are related; Brian as there is obviously lot of focus on Time Warner's announcements last week about an HBO over the top launch. And I don\u2019t know if you comment on that specifically and if not, maybe just broadly, philosophically how do you and how does Comcast look at the idea of bringing product to market for your consumers that moves the \u2013 the content distribution model outside of what we historically think of as the TV bundle into a \u2013maybe more either Internet bundled service or even a direct to consumer model. Is that something you think make sense for the industry for Comcast and its customers, do you view that as being a less elegant solution than X1.","And then I had a sort of question on the same lines for Steve around time-shifting and streaming and its seems like we're seeing an acceleration in behavioral shift. Do you have any sense Steve how much leakage in viewer ship you're seeing in comparing the Nielsen ratings to what's actually happening at the customer level, particularly at your cable networks and how do you fix that problem over time?","Brian L. Roberts","","Okay, Ben. Thank you. I think I'll start and maybe give Neil a chance to talk a little bit about your first question then we'll kick it over to Steve. I am going to differ talk about any of the specific announcements. But as I said earlier, I do think its, all companies are trying to figure out how to reach all customers, potential customers and do what's right for their company in their mind. But I do think our existing business model is very strong this quarter, last quarter and probably you know, future quarters will show that many people want these bundles.","But we have experimenting with products like and enrolling out Internet plus where we offer our \u2013 one of our best broadband's speeds along with a smaller television package along with HBO. We have a campus product that is very exciting which \u2013 where you don\u2019t get box, it\u2019s simply a streaming product right from the get go.","So I think our \u2013 both our innovations department, our network and our existing relationships and our relationship with content companies, you put all together and that puts us in a great position to try to reach many consumers and work with each company and try to find the best answer with their content. Neil?","Neil Smit","","Yeah, I think clearly there is some shifting in the ecosystem and we were focused on targeting every customer segment, as Brian mentioned that we were the first to introduce HBO Internet Plus product targeted at the \u2013 in millennials together with HBO. We have a great working relationship with them and I expect that continue.","The X1 product actually is driving more linear viewing and we think that also targets everyone, not just millennial group.","Stephen B. Burke","","So Ben, in beginning of your question you mentioned that the HBO product was then over the top product, I actually don\u2019t think it is, and I don\u2019t think the CBS product is over the top either. If you define over the top sort of coming over the top the existing distributors and going direct and bypassing existing distributors, I think both HBO and CBS are trying to add to their existing ecosystem.","And if you think about it HBO probably has the most elegant, economically attractive sort of business model, anybody who is ever been in the television business as be interesting and I think challenging for them to go and try to attract new customers into that ecosystem without cannibalizing the existing customers.","The existing customers that are sold through cable and satellite are extremely high margin. So even if they sell at $15 sub, they got to be very \u2013 when they go directly to a consumers view the internet, they got to be very careful at cannibalization.","It will be interesting to see how that works, but I don\u2019t think they are saying we're going over the top of the existing ecosystem, I mean, Time Warner was company that really created TV everywhere. I think CBS is the same thing. CBS is not, I don\u2019t think trying to get their existing ecosystem to move over to a new model, they are trying to Mellanious or new customers and I think that\u2019s we're all trying to do.","And that leads into the second part of your question about time-shifting and leakage. I think the fact of the matter is people have more options to watch quality, professionally produce video then ever before and they are using those options. Whether its DVR, Netflix, Hulu or a variety of other ways to consume this content. A lot of those options are not properly measure; some of those options are not measure at all. And so what you're seeing I think is a pressure on traditional ratings in both broadcast is been going on for a while.","But now cable, I think some of that is going to get better, I think there will business models that evolve, some of that we've addressed by selling to Hulu and Netflix and Amazon and we make hundreds and millions of dollars doing that. But I think its going to be more, more and challenging. There was a great article a few months ago where they said that were 88 new television shows launched during the summer and this is in a business that 20 years ago nobody launched a new television show during the summer. So that competition combined with new technology is making it harder and harder to deliver the kind of ratings that we've all been used to.","Ben Swinburne - Morgan Stanley","Thanks a lot\u2026","Stephen B. Burke","The only think I would add is, I really want to emphasize the value of our product, if you really look at the last 12 months, we lost about 155,000 video customers and we've had been over built by an additional 2.2 million over built homes, and we've also increased our bundles by over 200 basis points year-over-year. So the value of our products we think are pretty compelling and I think the numbers are showing that force.","Ben Swinburne - Morgan Stanley","Yeah. Thank you very much.","Stephen B. Burke","Thank you very much.","Brian L. Roberts","Yeah. Thanks, Ben. Operator, next question please?","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson","Hi, thank you. Two questions, I guess both for Neil probably. You know first you\u2019ve probably heard a lot of people now more openly speculating about a Wi-Fi first retail offering in wireless, can you just update us on your thinking about that? And then second if I could just follow up to the comment that Michael just made about the overbuild and yet the relatively small video losses, can you expand on that a little bit, does that imply that you are actually gaining share in the places where we are just competing against satellite at this point?","Neil Smit ","Sure, Craig. On the Wi-Fi first front we continue to extend our Wi-Fi network both in-home and out of home. We have a total of about 5 million hotspots, the majority of those are in-home but we think it\u2019s a very powerful asset going forward. We are not, we haven\u2019t clearly identified how to best monetize that asset, but the in-home Wi-Fi usage about half our HSD customers have our high end routers with the highest in-home speeds and they are hiring in more devices everyday and I think they are going to be more connected devices coming and Wi-Fi will be an important aspect of the subscription value.","With regards to the video business, I think there were a number of good things that happened this quarter. One is we targeted effectively what really drove the video number was churn reductions and I think we are getting better customers, we are screening them better and I think also we are bundling better. We \u2013 as Michael said, we went up 200 basis points on double and triple play churn bundles.","And so the video business is strong. X1 continues to pull well, it was about 20% of our triple plays now and about 75% of the triple play net adds this quarter. So and all the metrics around X1 seem to be holding the churn, voluntary churn reductions down about 20%. The DVR purchases are up, the transactional VOD is up 20% so it continues to perform very well.","Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson","Should we assume that most of your losses at this point are due [telco] TV or \u2013 net your roughly breakeven or you are better than that against satellite at this point?","Brian L. Roberts","","I think it depends on the market but we are performing well and we feel against both the telcos and satellite players.","Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson","Right. Thank you.","Brian L. Roberts","","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Also two questions, one NBCU one Cable. On NBCU hoping Steve would comment on either this visit contrast between the broadcasting cable advertising growth, is this all ratings in your view, you mentioned the measurement issues, when does that actually get rid of the measurement of devices and non-linear viewing how much would you attribute this problematic buying some of which obviously will come back and into television and any commentary you can give in terms of share shift within media, some of the money is actually going to digital properties are you seeing a new digital property? So that\u2019s the NBCU question.","Stephen B. Burke","","That was actually seven questions, but I\u2019ll try to answer them all as one. I think some of it is measurement, you know Nielsen did the sort of put in broadband homes into the denominator and appears to be taking them out now and you know there is some sort of pure math measurement. I think there is also sort of a feeling that its increasingly difficult to particularly when you are looking at demo ratings 18 to 49 that\u2019s increasingly difficult to get measurement in upscale young homes.","So I think there is always a question about that. But I think the fact of the matter is the next five or ten years in basic entertainment cable as it relates to ratings are going to be much more difficult than the last five to ten years. And as a side of that, that\u2019s technology and there\u2019s a side of that that\u2019s a lot of new shows and the ability to have your required programming your VP programming which many of these cable networks were built on, when you can get those episodes in other places I think those are going to be tougher businesses than they have been. We don\u2019t see the advertising number was as it relates to cable was primarily driven by ratings not by CPMs.","I do think you are seeing kind of a resurgence of the advertising business as NBC resurges so that explains some of the change there. But our big cable channels particularly when sold as a portfolio are very attractive and very powerful. I just think its unreasonable to assume that the ratings for those businesses are going to grow if you look over a five or ten year period.","Jessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","And the digital shifts?","Brian L. Roberts","","You know there is clearly a shift to digital; you can\u2019t talk to a marketer or an advertising agency that isn\u2019t talking about shifting dollars to digital. I do think to agree the upfront was a little slower for some people. We actually had a very good upfront but for some people it was not so good and the question is, is it tentativeness on the part of the advertisers or a shift to digital. I\u2019m in the camp that says it was more tentativeness and keeping flexibility. The fact of the matter is digital can\u2019t deliver the same kind of emotional attitude adjusting advertising at a 30 second television spot can and I think a lot of advertisers intellectually want to get the targegability and data driven side of digital but they also realize when they have big product to get out into the market that they need television.","So, I think clearly there is a shift to digital, but I think the market is likely to be quite strong and you know the question we always get as is how is scatter? Scatter is just fine. Its steady, and for us because we\u2019ve had our performance at NBC and sell as a portfolio we are seeing very very fine attractive steady trends in the scatter market.","Jessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Great. And then on the Cable question, is just like as I follow up on some of XFINITY comment, you mentioned 5 million set top boxes now, can you talk about where you might be a year from now and you know what are you seeing in terms of usage, is that linear viewing is up, what do you think overall usage and is there a difference in ARPU you already said churn is lower 20% better, but what are the statistics, are you finding from XFINITY?","Neil Smit","","What we said publicly is that we will have the X1 boxes to the majority of our customers within three years. And we are I think we are right on track. In terms of the performance date the X1 customers do have a higher ARPU and they have a higher ARPU for three reasons. One is the VOD buys are great or 20% higher, two is they get almost two times the number of DDRs than the average customer and three is they have more additional outlets, that they are getting, they want to use the system more its getting more usage.","We are seeing more viewing both in linear and On Demand, and I think that\u2019s just because we are making it easier to discover and find that the content. I think that you know we are going to continue to see good results. We continue to refine the product and I haven\u2019t seen any slowdown in the performance metrics.","Brian L. Roberts","","The only thing I would add is when you look at the triple play sort of the customer life time value of an X1 triple play, obviously given what Neil just said in the low and the reduced churn we do have a pretty done good return on that investment of X1 and we have an improvement in the CLV.","Neil Smit","And we\u2019ve opened up the availability from both from the triple play and now double play customers and in retention, so as a wider audience has it available.","Stephen B. Burke","Just to state the obvious, we\u2019re very pleased with how stable it is, we\u2019re doing something that\u2019s never been done before, nobody else is doing this I don\u2019t think anywhere in the world right now. And its scaling, we are growing. We have accelerated already and if we can continue to do things \u2013 you know it\u2019s a game changer and to the extent that we can speed up in ways I think it\u2019s our goal but we also want to deliver a great experience with it and it\u2019s a complicated process to get it into the home \u2013 working perfectly but want to stay if its fantastic.","Brian L. Roberts","Next question, please.","Operator","Next question will come from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John Hodulik - UBS","Okay, thanks guys. I want to focus a little bit more on the lower video churn. First, is that being driven by just increased acceleration or penetration of X1 or are there other factors that are driving that down?","And then as you look forward towards the completion of the transactions, move churn has always been a factor in the sub trends. I mean how would the better clustering that comes from the deal and the swaps affect that factor. I mean can we expect sort of another step down in terms of video churn aside from the X1 issues?","And then, Neil, you talked a little bit about the pull through effects on DVR. But what about broadband? I mean, as we see better churn and better video trends is that going to have a -- do you have a higher attachment rate for broadband with X1 that should help make those trends continue as we have seen recently? Thanks","Neil Smit","Okay, you have a number of questions in there. The video churn was driven, the churn reduction I should say was driven by a few factors. One is X1, this just has a lower churn profile and business is usual boxes.","Second is we are bundling more, so we have 68% in the bundle and so that \u2013 then triple played at 36% it reduces the overall churn significantly. And three is I think that some of the new features we are adding in like the electronic sell through where you own the assets and it reduces churn, it could hold you into the system, its very sticky. So I think there are a few reasons there.","And I think we tightened up the credit policies, we are targeting customers better, we are being more effective in our marketing. Concerning the X1 and its relationship to broadband pull through, I think generally speaking if you got better products and you put them together we\u2019ve got the best broadband product, the best Wi-Fi product and the best video product. I think no matter how you mix them; you are going to get greater pull through. And we\u2019ve been creatively bundling a number of different offers going after different segments and it\u2019s been working.","Stephen B. Burke","And I\u2019ll just comment on the move churn, of course one of the benefits of the transaction is more territory which would hopefully reduce move churn and what we call those jump offs and we\u2019ve looked at that, that\u2019s simply a benefit of the transaction ultimately it will show up in our revenue synergies which we are optimistic on.","John Hodulik - UBS","Okay.","Neil Smit","I just want to say maybe kind of relates to the deal in general but to that point on what are some of the benefits of the transaction you know remember that obviously there is no overlap so we\u2019re not reducing any competition as we\u2019ve made the case. But products like X1, faster broadband, faster Wi-Fi, now with Cloud we haven\u2019t talked about Cloud DVR and streaming in-home where you don\u2019t need a device like the campus product we have borrow On Demand.","So for those of you in New York or in LA on the call, you know we\u2019ve been really looking forward to bringing this suite of products as fast as possible. We are doing a lot of work to try to have an integration plan to hit the ground as fast as humanly possible, business service side being able to have more markets and Charlie Herrin was one of the first things he is working on in his new job in customer experience is that move churn question which is to \u2013 when you are on the phone wanted to take you all the way to completion so that the move so we can reduce the friction in the system for people who are moving.","So we\u2019re anxious to bring this we think better suite of products to these new markets along with things like internet essentials and offering the whole array of benefits that we have listed in the transaction, but I think it\u2019s the better products and we are working hard to have a plan to do as quickly as possible after close.","John Hodulik - UBS","Brian, you guys have a -- you guys have said that you will have [excellent] penetration to the majority of your sort of Comcast legacy subs in three years. Considering the platform is already set and it is stable can you do better than that in terms of the new markets once the deal is closed?","Brian L. Roberts","That\u2019s the stuff we are working on right now. And everybody we \u2013 you know I\u2019m not ready to answer that question right at this minute, but Neil has set a very high bar for the team internally to say that\u2019s the game changer. How fast can we get this suite of products to you know all the markets that are Time Warner Cable but lets just you are in New York, you know in New York and that\u2019s we have to learn a lot about how it operates in New York we are doing that, planning now but we believe we have good road maps to have a satisfactory answer to that question, but we are working on it a huge opportunity with this transaction to bring better products to consumer that we don\u2019t offer any products to right now.","John Hodulik - UBS","Great. Thanks guys.","Brian L. Roberts","Thanks John. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Phil Cusick - JPMorgan","Hey guys, thanks. Neil, speaking of drawing more customers into the video ecosystem, can you talk about the success of your on-campus efforts? And the big mix shift this quarter is the double play from triple play. Is that a back-to-school issue or do you think there is some secular sign of a downshift and voice penetration rate? Thanks.","Neil Smit","I\u2019ll answer in the reverse. The double play was more a result of the double plays focus was more a result of the back-to-school which is such a big part of our third quarter net add. You know the students are less focused on a fixed line phone and go with wireless alternative. The other thing that happened last year in the third quarter we launched X1 and it was available only to triple play customers so that drove a lot of phone units during that quarter so the comp was \u2013 is difficult. Concerning the repeat your other question?","Phil Cusick - JPMorgan","Just trying to think about driving more customers to the ecosystem as you think about back-to-school you\u2019ve been putting in some skinnier video packages, is that certain to draw more people and who might otherwise just gone to broadband.","Neil Smit","You know the senior packets is as we look at the audience that we want to target and that were hard responding to certain offers. And we\u2019re always testing offers to find out which package draws the best. The XFINITY campus product that you mentioned what was great about that is we went to the campus and in many of the campus we offer business services to whether its\u2019 internet or whatever.","And the students wanted to watch television but they wanted to watch it in their dorms on their laptops, so we came up with this streaming solution where we plug into the University network, it\u2019s not seasonal because it\u2019s a bulk deal and you know we are getting standing ovations at these universities. We\u2019ve got six universities who are currently providing their service to in a number of others in roll out mode now. So, I think its\u2019 a great new products that\u2019s a way of targeting an audience in getting the land yields you know you use to watch in the great \u2013 all the great content that\u2019s being produced right now, in a way that\u2019s convenient to them.","Phil Cusick - JPMorgan","That\u2019s great. Thanks Neil.","Brian L. Roberts","Thanks Phil. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant w- ISI Group. Please go ahead.","Vijay Jayant - ISI Group","Thank you. I just want to follow up on the prior question by Neil. It seems that the skinny video packages are having some traction. But I understand that there is some limitations on how pervasive that can be given your contracts that they are widely distributed content providers. So can you talk about where you are on that lifecycle and how much flexibility you still have? And once you do hit that what can you do next to still keep those customers within the ecosystem? Thanks ","Neil Smit","While we don\u2019t disclose our programming content to contract and the penetration requirements but we manage within the realm of those contracts and the offers and we manage out and can control that very closely. But what\u2019s interesting is this Q3 if you take Internet Plus and Blast Plus which were the two lean products we had last year. And you were to compare Internet Plus and Blast Plus to this third quarter. We actually sold fewer Internet Plus and Blast Plus net adds this quarter than last year. So the mix was a little bit different. And we \u2013 ARPU and revenue were a little bit soft than video because that we took pure rate increases this year than the year before.","Stephen B. Burke","So let me just say that when you are talking about confidentiality of the programming contracts, Neil let me just use that as a moment to just clarify what I believe happened yesterday with the FCC. It\u2019s that issue of confidentiality of programming agreements that the FCC and the programmers are debating, and so there is a procedural issue on how to go forward and that\u2019s between them and I don\u2019t believe and we don\u2019t believe has any \u2013 the stoppage to respond to that doesn\u2019t reflect any substance of concerns with our transactions. So we\u2019re not particularly concerned about that development because we believe the FCC is still doing continuing with the staff as working on that substantive review. And even if the clock stopped and this has happened in other transactions as well, but this particular dispute over programming contracts is kind of new. So we continue to believe that the review will get completed and as we previously said you know and hopefully close sometime early 2015.","Brian L. Roberts","Thanks Vijay. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett, your line maybe on mute.","Brett Feldman \u2013 Goldman Sachs.","Thank you. Sorry about that, thanks for taking the question. A point of clarification, you mentioned the pacing of the additional share repurchase program. I am just curious is that at all sensitive to the actual pace of the approval process? For example, does it matter that the FCC has paused there shot clock","And then I want to go back to talk about churn. All the things you highlighted, whether it is X1 or increased triple play, those things seem like they're going to continue. And so it would seem that churn is likely to continue to migrate lower going forward. Do you think it is reasonable for us to anticipate that as a result of that your video trends will continue to improve on a year-over-year basis, or is there an offsetting factor we need to be taking into account?","Stephen B. Burke","Okay. I\u2019ll take the buyback one obviously. Our view on buyback is really simple. It\u2019s not necessarily co-related to the shot clock or pacing. Our intention is to do the 2.5 billion of additional buyback there. We had always mentioned and splitted evenly 1.25 billion in the fourth quarter of this year and 1.25 billion in the early parts of the first quarter of 2015. So we are putting finer point on that.","With regards to churn and I\u2019ll let Neil take it, but I think the goal has always been just to continue to improve and I think we\u2019ve improved 14 or last 16 quarters with regards to video.","Neil Smit","I think that\u2019s right. It\u2019s been a pretty steady trend and we think that\u2019s because we are putting a better product and I think we\u2019re always managing the balance between units and rate and trying to balance out that equation. And looking for new segments and bringing new products to market and opening up new channels such as the campus channel.","Brett Feldman \u2013 Goldman Sachs.","Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question.","Brian L. Roberts","Thanks, Brett. Next question please","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo","I have two questions, one regulatory for whoever wants to take it, and then one for Steve. So on the regulatory front can you just talk about what is going on in DC? Your thoughts on the potential for [Title 2] either to be at the last mile or at the interconnect?","And then secondly for Steve, were you surprised by the HBO or the CBS announcements? Or is this something that you either had a feeling was coming or they gave you a heads up for? Thanks.","Brian L. Roberts","I think in terms of the DC question, this is Brian. We have been pretty consistent and we\u2019re still in the same place which is that we think that broadband innovation and investment are critical to not just our company but to the nations infrastructure and that the best way to have a strong and robust investment cycle as well as real protections where consumers is with section 706 that there is a real consensus among all the Internet service providers and I think the internet community in general that\u2019s strong rules, having an open ended free internet are important and we support that initiative but we don\u2019t want to have a rule set that creates uncertainty and lingering doubt which we believe titled two does. So that\u2019s our position, I think that\u2019s a position of a number of companies and we you know have been hopeful that that\u2019s how it will resolve itself.","Stephen B. Burke","Regarding HBO and CBS selling directly I was surprised, I was surprised by both of them for different reasons. CBS I was surprised because they have been such a defender of retransmission consent in the traditional ecosystem and been so successful in the broadcast business and HBO because I think its going to be such a challenge for them to not cannibalize what is already a really really good business. That having been said, we are still early on in the transition to more internet television that I think you are going to see a lot of surprising things. And you know what\u2019s surprising to me is that we are making hundreds of millions of dollars from Hulu and Netflix and Amazon, businesses that we didn\u2019t even think about five years ago.","So I think we all ought to be prepared to be surprised every once in a while but also put everything in perspective and really look at what people\u2019s real motivations are and the challenges. I don\u2019t think distributing directly to consumers be the internet is an easy thing to do and I think it\u2019s a voyage that if you are successful like Netflix can be a way to create a lot of value but it\u2019s not an easy thing to do.","Neil Smit","The one other thing I guess just to add on the back on the regulatory is the interconnection question if there is one is being looked at separately by the FCC and we think that that\u2019s we have supported that and welcomed that with you we are very hopeful that that will show that its our motivation and our practice to be completely transparent and have great products for consumers and poor companies who want to reach those consumers.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo","Thank you.","Brian L. Roberts","Thanks Marci. Regina, just given the time we\u2019ll take one last question please.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Bazinet - Citi","Hi, thanks. I just had a question for Mr. Burke. Given the changes that are going on in the video ecosystem and some of the trends you alluded to going forward for Cable Networks, what adjustments, if any, do you think investors should anticipate regarding your Cable Net portfolio? Thanks.","Stephen B. Burke","Well, I think we\u2019re always making adjustments and trying to look at new things, if you take USA for example, we\u2019re going to be investing more in original programming. We\u2019re not going to put a number of that, because of a lot of it is show dependent but investing in original programming we\u2019re going to try to make that program \u2013 we\u2019re changing the lens on that programming, if you went back five years or so you have say, was in the business of creating blue sky procedurals and we\u2019re much more interested serialized slightly edgier content.","I think you could see us taking some of our existing sports that are on other channels and putting them on USA. So there will be a whole variety of changes and hopefully those changes resulted in a hit and our ability to outperform the rest of the sector I do think that the point that they were make is, that the sector is unlikely to have ratings performance over the next five or ten years, that\u2019s good it was over the five or ten simply because its more competitive and there\u2019s more technological change out there.","Neil Smit","But let me just end the call by saying, thanks for as always the good questions and interest in the company. I think, we had a really strong third quarter. I think its reflect the quality of the underlying businesses, the teams are executing well. They\u2019re staying focused which is as we talked about really at a very complicated time.","A lot of momentum at NBCUniversal and in Cable we talked a lot about the innovation and what that\u2019s doing to our results. So I\u2019m pretty really pleased with the team there and what\u2019s happening in the trends. And the positioning of X1 and ability to take it in-home on other devices, out of the home with TV everywhere, cloud DVR networking, Wi-Fi getting faster and better, bringing that to the Time Warner market the transaction review we\u2019ve now submitted everything that\u2019s been require a lot of the local franchises have been approved.","It\u2019s an exciting time for the company and exciting time for the industry.

Please refer to our 8-K for the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.","With that, let me turn the call to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian?","Brian L. Roberts - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. We were really pleased with the second quarter results as we continue our terrific momentum this year. We increased revenue and operating cash flow thanks to broad-based strength across our businesses. As you will hear, we have many positive trends in each part of the company.","At Cable, we achieved some of the best customer metrics in nearly a decade while posting strong operating cash flow growth. Our results this quarter provide further evidence that customers are responding favorably to many of our new initiatives. We added 115,000 customer relationships which is more than triple the number we added in the second quarter of 2015. In what is normally a negative seasonal quarter, we lost only 4,000 video customers, the best second quarter result we have had in over ten years. On a trailing 12-month basis we have now added about 90,000 video customers, a remarkable improvement in the face of significant competitive and technological change and a testament to the investments we've made in our platform and breadth of content.","X1 is now about 40% penetrated, and we have deployed a total of 8 million voice remotes. We're rolling out 800,000 new voice remotes each month and customers love it. It's generating over 200 million commands per month. Overall, the feedback on X1 continues to be terrific and the voice remote is driving customer satisfaction with the platform even higher.","Next, at high-speed Internet, we added 220,000 customers, the best second quarter result in eight years. Similar to video, the improvement was driven by better customer retention. We've started our rollout of DOCSIS 3.1 and expect this to continue to enhance the quality of our offering and ultimately our competitive advantage.","We've been investing in improving the customer experience at every touch point, and we're very encouraged by our progress. Many of the key indicators around customer service are showing real improvement. First call resolution is at a multi-year high. Our billing and on-boarding contact rates are down significantly. Our customer satisfaction scores are up, and external indicators are pointing in the right direction as well. So all in all, another very strong quarter at Cable.","At NBCUniversal, as expected, we had a challenging comparison in film, but we delivered very strong performance at broadcast and solid growth in our theme parks and cable networks. I'm pleased to report that we've now completed our most successful upfront since owning the company with a 12.5% CPM increase at NBC primetime. Overall, demand is strong across our entire portfolio. We've got a differentiated story versus our peers. Part of our success and leadership comes from a unified approach. We go to market as one company.","Also, our Big Night strategy is compelling. If you aggregate Big Nights on TV in 2016, defined as a 10-household rating and a five in the 18 to 49 demo, we project that NBC will own 70% of those nights. We're also continuing our leading position in news. NBC Nightly News won both total viewers and a demo for the fourth consecutive quarter. The Today Show remains number one in demo, and Meet the Press has risen from number three to number one in the key demo in the past year alone.","We're on track to finish number one in broadcast for the full year, and cable networks continue to benefit from a great portfolio in entertainment, sports and news. For example, we saw particular strength at MSNBC during the quarter and are proud of the six recent Emmy nominations for USA's Mr. Robot, including for outstanding drama series.","At Theme Parks, the highlight during the quarter was our launch of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Hollywood, which has been a tremendous early success. Both attendance and per-capita spending at the park saw significant lifts and guest satisfaction is at record levels.","In film, we announced our acquisition of DreamWorks in the second quarter. We look forward to welcoming the team and their wonderful creative talent to Universal and the broader Comcast family. Speaking of animation, The Secret Life of Pets is a huge success and another great example of what happens when we put the entire weight of the company behind an initiative. We featured pets on many different platforms across all of Comcast NBCUniversal, including integration with our X1 experience.","The movie opened to a record-breaking $104 million, the highest-ever opening in the U.S. for an original animated film. And importantly, we created another franchise for Chris Meledandri and Illumination.","Finally, let me just say a word about the Olympics. It's an honor to be the company that brings the Olympic Games to America. It's one of our greatest moments of pride, and the entire organization is ready to deliver the most comprehensive and technologically advanced Olympics in history. Starting next week in Rio, NBC's coverage will be unprecedented; everything live streamed. 306 events, 11 networks, close to 6,800 hours of content. And our Emmy-winning team will bring to life the stories of these remarkable athletes in a way that nobody else can.","What excites me is the opportunity to marry the unique storytelling capabilities of NBC with Comcast's world-class technology. The best way to experience Rio will be on the X1 platform. For the first time, we have built a destination that will combine live television, online streaming and on- demand content, athlete profiles and up-to-the-minute stats in one integrated NBC Olympics dashboard. And it's all searchable with our X1 voice remote.","We think that our viewers and customers are going to be amazed. Those 17 nights will showcase the strength of NBC, all of our cable networks and Comcast Cable working together, and we couldn't be more excited.","So we've had a great first half of the year on so many fronts, and we're very excited to build on this in the second half. Mike, over to you.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everybody. I'm starting on slide four for those following the presentation. Our second quarter results reflect broad-based strength across our businesses, partially offset by a challenging comparison in Film where revenue declined by $915 million and operating cash flow declined by $366 million as a result of tough comparisons to our record-breaking performance in the second quarter of 2015. Recall last year's second quarter was driven by the tremendous success of both Furious 7 and Jurassic World.","So including film, you can see on slide four consolidated revenue increased 2.8% and operating cash flow grew 3% for the second quarter. Earnings per share was $0.83, a 1.2% decrease compared to a year ago, and free cash flow was $1.4 billion in the quarter, a decline of 5.4%. We will go into greater detail on these results on the slides to come.","Now let's start with Cable Communications on slide five. Cable Communications delivered strong second quarter results. Revenue increased 6% to $12.4 billion as we increased customer relationships and grew total revenue per customer relationship by 3% to $148 per month. We added 115,000 customer relationships, an increase of 83,000 compared to last year's second quarter, with broad-based improvement and strength across our entire footprint.","Growth in two-product and three-product customers and a reduction in churn across all products drove the improvement. In fact, we have improved churn in video and high-speed data for 29 consecutive months as customers increasingly recognize the value of our X1 platform and superior high-speed data product, and we make meaningful strides in improving customer service.","High-speed Internet continues to be the largest contribute to overall cable revenue growth. Revenue increased 8.6% to $3.4 billion in the quarter, reflecting strong customer growth, customers subscribing to higher levels of service and rate adjustments, which were more modest compared to the prior year.","Our customer momentum continued as we added a combined 220,000 residential and business customers in the quarter, up 22% over last year's net adds, and added 1.4 million combined customers over the past 12 months.","We continue to gain market share and benefit from growth in the overall market as customers respond to our product differentiation. At the end of the quarter, 79% of our residential customers received speeds of 50 megabits per second or greater compared to 69% in the prior year.","Video revenue increased 2.8% to $5.6 billion in the quarter primarily due to rate adjustments as well as customers subscribing to additional services, including premium channels, HD DVR and additional outlets. Our rate of growth was impacted by the challenging comparison to the hugely successful Pacquiao versus Mayweather fight on pay-per-view in last year's second quarter. Our rate adjustments are primarily from broadcast TV and RSN fees which, as we will discuss in programming expenses, are the most significant sources of our cost pressure.","In terms of volume, our total Video customer base has grown modestly year over year as we have consistently improved our Video customer metrics for several quarters. In a quarter that's typically seasonally weak, we lost a combined 4,000 net Video customers, an improvement of 64,000 versus the year-ago quarter, and as Brian noted, making this our best second quarter result in over 10 years.","The improvement continues to be driven primarily by improved churn. Our X1 platform is proving to be a real competitive differentiator, and we continue to make good progress, rolling it out to 855,000 net new and existing customers this quarter with nearly 40% of our total Video customers now having X1.","In addition to great technology, we couple this with a breadth of content available on demand and with a compelling TV Everywhere offering. Our customers are responding to these choices. On X1, 85% of our subscribers are using XFINITY On Demand monthly, viewing 29 hours a month on average. And 42% of our subscribers are using our TV Everywhere platforms monthly, up 17% from last year, viewing 10 hours a month on average. We think this adds great utility to our Video service.","Rounding out our residential products, voice revenue declined by 1.1% to $893 million in the second quarter as customer combined net additions of 64,000 were offset by a modest decline in ARPU, reflecting our usual revenue allocations within our multi-product packages.","Let's now turn to business services, which continues to deliver excellent results. Revenue increased 17% to $1.4 billion, with the small business segment accounting for about 75% of our revenue and 60% of our growth. Revenue for the mid-size business segment continues to grow at an attractive rate and its contribution as a percentage of total business revenue is increasing. Overall, business services has strong positive momentum and continues to represent a large and attractive growth opportunity for the company.","Cable advertising revenue increased 3.5% to $597 million, reflecting higher political revenue, as we continue to benefit from advertising for the upcoming elections. Excluding the political contribution, our cable advertising revenue increased 1.1%, reflecting slower growth across core categories and the timing of media spending. Despite the slowdown in core local advertising, we expect advertising revenue growth to ramp in the second half of this year, again driven by political revenue from the upcoming elections.","Turning to slide six, second quarter Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 5.7% to $5 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.6%, relatively consistent with the second quarter of 2015. Programming expenses grew 7.4%. However, excluding the impact of the pay-per-view fees associated with the fight in last year's second's quarter, programming expense growth would have been 9.4%. This growth reflects programming contract renewals, higher retransmission consent fees and sports programming costs. We continue to expect approximately 10% growth in programming costs for 2016 as growth ramps in the second half of the year, driven by upcoming contract renewals.","Non-programming expenses increased 5.5%, reflecting our planned investment to improve the customer experience and to continue the rollout of X1. We've added technicians and service personnel, strengthened our dispatch teams and operations and invested in training, tools and technology. As a result, technical and product support and customer service costs each increased 6%.","On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow increased 5.3% to $9.9 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.3%, down 40 basis points compared to the same period in 2015. As a reminder, earlier this year we provided full year guidance for our 2016 Cable operating margin to be flat to down 50 basis points compared to 40.6% in 2015, and that guidance is unchanged.","Now let's move on to NBCUniversal's results. On slide seven, you can see NBCUniversal delivered strong results in our TV and Theme Park businesses, offset by the challenging film comparison. Revenue declined 1.8% and operating cash flow remained stable at $1.7 billion. Adjusting to include the acquisition of Universal Studios Japan in last year's results, pro forma revenue decreased 5.1% and operating cash flow decreased 6.4%. Cable Network's revenue increased 4.7% and operating cash flow increased 8.3% to $944 million, reflecting higher distribution and content licensing and other revenue as well as lower advertising, marketing and promotion expenses, partially offset by an increase in programming and production costs.","Distribution revenue increased 6.9%, driven by contractual rate increases and contract renewals, partially offset by a slight decline in subscribers at our cable networks. Advertising revenue was flat compared to the second quarter of 2015, reflecting strong pricing, offset by audience ratings declines at our cable networks.","Broadcast Television had another strong quarter, with revenue growth of 17.3% and operating cash flow growth of 70.5% to $394 million. This increase reflects higher content licensing, retransmission and advertising revenue partially offset by higher programming and production spending.","Content licensing increased 59.9% primarily due to the availability of content in our current SVOD deals. Distribution and other revenue growth of 35% was driven by a 63% increase in retransmission revenue.","Last, advertising revenue increased a healthy 2.9% reflecting a strong scatter market partially offset by a challenging comparison in sports advertising due to less favorable NHL playoff matchups and the absence of a Triple Crown contender.","Film revenue declined 40.4% and operate cash flow declined 86.7% to $56 million reflecting the difficult comparison to last year's film performance. Most notably, theatrical revenue declined 78.8% compared to last year's second quarter which included the strong performances of Furious 7 and Jurassic World.","In addition, home entertainment revenue declined 25.1% due to the strong performance of several releases last year, including Fifty Shades of Grey. Partially offsetting this lower revenue was higher content licensing revenue due to several of last year's theatrical releases like Minions and Jurassic World now in the pay-TV window.","Theme Parks' revenue increased 47% to $1.1 billion and operating cash flow increased 40.5% to $469 million in the second quarter of 2016. On a pro forma basis, revenue increased 10.6% and operate cash flow increased 5.3%. These results were driven by higher per capita spending at the Parks and the successful opening of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction in Hollywood. Partially offsetting these results was the timing of spring break which was more concentrated in the first quarter this year, and pre-opening costs ahead of the new King Kong attraction this summer in Orlando.","Let's move on to slide eight to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. Consolidated capital expenditures increased 15.2% to $2.3 billion in the second quarter. At Cable Communications, capital expenditures increased 12% to $1.9 billion for the quarter, and on a","year-to-date basis have increased 10.6% to $3.5 billion representing capital intensity of 14% compared to 13.5% for the first half of 2015.","The higher spending reflects increased investment in line extensions and a higher level of investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity. Our investment in our network helps enhance our competitive position in broadband while staying ahead of rapid growth and bandwidth consumption by our customers. We believe we have, and will continue to monetize these investments effectively, through subscriber growth and rate adjustments.","In addition, our higher capital expenditures reflect spending on customer premise equipment related to the deployment of our wireless gateways and the X1 platform. We continue to expect that for the full year of 2016, our Cable capital intensity will remain flat to 2015 at approximately 15%.","At NBCUniversal, capital expenditures increased 32.4% to $360 million in the second quarter and increased 21.3% to $655 million on a year-to-date basis driven by the inclusion of a full quarter of Universal Studios Japan. We continue to expect NBCUniversal's CapEx to increase approximately 10% this year.","I'll now finish up on slide nine. As I mentioned earlier, consolidated free cash flow declined 5.4% to $1.4 billion in the second quarter reflecting growth in consolidated operating cash flow offset by higher capital expenditures. For the first half of the year we generated $4.2 billion in free cash flow, a decrease of 9.8% over the first half of 2015. This decline reflects growth in consolidated operating cash flow offset by increased working capital as well as higher capital expenditures and cash paid for capitalized software and other intangible assets.","In addition to investing in the business, we are also successfully executing our plan for returning capital to shareholders. Dividend payments during the quarter were $670 million up 6.6% and share repurchases were $1.1 billion, consistent with our plan to repurchase $5 billion of our common stock during the full year. In addition, we ended the quarter right at 2.0 times net leverage, in line with our stated target.","That concludes our summary of the quarter. I hope that everyone now has a good sense for how pleased we are with our results as well as our momentum going into the second half of the year. Now I'll turn it back to Jason to lead the Q&A.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Mike. Regina, let's open up the call for Q&A, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi. Good morning. A question regarding your Cable business for a second, and something that we've seen coming up in your set-top box configurations. Can you talk about the XB6 wireless gateway configuration for video distribution and what that might do, not just to the CapEx cost of X1 deployment, but also the OpEx cost of self-provisioning and how that might \u2013 when we might see that being operationalized?","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","Hi, Craig. It's Neil. The XB6 will be out \u2013 it's in the lab now. It'll be out towards the end of year or early next year. It is, as you mentioned, a Wi-Fi based delivery of the video signal, and which should cut down on both OpEx and CapEx cost. And we haven't put out how much yet. It's still in the early days, but I think it'll be a great addition to the overall hardware configuration and should over time bring down CapEx cost \u2013 CPE cost.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","And is there anything you can update us on with respect to the kind of reaction you're seeing from customers about the current X1 set-top boxes with respect to take rates of VOD, churn rates and what have you?","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","Well, churn rates are down significantly with the X1. DVR take rate is about three times native. The pay-per-view is about two times native. We're getting more additional outlets per box so the ARPU is up significantly and churn is down. So it's been a great product for us and we keep innovating with it and adding new features and functionality.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks, Neil.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Craig. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning. I have a question for Brian and one for Steve. Brian, the industry has a long history of collaboration that's been a big part of the success if you think about cable labs, et cetera, and I'm wondering in the context of all the big changes in ownership outside of Comcast and when you look at how much more software-driven the business is becoming, you look at how much more streaming is happening around the country in terms of OTT, do you see either an opportunity or a need for greater collaboration throughout the cable industry going forward and you \u2013 something that you think might actually impact your business or make what you offer the consumer even more powerful?","And then I'll just ask my follow-up to Steve. Steve, you had a huge content licensing quarter this quarter and I'm just wondering in that context, can you talk about your philosophy on SVOD licensing, particularly as we head towards this Hulu bundle, which, while we don't know what it looks like, there's a lot of talk about cutting back on licensing to folks like Netflix and putting more product inside the bundle. Just wondering if you could opine on how you're thinking about that at NBC.","Stephen B. Burke - Chief Executive Officer, NBCUniversal & Senior Executive Vice President, Comcast Corp.","So the content licensing numbers bounce around, and this quarter was slightly higher than some of the other quarters, but I don't think there's \u2013 I know there's no change in strategy. We run the business being very careful about windows and being very careful about the various ways that we make money, and we've essentially licensed to everybody that you would expect us to license to. As it relates to the new OTT entrance, I think the key there is going to be making sure that we're in every bundle, and I think we're going to be. We have more channels and more eyeballs than anyone else and we're pretty much essential to those bundles. And then as they go out, making sure that they're incremental, that they're not cannibalistic, wholly cannibalistic. I believe the vast majority of OTT subscribers will be incremental. We'll be going after people who currently are not part of the ecosystem and therefore will be additive to NBCUniversal and all of Comcast NBCUniversal as well.","Brian L. Roberts - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Look, I'm not sure I know what's at your question there, Ben, but I think listening to it, first thing we did is we wanted to have sufficient scale for Comcast to be able to invest in the kinds of things we're going to do for the Olympics and X1 where we have enough scale to justify that and do really well as a stand-alone company.","We've always liked to collaborate, you're right about that. As we look at things like business services and advanced advertising, one of reasons we were happy to see some of the other consolidation that took place earlier in the year and has been happening is to enable that collaboration, and I think it also extends to programmers and operators trying to find ways to use this new technology to give more value to the consumer.","And whether that's starting with high def, working all the way to on demand and DVRs to now additional content and random access and on multi-screens and all devices and whatever's coming next, and it's a very exciting time. And I think our company has a real momentum of being new products, innovation, improving service, and I think that's why you're seeing the results we're reporting his morning.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you both.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Ben. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Greenfield with BTIG. Please go ahead.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC","Hi. Couple questions. One, just wondering how are you thinking about balancing Video subs relative to ARPU? Obviously your Video sub growth has been really impressive relative to the rest of industry. ARPU's slowing a little bit, and just wondering what's going on there in terms of the balancing act. And then two, just wanted to follow up on the last question tied to Hulu. At INTX, I think, Brian, and your team talked to how technologically, there's nothing stopping X1 from working nationwide, and given all the stats that Neil just cited for X1, with Hulu, DISH, DIRECTV, YouTube and others going nationwide, what's stopping Comcast from basically launching X1 on a nationwide basis and really competing with everyone that's out there?","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","Hi, Rich. It's Neil. I think the first question concerning how do we balance subs and ARPU can be explained by the fight \u2013 the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight last year. The difference in revenue was about 150 basis points in the fight, so if we were to include the fight this year, it would be we'd be 150 basis points up if you want to look at it that way and actually higher ARPU than last year's second quarter \u2013 or higher revenue, excuse me. So that explains that.","I think we continuously balance the volume and the rate, but we also had more subs come into the starter package, which is a fully-bundled package, this quarter than we had in the past, so we're get the fully-bundled product out there.","Brian L. Roberts - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'll take the second one. First of all, I think, Neil, you guys are doing a great job in that answer, and the balance is one of the things we're most proud of. It's not just subscribers. It's the revenue and cash flow growth for Cable very healthy this quarter and all year, and the trend is we're doing both really well. So thanks for asking that because the fight did distort that this quarter a bit.","Look, on \u2013 we just fundamentally believe for now that our end market, end footprint strategy is where we add the most value to consumers. Right now we're 40% X1 penetrated. We're hoping to increase that in the short period, next year or two.","As it continues to scale, our broadband is great results, business services, it all works well with having a network. OTT economics are unproven to us, and out of footprint it's not clear that that's the right strategy for us. So we're about a business model where we're able to grow the customer base, have customers that have multiple products, really high value and ever-reducing churn and innovative new products you that bolt on. Now, it's not clear how you do that where you don't have a network, but we're innovating all the time, and we're happy with the strategy we have.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Rich.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC","Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Brian L. Roberts - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Wow.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. First question for Cable. It looks like expense growth moderated in the quarter if we look at just advertising and customer service. Is this seasonality? Or are you through the bulk of investment spend? And then the second question is for Steve. The 63% increase in the retrans number, is this coming more from retrans or from reverse comp? Or are they evenly split at this point?","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","Hi, Marci. On the programming costs question, it came in at 7.4%, but again, it was the fight last year that if included would have risen our rate to a 9.4% increase. So it was a significant difference between cost this year and last.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Neil, I was talking more about the non-programming expense.","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","The non-programming expense?","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah.","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","I wouldn't read anything significantly into that. It was non-programming expense. We're still focusing on customer service, we're still driving out X1, so I think that the trends are going to be fairly consistent there.","Stephen B. Burke - Chief Executive Officer, NBCUniversal & Senior Executive Vice President, Comcast Corp.","So in terms of retransmission consent, we've grown retrans very, very substantially in the last five years. But we still lag the other three big broadcasters based on what we know. We make slightly more from our affiliates as a share of their retrans than we make from our O&Os, but the real point, I think, on retrans is we still have some major contracts where retrans is going to take significant step-ups and we're still hundreds of millions of dollars less than some of the other comparable peers. And we think we deserve the same amount for retransmission consent. We have the Olympics, we have the NFL, we're the number one network in the demo, and so I think over time that'll be a number that continues to grow nicely.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Marci. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Two questions, both for Neil. First, there's like a one terabyte cap now on your monthly usage for broadband. I just want to understand how we think about usage-based pricing given that hurdle in consumption. And then we saw an announcement on you introducing a prepaid offering. Just want to understand the market opportunity, and that's something we normally see in the developing world. Why was there a need to actually do a prepaid offering for video? Thank you.","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","Well we have one terabyte. We moved it up from 300 gigabyte to one terabyte in 14% of our markets where we have usage-based pricing. We think we're going to continue to adjust and look at it as the market evolves and as usage evolves. We have different pricing models, some based on speed, some based on usage, and we're going to be flexible and kind of let the market tell us which way is best for consumers and how we add the most value. We continue to add speeds. We've upped speeds 17 times in 15 years. We've built out the fastest Wi-Fi. So we're going to continue to invest in the network to stay ahead of things.","Concerning prepaid, there is a segment of the customer, or consumer base, that we felt that there was a better model at serving them. They're generally lower income, may or may not have a credit card and generally wouldn't meet our credit ratings \u2013 or credit standards that we had applied for customers \u2013 acquiring customers. So we felt this was a good model. We tested it and it and worked well, and so we'll be rolling it out on a broader basis.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI","Great. Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Vijay. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Couple things. Staying away from Spectrum, but can you talk about the wireless strategy of the company and when we might see you do some MVNO trials? And second, following up on Steve, with a nearly 13% CPM increase, how do you think about your monetization gap versus the industry, and how long to get to parity on advertising rates? Thanks.","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","Concerning the Wireless strategy and Spectrum, I can't really talk about Spectrum but we think the Wireless represents a significant opportunity for the business. With 28 million customer relationships, our MVNO rights, which we've invoked, and our 15 million Wi-Fi hotspots, we think there's a real business opportunity there. We've been in test and learn mode. We recently announced Greg Butz, who was running all our sales channels to take over the marketing, take over the wireless business. He comes from that business, came to Comcast from the wireless business and has a great deal of experience in selling to our base and acquiring new customers. So we're continuing to move forward with our strategy and more to come in the future.","Stephen B. Burke - Chief Executive Officer, NBCUniversal & Senior Executive Vice President, Comcast Corp.","So over the last five years, we've talked a lot about what we call the monetization gap, which is the gap between the CPMs that other people get and the CPMs that we receive. We also have had a monetization gap on the affiliate side, which is the gap between the retrans or the affiliate fees that we receive in similarly situated channels.","At the time we did the deal, the monetization gap was about 20% on add sales. We've closed the majority of that gap, and the biggest progress we've made in any single upfront was the progress we just made.","A few years ago we put all of our channels together. We had previously sold cable separately from broadcast and sports separately from primetime and news. We put everything together. So now if you want to buy from any part of the company, we have a discussion about every part of the company, and that, because we're the larger provider of television advertising in the country, people come to us first. So for the last couple upfronts, we've really led the discussions and led the sort of negotiations and price setting of the entire market.","Brian mentioned it in his overview, but we got 12.5% increases on NBC Entertainment, but we also got 13% on USA. We got 12% on E!, we got 10% on Bravo, and overall Cable was up double digits and broadcast was up double digits. So we had a wonderful upfront. I think in some I instances, we might be a few percentage points ahead of similarly situated networks this year. But we think we deserve that, and we still have a gap that we're trying to close.","It's hard to make progress that's much more material than a few percentage points, but I think we certainly made it this year. And we're also taking advantage of the fact that it's a strong advertising market, both in scattering and upfront pricing, and I think big advertisers realize that digital's an important part of the mix. But if you have a major product launch, you really, really have to look at big events on broadcasting cable television that can provide the kind of reach and sort of depth that you get.","Think of what someone gets when they advertise in the Olympics. We have three times the combined ratings on any given night during the Olympics of ABC, CBS and Fox. So that kind of appeal, if you're marketing an automobile or a beer or a car, it's just a tremendous value proposition and we're happy to have it, and we made real progress this year.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, Steve.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Phil. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Oh, thanks. I'll focus on NBC in my two questions, but I just want to stay I've never seen a second quarter with video subs flattish even when the industry was like a fraction of penetration, so hats off to Neil. But I have two NBC questions. One is on the Olympics. And Steve, you just touched on the Big Nights that you'll have, but given your differentiated and unique approach to the Olympics, how will you monetize beyond the advertising sales you've already garnered? And the second completely different question but also NBCU is, can you talk a little bit about your China strategy? Have you actually signed the documents for Beijing Park and what the timing is? How are you thinking about film? The quotas are likely to be, and the splits, likely to be lifted next year? So can you just talk about overall approach to China? Thanks?","Stephen B. Burke - Chief Executive Officer, NBCUniversal & Senior Executive Vice President, Comcast Corp.","Okay. So let me start with the Olympics. So, for the first time since we've been here, we hit our advertising budget for the Olympics three weeks before the start of the Olympics. Normally we would hit the budget right about the time the Olympics started or shortly thereafter. And our budget was about a 20% increase from London. So we're very, very happy with how we're doing in terms of Olympic sales.","We make money a lot of different ways in the Olympics. We have national advertising, which is what I was just referring to. We also have a lot of advertising in our own stations. We get paid an affiliate fee by cable and satellite and telco operators. And then we have a very big digital business. All of those businesses look terrific. And the way the Olympics work, you have a sufficient make-good to cover any rating shortfall which we hope and think there won't be. But even if there was a significant shortfall, we would just make good during the Olympics. So we're looking, I think, at a very profitable Olympics. We made $120 million or thereabouts in London, and we are going to make a lot more than that in Rio. So we're looking forward to that.","China, Brian and I were in China two weeks ago, and we are very, very bullish on our business there as are most people doing business in China. NBCUniversal made essentially nothing in China four years ago. I'm talking movies, television, consumer products and theme parks. Last year we made call it $170 million in China from movies and television. That number's going to grow substantially in the future. We have existing deals and new deals and we're getting better and better at bringing our products to China. And then in 2020, we're projecting to open a theme park in Beijing, which we're very bullish about. We have not signed all the documents but we've had countless meetings. By the way, our first meeting about Beijing happened something like 12 years ago. So this has been going on a long, long time. But we're essentially \u2013 we're in schematic drawings. We've had countless discussions on \u2013 we have all the attractions laid out. I mean we're really in production mode. And I think when you look forward to 2020, combination of movies and television and theme parks, China is going to be a very, very substantial profit generator for our company.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Jessica. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. Couple questions for Neil. First on the X1, you've gone from 30% to 40% penetration in first half year. It looks like you'll be north of 50% by the end of the year. Can you give us an idea of where you think that number tops out? And looking at that, can we assume that 2016 here is the big year in term of CapEx and OpEx to support it for the X1 rollout? That's number one. And then second is on the business market. Nice growth, 17% growth, obviously most of it coming from the small, medium size business. Do you believe you need more assets to go after the large business market? Is that an opportunity for you, especially out-of-region assets? Or is a partnership with Charter and other cable companies the more likely way you approach that segment of the market? Thanks.","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","Hi, John. With X1, we will be at about 50% penetration by the end of the year. We put out about 885,000 boxes this quarter, so we are growing at a good rate. We'll continue to press more penetration. I'm not exactly sure where it tops out but you could say that generally speaking, in the 80%, 85% range. There's a part of the base you probably don't get to because you don't want to disrupt satisfied legacy customers who are in single-play video.","Concerning the business services, you're right. The majority of the growth is still coming from small and medium size. We stood up the enterprise business September of 2015. We're growing customers and we are doing deals with other MSOs. So Huawei's a good example. We just signed a deal with them for 700 locations for both XFINITY public Wi-Fi in the stores and then employee Wi-Fi also within the stores and we did it out of footprint and in footprint. So we did deals with other operators and it's worked out very well. So a lot of the chains we're opening up to like banks have main headquarters and then multiple locations. And that's kind of the profile we're going after in the enterprise space and it's moving ahead quite nicely.","John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Got you. But on the X1, can we assume that the spending there is topping out this year and maybe it's flat to down next year to support that?","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","We haven't made any projections as to how many boxes we'll be getting out over the next year. We're still working the 2017 plan. But I think that, you know, the other thing we're doing is getting X1 out on other devices and incorporating other players like Netflix into X1. So as we go out, and you can get the X1 experience on a Roku or a Samsung TV, that'll also extend its reach.","John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Great. Thanks, Neil.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, John. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I just have a question for Mr. Burke. Several years ago when you first got control of NBCUniversal, I think you guys said if you had your druthers, you'd have fewer brands to support within the cable network division. And I just wonder, is that still true? Do you still believe that's true given the way you're selling ads? And if it is true, is there something subtle going on underneath the way you're allocating your programming dollars where you're arraying them against a fewer subset of all the brands that you have?","Stephen B. Burke - Chief Executive Officer, NBCUniversal & Senior Executive Vice President, Comcast Corp.","I do think that we and most of the big media companies are concentrating on their big brands. We have some cable channels that don't have full distribution. We've had a certain amount of consolidation and moving around. We had a network called G4 and a network called Style that neither one currently exist. And I think you'll see more of that. I think you'll see the more of that with us and others as the discussions with NVPDs get more and more contentious. I think it's \u2013 you want to make sure that your big networks are fully supported and you're more willing to re-allocate. Normally when you do those re-allocations, they're not all that negative for the content owner because you can take some of the programming and fees and ad sales and move them, consolidate them on some of your bigger networks.","The good news for us, really, and you're seeing this with OTT, is if you have NBC you really need to be in a bundle. If you have USA it really needs to be in a bundle. If you have Syfy or Bravo or E!, those are big substantial networks that are in the bundle. And when you really look at our cable networks, we make most of our money in those big channels. And we've trimmed, and I think you'll see us and others continue to trim some of the more marginal channels. There's just too many channels and people are spending too much programming channels that are not fully distributed and you'd much rather put your money and have Mr. Robot on USA and have The Voice and Blind Spot on NBC and really go with your strong networks.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","How far along would you say are you in that evolution please?","Stephen B. Burke - Chief Executive Officer, NBCUniversal & Senior Executive Vice President, Comcast Corp.","I don't know. I think there's more to do. We've done some. I think there's more to do. I don't think it's going to have a material impact on the way our profitability looks in terms of cable channels one way or the other. It might be slightly positive, but I think it'll evolve itself over the next number of years and we'll continue to invest what we need to invest in the big guys and try to trim some of smaller ones.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Jason. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for taking the question, and just going back to the video trends, you talked about this long cycle you've seen and improvements in churn, and I'm just curious, do you feel like you're getting to the point where maybe most of that improvement is behind you? Or do you still see some obvious ways you can continue to chisel away at that? And then just at a higher level, your thoughts on the competitive environment in video. Seems like the second quarter may not have been the most competitive quarter in light of some internal issues that your competitors were facing. Are you expecting any meaningful change in the second half of the year, and is there anything you think you need to do to maybe reposition around the competitive environment in the back half? Thanks.","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","I think on the video side we're \u2013 we've got what I believe is the best product out there in X1. We continue to add content. We're integrating new content into the platform. We're getting on more devices, and I think we're just executing better. So I see room in continued churn reduction. It's been 29 straight months on the video and HSD side, and I think there's still opportunity there as we improve the customer experience and continue to develop the product. And your second question was...","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","See broad competitive environment, particularly looking into the second half.","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","Yeah. The competitive environment, there, I think that we're competing well across all markets. Verizon had the strike this quarter but that's only in 15% of our footprint, and the rest of our footprint performed just as well. So I think we're always in a competitive environment. Nothing's changed dramatically, and we think we're competing very well.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thanks.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Brett. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. First, for Steve, given the agreement for Netflix to be integrated with X1, Comcast cable's giving its customers better access to an ad-free viewing option relative to an ad-supported VOD option on cable. Are you concerned that that integration could have an impact on ratings and potentially ad revenue at NBCU and other cable TV programmers in the industry? And then second question for Neil, I just wanted to get your thoughts on the value of premium paid TV networks to your video platform given that they're going direct to consumer increasingly. So for example, how does HBO going direct to consumer with HBO NOW change your approach to marketing it? Does it change the value of HBO to your video customers, or do you look at it as an opportunity on the broadband side? Thank you both.","Stephen B. Burke - Chief Executive Officer, NBCUniversal & Senior Executive Vice President, Comcast Corp.","So when you look at all the change that's going on in the video spaces, I think it`s easy to sort of overreact to a change or to predict that a change is going to be more dramatic than it really is. The fact of the matter is something like 40% of the people in America have Netflix now, and the people \u2013 it's obviously an extremely successful service and people are watching a lot on Netflix. And whatever Netflix is doing to viewing habits, I think a lot of that is already done and it's going to change and the tide'll come in and go out. But I the fact that Neil's putting it on the set-top box is a great idea. It's very customer-focused. It's going to make Comcast an easier place to view, particularly with X1, easier place to view all the options in video and I think it's a very smart strategy for Comcast, and I think to the degree the MVPD ecosystem stays strong, that's good for NBCUniversal. Our relationship with Netflix has never been better. They're a huge purchaser of our content. We talk to them all the time. So my prediction is it'll be quite a good thing for Comcast Cable and it'll be a good thing for NBCUniversal.","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","As Steve said, the X1 platform gives us the ability to be an aggregator of aggregators and to incorporate services like Netflix and to give the customer easy access to it, a seamless access. We had tossed around the decision for a while, but really it came down to what's best for the customer as we get very customer experience focused and making sure we had critical mass in X1 so it made a difference. But concerning the premium packages overall, I don't see their role changing dramatically. I think there needs to be some sort of a relationship or an indexing between retail and wholesale pricing, but we still think they add great value to the service and we'll continue to work them into the service.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Anthony. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. I want to ask, I guess, first on advertising, Steve, just was wondering (54:45 \u2013 54:48) and also if you could comment on I guess how much of your inventory sold in the upfronts this year relative to last year. Did you sell more, or roughly the same or less? And was also wondering what your expectations, Neil and Steve, are for political advertising as the election cycle gets underway. And then if I could, separately, I just wanted to ask you about the YES dispute. You had obviously the real viewing data that made you confident in going ahead without YES carriage. Just wondering what you learned there and how it might affect future negotiations on RSNs. Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Hey, Bryan. It's Jason. Just to clarify, because you did break up for a part of the question, the first question was about inventory sold in the upfront? Is that the entirety of it?","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","The first question was if you could comment on what you're seeing in the scatter market right now, and then also separately if you could comment on how much of the inventory you moved to this year in the upfront. Yes.","Stephen B. Burke - Chief Executive Officer, NBCUniversal & Senior Executive Vice President, Comcast Corp.","Okay. I would say the scatter market continues to be extremely strong, as strong as we can remember it being. And that's continuing. We're going into an Olympics period, so who knows what's going to happen there, but I think the advertising market is very, very strong, and some of that is reflected in the upfront. In terms of volume in the upfront, I think we could have sold a lot more than we sold in the upfront. We sold about 10% more volume on the broadcast side, about 5% overall. We turned away a lot of volume. We're working on mix on the cable side to try to get higher, more profitable advertising into our mix in some of our cable channels. But there was plenty of volume. And we could have sold more if we wanted to. The percentage sold as a percent of the total is roughly comparable to previous years, so we still have, depending on the network, 20%, 25% of the volume available for a strong scatter market.","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","And concerning political, we see a good opportunity in the fourth quarter as we have seen in the past, and so we think there's room there. And concerning YES, we had very detailed viewership data that \u2013 where we assumed that if we took it off the air, there would be a certain amount of lost subscribers and our assumptions were much higher than the actual case turned out to be. We lost many fewer subscribers than we anticipated. So I think at the end of the day, great programming there will always be a price for, and we'll go in well informed to our conversations and look for value add to the consumer and value add between the programmers and distributors.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Bryan. Regina, we'll make this the last question, please.","Operator","Our last question will come from the line of Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. Neil, maybe just a couple for you. On thinking about the fourth quarter or the back end of the year, we're seeing a lot of OTT offerings coming out. How do you guys think about positioning a single-play broadband product, and I guess how much flexibility do you have in pricing that? And then secondly, either Mike or Neil, just thinking about the cable OCF (58:14) guide, is that just programming in the back half that might weigh on it?","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","Yeah. Concerning the Q4 OTT products, as Brian said earlier, we haven't seen an OTT model that really is very profitable for us and we think that bundling our products and having business services and operating \u2013 the bundle is still the best value. And concerning single play and broadband, we do market that. We think there's going to continue to be streaming services and OTT services that come through and broadband will continue to grow as we continue to invest in the network and the Wi-Fi capabilities.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","And in term of programming costs, so for the full year we still expect to be up about 10% for the full year year-over-year. We were about 9.4% for the year-to-date when you adjust out the deflation caused by the fight, and that's on the back of contract renewals that we had at the beginning of year and we'll have in the second half and some of that'll carry over to next year as well.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","And, Mike, is it just the programming piece, though, that drives the, what looks to be conservative guidance based on the first half?","Michael J. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Well first half of the year on overall margin we were down 40 basis points to 40.3% versus 40.6% last year, and as we said at the beginning of the year, it will be flat to down 50 basis points, and not going to tune up the second half of the year, but all the trends are as just described so we'll be in that range.","Mike L.

This is a great result and is due to the broad-based momentum across all our businesses. It gives us the best first half EBITDA growth in six years.","NBCUniversal's results stood out with EBITDA increasing by over 20% for the second consecutive quarter, reflecting strong contributions from all parts.","So let me break this down by business starting with Theme Parks, which had another outstanding quarter of double-digit EBITDA growth. This quarter included the opening of our exciting new water theme park Volcano Bay in Orlando. And speaking from personal experience, it is truly extraordinary, from the use of innovative wearable technology to the amazing attractions, including a thrilling 125-foot drop-down of slide from the top of the volcano.","In Japan, our timing was really good and we couldn't be more pleased with our acquisition of the remaining 49% of Universal Studios Japan, where the recent launch of Minion Park has significantly exceeded our early expectations.","The region holds tremendous potential for us and Mike Cavanagh and I along with Tom Williams, who heads the Park business, just returned from a trip to China and we are as enthusiast as ever about bringing a spectacular theme park to Beijing.","In Film, we continue to see success with theatrical releases after setting a new record for the biggest ever worldwide opening, Fate of the Furious, went on to become just the sixth film in history to cross $1 billion at the international box office and Universal's third-highest grossing movie ever.

The film's performance has been fantastic both domestically and internationally since its release at the end of June and was the largest ever debut for an animated movie in China.","These incredible results are attributed to the management team's wonderful execution of our franchise-focused strategy along with global marketing and distribution efforts.","In our TV businesses, our strategy to market and monetize NBCUniversal's unified portfolio of networks under one umbrella is working really well.","On the distribution side, affiliate fees and retransmission fees continue to fuel good momentum.","Our upfront performance proves that advertiser demand for high-quality TV content is really solid. During the upfront, we achieved high single-digit growth in CPMs, demonstrating the power of the big events we air across NBC broadcast, Telemundo and our Cable Networks. We think we had the most successful upfront of anyone in the industry.","During the second quarter, NBC broadcast gained share from its peers helped by summer hits, including World Of Dance, the number one new entertainment series. NBC remains on track to win the 52-week season for the fourth consecutive year and by a substantial margin.","At Cable Networks, MSNBC is a real bright spot with ratings in prime increasing nearly 80% year-over-year in the second quarter.","Now turning to Cable Communications, our team's performance has been a model of consistency for us, and the second quarter was no different. Our results again demonstrated our balanced approach of driving profitable growth as we generated a healthy 5.4% increase in EBITDA, while also adding 114,000 net new customer relationships.","Since taking the reins in April, Dave Watson has done a terrific job and the transition has been seamless. We are confident our team has the right strategy focusing on improving service with strong EBITDA growth and customer momentum.","We're investing in innovation, differentiating our products and customer segmentation, highlighted by offerings like the X1 platform and our recently launched xFi experience for in-home broadband, as well as our ongoing rollout of DOCSIS 3.1 to enable gigabit speeds across our footprint.","In addition, a relentless focus on customer service is translating into a better experience for our customers and reduced costs as we get it right the first time and move more and more interactions to digital. In the second quarter, we reduced customer calls handled by our agents by over 3 million year-over-year. We also increased the percentage of customer interactions completed digitally by double-digits year-over-year.","As we look beyond the second quarter, we see so many opportunities for continued growth in our Cable business, with significant runway ahead in broadband, robust growth in business services, attractive opportunities driven by our differentiated approach to Video, and upside in newer offerings like XFINITY Home, all these services enabled by an ever-increasing digital service experience.","We're also excited about the prospects for XFINITY Mobile, which we launched to customers in the middle of the second quarter. While it's still early days, the customer feedback confirms our belief that we have an attractive proposition in the market. Our differentiated offerings are resonating, including our By the Gig data option and the ability for customers to mix and match and easily switch between two plans, as well as the inclusion of five lines in our convenient digital experience.","So all in all, a great first half of the year with a fantastic group of businesses that are executing extremely well. I'm proud of what we accomplished, including our 10% EBITDA growth, and we have a strong foundation to build on for the remainder of the year and beyond.","Mike, over to you.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","Thanks, Brian; and good morning, everybody. Let's start on slide 4. So as Brian just said, we delivered very strong second quarter results. On a consolidated basis, revenue increased 9.8%, adjusted EBITDA grew 10%, earnings per share increased 26.8% to $0.52 a share, and we generated $2.2 billion in free cash flow during the quarter.","Now, let's go deeper into the businesses, starting with Cable Communications on slide 5. Cable Communications revenues increased 5.5% to $13.1 billion, driven by growth in residential high-speed Internet and Video as well as Business Services. In our Residential business, we added 77,000 net new customer relationships in the quarter, a 6.4% increase over last year, with both Video and high-speed data churn remaining at the lowest levels in over 10 years. We are pleased with these results and our ability to weather the more competitive environment this quarter. There have been several new entrants in the over-the-top video space, prompting existing competitors to respond with aggressive price points that have cut across multiple products.","We continue to believe in our ability to compete effectively. First, we have innovative products, including best-in-class broadband and a great video experience with X1. Second, we successfully bundle our services together, with 70% of our residential customer base taking at least two products. In addition, we focus on market segmentation, packaging our products to be competitive to multiple customer segments, and, importantly, we are making continuous improvements to our customer service.","High-speed Internet continues to be the largest contributor to overall cable revenue growth. Revenue increased 9.2% to $3.7 billion in the quarter, driven by an increase in our residential customer base and rate adjustments. We added 140,000 residential high-speed Internet customers in the quarter and we remain focused on adding value and further enhancing our competitive differentiation through improvement to capacity, coverage and capabilities.","We consistently increase our speeds and nearly 55% of our residential customers take speeds of 100 megabits per second or higher. We're offering gigabit speeds with our deployment of DOCSIS 3.1 and plan to have this technology available to the majority of our homes passed by year-end. And in addition, we recently launched xFi, a new home WiFi platform that gives customers the fastest speeds, the best WiFi coverage and ultimate control in their homes, making WiFi an even better experience. As Brian mentioned, we have a long runway for growth in adding broadband customers.","Video revenue increased 3.9% to $5.8 billion in the quarter, primarily due to rate adjustments as well as customers subscribing to additional services. We had 45,000 residential video customer net losses in the quarter, reflecting both typical second quarter seasonality as well as the competitive dynamics I mentioned earlier.","We continue to drive X1 deeper into our base, ending the quarter with 55% of residential video customers having X1, compared to about 40% a year ago.","Business Services delivered another strong quarter of double-digit growth as revenue increased 12.6% to $1.5 billion during the quarter, primarily driven by customer growth. We added 37,000 business customer relationships, and in terms of individual products, we added 11,000 video customers, 35,000 high-speed Internet customers, and 27,000 voice customers in the quarter.","In addition, we increased revenue for business customer relationship by 4%, which reflects good momentum in our Ethernet and advanced voice services.","Turning to slide 6, second quarter Cable Communications EBITDA increased 5.4% to $5.3 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.5%, down 10 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2016.","Programming expenses increased 12% during the quarter, and on a year-to-date basis, reflecting the timing of contract renewals. Non-programming expenses increased 1.4% this quarter as we benefit from the investments we have made in customer experience initiatives, as well as overall disciplined cost management. Notably, customer service expenses declined 1.1% this quarter even as we grew customer relationships by 3.2%.","Despite the higher rate of programming expense growth, our year-to-date EBITDA margin of 40.4% has improved by 10 basis points compared to the same period in 2016. The improvement was driven by growth in higher-margin services such as high-speed Internet and Business Services, as well as the lower rate of growth in non-programming expenses.","As we look forward, we now expect the full year 2017 EBITDA margin to be flat compared to 2016, which was 40.2%. The improvement relative to our original guidance from earlier this year is equally split between programming and non-programming expenses.","Now let's move on to NBCUniversal's results. On slide 7, you can see NBCUniversal's revenues increased 17% and EBITDA increased 23% in the quarter. These strong results were driven by a successful box office, healthy growth in re-trans and affiliate fees, as well as continued strong growth at Theme Parks.","Cable Networks delivered another quarter of strong growth with revenue increasing 5.1% and EBITDA up 11.7% to $1.1 billion. While advertising revenue was down 1% this quarter, distribution revenue increased 8.1%, driving double-digit EBITDA growth. Recall we have successfully renewed a number of our distribution agreements and this should continue to contribute to healthy EBITDA growth for the remainder of the year.","Broadcast Television also delivered a solid quarter, with revenue increasing 5.3% and EBITDA growth of 5.5% to $416 million. This growth was primarily driven by higher retransmission consent fees, which increased nearly 65% to $363 million. Partially offsetting this growth was a modest 1% decline in advertising revenue, which reflected ratings pressure during the quarter as well as higher programming expenses and increased marketing investments.","Film had a phenomenal quarter with revenue increasing 60% and EBITDA growing by $229 million to $285 million. Theatrical revenue increased by $540 million to $837 million, driven by the strong box office performance of Fate of the Furious, which more than offset the underperformance of The Mummy. Home Entertainment revenue increased 43% due to the continued success of earlier titles including Fifty Shades Darker and Sing.","Last, content licensing revenue grew 14%, reflecting the inclusion of DreamWorks.","Theme Parks continued its momentum with revenue growth of 15.6% and EBITDA up a very healthy 17.3% to $551 million in the second quarter. These results reflect higher attendance in per capita spending as well as a favorable comparison from the timing of spring break vacations.","As a reminder, spring break and the Easter holiday occurred in the second quarter this year, but occurred during the first quarter last year, creating a favorable comparison this quarter. However even if we adjust for this timing, EBITDA would have still grown double-digits this quarter as we continue to benefit from Harry Potter in Hollywood as well as our launches of new attractions Brian mentioned Volcano Bay in Orlando and Minion Park in Japan.","Now let's move to slide 8 to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. Consolidated CapEx increased 2.5% to $2.3 billion in the second quarter. At Cable Communications, capital expenditures increased 4% to $2 billion for the quarter, resulting in capital intensity of 14.9%. For the full year, we continue to expect capital intensity to remain flat to 2016 at approximately 15% of total Cable Communications revenue.","For the quarter, the increase in spending reflects a higher level of investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity and increased investment in line extensions partially offset by decreased spending on customer premise equipment.","At NBCUniversal, second quarter capital expenditures decreased 6.1% to $338 million, reflecting our continued investment in Theme Parks more than offset by the timing of spending on real estate and at our headquarters. For the full year, we continue to expect NBCUniversal's capital expenditures to increase approximately 10% versus 2016.","And now finishing up on slide 9, as I mentioned earlier, we generated $2.2 billion in free cash flow in the quarter and $5.3 billion on a year-to-date basis. Our return of capital to shareholders in the second quarter included dividend payments totaling $747 million, up 11.6%, and share repurchases of $1.4 billion. We continue to expect to repurchase a total of $5 billion of our common shares this year.","In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter at 2.2 times net leverage. During the quarter, we completed our acquisition of the remaining 49% stake in Universal Studios Japan for $2.3 billion. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we received proceeds of $482 million in connection with our previously announced relinquishments of FCC licenses for spectrum in the New York, Philadelphia and Chicago designated market areas.","So that concludes our summary of the quarter. We're clearly very pleased with our continued strong performance as well as our momentum.","Now I'll turn it back to Jason to lead the Q&A.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Mike. Regina, let's open up the call for Q&A, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning. I'd like to ask you about two of the big debates out there. One is on the runway for broadband and the other on the pay-TV ecosystem. Brian, you specifically said in your prepared remarks you see a significant runway for the data business. And I'd love to hear from you and from Dave what gives you confidence in that, how do you think about driving market share gains further from here, any comment on the response to xFi and just other things you're doing around the products beyond speed, to continue to push your advantage in the marketplace and grow that business over time?","And then on the Video side, maybe from Steve, how are you \u2013 what are you seeing on the subscriber front for your Cable Nets as you see these new entrants come into the market? Obviously, there's been a lot of pressure for the overall industry. But curious how you're thinking about the impact of these emerging streaming bundles on your business. Thank you.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Okay. Well, thank you and good morning. So first big comment would be that we're performing well in broadband. If you look at us versus all the competitors that have reported, you're going to see growth \u2013 continued growth and we expect that to continue for the rest of the year, and hopefully, for years to come. And that's why, I think we make that statement.","I think our product is better. So what Dave's doing, and I'll let him talk about it, is we're taking some of that same innovation, as you alluded to, that we brought to Video, which is why our Video results have been pretty strong the last several years compared to, again, the marketplace. It's that innovation and that culture of every month the product gets better. So we have a whole team of people who are trying to be more than just we're getting faster and better. But, again, Dave, why don't you jump in, and Steve can talk about the Video.","But, again, I think company-wide, I think we're executing better than maybe a lot of people believe these businesses can do. And that's why we think it's going to continue for the future. It's great momentum.","David N. Watson - Comcast Corp.","Yes, Ben, so \u2013 as Brian said, there is significant runway ahead of broadband. And the key to me when you look at this is the upside of the opportunity. We're sitting at 45% penetration right now. So there's growth just there. The overall market is growing with only 75% of households subscribing to Internet access. And so mostly, from our position, it's the innovation that Brian's talking about. We like our formula. We deliver very fast, reliable service. And the focus \u2013 the shift that we've had around innovation is around WiFi in the home.","And a key for us to staying ahead of competition with speed, capacity, coverage, and capability. And xFi is a good example of that. I think we deliver on all these points.","With xFi, you get fantastic wireless gateways. We're just introducing a new advanced wireless gateway that can get you up to 1 gig WiFi speed. So it delivers great coverage in the home. And it gives for the first time \u2013 one of the pain points for customers \u2013 the ability to connect just an ever-increasing amount of wireless devices in the home and let you simply and easily manage all of that within your home. So I think when you add it all up, we like our position. There could be continued innovative focus around the broadband category, but we have good momentum.","Stephen B. Burke - Comcast Corp.","So the over-the-top services that have been launched so far, doing about as we expected they would do. And they're not all that material to our business. They've all launched. They have subscribers. We have deals in place with all of them. They're actually very favorable. So from an NBCUniversal point of view, if someone goes to an over-the-top provider, it's actually slightly better. But it's a very tough business. And as we've said before, we're skeptical that it's going to be a very large business or profitable business for the people that are in it. And they're off to a relatively slow start.","In terms of the overall subscriber trends, they're the same as they have been. No speed-up or slowdown in the modest subscriber losses that we've seen over the last few years.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you both.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","All right. Thanks, Ben. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi. Thank you. Brian, I guess, the obvious question that seems to be on everyone's lips is, it seems like every day that goes by, there is another round of speculation about who \u2013 with whom you might partner next, or who you might buy or merge with and that sort of thing. I wonder if you could just step back and strategically talk about the assets you have and where, if anywhere, you think you might look next to add to the portfolio.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Thank you and thanks for posting that question in a broad way, which makes it, in my opinion \u2013 I thought we were really clear last quarter. So I guess, the chance to be even more clear. While, yes, we always look at the world around us and we do our jobs, frankly, and looking at opportunities. We love our business. Look at this quarter, 10% cash flow growth, 10% revenue growth, every one of the businesses performing well. So I don't see anybody quite doing that, frankly, in our space, quarter after quarter, by the way, not just one movie.","And I think I've said and I think we've said in multiple forums that we really feel we're not missing anything. And so just to specifically talk about wireless, which I think was embedded in your question, no disrespect to wireless, it's a tough business. And our strategy of MVNO, we really like what we're doing \u2013 and just it's very, very early with XFINITY Mobile. And our early employee results and our first set of customers really improves a lot of the things we hoped it would improve. It will be a long road, but I don't see something happening in that industry that we envy a position that we don't have today.","So while we continue to focus on what we've got, if you look at the mix of content, it's not just content for content's sake. I think putting an incredible team on the field and having an NBC be in first place, to have Telemundo really just surging. Big year we're going to have in sports with all the big events. And Cable, Dave just talked about it. It's a fantastic strategy. I think we have a really special company and I wouldn't want to do anything to change that.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks, Brian. That's helpful.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Craig. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Two questions. First on the Cable side. We've seen the subscriber results from AT&T and Verizon, and I think the FIOS and U-verse subs were a bit better than expected. So, I guess, the question is, at what point do you feel that you have to respond to this, whether it be promotions or lower overall pricing?","And then second, on the NBC side, Steve, as you said, the upfront was really successful. Do you think this represents true underlying demand or do you think it's just ad dollars being pulled forward so there might be less demand in scatter? Thanks.","David N. Watson - Comcast Corp.","Let me start, Marci. It's Dave. So we go through competitive cycles with all sorts of providers, not the least of which the telephone company. So we're very accustomed to moments where they discount a bit more. Our focus is to stay disciplined around delivering the best products. We put them in packages that work for customers. And so whether it's X1, just talked about broadband, those are the keys.","We always compete, and we always segment. We always go after different market segments and making sure we are competitive for each of those. So we do tweak our go-to-market approaches. We've been doing that for a long time. So I don't see anything materially different in our approach to stay very focused on delivering the best products in the marketplace and being competitive.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","I just want to add one other thing, too. Dave has been doing this for us for 20 years now or more, and has seen it all. And what I like about his leadership is the mix, and Neil before him. And you'll see a lot of results today. We've got a busy day for the analysts and our sympathies go out to you for all the companies reporting on the same day. I don't know that you'll see subscriber results and revenue growth and cash flow, and it's that balance that is the way Dave's leadership and the team he's got is trying to run the company. And I think that's what we're going to try to do in the future.","Stephen B. Burke - Comcast Corp.","So regarding the upfront, I think it was a pretty good upfront for the television business in general. It was a particularly good upfront for us. We went into the upfront with NBC ahead if you take out the Super Bowl at Fox, we were 20% ahead in terms of primetime ratings of anybody else.","Brian mentioned Telemundo, but we also had strength at MSNBC, cable strength, sports. And our approach to ad sales, starting five years ago, we put all of the ad sales under Linda Yaccarino, and Linda and her team sell the entire portfolio together, which, since we're the biggest provider of television advertising, we tend to go first. We've gone first the last few years in the upfront. And that yielded, I think, a greater result than was the typical result.","Our upfront volume was up about 8%, which represents about $400 million. And that doesn't include the Olympics and Super Bowl where we sold some ads on top of that 8% increase. We think we led the market in terms of Broadcast by a few points and Cable was at the high-end of the range. We've been talking over the last six years or so about a monetization gap. We think every year we're chipping away at that and we've closed a lot of the monetization gap.","In terms of did we pull demand forward? I don't think so. I think the demand, really for the last two years or three years, has been remarkably consistent throughout the year and the percentage that went in the upfront, I don't see any major sign that that percentage is higher or lower than it has been traditionally. And all the signs we see more recently than the upfront point to continued strength in the advertising markets, and we're doing well in terms of our advanced sales on the Super Bowl and the Olympics and everything else. So I think we feel pretty confident.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Great. Thank you, Marci. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Two separate questions. First for Brian or Dave, the competitive landscape is changing pretty rapidly as companies from multiple industries are trying to emulate you or parts of you. Whether it's the FANG companies, the telcos, they're all big companies. So can you talk about what you're doing to enhance the customer experience over the next few years to protect and grow your business? You sort of answered it on broadband; maybe if you could take a Video perspective?","And for Steve, a different advertising question. The market overall seems fairly stable despite ratings issues, whether that's due to measurement or fragmentation. Can you talk about what NBC is doing to position your company over the next two years to enhance the advertising platform?","David N. Watson - Comcast Corp.","So, hey, Jessica. Dave. So let me start with Video. It is \u2013 as you said, it's a very competitive environment, lots of new entrants coming in, and doing different things. The key is we really like our position overall. We've got this terrific platform X1 with the unbelievable functionality of the voice remote and the complete \u2013 the overall level of choices that we deliver and the amount of the breadth of content on-demand, live, DVR, and new entrants that are now part of X1, like Netflix, all seamlessly integrated.","So in addition, as I mentioned before, we're going to compete vigorously across the board for every segment. And so we do break it down, whether it's students, whether it's millennials. And so we're seeing really good benefits. And I think while they're sampling, you see new entrants come in. For us, we're going to stay very focused on our strengths.","And one of the things, too, that we're rolling out is, we've talked about before is Instant TV. Instant TV, again, we're launching this. We've been testing it for a while. We'll launch it more broadly in the second half of the year. And, again, this is an in-home Title VI cable service, with a managed network, without a set-top box. So it's ideal for certain segments and millennials in the test markets; very good response.","So we'll continue to roll that out. There's a lot of appeal, different price points that we're testing around that. But our key is to leverage our strength in X1 and Video, but also compete for every segment.","Stephen B. Burke - Comcast Corp.","So in terms of ratings and what's going on in the video landscaping, it's a very interesting time to be in the television business. I think you have to assume that ratings are going to \u2013 linear ratings are going to continue to decline. I'm not sure if the decline is going to speed up or slow down. I think the safest thing is to assume it's going to continue.","But overall video consumption if you include consumption on the Internet, I think most think it's as high as it's ever been. And the first part of our challenge is to make sure that we monetize better, that we get ratings and then monetization at a better rate than we currently do with consumption on the Internet.","The second thing is to try to get more of the Internet functionality, target ability, and data into our traditional television advertising. And I think we've been a leader in that. We have a lot of data enhanced products and ways to position our television advertising with some of our digital assets and the partnerships we have. We're a shareholder in BuzzFeed, and Vox and Snap, and we're doing a lot of selling with Apple and AOL and others. So that when Linda Yaccarino goes to market, we can offer television products, which are data-enhanced and then bundles, which include television and traditional digital advertising.","So it's certainly more challenging. There are more variables to play with. But I like our hand, and we, I think, have been as aggressive as anybody in trying to make sure that we're continually evolving and giving advertisers what they want, which is the tremendous reach of television, still the best way to reach a large market. But some of the targeting that people have started to realize is attractive because of the Internet.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Jessica. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. Wonder if you can dig more into the cable margin guide increase. How should we think about programming in the second half and 2018, if you can, versus the 12% in the first half, what does the pace of renewals look like in the second half versus first?","And then second, in terms of non-programming OpEx trends, are there cost-cutting efforts happening there? Or is it really declines driven by a shift in customer activity from those call centers to digital? And what does the runway look like there? Thank you.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","Hey, Phil, it's Mike. I'll start and Dave can finish. So for 2017, as we started the year, we expected programming to be up 13%. Programming costs, we came in in the first half of the year at around 12% and I wouldn't expect it to be much different in the second half.","In terms of non-programming costs, you saw the great results in the first half of the year and we think those trends are steady. So we're just revising today the guidance for the full year this year and we expect to be flat to 2016.","And as you know, we don't go into a multi-year guidance. But I think what Dave and I have both said previously is that we're going to continue to drive growth in our high margin businesses, high-speed data and business services, which were obviously margin positive. We do expect programming costs as we've said to come down into the high single-digits in years after 2017.","And then, finally, on the non-programming costs side, a lot of the efforts that Dave and Neil have been putting in over multiple years into customer service, in particular, are paying dividends in terms of reduced truck rolls, lower calls, on top of higher satisfaction. And that's been a tailwind to non-programming expenses. And Dave can comment further, but we're going to continue to execute against those kind of trends. But, again, we don't go beyond the year we're in in terms of guidance. So I'll leave it there.","David N. Watson - Comcast Corp.","Thanks, Mike. So, as Mike just said, it starts with us, we're looking at high-margin businesses. So you said that we're all very focused on broadband commercial. But the key driver, I think, to your question, Phil, is that the rate of growth for non-programming expenses is trending lower in 2017 and certainly continued trending it from last year. So this is a combination of things. We've always been very focused on cost management. But the key thing that we're looking at is getting yield from our customer experience investments. And we made those investments. We like the results. And we believe very strongly that this is going to yield a better customer experience also.","So it's often the case that you do a good job and you're taking transactions out. You're going to get a lower cost of delivering service. So I think we're getting out ahead of a lot of customer service issues. We've got ways to go, but we're really pleased with our progress. So \u2013 and this comes in \u2013 you look at call volumes coming out, truck rolls, and so contact rates. All of these things are really trending in the right direction. So I like our momentum there. We're going to stay very focused on taking transactions out, but at the same time, this is going to be good for the customer.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. Thanks, guys.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Phil. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Maybe a couple of follow-up questions for Dave. First on the competitive front, have the competitive efforts you've seen from the traditional guys, does that continue here into the third quarter? And maybe, can you give us a sense for maybe where it's coming from? Is it the telcos, or the satellite guys? And then, on the new Instant TV product, I think we've heard \u2013 or you guys have talked about a third quarter launch, but could you give us some more color on the breadth of launch, how you guys are going to promote it, maybe anything you can tell us about what's in that package, or the pricing around it? Thanks.","David N. Watson - Comcast Corp.","Yes. Sure, John. So on the telcos side, it's mostly in terms of the shift, there's \u2013 again, this competitive cycle, it's the telephone companies being a little bit more aggressive on discounting. And again, we compete. We take it all seriously. We look at everything, and don't take it for granted. So we do compete, but the adjustments we make are modest in nature, very targeted. And so we like, again, our position as I talked about before. And you connect that and sometimes, you have a lot of new entrants coming in. So a lot of sampling on the new folks over-the-top. But, again, I talked about our Video and broadband momentum.","On Instant TV, this is a program that we've been looking at to go after. Primarily the segments that, like millennials, this is not something that we'll do broad-based in terms of our approach to the market. This is going to be very targeted; primarily digital in nature and how we do it. We love our fall video positioning with X1. So we'll continue to compete aggressively with that. But Instant TV gives us one more part of the portfolio to be able to go after different segments with. So it'll be fully launched towards the end of Q3 and will be part of our go-to-market approach.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Dave.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, John. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Mike, I had, I guess, a housekeeping question first then I had one for Steve. The NBCU headquarters other elimination OCF number was noticeably higher this quarter than it's been in the past. I just wanted to see if you can give some color on that. Is that a new run rate, more or less, or was there something anomalous in the second quarter?","And then, Steve, you had mentioned a moment ago the digital investments that you've made in Snap, BuzzFeed and Vox. I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate on just how you're leveraging those investments in NBCU and how they fit into the broader strategy. Thanks.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","Thanks, Bryan. It's Mike. So there's just some one-time choppiness in that number. We can deal with that \u2013 give you more color offline, if you like, but nothing that would affect the go-forward trends that you've seen before this quarter.","Stephen B. Burke - Comcast Corp.","So when we make these digital investments, we actually call them beacon investments, because we like to think that by investing in BuzzFeed, or Vox, or Snap, we're telling our employees and their employees that we really want to work together. So it's not a passive or inactive process. So when we make the investment, we would sit down with the management teams of the various companies and try to identify a half dozen projects to work on. And in each of those three companies, we've had very material projects succeed in the marketplace.","Our most recent investment was Snapchat. And we have a show called The Rundown, which is produced by E!, which is getting 5 million to 10 million daily users, which makes real money. We just launched a second product based on an NBC News \u2013 a 24-hour-a-day NBC News product. Very unique. Launched \u2013 I believe it was last week. It's called Stay Tuned and it's off to a very, very strong start.","And we've done similar things with BuzzFeed and Vox. And a big part of our job, I think, as the company gets more digital DNA into our company, is to find digital investments with companies that we can learn from and get into business with as opposed to just making an investment. So I think Vox, BuzzFeed and Snap are three great companies. We've learned a lot from them and we're better off for having made those investments.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Interesting. Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Bryan. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. I realize it's still early days here with XFINITY Mobile, but I'll throw a couple of questions at you and see what you're willing to share. In terms of acquiring customers, what's working? Are you mostly leveraging interactions you would otherwise have on a normal basis? Is some of your outbound causing people to come to you? Where are they coming from? Which plans are most successful? And then, the last one would be, is it hurting any of your other businesses? For example, is it actually cannibalizing residential voice? So a lot in there, but whatever you can do to help us gain some insight as to what's working early on would be great. Thank you.","David N. Watson - Comcast Corp.","You got it. All right. So a couple of \u2013 it's way early, as Brian said, but a couple of observations. First off, it's operationally scaling well. Again, very early, but we're pleased with just in general as we have rolled this out across the footprint. One thing that maybe in terms of where the customers or how they're onboarding, about half of the customers are going through our digital channel, which is terrific.","So Greg Butz and his team have really done a terrific job. And I think it speaks to just how easy this experience is for customers. And not only is it easy to onboard but, as Brian said, it's really easy to manage your service on an ongoing basis. We're one of the only ones that you can go back and forth literally with the click of a button and you can change your By-the-Gig to unlimited and back and forth.","So it's a really extraordinary digital experience. And so we're pleased with that. The other observation early on is that there's real value By the Gig. We have \u2013 most of our customers are taking By the Gig versus unlimited. So we can do both. And the partnership with Verizon is going well. And so early response from customers is extremely positive. They like the service. They like the value. They like just how easy this is.","And so in regards to things, I think it's the \u2013 quite frankly, there's an opportunity to go the other way, especially as we leverage our existing retail capabilities and digital capabilities, I think mobile is an opportunity to expand consideration for other products. And while there may be some \u2013 a little bit of focus, whether it's packaging around wireline voice, I think it gives us an opportunity to talk about everything that we do. So we're really encouraged about our early-stage retail launches where we see that happening. So real pleased with their early results.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Appreciate it.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Brett. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Just one question from me, which is on the CapEx line. You've seen scalable infrastructure and line extensions grow quite substantially over the last year or so. Could you just talk about what's exactly in that line? And is this driven by fiber or is there some other focus on those lines right now? Thanks.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","Hey, Kannan. It's Mike. So I'll start again on this one. So scalable infrastructure \u2013 think about it as adding capacity and speed to our network generally in things like Cloud DVRs and the like. As we see greater usage to our network, we're investing to keep the experience ahead of our customer expectations. And so that's what you would see in that CapEx line. And then we've said repeatedly we want to continue to invest in that broadband network for the future we see for the business.","In terms of line extensions, that's connecting more addresses to our networks. And so that's largely led by business services. And pushing the business services is obviously high-growth business. Some of the hyper-builds we talk about \u2013 the growth in line extensions is driven by that.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right. Thank you.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","Yep.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Kannan. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. Dave, maybe just a comment on the commercial opportunity and what you're seeing as far as moving upstream into bigger enterprises? And then, also a comment perhaps on 5G, what you're seeing out there as far as whether it's a risk or opportunity for you guys? Thanks.","David N. Watson - Comcast Corp.","Sure. So I think the larger business services opportunity is enterprise. It's upside for us. Currently, we're within our footprint. We're at less than 5% of the overall revenue opportunity. So what we're seeing is solid cooperation with the other cable operators and really helping large businesses that have local offices throughout the country. So I think so far we're real pleased with our progress. A lot of very premier accounts that have jumped on board. Again, early innings on this one, too, but we're pleased and I think there's upside there.","On 5G, we're testing it. We're looking at it. I've commented before that it's something that, I think, will evolve and take a while. It's not something that will be immediate, but we'll look at it as closely as everybody else. From our vantage point, there's work to do there, but we'll stay very close to that. I continue to believe that it's an opportunity for the mobile providers to enhance their mobile data service, but in regards to any other implications, way too early.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks, Dave.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Mike. Regina, we'll make this next one the last question, please.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Brian, you've been talking about innovation and differentiation in the marketplace that Comcast is trying to lead on. We are pretty close to the end of the consent decree on NBC, and obviously, you've had some synergies with the assets. Can you just talk about what that end could do in leapfrogging that innovation and differentiation?","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Well, let me just start by saying that I'm very pleased with the organization for \u2013 we complied and in many cases exceeded all the requirements that were placed on us. And I think that it'll be less of an administrative burden for sure when the consent decree ends, but we have great momentum. And I think hopefully we'll look forward. We won't look back.","I don't have a specific answer for you probably today in that regard, but I do think we've executed really well in the past. So I don't want to say any more about the consent decree as we get toward the end of it.","But I will say that the two companies have worked really well together. And one of the themes that this will probably allow that to even continue and maybe increase in the future is just how well the culture of the company is \u2013 Comcast, NBCUniversal. I'm really pleased and proud of that, and I think that the results that we just talked about for the last hour, I think, demonstrate that.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","So onward we go.

Roberts - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. We're off to a great start in 2016. We increased revenue and operating cash flow in the first quarter, while continuing to prudently invest in the businesses to further strengthen our competitive position and drive growth.","I believe our Cable business is really differentiating itself, bolstering real innovation that is translating into the strong momentum you see in these results. We're demonstrating notable improvements in customer service, investing to put the industry's fastest Wi-Fi in homes, and to be the first to bring customers widespread access to gigabit speeds through DOCSIS 3.1 technology, and with X1, delivering a platform and a breadth of content that's unrivaled. And this quarter once again shows, our customers are responding to all of this. We increased our customer relationship growth by 36% from the first quarter of 2015 and now have achieved 50% penetration of our home's past. (2:20)","We added 53,000 video customers in the quarter, making us video net add positive over the past 12 months. This important milestone has eluded us for nearly a decade and we have now accomplished it within the context of an unprecedented pace of change in this industry, including the steady drumbeat of new competitors and new offers. Our voice remotes are the latest example of how we are differentiating ourselves in the market. In a short period of time, we've deployed six million of these new remotes. Thanks to Tony Werner and his technology team's great customer experience, we're getting wonderful feedback from our customers already.","We added another 438,000 broadband subscribers in the quarter, the best first quarter we've had in four years. Much like our improvement in video, the progress we are making is largely a result of improvements in churn. We are upping speeds, delivering best-in-class Wi-Fi access, and investing in more ways to add value to our customers. As a result, they are staying with us longer.","Business services delivered another excellent quarter, with revenue growth of nearly 18%. This growth comes with very attractive margins for us, as you know. We continue to take share in small business and bring new competition and choice for midsize businesses as well as enterprise customers. Just as important as our strong service and subscriber metrics, Neil and the team are demonstrating terrific balance driving revenue per customer relationship forward at a healthy clip along with solid operating cash flow growth.","Over at NBCUniversal, Steve and his team delivered another strong quarter. Operating cash flow increased by 10%, benefiting from particularly strong performance in Broadcast and our recent acquisition of Universal Studios Japan. Our TV business has performed well and it's had some good momentum. The advertising environment remains robust, which we believe sets up Linda Yaccarino and her team for a strong upfront.","This year, we are unifying the upfront for NBC, Broadcast, Telemundo, and Cable Networks, reflecting the way we go to market as a strong and comprehensive portfolio. We feel great about our position, which will be strengthened as we now add Thursday Night Football to go along with an already strong list of sports properties.","Speaking of strong sports properties, we recently surpassed $1 billion in national advertising sales for the Rio Olympics, achieving this milestone far earlier than the London Olympics. This is a very promising result, which reinforces our view of the attractiveness of this event. Meanwhile, MSNBC continues its impressive performance with its best ratings in three years and primetime up over 100%. Andy Lack and the news team are doing a wonderful job with the news organization, particularly through the early stages of this election cycle.","In our Theme Parks, we're delighted about our trajectory, the momentum that we've created, and our roadmap with new investments in new attractions and additional hotel room capacity. Universal Studios Japan set attendance records in this just-ended fiscal year, and performed well in our first full quarter of ownership. Additionally, we just launched Harry Potter at Universal Hollywood and we expect it to follow the strong success we have seen with our other Potter attractions.","We've got a unique and wonderful set of assets which provides Comcast NBCUniversal with many opportunities. All of this will be on display this summer when we put the full weight of the company behind the Olympics. I'm amazed at what we've accomplished in a short period of time as a combined company just five years in, and I think we're not only five years wiser and stronger but really better together. We're confident we remain on the right path to creating value for our customers and shareholders, and I couldn't be more excited about our future.","Mike, over to you.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Good morning, everybody. Let's go right to the first quarter on slide four and cover the key financials. Overall, we delivered consolidated revenue growth of 5.3% and operating cash flow growth of 6.9% for the first quarter. At Cable, the primary drivers of growth were high-speed data, video, and business services; while NBCUniversal's results were driven by Broadcast, Cable Networks, and Theme Parks, which was positively impacted by the inclusion of Universal Studios Japan.","Moving down the income statement, adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.84 a share, a 6.3% increase compared to a year ago. The cash flow was $2.8 billion in the first quarter, a decline of 11.9%, while free cash flow per share declined 8.8% to $1.14. We'll go into greater detail on these results on slides to come. Now, let's review the results of our businesses in more detail, starting with Cable Communications on slide five.","Cable Communications delivered a solid first quarter. Revenue increased 6.7% to $12.2 billion as we increased customer relationships and grew total revenue per customer relationship by 4% to $146 per month. We added 269,000 customer relationships, 36% improvement in net adds compared to last year's first quarter, driven by growth in two-product and three-product customers and a reduction in churn across all products. In fact, video and high-speed data have each improved churn for 26 consecutive months.","High-speed Internet continues to be the largest contributor to overall Cable revenue growth. Revenue increased 7.6% to $3.3 billion in the quarter, reflecting strong customer growth, customers subscribing to higher levels of service, and more modest rate adjustments compared to the prior year. Customer growth was strong, as we added a combined 438,000 net data customers in the quarter, which includes residential and business customers.","We continue to differentiate and improve our product by increasing our speeds on existing tiers as well as offering the fastest in-home Wi-Fi with our advanced wireless gateways. At the end of the quarter, 77% of our residential customers received speeds of 50 Mb per second or greater and have one of our wireless gateways, both up significantly from the prior year.","Video revenue remained healthy, increasing 3.9% to $5.5 billion in the quarter, primarily due to rate adjustments as well as customers subscribing to additional services, including premium channels, HD DVRs, and additional outlets. We added a combined 53,000 net video customers, our best first quarter result in nine years, driven primarily by another quarter of improved churn. We continue to make great progress rolling out X1 to new and existing customers, adding 1.1 million customers in the quarter, a 53% increase in net adds compared to last year.","Nearly 35% of our total video customers have X1, which we believe is a real competitive differentiator. Coupled with the X1 technology is the breadth of content we offer customers both On Demand and with the compelling TV Everywhere offering. On X1, 86% of subscribers are using XFINITY on-demand monthly, viewing 25 hours a month on average; and 42% of subscribers are using our mobile TV Everywhere platforms monthly, up 32% from last year, viewing 7 hours a month on average. We think this adds great utility to our video service.","Rounding out our residential products, voice revenue declined by 1.1% to $896 million in the first quarter, as customer additions were offset by a modest decline in ARPU. In the first quarter, we added a combined 102,000 net voice customers, up 33% versus a year ago.","Now let's turn to business services, which continues to deliver excellent results. Revenue increased 17.5% to $1.3 billion, with the small business segment accounting for about 75% of our revenues and 60% of our growth. Revenue for the midsize business segment is growing at a faster rate than the small business segment, increasing its contribution as a percentage of total business revenue. Overall, business services has strong positive momentum, and continues to represent a large and attractive growth opportunity for the company.","Finally, Cable advertising revenue increased 12.1% to $559 million. Excluding political revenue, our Cable advertising revenue increased 7.6% in the first quarter.","Turning to slide six, first quarter Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 5% to $4.9 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.1% compared to 40.7% in the first quarter of 2015, driven by higher expenses primarily related to increases in programming costs and the investments we are making to improve the customer experience.","Programming expenses grew 9.4%, reflecting programming contract renewals, as well as higher retransmit and consent fees and sports programming costs. As we've noted before, when we negotiate programming deals, we continue to value expanded content rights for our On Demand and TV Everywhere platforms. We continue to add more content, out-of-home rights, stacking rights, and back seasons, which helps ensure we have the most compelling and competitive video product on the market.","Non-programming expenses increased 6.9%, reflecting our planned investment to improve the customer experience and to continue the rollout of X1. We've added technicians and service personnel, strengthened our dispatch teams and operations, and invested in training, tools, and technology. As a result, technical and product support costs grew 6.3%, and customer service expenses increased 8%.","We continue to expect our 2016 Cable operating margin to be flat to down 50 basis points compared to 40.6% in 2015, as programming and other expense growth should be offset by modest rate adjustments, growth in high-margin businesses like high-speed data and business services, and continued overall cost discipline.","Keep in mind for the second quarter, we face tough comparisons to last year's hugely successful Pacquiao versus Mayweather fight on pay-per-view. However, growth in high-margin political advertising revenue should provide more significant support for margin in the back half of the year.","Now let's move on to NBCUniversal's results. On slide seven, you can see NBCUniversal delivered solid results in the first quarter, as revenue increased 3.9% and operating cash flow increased 10%. Adjusting to include the acquisition of Universal Studios Japan in last year's results, pro forma revenue was relatively flat, and operating cash flow increased 1.8%, more than offsetting the difficult comparison to a profitable Super Bowl and our strong Film results last year.","This quarter's growth was driven by strong TV results, fueled by higher retransmission and affiliate revenues and the underlying strength of the advertising market.","Cable Networks revenue increased 4%, and operating cash flow increased 6.4% to $956 million, reflecting higher distribution revenue, strong ad revenue, given the best advertising market we've seen in some time, and a modest increase in programming and production costs. Distribution revenue increased 5.9%, driven by contractual rate increases and contract renewals, partially offset by a slight decline in subscribers at our cable networks.","Advertising revenue was flat compared to the first quarter of 2015, which included a benefit from a reduction in deferred advertising revenue. If we exclude this benefit, advertising growth would've been about 4%, driven by strong pricing, partially offset by audience rating declines at our cable networks.","At Broadcast Television, while revenue declined 7.3%, we delivered outstanding operating cash flow growth of 56.5%, even with the profitable Super Bowl included in last year's results. This growth was driven by a few factors. First, the underlying strength of the advertising market. Excluding the Super Bowl, advertising revenue increased 9.6%, reflecting strong scatter pricing as well as one additional NFL game compared to last year's first quarter. Excluding the extra NFL game, advertising growth was still up high single-digits. Second, strong retransmission revenue growth was driven by recent step-ups. And last, programming and production costs were lower compared to last year, which included not only the Super Bowl but also more expensive prime time programming due to series finales.","Film revenue declined 4.3% and operating cash flow declined 43.1% to $167 million, reflecting the difficult comparison to last year's strong film performance. Most notably, theatrical revenue declined 36.4% compared to last year's first quarter, which included the very successful Fifty Shades of Grey.","In addition, home entertainment revenue declined 24.4% due to the strong performance of several releases last year, including Lucy. Partially offsetting this lower revenue was higher content licensing revenue and strong consumer products growth due to the Minions and Jurassic franchises.","Theme Parks revenue increased 57.5% to $1 billion and operating cash flow increased 53.6% to $375 million in the first quarter of 2016. On a pro forma basis, revenue increased 9.6% and operating cash flow increased 3.3%. These results reflect the timing of spring break this year, stable guest attendance and higher per capita spending, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, including pre-opening costs to support Harry Potter in Hollywood and The Flying Dinosaur in Japan.","Now let's move to slide eight to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. Consolidated capital expenditures increased 9.2%, to $1.9 billion in the first quarter. At Cable Communications, capital expenditures increased 9%, to $1.6 billion for the quarter, equal to 12.9% of Cable revenue versus 12.6% in the first quarter of 2015. The increase reflects a higher level of investment and scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity, and an increased investment in line extensions as well as higher spending on customer premise equipment related to the deployment of the X1 platform and wireless gateways.","Also included in each of these growth rates is the continued expansion of business services. In 2016, we will continue to invest into (18:29) these areas, as they are driving positive results in our business. For the full year, we continue to expect capital intensity to remain flat 2015, at approximately 15%.","At NBCUniversal, first quarter capital expenditures increased 10% to $295 million, driven by the inclusion of Universal Studios Japan. We continue to expect NBCUniversal's CapEx to increase approximately 10% this year.","We'll now finish up on slide nine. As I mentioned earlier, consolidated free cash flow declined 11.9% to $2.8 billion in the first quarter, reflecting growth in consolidated operating cash flow, offset by increased working capital as well as higher capital expenditures and cash paid for capitalized software and other intangible assets.","We are successfully executing our plans for returning capital to shareholders, including dividend payments during the quarter totaling $611 million, up 6.9%, and share repurchases of $1.25 billion in the quarter, which are tracking to our $5 billion annual target. We ended the quarter right at 2 times net leverage, in line with our stated target.","That concludes our summary of the quarter. I hope that everyone now has a good sense for how pleased we are with our results as well as our momentum.","Now I'll turn it back to Jason to lead the Q&A.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Mike. Regina, let's open up the call for Q&A please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Neil, the customer metrics obviously speak for themselves. I'm just wondering if you could spend a minute talking about the kind of churn versus connect dynamic and how much of an opportunity is there to continue to bring churn down. For example, if X1 goes from 30-odd percent to 60%, is that going to continue to drive churn lower? And is there anything you're thinking about to drive connects up as you think about segmenting the market, and if (20:49) guys aren't doing today?","And then Mike, on the non-programming cost growth, which you called out at 7%, is that the kind of investment you need to sustain this top line or should investors think that there should be some leverage in that broad cost bucket over time? Thank you.","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","Hi, Ben. I'll speak to connects and churn. Connects have been strong. I didn't want to say this, that the churn is the only driver there. We've had strong connects and they're driven by good segmentation of the market. We're segmenting different customer bases. We're rolling out great products, X1, 35% of the customer base now as well as voice remote. I mean, we've got 160 million commands on the voice remote part (21:33). So we're seeing great usage there. The customer experience we spent a lot of time on and I think that's helping churn. X1 is helping churn. And I think also, we've developed new sales channels like Amazon we announced earlier this quarter, though I think it's a combination of driving connects and reducing churn.","The churns went down for 26 consecutive months, as Brian mentioned, and I see that trend continuing. I think that we're doing the right things in the customer experience, we're doing the right things on the product side, and we're doing the right things in the channel development side. So I see good trends continuing.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","And I'll just follow on that. I mean we're \u2013 on the investment and expense, and we're just playing offense and following the growth and progress that we're making. It's all success-based, so we'll keep doing what we're doing behind customer service, product, technology, and you've seen that on the non-programming side, but we'll get leverage over time as the customer service experience settles down, but we're not giving guidance today, Ben.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you both.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi. Good morning. Brian, a question for you. I know you can't talk about M&A specifically, but maybe more broadly, it's now been about seven years since \u2013 or getting on to be seven years since you first stepped in for NBCU. I wonder if you could just reflect on how you see the relative values of content and distribution, and how you see the relative negotiating leverage of content distribution as we see more of these kind of programming disputes like the one that DISH just had with Viacom?","Brian L. Roberts - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, first of all, it's been five years since we closed NBC Universal and it's been a wonderful experience in all regards, and exceeded our expectations in almost every business. And we've talked a lot about that. I also think that putting the two together, we feel we're better together. I said that in the upfront remarks and almost every senior executive of the company sees a benefit from some other part of the company in their part of the company. And that is part of Symphony.","When I think about the Olympics \u2013 I just touched on briefly in my opening remarks \u2013 you will see XFINITY's coverage of the Olympics will be unlike any television on the X1 experience that's ever been presented to a consumer for a live sporting event. And NBC coverage itself will be unprecedented if you just go back a few years to see how much this landscape has changed. And the companies that are leaning in toward that and are well-positioned, I can't think of a better company than ourselves.","As to the relative value, these things evolve and go up and down, and the relationship between the two in terms of carriage disputes and other things, they're both great businesses. And that was our fundamental premise all along. I think I first learned that being on Ted Turner's board when Comcast was purely a cable company. It's a worldwide business, it grows all (25:00) in different ways, but they're in the same sort of system where together, the value tends to head in the same direction. And at any one time, one part of the ecosystem can be doing better than another part of the ecosystem, but in the end, we're bringing great experiences to consumers. You need their content, you need innovative distribution technologies, and that's how we're running our company. And I hope that's responsive to your question. Thanks for asking.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","If you had your druthers, would you rather have more of one than the other? I mean, you tried to buy some more distribution and now, at least, there's some speculation you're interested in more content. Is there one that you find more attractive at the moment?","Brian L. Roberts - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not going to comment on that regard, and if you have more than one kid, you love them equally, and I don't know any other way to put it than they're both great businesses, and everything is specific to the situation. But we have very rigorous returns, our track record, it comes down to operating excellence. And just looking at Neil and Steve and their teams behind them, and I think that's what is the story today with these results. Both parts of the company remain at an exceptional level, in my opinion.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Well said. Thanks, Brian.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Craig. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Maybe a regulatory question for Brian. The FCC seems determined to fold cable underneath the special \u2013 or what they're now calling the business data services regime, and we should get some more color on that on Thursday. Just, what's your thoughts on that? And then, maybe somewhat related questions, Verizon's been making a lot of comments about eventual 5G rollout, any sort of early thoughts on the competitive environment, or how that's likely to evolve as 5G technology develops? Thanks.","Brian L. Roberts - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let me let Neil start with the special access (27:06). Go ahead, Neil.","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","Yeah, well, the Chairman recently claimed that there was limited competition in the business data services area and it needed more regulation. I can say that we compete every day for that business, and it seems kind of counterintuitive that the FCC would want to impose regulations on a new entrant such as us, who's bringing more competition to the business. I think we haven't seen the proposed rulemaking yet, so it's probably premature to comment any further on it, though.","Brian L. Roberts - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Your second question was?","John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","It was on 5G. As you guys have probably heard, Verizon is talking a lot about rolling it out, really starting in 2018, as a sort of fixed wireless replacement for cable plan. I mean obviously, it's a little bit down the road, but just any sort of early thoughts on 5G and fixed wireless as a potential competitor to cable?","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","Let me speak to that. 5G is an exciting new platform, and it's still in the very early days. We think that the propagation distance is fairly short, about 300 foot radius. The antennas are going to need space and power and backhaul, and it has \u2013 the spectrum doesn't really pass through objects like trees and buildings very well. But we think we're very well-positioned, because we have space and power and backhaul, as well as a field force to be able to install all the antennas and maintain the services and provide the backhaul that would be required. So we're going to continue to monitor, it's still a way \u2013 early in the game, and we feel well-positioned.","John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, John. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. First, a follow-up. Churn is improving nicely. You said it's been really sustained. Is there a case to be made to ease off on marketing to offset the cost growth in other parts of the business if this continues, and to support margin a little bit? And then second, on the opening up of the China market for film next year, how are you working toward that? Is that a real opportunity on the Universal side? Thanks.","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","Concerning the churn side, we've gotten very detailed. We have a data department that Ed Purcell (29:28) runs that's very detailed in how it segments the customer audience, and which segments we're going after. And we're very specific about that, and go after the high value, long CLB (29:44) customers. So I think where we see the opportunity, we're going to spend the marketing dollars, and we'll continue to provide great service and manage the churn as appropriate. I think the churn is an accumulation of a lot of different things we're doing in the business: customer experience, better product and just overall better service.","Brian L. Roberts - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","One of the things I just want to add, that I think that Neil and Dave Watson and the team have calibrated, not just subscriber results, but also revenue and cash flow, and there's a balance that is pretty different than I think I've seen anybody else quite have, over a sustainable number of quarters. And so the investment we're making in service, investment in innovation and marketing, it's all working, but it's not at the expense of one or the other. And as you drive us forward, I think Neil, you'll be making judgments every day on that balance. But that's what I personally find appealing in some of the results, is that we're not just going on one side or the other.","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","(30:54) Dave Watson and Cathy Avgiris and the field teams have done a great job just driving the business on a consistent basis.","Stephen B. Burke - Chief Executive Officer, NBCUniversal & Senior Executive Vice President, Comcast Corp.","So China, it's amazing how far we've come in the last few years. We had no employees in China several years ago. We now have a very good team, a movie team, a consumer products team, and we spent a lot of time, and have discussed on previous calls, trying to get going on building a theme park in Beijing. And that's going according to plan. So, China represents a big, big opportunity for the company. It already is a significant profit generator. Fast & Furious, for example, we did over $400 million in China.","But as that market grows, I think it's very important that we be there, and I think we're doing all the things that you would expect us to do, and have a lot of big movies coming out in China in the next year, and want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to grow that market as aggressively as possible.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, guys.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Phil. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. I have one for Steve and one's for Neil. Steve, on the upfront, I'd love to get your view of how this will turn out. You're coming to the market with a unified approach, which seems really logical but it's obviously never been done before. And within that context, so I'm wondering what the advertiser response has been so far. And within the context of the upfront, can you talk a little bit about Telemundo, which doesn't get that much attention, but you're a solid 40% share of the market at this point?","And then for Neil, you've talked a lot about the drivers of video subs, which is phenomenal. I'm just wondering if you could drill down a little bit on what you're doing in customer service that's different this year versus last and what your plans are for next year. For example, like the Uber- (32:54) like app available across the footprint. Thank you.","Stephen B. Burke - Chief Executive Officer, NBCUniversal & Senior Executive Vice President, Comcast Corp.","So regarding the upfront, let me talk a little bit about the market. A year ago, a lot of advertisers pulled back and didn't spend as much in the upfront. I think part of the thinking was we can always spend later and there's plenty of places to spend our money on digital. I think the emotion of the market has swung pretty dramatically over the last year. I think people have come to the realization that broad television reach is really important in a campaign that digital has a place but television has a big place. And a lot of people, I think, who did not come into the upfront market last year paid significantly more in what has been one of the strongest scatter markets I've ever seen. So in terms of market dynamics, we're going into the upfront season, I think, with a lot of wind at our back, and my prediction is that it's going to be a strong upfront.","We think we're in the pole position for that strong upfront. We represent about 20% of the eyeballs in television, if you add up broadcast and cable. NBC is on its way to its third annual 18 to 49 victory. We're doing very well in sports and news at NBC. And then our cable channels are strong. I'm glad you pointed out Telemundo. Telemundo used to be a weak second. We're beating Univision most nights at 10:00 and have closed the gap with Univision. And I think in a number of our channels, we're still underpriced relative to people that we're beating or close to or at least competitive to. So I think we're going into the upfront in a very strong position.","And as you said, we sell all of our channels and all of our digital properties together under the unified direction of Linda Yaccarino our head of ad sales, which is an advantage for advertisers, but also, given our position, we tend to talk to people first, and that's exactly where we want to be. So I think we're going into this upfront with a better upfront, a better more unified approach, and more strength than we've ever had, and we'll see how it all plays out.","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","Jessica, concerning customer experience, we're focusing on a few things. One is making the experience all digital, so the customer, if they don't want to call an agent, doesn't have to. They can do everything they need to do, from a customer service perspective, online or digitally. We're working very closely on the first 90 days on the onboarding experience, making sure that's a perfect experience, that's a higher churn environment. We're focusing on reliability of the products and the network, making sure they're always up. We said at Intex (35:40) a year ago, we have the best product in the market, and I think we're delivering that now.","We had the lowest days and call-in (35:49) rate in years. We took out 11 million calls. We had the highest first contact resolution rate in years as well. So we're seeing the results but it's focused across a number of fronts. And the team \u2013 Charlie Herrin and the team have done a great job getting organized around the five key journeys, and we're delivering \u2013 we're changing the way we look at the business through the customer lens, and it's really changed the way we go about doing things.","Unknown Speaker","Yeah.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Jessica. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I just had a question for Mr. Burke. For years, the Street always was unwilling to put a multiple on the studio division, given its driven (36:42) nature. That seems to be changing a little bit as the failure rate of the franchise film falls If you look to (36:46) monetize those franchises across divisions they're increasing (36:50). Would you say that's an explicit strategy of your studio to focus on franchise films?","Stephen B. Burke - Chief Executive Officer, NBCUniversal & Senior Executive Vice President, Comcast Corp.","Oh, absolutely. Five years ago, we had one franchise, Fast and Furious. Today, we have eight franchises, and we're hard at work trying to build more. And we spend a lot of time trying to figure out where films are in the arc of the franchise. The franchise eventually declines and leaves and we're doing everything we can to make sure that the franchises that we have are strong as possible.","We did \u2013 our Film group five-year plan review was just yesterday and we spent half the time talking about how to take care of franchises, make sure that they stay fresh, create new ones, make sure that they're fully monetized in consumer products and around the world. So it's a key, key part of our company and again, we've made tremendous progress in the last five years being in the position we are now where we can look forward to these franchises continuing to come back and succeed for many years to come.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you very much.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Jay. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for taking the question. I would be interested in hearing you comment on the future of the set-top box. If we look at what you're doing, on the one hand, you're making a big commitment to it through the X1 deployment, but you're also out there with your partner program and your recent announcement with Roku and Samsung. And so maybe just getting a view for how you think the marketplace is going to evolve.","And then were you surprised at all by the FCC's reaction to the announcement that you had with Roku? It would seem that it would align with their set-top box reforms and yet they came out somewhat harshly against it.","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","Well, we think the X1 platform is the best there is in the market right now and we're seeing great results from it. Churn is down, VOD is up, more DVRs, more additional outlets, so it's hitting on all cylinders. We also want to make our content available to as many customers or potential customers as possible, and we want have the best content available. So we think the way to approach it is instead of coming up with new hardware that will probably be outdated in a short period, the apps-based approach was the right approach. And the deals that you referred to with Roku and Samsung are HTML5-based apps that provides the full suite of services. So set-top boxes will continue to be part of our ecosystem and as will apps. Brian?","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And will the... (39:38)","Brian L. Roberts - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Go ahead. What were you going to say?","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I was just going to ask your comments on the FCC's set-top box proposed reforms and their reaction to the partner program.","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","Yeah, I thought their reaction was unnecessary. I think that we are working hard with our partners. We've had over 40 companies call us to sign up for the partner program since then, and so there's great interest in the ecosystem to get access to our XFINITY app, and so I thought it was uncalled for.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks for taking the question.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Brett. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have one for Mike and one for Neil. Mike, I think as a follow-up from an earlier question, from Ben's question, but can you talk any more specifically about the drivers of the 9.4% growth in programming expense in the quarter? I realize you had renewals on the content side, you're adding more content rights as you described in your remarks, but I think investors continue to wonder if this sort of 9% to 10% programming expense growth rate that we're seeing continues into 2017, or if it moderates as you get beyond some of the onetime renewals \u2013 some of those onetime step-ups with your partners? And then for Neil, it looks like on the high-speed data side that ARPU decelerated a touch in the quarter. I know you didn't have modem fee increases, but I think pricing power on broadband is something investors assume that's an arrow that you have in your quiver. So, just wondering if you could update us on how you think about broadband pricing this year and in the longer term? And if you have anything to say about what the FCC said about Charter not being able to impose caps on data usage. Any thoughts there would be appreciated. Thanks, both.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Anthony, it's Mike. On program expense, what we're seeing thus far and for this year is consistent with what we had said at the beginning of the year, which is about 10% increase in programming expenses. And you hit the reasons; we have big \u2013 certain renewals happening now and over the course of this year. As far as going beyond this year, long term, you look back over time and long-term trends have been in the high single-digits, so we're running a little higher than \u2013 in the near term than that. But that is, again, due to just having some of our big contracts coming back up for renewal.","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","And concerning HSD, I mean, we're very pleased with the 7.6% growth and the 438,000 subs. We feel good about the business. It goes back to that balance that Brian referred to. We've increased speeds 16 times (42:33) in the last 14 years. We're rolling out DOCSIS 3.1. We have tens of millions of Wi-Fi hotspots and so we continue to add value to the business. I think there's pricing opportunity going forward as we continue to add value. Concerning the Charter caps, I'd prefer not to comment on that. That's still pending.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Anthony. Question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. I have one for Mike and one for Steve. Mike, I wanted to ask about cash paid for intangible assets. These investments have been growing at a pretty good rate over the past couple of years, particularly in recent quarters. Can you talk about what's been driving the growth and how we should think about those investments going forward? And then, Steve, I was just wondering if you could comment on where the DISH carriage negotiations stand, and do you feel that you're making any progress at this point? Thank you.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Okay. So, I'll just comment and if Neil wants to pile in, he can. But on the software intangible side, this is the other side of the offensive investments we're making in X1, cloud, cloud DVR, our home products, smart Internet. When we build software, we improve our backbone through some infrastructure investments, some of that rolls through software intangibles. So, it's the same story as what's going on in CapEx, and investing behind the growth we're seeing.","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","I think we're in good shape with DISH. I think we have a meeting of the minds. We don't have a signed deal yet, but I think we will have one in the not-too-distant future.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Mike, if I could just follow up. I mean, as you get through the X1 rollout which is, on the CapEx side, is more hardware-driven, I think most of us would expect the capital intensity to decline. But on the software side, should we expect the same, because it seems like the business is becoming more software-driven? So, is that going to take on maybe a different trajectory as you get toward the end of the X1 deployment?","Michael J. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","I'd say that continues to be on a trajectory. We are investing a lot in innovation, that's the point of what we've been doing on the product side, so that will continue. It's a small \u2013 obviously, a much smaller amount than the hardware side, but it has been on a higher growth rate and I'd expect it to, as long as we're seeing great results, continue to be biased towards innovating and getting great products out there.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Bryan. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. Neil, maybe a quick comment on AT&T's DIRECTV Now announcement rolling out later this year, sort of a true nationwide full-bundled offering, presumably \u2013 if and when they get the rights, whether or not that changes your thought on the competitive landscape? And I guess, for Comcast specifically, could you do the same thing? Are there Title VI or LFA requirements that would prevent you from doing so? And then I guess, for Mike, Cable OCF margins, can we just get a sense for how you think about the pacing throughout the year on quarters?","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","Yeah, so on the AT&T announced product, there's no reason we couldn't do something very similar from a technology perspective or a rights perspective. We just have to go get the rights and deploy the product. We thus far haven't seen an OTT model that really hunts, (46:18) but we'll continue to stay tuned in to the market and be prepared to respond accordingly.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","And on Cable margins, it's quarter-by quarter; seasonality will drive things a little bit. I mentioned last year's second quarter, we had the Pacquiao fight in what is usually a seasonally weaker quarter. But full year is, as we said, last year was 40.6% Cable margins and, as we said at the beginning of the year, it'd be flat to down 50 basis points, and that continues to be what we see.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks. Mike. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI","Hi. Thanks. Two questions, please. Steve, just want to get some color on the Cable net underlying subscriber trends. Obviously, we have some sense on what cord cutting is, but on the cord-shaving side, any color? I mean, we've been thinking it's about a 2% decline on the base, but is that changing? Any color there would be great.","And then for Neil, I understand there's a big cost element on the operating cost side for set-top box-related costs, structurals, (47:33) customer care. So, in a longer-term environment where set-top box possibly goes away, if that's the case, how much cost can go out from that line? That would be great to understand. Thanks.","Stephen B. Burke - Chief Executive Officer, NBCUniversal & Senior Executive Vice President, Comcast Corp.","So, in terms of cord cutting, cord shaving, we don't see much change at all. The numbers you \u2013 the 2% you talked about is not far off from what we're seeing, and some of it is shaving and some of it is cutting. And the interesting thing about the Cable Network business is the overall resiliency. If you look at the affiliate stream and the advertising stream and the desire for advertisers to buy broadly-distributed, highly-rated cable channels being stronger than ever. So, as a business, it's not going to grow \u2013 we've said before and we'll say again, it's not going to grow the way it did 10 years ago. But it's still a good business for us, and we don't see any major change, in terms of what's going on with sub trends.","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","Concerning set-top boxes (48:32) as we put more up in the cloud and go to IP video, we think the cost of the set-top boxes and the overall hardware in the house will come down. We still believe there's a need for hardware in the house, at least at the gateway level, and we've got IP video in the labs now and we'll continue to look at the right balance to get the best content and all the content to our customers while managing the CapEx cost. But in terms of CapEx, CPE is in the 40% to 50% range of our CapEx spend, so that would be the amount overall that would be under development.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI","Great. Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Vijay. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Two quick questions. First, in terms of Cable, Charter is being asked to overbuild 1 million broadband subs and, looking at how big of an issue this might be, since this is the first time cable operators will actually compete against each other. I know it's early, but do you have any thoughts about this that you can share with us? And then secondly, for Steve, within NBCUniversal, and I guess just in general, we keep seeing declines in Cable subs but not Broadcast. Can you talk about what's driving the difference?","Neil Smit - President & Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable & Senior Executive Vice President","This is Neil. I'll comment on the Charter overbuild. I think it's early to comment on it, since we haven't seen the details. But generally speaking, Comcast is in urban markets and these urban markets have been overbuilt by one or another telco. And so, we're in a very competitive environment as it is, and we think we're well-positioned.","Stephen B. Burke - Chief Executive Officer, NBCUniversal & Senior Executive Vice President, Comcast Corp.","So, the Broadcast business is a real positive, I think, in the overall NBCUniversal story, if you look at where the company was five years ago and where it is today. The most highly-rated channels, I think, are going to be staying in the most bundles and are going to be watched by the most people, continue to be watched by the most people, and I put NBC obviously right at the top of that list.","Retransmission consent has been a tremendous benefit to our Broadcast business, both the retransmission we get from our own stations and the share we get from our affiliates. If you add those two numbers together, that was a number around zero five years ago and it's a number around $800 million today, something like that.","And also on the advertising side, I think, particularly the live events, you've got Olympics coming up for 17 days, our ratings will be higher than all \u2013 if you add the other three broadcasters together, we will be a multiple of anyone else's ratings for 17 days. Imagine how valuable that is to someone who's trying to build a brand or introduce a new car or do something major in terms of changing the opinion of people in America.","So, it's interesting. I would not have predicted this 10 or 20 years ago but it feels like Broadcast is getting stronger and stronger in this period. We have to keep putting good shows on and it's tougher and tougher in a fragmented world to get a rating. But when you do, you do get \u2013 you get rewarded for it significantly.","Marci L.

Can you comment a little bit more on the Amazon channel partnership and how important you feel that channel partners like Amazon and others will be to the products that you have going forward?","Brian L. Roberts - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's in the early stages of the partnership, but it's worked very well. They've been a great partner in helping us understand how to better sell contextually. In other words, if you buy a laptop, do you want an HSD service? If you buy a television, do you want a video service? So, the contextual sales aspect they've been very helpful in working with us. Concerning \u2013 we've developed a number of other channels. Our stores are doing very well. XFINITY On Campus is doing very well. So, we continue to \u2013 every year, we seek to develop new channels and Amazon, we see great promise in.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I would now turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marlene Dooner. Please go ahead, Ms. Dooner.","Marlene S. Dooner","Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter and full year 2011 earnings call. Joining me on the call are Brian Roberts; Michael Angelakis; Steve Burke; and Neil Smit. As we have done in the past, Brian and Michael will make formal remarks, and Steve and Neil will also be available for Q&A. ","As always, let me refer you to Slide #2, which contains our Safe Harbor disclaimer, and remind you that this conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, in this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our 8-K for the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. ","With that, let me turn the call to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian?","Brian L. Roberts","Thanks, Marlene, and good morning, everyone. I'm delighted to begin 2012 with this first call. Just thinking back a year ago, we were closing the NBCUniversal deal. We were making major management changes, bringing Neil Smit to fully run Comcast Cable, Steve Burke was beginning his first year at NBCUniversal, and it was a really, really important year for 2011 that had a lot go well. I'm thrilled to tell you that I think virtually across the board, our 2011 performance, as you can see in these fourth quarter's results and throughout the year, is right where we had hoped to be, and in some cases substantially better. ","And based on all of that, we're very pleased today to be increasing our dividend by 44% to $0.65 per share on an annual basis and that our board has approved a new $6.5 billion stock buyback program under which we plan to increase our repurchases of stock by 40% to $3 billion this year. Now the way we come to those conclusions of the optimism and good feelings we have about the company is based on the financial results. ","So let me start with Cable, which had an outstanding year, capped by a great fourth quarter of improving customer metrics combined with healthy financial results. In the fourth quarter, Video customer losses declined to 17,000, our best quarterly Video performance in almost 5 years. And for the full year, we reduced Video customer losses by nearly 40%. We also added 336,000 High-Speed Internet customers in the quarter, a 15% increase and marked the sixth year in a row of adding more than 1 million high-speed data customers. ","I really believe these improvements are sustainable because they are the result of our scale and our intensified focus on service and innovation, all of which come together in our wonderful XFINITY brand message of product innovation and a better customer experience. Our major technical initiatives of DOCSIS 3.0, all digital, a content delivery network that works on all platforms is now complete, and we have leveraged these investments to deliver more innovation faster than ever before. ","So in 2011, we introduced more new products and features than the prior 2 years combined. And our product roadmap for 2012 is just as exciting, and it includes a broader rollout of the Xcalibur platform, which we're rebranding to X1, including our cloud-based guide to hundreds of thousands of customers this year across multiple markets. We'll be expanding our Home Security business in many, many markets virtually nationwide, an expansion of Wi-Fi to several new markets and a lot of content, which will be On Demand and on all devices. And we also recently began to jointly market our services with Verizon Wireless, and we hope to expand the marketing footprint and working on new innovative products this year with Verizon Wireless. And we continue to expand choices and offerings for our customers, and we've taken important steps in our programming agreements and our relationship with the program suppliers, extending terms, expanding rights, going longer and having broader On Demand lineups and more flexibility to deliver this content to more devices in and out of the home than ever before. So all in all, our Cable business is in terrific shape today, our competitive position continues to get stronger, and we are leading with XFINITY in an innovation, and I believe we are in a solid position for the future. ","Let me now switch to NBCUniversal, where in 2011, we successfully completed our integration, but we also had such a busy year with many important investment decisions. Some of these investments are already paying off, and others will pay off over time. We invested in new shows in both Cable Networks and on our Broadcast networks. We invested in our own stations. We extended the NHL and PGA rights, purchased 100% of the Orlando theme parks, have some exciting film franchises launching in 2012. We invested to extend the Harry Potter franchise in several of our Theme Parks. We also brought together all of our company's capabilities and successful bids for the Olympics, for the Spanish-language rights for FIFA World Cup soccer, and we extended the all-important Sunday night football franchise with the NFL. In each case, we secured important rights for many years, and we got more content to be used over many new platforms, putting us on a path to make these investments profitable over time and to significantly strengthen the business. ","In the first year, we've also had some early successes that validate our belief that we can create real value with our combination of distribution and content businesses. We launched Project Symphony, concentrating first on cross-promotion, which had real success with The Voice in early 2011 and again just last week with the Super Bowl, The Voice and Smash. The Super Bowl and all of last week was critically important to the company, both from an execution standpoint and from just purely the largest audience in American television history. ","And just one example of how well the company is working together was around Smash, where once again, we showed that NBC can promote its own shows on all of its platforms, but also along with Comcast was able in the Comcast markets to generate over 20% higher ratings than elsewhere in the average of the country. So we're a new and different and, frankly, I think, unique company, full of enthusiasm and optimism for what we can achieve in Cable at NBCUniversal and what we can now build together. So it's with that great start for 2012 that we're focused on maintaining the momentum, continuing to drive operating and financial excellence, and building value for our shareholders. ","Let me now pass to Michael to cover the fourth quarter and full year results in detail.","Michael J. Angelakis","Thank you, Brian. We are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results for 2011, which reflect profitable growth and the fundamental strength of our businesses. Based on our confidence in the ongoing performance of the company and as Brian just mentioned, we are increasing our total return of capital to shareholders in 2012 by 45%. We'll address our financial strategy a bit later, but now let's discuss our business performance for 2011 in more detail. ","For the full year of 2011, consolidated revenue increased 47.2% to $55.8 billion, and operating cash flow increased 25.8% to $18.4 billion, reflecting strong organic growth in the Cable business as well as consolidating the acquisitions of NBCUniversal on January 28 and the remaining 50% of Universal Orlando on July 1. ","Free cash flow for the full year, which excludes the impact of the economic stimulus, increased 30.1% to $7 billion, primarily reflecting growth in operating cash flow, which includes NBCUniversal, and partially offset by increases in working capital, higher cash-paid interest, capital expenditures and intangible asset expenditures. Free cash flow per share increased 31.9% to $2.52 per share in 2011. For the year, our Cable free cash flow accounted for $5.2 billion or 75% of the total, while NBCUniversal contributed $1.8 billion or 25% of consolidated free cash flow. Earnings per share for the full year grew 16.3% to $1.50 per share from $1.29 per share in 2010. Excluding NBCUniversal transaction-related costs and other nonrecurring items, our EPS increased 20.6% to $1.58 compared to $1.31 in 2010. Please refer to Slide 5. ","Let's take a look at the pro forma results of our Cable and NBCUniversal businesses. Pro forma results are presented as if the NBCUniversal and the Universal Orlando transactions were both effective on January 1, 2010. We believe the pro forma presentation provides a more meaningful comparison of the operating performance of the businesses. In addition, we adjust operating cash flow to incorporate the effects of acquisition accounting and eliminate the costs and expenses directly related to the NBCUniversal transaction. In total, during 2011, these adjustments, which are detailed on Table 6 of our press release, impacted NBCUniversal operating cash flow by $340 million. Our purchase accounting adjustments are now complete, so year-over-year comparisons should be a bit easier going forward. ","In 2011, Cable Communications revenue increased 5.3% to $37.2 billion and represented 65% of our consolidated revenue, while Cable operating cash flow grew 6.9% to $15.3 billion and represented 82% of our consolidated operating cash flow. ","For the full year, NBCUniversal generated revenue of $21.1 billion, an increase of 3.7%. This growth reflects the inclusion of $782 million of revenue from the Olympics in 2010. So on an apples-to-apples basis, revenue increased 7.8%. ","Operating cash flow increased 2.3% to $3.8 billion. Again, excluding the Olympics in 2010 and the acquisition-related accounting revisions in cost in 2011, NBCUniversal's operating cash flow increased 5.2%. These results reflect strong performance at the Cable Networks and Theme Parks, which are offset by weaker performance at Broadcast and Film. ","For the full year, consolidated revenue increased 4.7% to $57.7 billion. Again, excluding the impact of the Olympics in 2010, pro forma consolidated revenue increased 6.2%. Consolidated pro forma operating cash flow increased 6.2% to $18.7 billion, and excluding the Olympics and the acquisition-related accounting revisions in cost that I just described, full year operating cash flow increased 6.8%. ","Please refer to the next slide, and let's review Cable Communications results in more detail. ","In 2011, our Cable segment reported strong financial results and customer growth with substantial year-over-year improvements. For the full year of 2011, Cable Communications revenue increased 5.3% to $37.2 billion, reflecting growth in our recurring residential business and continued strength in Business Services, partially offset by lower political advertising. ","The Cable business has performed well and has had consistent results. Excluding advertising, Cable revenue increased 5.6% for the full year, which is consistent with the growth rate in each of the last 4 quarters. In 2010, we generated $180 million of political ad revenue, making 2011 comparisons a bit challenging. As a result, Cable advertising declined by 1% for the full year and by 9% or $56 million for the fourth quarter. However, excluding the political ad revenue, cable advertising increased 7% for the full year and 5% in the fourth quarter. ","We are managing the business for sustainable and profitable growth, and our total revenue per Video customer reached $141 per month in the fourth quarter, a 7% increase. That reflects our growing customer base, a higher contribution from Business Services and an increasing number of residential customers taking multiple products. At year end, 71% of our Video customers took at least 2 products, and 37% took all 3 services versus 33% in 2010. ","We continued to experience real strength in our customer metrics. We ended the year with improved year-over-year customer growth. For the year, we added 1.4 million total Video, High-Speed Internet and Voice customers, an 11% increase in net customer additions compared to 2010. As Brian mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we lost 17,000 Video customers, a significant improvement over the 135,000 Video subscriber losses in last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, we reduced Video losses by nearly 300,000, approximately a 40% improvement over 2010. In addition, we added 1.2 million new High-Speed Internet customers in 2011, a 10% increase over last year's new customer additions. ","We have improved products, we are competing better, and our focus on retention and customer service has resulted in lower churn year-over-year and each quarter across all of our services. In addition to our strong customer metrics, rate adjustments, and an increasing number of customers taking higher levels of digital and advanced services contributed to a 1.3% increase in video revenue. We added 743,000 high def and\/or DVR customers in 2011 and now have 10.9 million high def and\/or DVR customers, equal to 53% of our 20.6 million digital customers. ","High-Speed Internet revenue was the largest contributor to Cable revenue growth in 2011. High-Speed Internet revenue increased 9.8%, reflecting rate adjustments, continued growth in our customer base and an increasing number of customers taking higher-speed services. Today, over 25% of our residential High-Speed Internet customers take a higher-speed tier than our primary service. Our HSI service is clearly capturing more market share as we continue to differentiate our product through service and speed enhancements. ","With regards to Voice, our Voice revenue increased 6.2% for the full year, reflecting continued growth in our customer base. In 2011, we added 732,000 voice customers, and our penetration is now 18% of our homes passed. ","Business Services were the second largest contributor to Cable revenue growth in 2011, with revenue increasing 41.4% to $1.8 billion. Virtually all of our growth is from the small end of the market or businesses with less than 20 employees, and we continue to experience strong momentum. In addition, we now have Metro E and PRI trunked voice available in all of our markets. In total, Business Services represents a $20 billion to $30 billion opportunity in our markets, and our penetration is only 10%. So we are enthusiastic about the growth opportunities in this segment. ","Please refer to Slide 7. In addition to revenue growth, we remain very focused on expense management in driving greater efficiencies and effectiveness through the organization. As a result, full year Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 6.9% to $15.3 billion, resulting in a margin of 41.1%, a 70 basis point improvement compared to 2010. We had several positives contributed to our margin improvement. First is our improving product mix. We are adding more High-Speed Internet, Voice and Business Services customers, and an increasing number of our residential customers subscribed to multiple products and upgrade to higher tiers of service, such as HD DVRs or faster Internet speeds. These products are clearly accretive to our margins. ","Second, we've had improved efficiencies in our operations as we then focus on improving service, reducing churn and increasing customer satisfaction. As a result, customer service and technical operation expenses were relatively flat during the year. In addition, bad debt expense improved as we continued to improve our retention, collection and screening processes. Partially offsetting these positives are 3 pressures, 2 of which we control and have positive ROIs. ","We are making important investments in new products to expand business services and to offer new products like XFINITY Home and Signature Support. In addition, in 2011, sales and marketing expenses increased 11.8% for the full year as a result of higher overall media spend and a continued investment in direct sales to more effectively target customers and enhance our competitive position. These increased marketing efforts have had a positive impact on our customer metrics. Our XFINITY brand is now launched in 100% of our footprint and represents a more technology- and customer-focused brand that is making a positive impact on both our customers and those considering our services for purchase. ","Finally, programming expense remains a challenge. In 2011, programming expenses increased 5.8% as we continue to increase the amount of content we provide consumers across multiple platforms. As we have mentioned previously, we expect programming expenses to grow at the mid- to high-single-digit rates, and in 2012, we expect programming expenses to grow at the higher end of that range. ","Please refer to Slide 8 so we can review our Cable Communications capital expenditures. As indicated on the slide, we continue to reduce the capital intensity of our Cable business. For 2011, total Cable capital expenditures decreased 1% to $4.8 billion, equal to 12.9% of revenue versus 13.7% in 2010. This reduction reflects scale efficiencies, including improved equipment pricing, partially offset by continued investments in network infrastructure and the expansion of Business Services. Our full year CPE expenditures declined even as we deployed 2.4 million advanced HD and\/or DVR set-tops and deployed 6.4 million digital adapters. In total, we have deployed over 23 million digital adapters since the inception of the All-Digital project, which is now complete. All-Digital has been a terrific initiative that has provided significant operational benefits and product enhancements as well as generating strong financial returns. ","Over the past year, we have begun to recapture the remaining analog bandwidth in a number of our markets, and we plan to continue this effort as we anticipate additional operating efficiencies and strategic benefits from fully digitizing our systems. ","Full year 2011 CapEx also reflects meaningful investments to support the continued growth in Business Services and to expand our efforts in the midsized business area. Our investment in Business Services increased 22% to $607 million in 2011. We've also increased our investment in network infrastructure to enable product enhancements, including increasing Internet speeds to our customers to reinforce our product leadership and High-Speed Internet. We successfully raised speeds on our flagship product from 12 to 15 megabits and raised speeds on our Blast! product from 20 to 25 megabits. In addition, we introduced our 50-megabit service and our extreme 105-megabit service to virtually all of our markets. ","With regards to 2012, we anticipate our capital intensity to moderate further as Cable capital expenditures are expected to be lower as a percentage of Cable revenue when compared to 2011, even as we continue to invest capital in our network and fund the expansion of new service offerings like XFINITY Home, Wi-Fi and Xcalibur. These projects provide attractive returns, expand our service and product offerings and drive future organic growth. Please refer to Slide 9 so we can take a closer look at the pro forma results of NBCUniversal segments. For the full year, Cable Networks generated revenue of $8.5 billion, an increase of 10.6%, driven by a 10.9% increase in distribution revenue, an 8.7% increase in advertising revenue and an 18.7% increase in other revenue, primarily due to increases in the licensing of content from the Cable production studio. Cable Networks' adjusted operating cash flow increased 9.8% as we reinvested some of the top line growth in original programming and incurred higher marketing expenses to support launches of new series and other new programming across a number of our Cable Networks. ","With regards to our Broadcast segment, full year Broadcast Television revenue decreased 7.1% to $6.4 billion, reflecting the inclusion of $782 million of revenue from the Olympics in 2010's results. Excluding the impact of the Olympics, Broadcast revenue increased 4.8%. Advertising revenue, excluding the impact of the Olympics, increased 1% in 2011, primarily reflecting ratings pressure at the NBC Broadcast network and lower political advertising at NBC-owned local stations. Content licensing revenue increased 23.3%, primarily the result of a licensing agreement for prior season and library content in the second and fourth quarters. Full year 2011 Broadcast adjusted operating cash flow, which excludes the Olympics in 2010 as well as acquisition-related accounting revisions in '11, decreased to $231 million, reflecting lower ratings, increased programming and marketing costs associated with NBC primetime schedule and higher news coverage. ","As we look at advertising revenue at Cable Networks and Broadcast, both had unusual items that impacted advertising growth in the fourth quarter, including 4 fewer days in our advertising calendar, fewer NBA games due to the lockout and lower political advertising revenue at the NBC-owned local stations. If we adjust advertising growth to exclude these items in the fourth quarter, Cable Networks advertising revenue increased 7% versus the reported 2% growth, and Broadcast advertising revenue was flat versus a reported decrease of 6.5%. ","Moving on to Filmed Entertainment. 2011 revenue was flat at $4.6 billion, reflecting higher theatrical revenue from the strong box-office performance of Fast Five and Bridesmaids as well as higher content licensing revenue offset by lower home entertainment revenue and a decrease in other revenue due to fewer stage plays. Film adjusted operating cash flow declined $220 million to $10 million in 2011, reflecting the underperformance of the 2011 film slate, higher marketing costs and a tough comparison to the 2010 performance of Despicable Me. ","Switching to our Theme Parks, this segment had a terrific year. Theme Parks generated revenue of $2 billion in 2011, a 24.3% increase that was driven by strong attendance in per capita spending at both parks, which are benefiting from the success of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction in Orlando and the King Kong attraction in Hollywood. Full year adjusted operating cash flow increased 41.2% to $835 million. We are pleased that the integration and transition of 2011 is behind us at NBCUniversal and look forward to 2012, which will be more execution-focused. ","Please refer to Slide 10 to review our consolidated financial strategy. We believe that operational excellence and strategic differentiation drive shareholder value, so we have an operating strategy that is execution-focused and a financial strategy that is returns-focused and supports the strategy by reinvesting in our business while maintaining a strong balance sheet and providing a consistent and sustainable return of capital to shareholders. Our strong free cash flow generation means we can balance and achieve our growth in capital allocation priorities. It's not an either\/or choice. So let me once again quickly review our priorities. ","Our first priority is to generate strong returns by reinvesting in our businesses. In both Cable and NBCUniversal, we are reinvesting to strengthen our competitive positions and to support attractive internal growth opportunities. In regards to acquisitions and investments, we have a very disciplined approach, focused on opportunities that generate strong risk-adjusted returns and combined with strategic importance that generate long-term value. We view our strong balance sheet as a strategic asset and are committed to remaining a strong investment-grade issuer. At the end of 2011, we had $39.3 billion of debt on our consolidated balance sheet and had gross debt to operating cash flow leverage of 2.1x. We are comfortable with a gross debt to operating cash flow leverage target of 2 to 2.5x and expect to remain at the low end of that range, which we believe provides appropriate financial flexibility and liquidity to execute our operating and strategic plans. We also have a strong commitment to deliver consistent and sustainable return of capital to shareholders within a disciplined capital structure and through a combination of dividends and buybacks, which we think enhances shareholder returns while maintaining adequate liquidity to execute our plans. ","To achieve that, we currently view Comcast and NBCUniversal as 2 distinct pools of cash flow generation and funding capacity. NBCUniversal retains its free cash flow, which amounted to $1.8 billion in 2011, to build capacity to fund future equity redemptions by GE while Comcast Cable allocates its free cash flow to consistently return capital to shareholders. ","As we move to the next slide, you can see a consistent and growing return of capital over the last 3 years and for 2012, reflecting today's announcements. Since the 2008-2009 financial crisis, we have steadily increased our total return of capital through a combination of increasing dividends and buybacks. We instituted an annual dividend in 2008 at $0.25 per share and have consistently increased it to the current announced level of $0.65 per share. The newly announced dividend represents 43% of our last 12 months of net income and raises our current dividend yield to approximately 2.4%, which is above the S&P 500. ","In combination with the planned stock repurchases in 2012, our combined yield is approximately 6.5%. As a percentage of free cash flow, our total payout has steadily increased from 35% in 2009 to 63% in 2011. With today's announcement, our total return of capital in 2012 is increasing approximately 45% to $4.8 billion, incorporating a 44% increase in the dividend and a plan to repurchase $3 billion of stock in 2012 under our new repurchase authorization of $6.5 billion. This total return represents a payout of 90% of our last 12 months' Cable free cash flow and approximately 115% of our last 12 months' net income. ","So as we conclude 2011 and begin 2012, the company is performing well, with a real focus on innovation and execution. In addition, we are pleased with the start in 2012 and hope to build on Cable Communications and NBCUniversal's momentum. We also are very pleased at this momentum, and our financial strength is allowing us to invest for profitable growth and to accelerate our return of capital to shareholders. ","Now let me turn the call to Marlene for Q&A.","Marlene S. Dooner","Thanks, Michael. Operator, let's open up the call for Q&A, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Moffett with Sanford Bernstein.","Craig Moffett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I'm going to try to slip in 2, if I can. First, on the strength in Video subscribers, are you seeing that as a competitive issue, or are you starting to see some tailwind from new household formation recovery in your markets? And then secondly, if you could just update us on your Wi-Fi expansion and whether you're thinking about a voice-over-Wi-Fi service as part of that? And if so, how would you fill the MVNO component in order to fill in where you don't have Wi-Fi coverage?","Neil Smit","Craig, this is Neil. I think that our Video results are more a competitive issue. I think we're focused on product innovation and better customer service, and I think we've seen kind of sustainable results from those 2 areas of focus. The other factor that I would mention is that the RBOC overbuild has flowed in 2011. It was about 1.1 million homes versus 2.5 million in 2010. We're getting more flexibility in our programming agreements, as you've seen, so we're offering more content to more devices. So we're staying focused on product innovation and better service, and more to come there. Concerning the Wi-Fi build-out, we built out Philly, parts of New Jersey and Delaware. We're pleased with the results. We have about 4,000 access points. We'll be building out more markets, but it will be primarily focused on data versus voice-over.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just have a question for Mr. Burke. On the Cable Networks side of the business, it seemed like expenses over the first 3 quarters of the year were growing pretty significantly and you had margin compression, and the expense growth seemed to stop in the fourth quarter of this year with pretty significant margin expansion. Can you just help us, spring 2012, in terms of how we should think about the level of investment or harvesting that's going on in the Cable Networks division?","Brian L. Roberts","Steve, you want to take that, or Michael?","Michael J. Angelakis","Why don't I take it? Sorry, Jason. You really can't look at the quarter-by-quarter for the Cable Networks. We've made meaningful investments in Cable Networks, really trying to build each of the franchises and build value for those particular channels. With regards to the first 3 quarters versus the fourth quarter, I really wouldn't focus on 1 quarter. I would really focus on the entire year and how we've invested in new series for different channels and how we've marketed those as well. As we look to 2012, we feel pretty good about what our investment level is. We'll continue to invest in certain areas where there's other channels that we think need some additional help. But it's not going to be material, and I think the cruising altitude that we have for investment in the Cable channels feels about right.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jessica Reif-Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have maybe a clarification and then a separate question. Michael, on the capital returns, I mean obviously, a very solid number for 2012. I think everybody should be happy. But can you clarify your outlook for 2013? If we assume that the balance of the buyback, the $3.5 billion, is 2013, your leverage then goes back to the mid onetime level. So how should we think about that, given your leverage target of 2 to 2.5x?","Michael J. Angelakis","So, Jessica, I really wouldn't look into 2013. I wouldn't look at the $6.5 billion authorization as a marker for 2013. We're very focused on 2012. And as we've said before, we're really looking at a financial strategy for each year separately. So the reason for the $6.5 billion is to provide us with flexibility. We obviously ran out our authorization in the fourth quarter of 2011, and we really want to have as much flexibility as we can. And then we'll obviously sit down with our board at the end of 2012, and we'll look at our financial strategy again with a pretty fresh look on both dividends and buybacks for 2013.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then my question for all. On NBCU, clearly, there's a lot of upside in every division. I was just hoping you could -- Steve, could talk a little bit about where you see the biggest growth opportunities over the next 1 to 3 years. And on the Cable side, can Neil or Brian, anyone discuss what you're seeing in terms of early indications of -- from the Verizon joint venture in terms of marketing? And you mentioned new products. Can you elaborate?","Stephen B. Burke","Jessica, this is Steve. Just to start on NBCUniversal, we obviously think there are a lot of opportunities, but if you look at 2011, that was really a year of integrating the 2 companies, making sure we had the right people in place and starting to invest in some of the businesses that we thought had real opportunity. And our goal for 2011 was to make those investments but not have cash flow go backwards, and we accomplished that goal. As you look out into 2012 and 2013, we're going to start to hopefully see some of the seeds we planted there bear fruit. We think there's real opportunity in Broadcast. We've said the network is going to take us a number of years to turn around. We had a very good week. Last week, The Voice is one of the top shows in America and, we think, is a franchise that we can help rebuild the network on, but that is going to be a multi-year effort. We also think we can see some improvement in Film, where our Film business has not been doing well. We have a very strong slate in 2012. We think our management team in Film is doing a very good job, and the films that we've seen that will be coming out later this year, we're very optimistic about. Cable Networks are extremely strong from really strength to strength. We have 20 cable networks that are all doing quite well, and we look at those being the core of the company. But we have opportunity there as well. So we're very optimistic, but I also want to caution people that we're still in the early innings of the integration process, and I don't want to get ahead of ourselves in terms of how fast some of these opportunities are going to be realized.","Neil Smit","Concerning the Verizon Wireless rollout, we've rolled out to 4 markets now. We're pleased with the results. We're learning. We're working together. They've been great partners. I think on that front, it's probably early to tell. Concerning new products, in addition to Verizon Wireless, we've got XFINITY Home, our Home Security product, which is going very well and we're rolling out to more markets; Signature Support, which is a higher-end service for customers who need more help; Wi-Fi was already mentioned when I responded to Craig's question; and then our Xcalibur product, our high-end video product which we're branding X1. So those are examples of a number of different products we're rolling out right now.","Brian L. Roberts","More On Demand and more -- the Disney agreement, with other agreements we've got in place and things that we're working on, I think TV Everywhere, whatever you want to brand it, we call it XFINITY, obviously, is you're going to see a lot of progress in 2012 on getting more content available to consumers on more devices than in any year in the company.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Two real quick ones. Maybe first for Neil. Obviously, I think the few Video losses for the fourth quarter's a sort of great harbinger of things to come. I mean, you typically see about 100,000 improvements sequentially in the first quarter, suggesting we're sort of getting to the point where, looking out into 2012 here, you could see potentially subscriber growth, if you could just sort of comment on that. And then maybe for Michael, the $6.5 billion buyback, you're -- just from your answer to Jessica's question. A quick follow-up would be, how did the SpectrumCo cash factor into that? I mean obviously, you could see another $2 billion in cash come by the end of the year. Could that potentially boost 2012 buyback? Or is that why you did the bigger authorization, or is that something that's going to factor into the numbers as we look into 2013?","Neil Smit","John, it's Neil. On the sub-growth question, I mean, as I said earlier, I think we're focused on product innovation and better customer service. I don't think we'll see growth in the first quarter, the quarter where we're taking rate increases, but we're going to stay focused on our priorities, which is really delivering more value to the customers. Michael?","Michael J. Angelakis","Sure. With regards to SpectrumCo and the sale of the Spectrum, it's not incorporated in our financial strategy for 2012. Just want to make that clear. Obviously, we have to close the transaction, which our best guess is in the latter part of the year. So we will utilize that SpectrumCo cash as we think about and evaluate our 2013 return-to-capital strategy. Also, I just want to make sure the $2.3 billion is a pretax number. We have a gain that we have on that. But really, when we think about SpectrumCo, first is let's get the transaction closed. Given what we think the timing of it will be, it will probably be in our 2013 evaluation.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs.","Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe just a follow-up on capital allocation. As we thought about sort of the pacing through last year, the excess cash was devoted towards taking down debt as opposed to refinancing. Is that still sort of the framework to use for 2012? And then question on the programming cost outlook and just maybe some more granularity on the contributors to 2012 being at the higher end of the historical range.","Michael J. Angelakis","Why don't I take the first one on capital allocation? The reality is there's really not going to be that much excess cash. When you think about NBCUniversal's free cash flow, 100% of that is really dedicated to, I would say, sort of indirect equity redemption over time with General Electric. And then when you think about Cable free cash flow, about 90%-plus of that will go to the buyback and the dividend. Obviously, we also have some taxes to pay related to the reversal of the benefits of the economic stimulus. So over time, our view is for 2012, we've got our balance sheet kind of where we want it to be, but there's not going to be really excess liquidity I think is a term you utilized.","Neil Smit","Jason, this is Neil. Concerning the programming increases. I mean, the rates really fluctuate based on renewals an roll-offs. We project for 2012 increases to be in the mid- to high single-digits, probably at the higher end of that range. I think we're getting longer terms and more flexibility in our contracts to deliver what Brian mentioned earlier, which is more content across more devices. I think it's important to note that we've grown Video gross margin dollars on a per-sub basis as we've upgraded to higher levels of service and advanced services. So we're very focused on the business, and we really want to deliver more value to our customers by getting more flexibility in the rights.","Operator","The next question comes from Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A question for Michael or Neil on Cable margins for the year. Given the balance of innovation and investment against efficiency, should we think about the positive impact of political advertising offsetting the faster programming cost growth that's potentially in 2012, so maybe flattish overall Cable margins? And then I did want to follow up on Craig and John's question. I'm not sure in the answer to John's question you said this or not, Neil, but is 1Q '12 sort of for sub growth starting the way 4Q and 2011 ended, if that's a fair question?","Neil Smit","I'll take the sub number, then I'll turn it over to Michael for the margin number. I mean, I think the way I described the first quarter is the trends that we're seeing seem to be sustainable. We've seen very strong response to our offers and we -- in the customer service and the increased value that we're delivering I think customers have responded well to. We've beefed up our channels, whether it's direct marketing or direct sales, and we're executing, I think, pretty well right now. But I think that while we won't grow, we'll be in a close range is the way I described the first quarter, and we're really focused on execution. Michael?","Michael J. Angelakis","Yes. I'll take Cable margins. I think political advertising in 2012 will obviously help, but it's not really going to move our margins, given the size of political advertising versus the size of the overall business. Obviously, it's a benefit. With regards to 2012, don't want to give guidance, but I think we see a little bit of the same versus 2011 is -- the real headwind is on programming costs which you mentioned, but we're going to have some benefits related primarily to product mix. As you can see with high-speed data and with Voice and with Business Services, those are growing really nicely and accretive to margins. So I don't want to give any predictions on margin, but I think stable is a pretty good way to think about it.","Operator","The next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I have 2 and I wanted to come back to the Video business. Brian, maybe you or maybe Neil can comment on X1 or the Xcalibur rollout and put it into context for us. It seems like if you look back over the last 2 years, you've had some major innovations, like DOCSIS 3, Project Infinity, All-Digital. Where does X1 fit into all that? How much of the sort of an experience changer is this for the customer in 2012? How broad do you deploy it? And related to that, I want to just ask about the CapEx outlook maybe for Michael. Intangibles were up in the 2011 year. I think you had about $1 billion, and that might be related to software on the X1 platform. Does your comment about flat CapEx to sales in '12 include intangibles? Does that move that comment around at all? Just want to get a clarification there.","Brian L. Roberts","Okay, Ben, this is Brian. Let me maybe start, and, Neil, if you want, feel free, or Michael can answer that second question. My view is that in 2012, X1 is a beginning of a new way of communicating with the television device which is coming from the cloud, not solely from the box. But it will be in hundreds of thousands of homes. Obviously, that's not tens of millions -- that's not the big number for us. It will be in multiple markets, and we will be stable, and it will radically improve the experience, in my opinion, over time. But more importantly, it is creating the unlocking mechanism to future innovation, which will then reside on the best servers in the cloud that can be upgraded, state-of-the-art, without having to ever come back to your house and can be done quickly, not over years, but over weeks and months. Those UI changes and other things that we want to do as we create better search products and we have the need with more On Demand. And so I think it's got the same kind of long-term strategic implications that some of those other products you've mentioned. In 2012, it's really getting it commercialized in a number of key markets. Another part of the strategy is -- that this accomplishes, is the beginning of allowing us to get on to other devices. We obviously are not operating in a vacuum, and we are very cognizant of the exciting changes in the consumer electronics space. And we want to position our company to take advantage of the innovation, not trying to necessarily fight it and want to make it as simple for our customers as possible, so we have an agreement with Xbox. We're working with Samsung. We'll be working with others throughout the year, and I think our Comcast technology group is doing a super job of changing the way we historically look at how we deliver our products to consumers. And so getting things into the cloud out of the cable box will have broad implications over time, and 2012 is a year to make it happen and get it started.","Michael J. Angelakis","So why don't I take the CapEx and software intangibles question? With regards to Cable CapEx, as I said in the remarks, Ben, I think that you'll see some trending downward in terms of intensity as a percentage of Cable revenue. So the team's done a phenomenal job of managing that. We're investing for growth in a lot of that, as Brian and Neil have mentioned on this call. So I really look at CapEx as trending slightly downward as a percentage of revenue and bringing that intensity a bit down. With regards to software and intangibles, one of the reasons for the increase is, obviously, NBCU now has added to that number and that free cash flow. But you've got to really look at 2 of them combined. As we've talked about and Brian mentioned just now, the Cable business is spending more on the software and areas in the cloud. That's an important investment for us. It allows Neil's team to really increase the speed of innovation, and I think we've got a pretty good number of what we're spending. That's a pretty stable number, sort of in the range. Also, NBCUniversal has been spending a bit on software and intangibles, and that's one of the reasons for the increase. So I think the number for all of 2011 that's in our press release is $954 million. I don't want to get too specific, but that's in the range.","Operator","The next question comes from James Ratcliffe with Barclays Capital.","James M. Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Two quick ones, if I could, on the Cable business. First of all, can you talk a little bit about the relative performance you're seeing on HSI and areas where there -- you face fiber, quasi-fiber competition versus areas where you're going up against standard DSL? And secondly, I know it's early, but any reads or takeaways thus far from the My TV Choice deployments in terms of customer interest and where those customers are coming from?","Neil Smit","James, this is Neil. I think generally speaking, we've performed much better in the DSL markets, and I think that's due to the billions of dollars of investment we've made in the plant. Capacity, we continue to increase, and we just got a -- what we feel is a better product versus DSL. I think generally speaking, in the fiber markets, we're competing well. They're aggressive competitors, as are we, and I think the bundle is a real value proposition. Concerning your second question, My TV Choice, we continue to look at packaging possibilities, and My TV Choice has been a -- we've discovered a lot and learned a lot from that rollout, and we'll continue to experiment. I think that we will look at how we can get more flexibility in packaging and delivering the right package to the right consumers, and that will be a component in that for this year.","Operator","The next question comes from Stefan Anninger with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Stefan Anninger - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Could you comment on how you might evaluate the opportunity to buy out the portion of NBC you don't own today? Of course, your ability to buy out the entire stake in the near term will depend on what GE might decide to do. But assuming that GE would opt to redeem half its stake in 2014, maybe you could discuss how you would think about the opportunity, and would it simply depend on the price of the last, let's say, 25% of the JV you would purchase? Or is there more at work there?","Michael J. Angelakis","Stefan, it's Michael. We're still pretty early days into this. We've owned NBCUniversal now for just over a year. We have really 2.5 years left before we would have to have that discussion, so obviously, we'll learn a lot more then. So we gave a lot of thought to how we structured the transaction with GE. We want to make sure that we retained our flexibility on our capital structure. We want to make sure we retained our flexibility on return of capital. We have, in our view, a pretty attractive carried interest. So I think we are very pleased with how NBCUniversal is performing and also the structure that we put in place with GE. So I really wouldn't want to front-run that. I think that we have to make a decision in a couple of years or 2.5 years, and then we'll revisit it then, and then we'll revisit it again in 6 years. So there's a long, long road here, and for us to alter the structure, I just don't see it right now.","Operator","The last question comes from Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Neil, I just want to get a better understanding of your subscriber performance in the quarter. Do you feel that Comcast is gaining market share? Or is the entire pay-TV sector healthier? And then a follow-up to this. I know in the prepared remarks, there was mention of better churn. I'm just curious if the gross-adds part of the equation is also trending better.","Neil Smit","Marci, I'll answer those in reverse. We had -- churn did improve for each of the 4 quarters on the year, and I think that was due to a few factors. One is, I think the field teams are just executing better on customer service, and they've done a nice job there. And I think that we've built up our retention focus as a channel. And so we're more focused on the offers and the destination pricing for customers who want to churn and for different reasons. I think concerning the -- whether we're gaining market share or not, I mean if we're losing subs, we're not gaining market share, and we don't like to lose subs. So our objective is to grow the business, and I think it's primarily due to the -- we're staying very focused on delivering more value, as Brian mentioned. And the second thing is we're just going to continue to improve customer service. I think we've built the foundation of it, and now we've got to continue to transform it. So I think we're going to continue to drive the business. We're very focused, and I think the teams are executing well. And that will be our focus going forward.","Brian L. Roberts","I just want to just add, Marci, that -- and maybe end the call on this thought, which is, Neil, I think a big part of it is your leadership -- I think the entire Cable team had an outstanding 2011, and part of it is the scale that we have, the ability to make the investments several years ago that are paying dividends now to try to have leading products that perhaps not everybody has. And so I begin -- I think this is several quarters in a row where we're trying to make that XFINITY experience the best in the market. And we may not get back to full growth on Video for a while, because we don't see housing growth at the moment, but someday, that's going to happen. But more importantly, I think this is just terrific execution by the Cable team and sets us up for 2012.","Marlene S.

Please refer to our 8-K and trending schedules for the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.","With that, let me turn the call over to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian?","Brian Roberts","Thank you, Jason, good morning, everyone. This was a great first quarter and an exciting fast start to the new year. Overall, we delivered strong EBITDA and earnings per share growth, as well as robust free cash flow. As you'll hear, this includes the best quarterly EBITDA growth in over 10 years at Cable. Favorable results at NBCUniversal and exceptional growth in customer relationships at both Cable and Sky.","These results combined with the continued, strategic evolution of our company bring into focus why we are so well positioned to successfully compete and grow for the long-term. We have the leading scaled platforms in the key and most attractive markets in the world. The U.S., UK, Germany, and Italy are four of the top 10 markets globally in terms of high value households representing 15% of the world's broadband and video customers, but with about 50% of the world's associated revenues.","Collectively, we are number one by a wide margin in these markets with 54 million customer relationships that generate ARPUs of over $110 with substantial margin and incredible stickiness. We are intensely focused on being the leaders in the markets in which we compete and we achieve this by continuously improving our best-in-class products and experiences. This gives us a sustainable path to growing and deepening our customer relationships for years to come. And our over 400,000 net additions in the first quarter continues our companywide momentum. ","Secondly, we also have leading scale in premium content. We purchase and produce $24 billion of content annually and monetize it through our entertainment, news, and sports networks and across other third party platforms. The first quarter was highlighted by NBCUniversal's. fantastic, theatrical releases and Sky\u2019s differentiated content continues to attract strong viewership with Sky originals representing all of the top five rated shows across its owned and partner entertainment channels. As content creation has many recent entrants, our industry-leading scale is a defining asset.","So let's turn to some more details of the first quarter and the opportunities that lie ahead. Cable Communications delivered an outstanding quarter, including the highest quarterly EBITDA growth in over a decade, even better net cash flow growth and healthy customer relationship growth. Our efforts to improve the customer experience are driving higher customer satisfaction and taking unnecessary activity out of the business. Nearly 80% of customer interactions are now completed digitally. And in the first quarter we reached our lowest service call rate, highest first call resolution rate and shortest repair times on record. These operational achievements are a huge part of the roadmap.","As we previously described, we pivoted the business towards our most important and differentiated product, our industry leading broadband service, which forms the foundation of our valuable relationships with residential and business customers. Our customers\u2019 demand for speed and data usage keeps increasing. Our median broadband home now uses over 200 gigabytes of data per month, an increase of 34% year-over-year, which accelerated from the fourth quarter. ","Our consistent investment in our network, including a capital efficient path to 10 gig speeds in the coming years, we believe we will continue to exceed customer expectations, along with X1, mobile, voice and home security. We continue to develop complimentary products and services to deepen these data centric relationships. Most recently we launched Flex, which adds value for broadband-only customers by integrating a wide variety of favorite streaming apps and leveraging some of the best features of the X1 platform, like our voice remote and the ability to manage connected devices on the big screen. Overall, with lots of runway ahead and our connectivity businesses, we are confident in our outlook for continued healthy customer and net cash flow growth at Cable.","At NBCUniversal, our first quarter performance demonstrates the power of our premier content portfolio. Adjusting for the profitable broadcast of the Superbowl and Winter Olympics during last year's first quarter, NBCUniversal EBITDA increased by double digits. Film had a tremendous quarter including the theatrical releases of DreamWorks' How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World and the thriller, Us. We're looking forward to the second Secret Life of Pets, as well as Hobbs and Shaw from the Fast and Furious franchise later this year. ","At Television, underlying trends remained healthy reflecting demand for our must see entertainment, sports and news content. NBC is on track to finish in first place among adults 18 to 49 for the 52-week season for the sixth consecutive year and has four out of the top 10 entertainment shows on broadcast this season more than any other network. MSNBC also continues its impressive success leading CNN by more than 50% with the narrowest gap to Fox News in over 15 years in total viewership. These highlights throughout our content portfolio bode well for NBCUniversal's direct-to-consumer launch.","Each company seems to be pursuing different opportunities as the streaming ecosystem evolves. And we really like our plan, which naturally leans towards the wonderful strengths across all of Comcast. Together NBC and our cable networks have leading viewership share and consumers love Universal's films, library in many content franchises. Advertisers are eager for targeted digital advertising opportunities, and the kinds of top quality shows we produce and our ad sales capabilities and organization are the best in the industry.","So our DTC service will be positioned to gain scale quickly as it will leverage the current pay TV ecosystem, including our own tens of millions of valuable customer relationships. We also have scaled IP video capabilities and infrastructure, including the Now TV OTT platform developed by Sky, which will greatly accelerate our efforts. The entire company is energized by this new initiative.","Turning to Sky, we remain confident in our strategy of differentiation through unique content leading to a sustained, attractive, competitive position. With a wide range of innovative products and packages Sky is in a great position to continue to expand its addressable market, leveraging the strength of its brand. In the quarter, we had robust subscriber growth adding over 100,000 net new customers, while it's expected new proprietary sports rights deals impacted our profitability.","As we begin this new chapter of our combined company, it's early days, but we are finding significant areas for collaboration. A couple of notable examples as quarter included the expansion of AdSmart, bringing together NBCUniversal's, advanced targeting solutions and Sky\u2019s addressable advertising tools in a first step towards creating a global premium video offering for advertisers. We also announced plans to combine key NBCUniversal and Sky assets including some European TV channels and global content distribution businesses which will provide better scale to accelerate growth and innovation. And we are also exploring launching a global NBC Sky News Channel later this year.","So in summary, we're off to a terrific start in 2019 highlighted in particular by momentum and broadband and business services which drove Cable to its fastest level of quarterly EBITDA growth in years. I'm really pleased with both our execution in the first quarter and our strategic positioning of the company for the future. We have world-class global content creation capabilities and our growing base of over 54 million recurring customer relationships is built around highly differentiated products and capabilities, our powerful broadband network at Comcast Cable and Sky\u2019s unique market position.","Over to you Mike. ","Mike Cavanagh","Thanks Brian and good morning everyone. I'll begin on Slide 4 with our first quarter consolidated results. As a reminder, we completed our acquisition of Sky in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our reported results include Sky from the acquisition date while pro forma results are as if the Sky transaction had occurred on January 1, 2017.","And now for the numbers, revenue increased 18% to $26.9 billion on a reported basis and decreased 3.3% on a pro forma basis primarily due to the comparison to our successful broadcast of the Super Bowl and Winter Olympics in last year's first quarter.","Adjusted EBITDA increased 18% to $8.6 billion on a reported basis and 6.4% on a pro forma basis. These results reflect exceptional growth at Cable and growth at NBCUniversal, despite the tough comparison to the prior year, partially offset by a decline at Sky do the timing of new sports rights cost. Adjusted earnings per share increase 17% to $0.76. And finally, we generated $4.6 billion of free cash flow in the quarter.","Now let's turn to our segment results starting with Cable Communications on Slide 5. Overall, Cable delivered a very strong first quarter, highlighted by profitable growth and great customer metrics driven by our connectivity businesses and ongoing improvements in the customer experience. Cable revenue increased 4.2% to $14.3 billion. EBITDA increased 9.8% to $5.7 billion. And net cash flow increased 25% to $4 billion.","Customer relationships grew 3.6% year-over-year, including 300,000 net additions in the first quarter. On a per relationship basis, EBITDA increased 6% and net cash flow grew 20%. These results now include Xfinity Mobile, which was previously reported in our corporate segment in both the current and prior year periods. Excluding wireless, in both periods, Cable revenue increased 4% and EBITDA increased 7.9% in the first quarter.","Now let's get into the details of the quarter. As our impressive first quarter results clearly demonstrate, the engine of growth for our Cable business is broadband, where we are very well positioned competitively through the strength of our network and our differentiation on the basis of speed, coverage and control.","Residential high-speed internet revenue was again the largest contributor to overall Cable growth, increasing 10% to $4.6 billion. This reflects a healthy balance of customer growth and higher revenue per customer. Our residential broadband customer base increased 5% year-over-year to over 25 million, including 352,000 net additions in the first quarter and our average revenue per customer grew nearly 5%. Notably, retention is the best on record.","Turning to our other connectivity business, business services revenue increased 9.5% to $1.9 billion. Customer relationships grew 5.4% year-over-year including 25,000 net additions in the first quarter. Revenue per business customer increased by 3.8%, these results reflect the demand for our core connectivity services across small, medium, and enterprise customer segments. We also continue to enhance our offering with complementary solutions that deepen our relationships with commercial customers and drive additional value. We are seeing encouraging uptake of these services including advanced Wifi, video surveillance, wireless backup and SD-WAN. In total our connectivity businesses generated $6.5 billion of revenue and grew nearly 10% in the first quarter and we expect to grow at equally strong levels for the full year.","Turning to our video business, in a highly competitive market, our residential video subscriber base declined 1.7% year-over-year consistent with recent quarterly trends and including net losses of 107,000 in the first quarter, resulting in a slight decrease in revenue. Video continues to play an important role in the bundle. We remain focused on driving video on segments we can serve profitably leading with our best-in-class X1 platform for customers who want a premium experience and the most content choices.","For customers who are primarily interested in streaming video content. We are leveraging the investments we've made in X1 to deliver our new Flex service, which provides a compelling platform and unique voice search capabilities for customers to use apps like Netflix, YouTube and Amazon Prime Video underscoring the value of our broadband service.","Now to wrap up with our newest addition to the Cable segment Xfinity Mobile, wireless generated $225 million of revenue compared to $185 million of revenue in last year's first quarter. This growth was driven by an increase in our customer base, partially offset by lower handset sales. We ended the quarter with 1.4 million customer lines up by 828,000 year-over-year including 170,000 net additions in the first quarter. The majority of customers are choosing our Buy the Gig Plan and we are seeing a significant increase in the uptake of Bring Your Own Device, both of which deliver great value to customers and benefit our economics. These factors along with the scale benefits we are seeing as our base grows at a relatively steady pace are contributing to improvement in our wireless EBITDA losses, which totaled $103 million compared to $189 million in last year's first quarter.","Moving now to Cable expense and margin detail on Slide 6, to start I\u2019d note that while costs associated with Xfinity Mobile are now included in each of our non-programming expense categories. The bulk of these costs fall into the tech and product support expense category as this is where our MVNO costs and mobile handset costs are housed. Overall, total Cable expenses increased about 1% in the first quarter, driven by 2.8% growth in programming expenses, non-programming expenses decreased slightly and decreased 4% on a per relationship basis.","Notably, customer service expense was down 2.3% even as our customer base grew 3.6%. Our ongoing focus on improving the customer experience and offering more digital service tools continues to pay-off in the form of higher customer satisfaction and a reduction in unnecessary activity and the associated costs. As Brian mentioned, nearly 80% of our interactions are now being completed digitally while both truck rolls and calls handled by our agents decreased nearly 10% in the first quarter. These expense results coupled with robust revenue growth resulted in EBITDA margins of 40.1% in the first quarter, up 200 basis points year-over-year including wireless in both periods.","For the full year, we now expect up to 100 basis points of year-over-year margin improvement compared to 2018\u2019s margin of 38.7%. This is an increase from our original guidance for up to 50 basis points of improvement in 2019. Cable capital expenditures decreased 19% to $1.4 billion leading to capital expenditure intensity of 9.5% in the first quarter, partially reflecting the timing of our spending. For the full year, we continue to expect 50 basis points of year-over-year improvement in capital expenditure intensity compared to 13.8% in 2018 which has been restated to include wireless revenue and capital expenditures.","I\u2019d note that our MVNO approach to mobile is very capital light and so the amount of wireless capital expenditures is immaterial both in the prior year and our 2019 guidance. We are confident in our ability to deliver another year of healthy growth in Cable in 2019 and our first quarter results show we are off to a great start.","With that, I'll turn to NBCUniversal's results on Slide 7. NBCUniversal revenue decreased 12% to $8.3 billion and EBITDA increased 2.9% to $2.3 billion, primarily reflecting the difficult comparison to our profitable broadcast of the Super Bowl and Winter Olympics, partially offset by a strong quarter at Filmed Entertainment. As a reminder, the Super Bowl and Winter Olympics generated $1.6 billion of incremental revenue at our TV businesses in last year's first quarter.","Cable Networks revenue decreased 9.2% to $2.9 billion and EBITDA increased 0.7% to $1.3 billion. Excluding $378 million of revenue associated with the Winter Olympics last year, revenue increased 3.2% driven by distribution and advertising revenue growth. Distribution revenue increased 6.8% reflecting the ongoing benefits of previous renewal agreements and a modest decline in subscribers. Advertising revenue increased 2% benefiting from overall higher pricing, robust demand at MSNBC and healthy NHL results partially offset by ratings declines.","Content licensing revenue decreased 12% due to the timing of content delivered under our licensing agreements. We continue to see strong and growing demand for our studio's content overall and with the upcoming launch of our own direct-to-consumer service. We'll have more ways than ever to maximize the value of our content.","Broadcast revenue decreased 29% to $2.5 billion and EBITDA decreased 24% to $387 million. Excluding revenue of $770 million from the Winter Olympics and $423 million from the Super Bowl, broadcast revenue increased 7.1%. Retrans revenue increased by about 20% to $495 million. Content licensing revenue increased by 7.2%. Advertising revenue grew 2.6%, reflecting overall higher pricing and strength in our entertainment and sports properties, partially offset by a decline in ratings.","Filmed Entertainment revenue increased 7.4% to $1.8 billion and EBITDA increased 79% to $364 million reflecting an 11% increase in content licensing revenue and including a successful quarter of theatrical releases. Theatrical revenue increased 5% driven by the box office performances of How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World and Us. We look forward to another animated sequel with The Secret Life of Pets 2 hitting theaters in June and the return of our Fast and Furious franchise with Hobbs & Shaw later this year.","Finally, at Theme Parks, revenue and EBITDA were both relatively flat at $1.3 billion and $498 million respectively. This in part reflects the impact of spring holiday timing, which benefited the first quarter of last year but falls in the second quarter of this year. Excluding this impact EBITDA would have grown by low single digits. Towards the end of the second quarter, we will be opening a new Hagrid-themed Harry Potter rollercoaster and the first phase of our Endless Summer Resort in Orlando as well as a new Jurassic World attraction in Hollywood. Looking ahead, we have a robust pipeline of new attractions which includes Nintendo coming to our parks starting with Japan in 2020 and the opening of our new Beijing park in 2021.","Moving on to Sky pro forma results on Slide 8, as I said earlier, these results are as if we own Sky as of January 1, 2017. In addition, the growth rates I will refer to in this section are on a constant currency basis. In the first quarter, revenue at Sky increased 1.9%. Content revenue grew 38%, reflecting the monetization of Sky\u2019s exclusive sports rights, premium channels and original programming. We added 112,000 net new customer relationships in the first quarter with growth in each of our markets.","Direct-to-Consumer and Advertising revenues were both relatively consistent with the prior year, EBITDA decreased a 11% in the first quarter reflecting the increased in-programming costs from new contracts for expanded Serie A and Champions League Soccer rights in Italy and Germany which will lap in the second half of this year while at the same time a new lower cost EPL contract begins.","We also anticipate benefiting for the remainder of the year from the price increases in the UK that went into effect in April. It's been seven months since the end of the Sky auction and we couldn't be off to a better start in the ways our teams across Sky, NBCUniversal and Cable are working together. Among the exciting initiatives already underway, our Sky NOW TV team support our NBC\u2019s direct-to-consumer service. The expansion of AdSmart, the integration of NBC\u2019s European channels with Sky. The integration of Sky Vision with NBC\u2019s Global TV distribution, the enhancement of Sky\u2019s products with Cable\u2019s xFi and voice technology, the leveraging of each other's content by sharing Universal films and TV shows as well as Sky Sports and NBC\u2019s Sports network programming and the collaboration in news, on event coverage and the launch of Sky News on X1.","So wrapping up on Slide 9 with free cash flow and our balance sheet, we generated $4.6 billion of free cash flow in the first quarter and paid dividends totaling $869 million. Pro Forma net leverage was 3.2 times at the end of the first quarter. We're making good progress on deleveraging and remain on track with the leverage commitments we made with the ratings agencies.","In closing, as you can see in our first quarter results, we are off to a great start to the year and strategically well positioned for future growth with leadership and valuable customer relationships, a highly differentiated broadband network and world class content. Our team's collaboration across the business makes us even stronger, which further supports our excitement about the opportunities ahead for Comcast. With that, I'll turn it back to Jason.","Jason Armstrong","Okay, thanks Mike. Regina, let's open up the call for Q&A please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jessica Reif Ehrlich","Thank you. I guess two questions. One, how is the company view evolving for direct-to-consumer both for your own service and for the cable company, given the onslaught of coming services, not just your own but Apple, Disney, Warner? And then separately, can you \u2013 is there anything that you could say on like long-term intentions with Hulu? Thanks. ","Brian Roberts","Let me start and then kick it over to Steve and Dave maybe. I think that we start with the central view that streaming is going to happen, video over the Internet is more friend than foe and we wish every bit was our bit, but if people consume more bits and video clearly does that. And 4K video does even more than that. That\u2019s in the sweet spot of where this company is going to grow.","In terms of the cable effect for the cable company again we've now integrated Amazon, and we've integrated Netflix and we deliver more Amazon and Netflix, I believe, to our customer homes, the number one way to receive it in our footprint and our customer homes. And that it's a deep, successful, beautiful, elegant integration that the tech teams have done at both companies. And we've done that with you YouTube. And you can imagine that we'll do that again with others as the world continues to evolve.","Dave, do you want to talk a little more? ","Dave Watson","Yes. Well as Brian had said we think that Internet delivered video is a good thing for the Cable doesn't. When you look at where the usage is on the broadband network, the median monthly data usage for our resi business is over 200 gigabytes and this is increasing at 34% year-over-year in the quarter. So it's clearly critical to have a fantastic broadband network. And I think it really showcases for us this differentiated network and broadband. But while broadband is crucial delivering the experience for all these apps, as Brian said too, the X1 platform is uniquely positioned to tie up all of this together. ","I've heard and you\u2019ve read different stories about just how complicated it can be for the consumer. We think X1 is just a fantastic platform, it gives us the ability to combine everything, live, DVR, on-demand and these apps in such a unique way using the voice. So I think that those two things, I think, give us a great position as we go forward in this landscape.","Brian Roberts","On Hulu the relationship with NBC that is very much in everybody's interest to maintain. And where have no new news today on it other than it's really valuable. And we're really glad we own a large piece of it. And Steve, do you want to add anything there?","Steve Burke","So Jessica, let me give you an update on the NBCU streaming service that we're developing. First of all, our feeling is, and it's interesting watching, you watch CNBC, you would assume that streaming is all of the entrants are in and it's a big battle between two or three of them. We actually think is very, very early innings and in some ways reminiscent of Cable in the 1970s or 1980s. And we think there will be a lot of entrants and a lot of companies will try to enter with their own unique strengths leveraging their own unique assets. And so you're starting to see that.","In our case NBC is the number one broadcast channel. We have a huge portfolio of cable channels. And if you add up all of our rating points, more people watch our channels than any other media companies\u2019 channels. And then not surprisingly, we're the number one provider of television advertising in the country. So we think those are strengths. We also think the fact that Comcast Cable and Sky have over 50 million direct relationships. Building direct relationships with customers is a real strength. So our approach, which we think is very interesting and different is to take thousands of hours of great programming and make it free to the vast majority of people who live in the United States or the UK eventually. And we think that's a way to get real scale quickly. And we think that's a way to achieve profitability more quickly than we would otherwise.","So we've taken, as Brian and Mike mentioned in their introductions, we've taken the Now TV executive team, two of the most senior people at Sky working on that project now live in the United States. And we have hundreds of other people working on rights, and technology, and all the things you need to do to set up the service. And in about a year we plan to enter in this unique way and we see a lot of people entering. And we think there is plenty of room for multiple companies in different strategies to make money. And we look at it as a real opportunity. Given all the content we have and the real strengths we have, we look at this as a way to grow our company and power our company for decades to come.","Jessica Reif Ehrlich","Thank you. ","Brian Roberts","Thanks Jessica. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you. Good morning. I just want to start on Cable another quarter, where not just customer growth strengths but also continued margin performance. Dave, you guys have had, I think, your non-programming OpEx has been coming down on a per customer basis now for awhile. Can you talk a little about the drivers of that and whether you see opportunity to continue Dave and or Mike to drive this kind of leverage in the business even as you grow your customer count so much?","And then just coming back to sort of the shifting streaming landscape maybe for Jeremy, Disney\u2019s role laid out a plan to roll out their product in Western Europe next year, we don't know about Warner's international plans. I'm sure we'll hear about that later this year. How do you \u2013 how should we think about Sky's position in Europe to the extent these rights move away from you? I guess if you see that as a risk or how you may redeploy capital into your own studio production? Just talk about Sky's position in Europe and how you think about the shifting landscape on the supply side?","Brian Roberts","Let\u2019s start with Dave.","Dave Watson","Yes. Alright, thanks Ben. So on non-programming OpEx we've said we have a long-term game plan and the key drivers for us starts with transforming the customer experience and the customer's digital capability. And when we do that, we're going to take out unnecessary transactions and associated costs out of the business and this is happening. It's good for the customer. And it\u2019s the right way for us to run the business. And so we think that there is still significant room to improve our performance in taking out these unnecessary transactions. But at the same time, customer experiences are only part of the non-programming OpEx, some of the costs are success based and some you'll see perhaps some increases based on higher volume of sales activity like on the mobile side handset cost. ","And we're going to continue to invest and grow on the experience. But what we're seeing, I think, is a reflection of our focus of just being very disciplined around cost and the customer experience. So it could be some lumpiness in any given quarter, I like our momentum in reducing the transactions. And if you combine what Mike was talking about the combination of this focus on the connectivity business and then with the \u2013 or focus on taking these cost out, you're seeing the margin improvement that Mike talked about up to a 100 basis points. So we like our momentum.","Ben Swinburne","Great. ","Brian Roberts","Jeremy?","Jeremy Darroch","Yes, sure. So Ben I'll feel really good about our position. I think that Sky's position in Europe is proved as you've seen to be very successful and durable in a variety of environments its anchored off our brand leadership in all of our markets. Our range and reach I don't think any business in Europe can reach as many customers through the broader platform as we can. And we've got really strong market positions.","We\u2019ve got very broad content as you know, across all the major genres, pretty much across of all the major providers. I don't think people are going to say \u2013 any of the business probably has the breath and range of content that we've got. And as you know, we stepped in early to really dismantle the big bundle almost 10 years ago now in Sky. So we have \u2013 we've really moved our base already your way and right size much of our base and of course we were early into streaming with Now TV.","So it's no surprise to me that business like Netflix, for example, want to be on Sky because they see that as one of the ways that they'll continue to grow the base across Europe. So I feel good about that basic market possession. I think the second thing I'd say about Europe, given that we've got such a strong free to air sector here is the other capabilities of DTC away from platforms, the ability to sell products, reach customers, compete against good free services and then keep the product sold, that's very acute here. And I think we're in a good place there. ","I think our relationships will evolve, of course with our partners. I don't feel there's any single partner that we need to keep on the platform. And as part of that continuing to invest in our own channels and content has been a key theme and will be a theme for us going forward. So this quarter alone, the Sky channels or Sky originals, as Brian mentioned, outperformed all of the pay TV providers in our markets.","So as always, it'll be disruptive to an extent I think. But I think if you look at our hand and all the assets we've got, we're going to be in a good place to navigate and continue to thrive in that environment.","Ben Swinburne","Thanks guys.","Brian Roberts","Thank you, Ben. Next question please. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John Hodulik","Okay, thanks. Can we talk a little bit about competition in traditional video? Do you guys think you're benefiting from the follow-up we're seeing at AT&T and maybe the price increases on the streaming side? And then correspondingly, do you think that gives a boost to the broadband market?","And then maybe similar question but on the NBC side, you talked about modest declines in subs. I think over the last few quarters you've talked about sub improvement or improving sub trends on your fully distributed networks. Are you seeing those trends worsen or how would you think of trends on that side? Thanks.","Dave Watson","Hey John this is Dave. So look, the video category remains a very competitive one. And it's little early to gage any impact from some of the moves from either virtual competitors or the SVODs, but they\u2019re still all competing. A sheer number of them as Steve mentioned too there are some new ones coming in. So it's a very competitive category. But having said that, I think, we're competing very effectively with discipline to not chase on profitable relationships. And X1 is a great long-term, terrific platform that as I mentioned before, that integrates live on demand DVR apps and will continue to be an important part of our go-to-market packaging approach.","So we're going to compete for the segments that really matter, we're going to leverage our X1 platform, we'll see where the video market goes. But what's happening is to your question broadband is the centerpiece of our packaging and we drove 300,000 total customer relationships. Broadband is the real driver behind that, are ending with 31 million relationships, which is up 3.6% year-over-year.","So we're, I think, doing a good job managing the business. We're still going to compete in video. But our overall net results, I think, reflect the strategy.","Brian Roberts","Before we jumped to Steve, I just would add to that point that probably a difference between us and some of the others that you reference is that's the strength of this great network and the model we've got between business services and consumers. If a customer doesn't choose to want to buy one of our video products, they're buying our broadband at a better rate than we might have anticipated years ago. And that's where the shift that we're talking about is playing to our strength. The higher margin, ultimately increasing revenues at the double digit that Mike talked about for the broadband business is pretty exceptional.","So getting that mix right, not holding on to the wrong customers too long allows us to free up the broadband business and that's where the flex product looks like strategically we've now set a course for years to come that anticipates the change that is happening in the market. And that that's where I want \u2013 Dave you're doing a great job.","Steve Burke","So from the perspective of NBCUniversal and sub trends, we've said, I think, maybe three or four calls in a row that we thought that virtual MVPD sort of growth was probably unsustainable and that's proven to be the case. I think as a number of people who have come in a virtual MVPD universe, they had promotional pricing or big launch plans and they would gain a fair amount of subs. And actually at one point the gain on the virtual MVPD side pretty much offset the loss on the traditional MVPD side. That trend, I think, is over. I think we were right that people came in and now they're raising prices, and pulling back and redirecting. And what you're seeing is that the virtual MVPD growth is slowing.","And there's nothing really dramatic on the traditional MVPD side. The erosion is pretty much the same as it's been, you just have a lower number of virtual MVPD net ads. And I think that's going to continue. I think we all believe that's a quite challenged business model and there was a bit of excitement as everybody rushed into the business over the last year or so. And that excitement now is going away.","John Hodulik","Got it, thanks guys.","Brian Roberts","Thank you, John. Next question please. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. ","Phil Cusick","Hey guys, thanks. One follow-up and a new question. First on the Cable margin following-up it seems like even the new guide of up to 200 basis points seems conservative, anything coming in costs later in the year that we should be thinking about?","And then second Sky revenue growth in local of only 2% year-over-year looks like a significant slowdown. Was there a timing comp issue in the UK price increase? And then recognizing that April price increase, should we expect that to be enough to return local growth toward last year\u2019s 4%? Thanks.","Mike Cavanagh","This is Mike I\u2019ll start and then give it to Jeremy. So on the up 100 basis points improvement in margin, I think, that's what you should count on. I think one quarter it's a great start to the year. The trends that we've seen in the business of continued mix shift to broadband and control of programming and non-programming costs will continue to be the story, but one quarter at a time. And I'd point you to the guidance that we gave today up a 100. Jeremy you want to hit Sky?","Jeremy Darroch","Yes, sure. So, yes, in terms of our quarter, year-over-year revenue growth, there were a couple of one-time effects there. We have fewer pay-per-view events. That was a bit of a drag, this year and then we also launched Sky on the Sky on the DTT network last year and that is a lower ARPU revenue business, which will cost, so it's very, very additive and attractive as a business for us, a bit of a drag.","You're right to say there's really no effect at all of a 5% price increase in the UK and that will come through as we move forward. So we would expect our revenue growth to improve from here and that will continue as we go through the \u2013 and broadly moves to the sort of number. The final thing to say is probably in Europe, as you know, the macro environment is bit more challenging in Europe. So the overall ad market in Europe was weak in the first quarter.","We significantly outperformed that, because our channels are doing so well. We'd expect that trend to continue, but given the political uncertainty, things like Brexit, we'll have to see how the total ad market goes as we move through the rest of the financial year.","Phil Cusick","Understood. Thanks guys.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks Phil. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Craig Moffett","Hi. Thank you, two questions if I could. Steve, just if I can stay with this topic of direct-to-consumer and does sort of the response to what Jeremy laid out, they articulated a pretty clear path for what it's going to cost as well as what the strategy is. I am wondering if you could just give some broad guidelines to how you think your own strategy will affect spending levels and your licensing revenues over the next couple of years. And then just on the Cable side, I wonder if you could just talk about capital intensity, I know there are reasons not to get too excited about today's number just because of some pull forward in CPE in last quarter. But this really is a sort of very different level of Cable capital intensity that we've ever seen before and I'm wondering if that sort of informs your view of long-term capital intensity, whether it's any different than what you've said in the past?","Steve Burke","So on the direct-to-consumer capital and spending and everything else, we have a lot of people working on it, but we're not going to give any numbers for the obvious competitive reasons. And we'll leave it with that.","Mike Cavanagh","Hey Craig, so as you said capital intensity can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, so sticking with expecting 50 basis points of improvement in capital expenditure intensity in 2019 is right. I think the main drivers are very consistent we said this awhile ago what was happening, anticipated this and so it's the decline in video CPE spending but with a very consistent focus on investing in a connectivity side of business and so don't provide the guidance much beyond what we just said. But we expect the trends to continue.","I look at the investment and the infrastructure, business services is just such a great growth engine. We will continue to do the right things in the marketplace and capital and increase passings and lines. The business services team is doing a great job, getting return on all of those investments.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks Craig. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Doug Mitchelson","Thanks so much. So, a couple of questions. First\u2026","Jason Armstrong","Doug. Hey Doug, we can't hear you?","Doug Mitchelson","[indiscernible]","Jason Armstrong","Hey Doug, we still can't hear you.","Doug Mitchelson","Sorry about that, can you hear me?","Jason Armstrong","We can now, yes start over.","Doug Mitchelson","Just updating the wireless strategy. So, obviously strong profit improvement year-over-year a bit better than we expected what this suggest for ROIs and a path to profitability. Is the pace of improvement sustainable and what drove that and is wireless delivery, the churn you\u2019d hoped for and over on NBC, you Steve, any predictions going to the upfront, what are advertisers telling you about their spending plans, given this balance of high scatter pricing, but also a lot of ratings declines across the universe? Thanks.","Mike Cavanagh","So, I'll just say it's Mike, I'll start on \u2013 we're starting to see on mobile the benefit of scaling up the business. And so that's we've been talking about that for a while, and waiting and watching for it. So you're seeing that in year-over-year with the improvement of about 180 million of losses to around just over 100 of losses. Going forward, I think we sustain that scale. We're really pleased Dave can comment on how the business is performing. But quarter-to-quarter it'll be driven a lot by volumes and we like the volumes we\u2019ve got in this quarter, particularly in light of what we see from the industry overall and that's part of what you see here, but we're starting to see the benefits of scale is the short story on the financials.","Dave Watson","Yes. So we're happy with the mobile results today, including this first quarter, especially within the context of seasonality and our overall strategy. So 170,000 net additions, pretty solid and ending with 1.4 million lines. And it's early and I\u2019ve mentioned it before, but we are seeing some improvement in retention and that's exactly one of our top goals were.","We wanted to increase consideration of other products. We're seeing movement in certain sales channels, retail for example, where people coming in and thinking about broadband and mobile is helping that. And last, Mike was mentioning, maintaining positive standalone wireless economics when we reached scale, I think we're on track.","Mike Cavanagh","So we're a few weeks out from the upfront and I think all of the indications are at least for us it's going to be a very strong upfront. I think the economy in the United States, the economy is quite strong. Our channels, NBC is ending the year, number one, MSNBC is beating CNN at night and the Telemundo is beating Univision. So we have a lot of inherent channel strength.","And then we're bringing a lot of new technology and a lot of new ways of thinking about spending on digital and interactive technology, et cetera to the market. And then finally you mentioned the scatter market, the scatter market for many, many quarters has been up 30% and sometimes 40% and that is just a very consistent strength. And the reality is, there's more and more places to spend on digital, but television remains a platform for big companies that want to change people's brand perceptions that you just can't find on the Internet. And so I think it is very likely to be a strong upfront and we're right there. We're heading into it in a few weeks.","Doug Mitchelson","Great. Thank you both.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks Doug. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wolf Research. Please go ahead.","Marci Ryvicker","Thank you. I have two questions, Brian. You mentioned the Comcast in total spent $24 billion annually on producing and purchasing content. Do you have, how much of that is related to sports? And then second for Steve as the speed and groups get bigger, is there any change in conversations when it comes to reverse comp? Thank you.","Brian Roberts","Marci, I don't have that off the top of my head. We'll get back to with whatever been disclosed on that and we'll try to sum that up. But I think the point in making this statement, just to put it in context is the scale of this company and the questions and the conversation that we've been having here, it just dawns on me that the steps we've taken, I feel great about it.","Sitting here today with the global world that is interconnected more than ever, technology allowing that, what's our growth, what's our strategy. And you take those top four geographies that's where the best customers reside, you want to have content opportunities in those countries. And the $24 billion shows that's not Dave Watson buying Cable service. That's our production or sports spend, our purchase from making films and you put that together that puts us first or second biggest producer of content.","You have all these new platforms that want that content and we have the very best team making that content and now doing that in a number one position in Europe, it makes us just that much of a greater company. And then the 54 million homes that having only 25% market share, but that's far in a way bigger than anybody else. But 25% although in those four countries we represent the revenue and the business relationships is at fantastic position for this company. So it's the scale and its cross content and distribution that I think we were trying to highlight.","Brian Roberts","So let me just quickly address the reverse comp question. Explain it a little bit for those of you who don't follow it. So in the 25% of the United States where we have NBC stations, we get retransmission consent and keep all of it. In the 75% of the United States where we don't have NBC stations but do have affiliates, we keep over half of the retransmission consent in a form that we call reverse comp and the reality is that has become a very substantial operating cash flow generator for the company.","And we \u2013 literally, every single one of our affiliates we've entered into deals with and I think our affiliates will acknowledge if you look at eyeballs \u2013 or really any way you measure it, advertising anything else, the network brings over half the value to a local station and the value of that local station as an asset would change dramatically without the network affiliation. So I don't think any of the changes on the M&A side are going to affect reverse comp in the future and I think being an NBC affiliate has been a very good thing over the last six years.","Marci Ryvicker","Great. Thank you.","Jason Armstrong","Thank you, Marci. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Bazinet","Can I just go back to Mr. Robert's comments around that $24 billion? I think there's a little bit of an asymmetry that the market perceives in that, for an attacker like Netflix, when you produce or purchase, it's viewed as fungible dollars. But for someone that's more than the incumbent position like yourself those are not viewed as fungible. And so my question is, is there an explicit sort of idea inside Comcast to pivot more of the dollars towards production and reduce the purchase, so that you would have the flexibility to make them more aggressive DTC push over time? Thanks.","Brian Roberts","Yes, I think, you know what Steve said earlier, we're going to keep our powder dry for another day to talk about more specifics than what we've already laid out. I would think, again, the point is as we see new entrants, we\u2019re just reminding people the breadth of this company and also, I guess our philosophy that it doesn't all have to be on one platform to be successful. There are a lot of different strategies and particularly, when you do that on a global basis.","So, we go from the number one broadcast network to frankly the great portfolio of Cable channels. Universal having its most successful three years in the last three years I think, or three of the top four years and having a great start to this year. Sky, already said they're going to do more of their own productions and the top five shows, were all Sky produced. You can see some trends and draw your own conclusions and we'll have more to talk about in the future.","Jason Bazinet","Thank you very much.","Jason Armstrong","Okay. Thanks Jason. We'll take one final question.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Vijay Jayant","Thanks. Now that you've owned Sky for a little over six months, can you give any update on the 500 million synergy, the thing think you had called out and how that's tracking or is there a bigger opportunity there? And then, you also talked about the Flex product being sort of a new frontier. Is that a product that's only going to be in your broadband footprint or is that something you could set a license out or rather sell outside the footprint and really give the benefit of the extended experience to other cord cutters? Thanks.","Mike Cavanagh","Vijay, it\u2019s Mike I'll start. So 500 synergies, we've said, I'll say it again, we're on track and we'll get those over time couple of years mix as we said of expenses and revenues. So project, against all that are underway and you'll see that in Sky's numbers, but also spread around the company broadly since the teams across the place working on all that.","So I feel good about the synergies, but I'd say more importantly, feel very good about owning Sky and as we said, it's about what Sky is onto itself that is attractive there and it's got great market position as Jeremy's described and you can pile on. But I think the list of work that both Brian and I've mentioned earlier, I won't repeat it, but it really cuts across the way Sky, NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable connect with each other, I think it is upside over the longer term for many years to come.","That'll make us a better and stronger company, and reach as many consumers as we've called out across the best markets in the world. Jeremy, I don't know if you want to add. Sorry.","Jeremy Darroch","Well, I just thought a couple of things, these are bit non-specific, but I think they're important. I mean it seems to me these businesses are of such size, the fact that we've, seven months in, integrated well, I can tell you that the people in the Sky easily feel very comfortable like our new colleagues are excited about the future. That in and of itself, that's a good thing to have gone under our belt. So I don't think there'd be any sort of balls dropped in the immediate transition and that's important.","And then secondly, I think sort of big picture, my assessment is that broadly we wake up in the morning thinking about the same things. We're all trying to do the same things together and therefore in a fast changing world, while you've just got to believe that the ability to move quickly and decisively have a broader set of views and do single things, more commonly across the organization, across the markets that Brian talked to you about is going to lead to advantage is my view.","So I think both of those things, there have been non-specific, but I think they're important nevertheless.","Mike Cavanagh","Vijay this is Dave on Flex. Flex is available in our Cable footprint right now and but consistent with our approach with X1 where we have syndication partners that have X1 and they market in their footprints. There's a lot of excitement around Flex as well. So we're in discussions with our partners around Flex as well. I think as Brian said its important long-term product. I think we're going to be using in the early stages in a targeted fashion, helping broadband, but it's a great platform to build broader video relationships as well. So we're excited about this in our footprint, but we'll be talking with other partners down the road.","Jason Armstrong","Okay. Thank you. Vijay and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Regina, we will wrap up the call at this point.","Operator","There will be a replay available of today's call starting at 12:00 PM Eastern Time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Finance, Mr. Jason Armstrong. Please go ahead, Mr. Armstrong.","Jason S.

Please refer to our 8-K and trending schedules for the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.","Turning to today's materials, we'll be doing things a bit differently with two segments to this call. First, as usual, Brian Roberts and Mike Cavanagh will make prepared remarks covering our third quarter earnings, after which they will be joined by Steve Burke and Dave Watson for a Q&A session related to our results. Then, we will move to a discussion of our recent acquisition of Sky with Jeremy Darroch, the CEO of Sky, joining Brian for a slide presentation, followed by Q& A.","With that, let me turn the call to Brian Roberts to review our third quarter 2018 results. Brian?","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone.","This is a really exciting time for our company, as we are so pleased to have completed the acquisition of Sky, and today we look forward to talking more about that, which we'll do in a little bit. But let me first turn to our strong third quarter results and the many key achievements that I'd like to highlight.","Cable's EBITDA growth of 7.6% was the fastest in six years, and net cash flow increased by 15.6%, the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. This impressive financial performance reflects the pivot we've made to our connectivity businesses, which have higher margins and lower capital intensity.","In addition, we surpassed 30 million customer relationships, as year-over-year growth accelerated to over 3%. Customer relationship net adds of 288,000 were driven by 363,000 net new broadband customers, the best third quarter in 10 years. Collectively, residential broadband and Business Services revenue increased by nearly 10%. These results demonstrate that customers love our products.","We are investing to harness the capacity and capabilities of our network and deliver innovative differentiated experiences, which we believe gives us a long runway for further growth. We are competing really well in residential broadband by offering customers the fastest speeds, most reliable Wi-Fi coverage in the home, and industry-leading Wi-Fi management and controls. We've branded our holistic broadband product as xFi, and continue to add new features, and we're rolling out our xFi gateways and pods to further enhance the service.","We also recently announced that our 1-gig Internet is now available to nearly all of the 58 million homes and businesses passed in our footprint. This is the fastest deployment of gigabit speeds to the most locations in the country by anybody. It's a similar story in Business Services, with demand for our connectivity across small, medium, and enterprise customers driving double-digit growth.","Led by our X1 platform, video plays an important supporting role in our strategy of driving whole-home economics and providing the best value and experience to customers, and we remain committed to competing for video subscribers we can serve profitably. By aggregating and integrating everything from linear TV to applications like Netflix, YouTube, and soon Amazon Prime Video, X1 deliveries an unmatched user experience and the broadest range of content that underscores the value of our broadband service.","Our newest addition to the bundle, Xfinity Mobile, is also resonating with customers. In little over a year, we've crossed 1 million customer lines. Customers who subscribe to Xfinity Mobile have overall higher satisfaction, and our early results indicate that adding mobile improves broadband customer retention, one of our key objectives.","Another success that I'm proud of is the progress we've made in improving the customer experience. Over the last 12 months, customer satisfaction scores have increased, and we have taken out 16 million calls handled by our agents and reduced truck rolls by over 1 million year over year while adding nearly 1 million customer relationships. What's enabled us to do this is our transformation of the way customers interact with us. Over 75% of the interactions are now being completed through our digital touch points. Providing more digital tools remains the key focus as we go forward, and that will help take additional operating costs out of the business.","Now turning to NBCUniversal, Cable Networks and Broadcast TV EBITDA collectively increased by 6% in the third quarter, reflecting growth across retrans and affiliate revenues, content licensing, and advertising. Some highlights from the recently completed 52-week season included NBC Broadcast finishing number one in total viewers for the first time in 16 years, along with our win among adults 18 to 49 for the fifth consecutive year in prime, and Telemundo's second consecutive win among adults 18 to 49 in Spanish language prime.","The new season is off to a great start as well. Both networks continue to lead the competition, and NBC holds four out of the top 10 shows in prime, the most among the broadcasters, as well as two of the top three new premieres this season with Manifest and New Amsterdam. Thanks to Bob Greenblatt for building this momentum, and we're excited with George Cheeks and Paul Telegdy, who are off to a great start.","At Cable Networks, MSNBC had an outstanding quarter once again, with record ratings resulting in its largest lead ever over CNN in key dayparts. As these results demonstrate, we have the right TV content with more ways to monetize it than ever before.","At Film, we had record profitability in last year's third quarter, thanks to Despicable Me 3. While this year was lower without a comparable animated film, it was still a healthy quarter, with successful theatrical results from Jurassic World, Mamma Mia, and other films. We are looking forward to 2019 and beyond, when we will see a ramp up to multiple animated releases from Illumination and DreamWorks, as well as the return of some of our best franchises.","Finally, at Theme Parks, our park in Japan experienced multiple unprecedented weather events and natural disasters that impacted results, as Mike will cover in more detail. Our thoughts are with those many in Japan who were affected by these devastating typhoons and earthquakes.","We remain very confident and excited by the long-term trajectory of the parks business as we continue to execute on our successful strategy of driving growth through new attractions and adding hotel rooms, as well as the opening of a new park in Beijing in the coming years.","This is a fantastic time in our company's history. We delivered a strong quarter with some of the best results in years. We've transitioned to more of a global company with our acquisition of Sky, and now we are getting started on the next phase of our strategy.","With that, let me turn it over to Mike for more details on our results.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","Thanks Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on slide 4 with our third quarter consolidated results.","Revenue increased 5% to $22.1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 2.5% to $7.3 billion, reflecting strong growth of 7.6% at Cable, partially offset by a decline of 8.5% at NBCUniversal, which I'll provide more context around in a moment. The Corporate and Other segment results included an EBITDA loss of $178 million for Xfinity Mobile.","Our adjusted earnings per share increased 27.5% to $0.65 for the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted earnings per share increased 22.4% to $1.91, reflecting the benefits of tax reform, which lowered our effective tax rate by about 10 percentage points year over year to 24%, as well as solid operational momentum. And finally, free cash flow was $3.1 billion in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $10.5 billion.","Turning to the details of the quarter, starting with Cable Communications results on slide 5, revenue increased 3.4% and EBITDA increased 7.6%, resulting in a 160 basis point year-over-year margin improvement to 40.7%. Adjusting for the negative impact of storms in the third quarter of 2017, Cable EBITDA increased 6.9%, reflecting the strong underlying trends in the business.","Customer relationships increased 3.4% year over year to 30.1 million, including 288,000 net additions in the third quarter. On a per-relationship basis, revenue was relatively consistent with the prior year and EBITDA increased by 4.4%.","Cable's performance was again fueled by momentum in our high-margin connectivity businesses, residential high-speed Internet and Business Services. High-speed Internet revenue was the largest contributor to overall Cable growth, increasing 9.6% to $4.3 billion. We have added over 1.2 million net new residential broadband customers in the last 12 months, including 334,000 net additions in the third quarter.","Our offering is resonating with customers, as our consistent innovation and investment in our network has enabled us to stay ahead of customer expectations for not just high speeds, but also wall-to-wall Wi-Fi coverage and the ability to manage the increasing number of devices attached to their home networks. With 1-gig speeds available throughout our footprint coupled with the best Wi-Fi coverage and innovative xFi control features, we are well-positioned to continue to win in broadband.","Connectivity is at the epicenter of our relationship with customers. And while part of our strategy is to effectively target customers whose current needs are met with broadband only, the majority of our customers are still best served with our bundles of multiple high-value complementary products that provide the best experience and deepen our relationship.","One of the best ways to utilize our broadband is to consume video, which is why we continue to innovate around X1 and bring together the best online content along with linear TV. With X1, we have the best platform to serve customers looking for the most content choices and a premium experience, and we are competing well in this segment. However, competitive pressures continue, including from virtual MVPDs, particularly in the lower value segments, contributing to our 95,000 net residential video customer losses in the third quarter.","Video revenue declined 2.9%, reflecting these customer losses as well as the comparison to a pay-per-view boxing event in last year's third quarter. Excluding the impact of this event, the third quarter video revenue decline would have been similar to the second quarter's decline of about 2%.","Another attractive proposition for our broadband customers is to bundle Xfinity Mobile. We ended the quarter with over 1 million customer lines, with 228,000 net additions in the quarter. We are pleased with our progress in mobile. And while it's still relatively early, the results we see are supportive of our key objectives when we entered the wireless business, including deepening the relationship with and improving the retention of broadband customers, attracting new broadband customers, and generating positive standalone economics once we reach scale.","Connectivity is also at the core of our relationship with business customers and drives our ability to continue to take share across small, midsize, and enterprise customers. In the third quarter, Business Services revenue increased 10.6% to $1.8 billion, reflecting a 6% year-over-year increase in business customer relationships to 2.3 million and a 4.4% increase in revenue per relationship.","I'd also note, advertising was a driver of Cable revenue growth in the third quarter due to robust political ad spending. Cable Communications advertising revenue increased by 15.2% to $684 million. Excluding political, cable advertising revenues increased by 0.6%.","Now turning to Cable expense and margin on slide 6, total cable expenses increased by 0.6% year over year, driven by a 1.4% increase in programming costs. As a reminder, last year's programming costs included additional expenses associated with the pay-per-view boxing event.","Non-programming costs were flat compared to last year and down 2.9% on a per-customer basis, as we continue to focus on disciplined cost management and improving the customer experience. Notably, customer service expense decreased by 4.9% despite our growth in customer relationships, reflecting the benefits of improvements we've made to our products and the way we serve customers, including reduced call volumes and more customer interactions through digital platforms, as Brian highlighted.","Overall, this expense management coupled with healthy revenue growth has resulted in consistent EBITDA margin expansion over the course of the year. On a year-to-date basis, Cable EBITDA margins are up 100 basis points compared to last year. As a result, for the full year we now expect to be toward the high end of our guidance of 50 to 100 basis points of margin expansion.","Cable capital expenditures in the quarter decreased by 5.7% to $1.9 billion, primarily reflecting lower spending on customer premise equipment, as X1 is now deployed to nearly 65% of our residential video customers. On a year-to-date basis, Cable capital expenditures decreased by 6.9% to $5.4 billion, as declines in customer premise equipment spending were partially offset by increased investment in line extensions and scalable infrastructure, consistent with the broader shift in our business towards connectivity.","Cable CapEx intensity was 14.1% in the third quarter and 13.2% year to date. We expect capital expenditure intensity to increase sequentially in the fourth quarter, following typical seasonal patterns. However, for the full year, we now expect the reduction in capital expenditure intensity to be towards the high end of our guidance of 50 to 100 basis points.","Wrapping up Cable, strong EBITDA growth and margin expansion together with declining capital expenditures resulted in net cash flow growth of 15.6% in the quarter and 14.8% year to date, underscoring the attractiveness of our connectivity-driven growth model.","Now let's move on to NBCUniversal's results on slide 7. NBCUniversal revenue increased 8.1% to $8.6 billion and EBITDA decreased 8.5% to $2.1 billion, reflecting healthy results in our TV businesses more than offset by a difficult comparison at Filmed Entertainment and the impact of severe weather and natural disasters that affected our Japan theme park.","Cable Networks revenue increased 10.8% to $2.9 billion and EBITDA increased 6.9% to $968 million, reflecting growth across affiliate fees, content licensing, and advertising. Distribution revenue increased by 9.5%, driven by the ongoing benefits of previous renewal agreements as well as moderating subscriber losses due to consumer adoption of virtual MVPDs. Subscriber declines at our cable networks were again less than 1% in the third quarter, an improvement compared to recent trends of 1.5% to 2% declines.","Content licensing and other revenue increased by 36.1%, driven by the delivery of content under our existing licensing agreements as well as new deals, which reflect the healthy demand for our content with more buyers than ever before.","Advertising increased 4.2% due to continued strength at MSNBC as well as strong pricing overall, partially offset by ratings declines.","Broadcast Television revenue increased 15.4% to $2.5 billion, reflecting increases in advertising, content licensing, and retrans revenue. Advertising revenue increased 9.2%, primarily driven by higher rates and Telemundo's broadcast of the World Cup. Excluding the impact of the World Cup as well as the timing benefit of an extra Sunday night football game in the quarter compared to last year, advertising would have been roughly flat year over year.","Content licensing grew by 24.7%, reflecting the delivery of content under our licensing agreements. Retrans revenue increased by 21% to $434 million and EBITDA increased 1.8% to $321 million, as these strong revenue results were partially offset by programming and production costs associated with the World Cup. Excluding the World Cup, EBITDA would have increased over 10%.","Film revenue increased 3.8% to $1.8 billion and EBITDA declined 44.2% to $214 million as the highly profitable hit Despicable Me 3 as well as carryover benefits of our successful slate in the first half of 2017 created an expected tough comparison to last year's third quarter despite the theatrical success of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again in this year's third quarter.","Wrapping up Filmed Entertainment, we are looking forward to 2019 and beyond as our animated slate ramps and some of our best franchises return.","Finally, Theme Parks revenue decreased 1.4% to $1.5 billion, and EBITDA decreased 6.5% to $725 million. These results largely reflect the effects of devastating weather and natural disasters that negatively impacted attendance at our park in Osaka for almost two-thirds of the days in the quarter. Excluding these impacts in Japan, we estimate that overall Theme Parks EBITDA would have shown low single-digit growth in the quarter. Looking ahead, we are beginning to see signs of recovery in Osaka, and we remain confident in our strategy and the runway for growth we see in the Parks business.","Finishing up on slide 8 with return of capital, we generated $3.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. We returned $2.1 billion to shareholders in the third quarter, including $871 million of dividends and $1.25 billion of share repurchases. As we announced at the beginning of the month, we expect to repurchase $5 billion of stock in 2018.","Following our acquisition of Sky, our pro forma net leverage stands at about 3.5 times. As we said as part of our bond offering related to financing the Sky transaction, we are committed to returning to leverage levels consistent with our current ratings in 18 to 24 months. As part of this commitment, we also announced that we intend to pause our repurchase program in 2019.","Overall, we are pleased with this quarter's results and the underlying momentum across our business. We believe Comcast is well-positioned with significant opportunities ahead as we begin a new chapter with Sky.","With that, I'll give it back to Jason for Q&A related to our earnings results.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Mike. As I mentioned up front, we'll now take questions on our results before we turn to our presentation on Sky. Regina, please open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Maybe for Brian, the X1 really led the way in terms of next-generation set-tops when you guys started building that out years ago. When you look at the video business going forward, how are you thinking about the product roadmap? I know the company is focused on bringing more third-party apps into the ecosystem, and you've seen folks like Amazon and Apple embrace a channel strategy. How are you thinking about leading with video going forward from a product and consumer perspective, and what does that mean for the financials of the business? And then I just had one follow-up.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Okay, I'm going to start out, let Dave talk a little bit about that. So I do think that X1 is the best in the world. And I think \u2013 and that's because we've embraced things like Netflix, YouTube, voice control guide. We have a long roadmap of more things. Top of the list is Amazon Prime shortly. And then beyond that, tremendous innovation, things like when we're watching a football game, all the other things you may want to do while consuming it, looking at stats, being able to someday interact, look at your fantasy leagues. I don't think we're anywhere near the completion of what the technology is capable of.","Second, we've used video in a way to support the broadband business, and that combination seems to be working quite well, but there's other applications throughout the whole home where voice can play that role. And artificial intelligence is the other area that we're using across the whole customer experience and the same platform is being used from everything from figuring out those sports scores and data that you want to recommendations of shows and entertainment to customer experience, service quality, and texting to customers appointments and scheduling. So we're building a great capability as a technology company, and I don't think we had any of that just a few short years ago. Dave?","David N. Watson - Comcast Corp.","We've often thought that X1 is an operating platform which not only the most preferred video applications would be there, but we also thought, as Brian said, that there are going to be many other applications, music, gaming. And as IoT continues to make progress, you're going to control your home experience in many ways, including right through the television in X1.","So our mission is to just make it simple and easy. And we're processing right now the way we've connected Netflix, the way we were doing \u2013 we will do Amazon and we're already doing it with YouTube, we're processing about 2.1 billion voice commands a quarter, and it's just easy. So from our standpoint, we think there's a long runway ahead to continue to have X1 be the aggregator of aggregators. So we're optimistic with that.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Then maybe just same question, Dave, on broadband. I think you're more or less done with DOCSIS 3.1. What's next for the evolution of the Broadband business to continue to maintain or even extend your lead against competition when you think about the product and technology and network roadmap for that business over the next couple years?","David N. Watson - Comcast Corp.","I think it starts with the fact that broadband \u2013 DOCSIS is a great standard. It's a very efficient one in that we've been steadily investing in the network in terms of node splits and expansions. So our focus around broadband is bringing to life our xFi brand, where it's the same thing we did with X1 for video we're doing with xFi.","And xFi stands for the best of speed, the best of coverage and control. Dana Strong and her team are doing a really nice job bringing xFi to life. And the proof points are there. As Brian mentioned, we have virtually our entire footprint is now deployed with 1-gig. We have the best-in-class gateways, pods that are delivering best-in-class in-home Wi-Fi capability. And the amount of devices that are being activated and used in the home continues to escalate. So the control aspect of this I think we are also standing out, and our xFi app is just terrific, and a lot of usage, a lot of engagement with that.","So I think we're going to keep our lead. We're going to stay focused in terms of how we differentiate broadband, not only in speed but also these other aspects. And I think this is where our focus is. It's connectivity in residential, in commercial. It starts with that, and I think this is \u2013 it didn't happen overnight. We've been steadily focused on this and we'll continue to be so.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Great, thank you, Ben. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan","Thanks. Mike, can you talk about cable margins? I appreciate the increase in guidance for the year, but that still seems conservative given typical 4Q seasonality and the political advertising potential. Anything happening in 4Q that should take us out of the seasonal trend?","And then going forward, you've talked in the past about a continued pause in programming renewals next year, revenue shifting to higher-margin broadband and business, and it seems like costs can come down further. Any reason we shouldn't look for similar margin growth next year? Thanks","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","No, Phil, not a lot to add to what we said previously and what we said today. So we're happy to firm up guidance on margins and on capital intensity at the high end of the improvements we talked about at beginning of the year for the very reasons that Dave just highlighted. So it is a shift to higher-margin connectivity businesses are definitely helping to drive margin and drive net cash flow, as Brian said. Net cash flow in the Cable business up 16% year over year, quarter to quarter. So those trends will continue on the programming side.","As we said, the last two years prior to this one were ones with big renewals, and so for a period of time, we will see relief on that side of the things. And everything that Dave's team is doing in terms of controlling expenses on the non-programming side, keeping expenses overall flat on the OpEx side while we grow customer base and improve customer experience are all initiatives that continue to roll through. We won't give guidance beyond this year, but obviously that type of work is ongoing and continued runway ahead.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan","Thanks, Mike.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","Yes.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Phil. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Thank you, two quick questions, if I may. First on share repurchases, you've suspended them for next year, but we don't have you getting back to 2.2 times leverage until the end of 2020. I'm wondering if you could restart repurchases before you get all the way down to your recent leverage threshold, or whether it's really pushed out to 2021.","And then on wireless, it looks like the losses, EBITDA losses have been steadily receding. Have we passed the peak in losses, and would you expect the losses to continue receding from here?","And on subscriber growth, there's been a nice gradual steady progression in growth. Should we expect this trend to continue, or is there an opportunity to see a more meaningful acceleration in growth as you bundle the product together with broadband and really drive home the savings that consumers can get by taking wireless from you? Thanks.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","Jon, it's Mike. I'll take the first one. So on share repurchases, our intention is to get ourselves back within 18 to 24 months, as I said, to the neighborhood of leverage consistent with the ratings that we maintain and the commitments we have made there. We'll take it one year at a time. So suspension of the buyback for next year is already safe at this stage. But I will say again, we intend to make that our priority. We're going to focus on the organic plans in each of our existing businesses, continue to drive the execution in all the businesses, and we'll see what happens in the world year by year from here.","David N. Watson - Comcast Corp.","This is Dave. I'll go into Mobile. So after starting this category, launching the category last spring, I think we're off to a really good start. We're ending Q3 with over a million customer lines and I think solid momentum. It's early, very early, but we're encouraged in that we're looking at mobile. One of the top reasons why we did it is to improve in particular broadband retention. So just early pulse check on that is showing that there is real hope there. So we like that.","The other two reasons \u2013 stand, we're very consistent on this point that we're going to achieve positive standalone wireless economics at scale and that we're also going to look to attract even more broadband customers and more opportunities to expand the relationship through mobile. So overall, the trending is what we expected. It's still early but encouraged.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Thanks.","David N. Watson - Comcast Corp.","Thanks.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Jonathan. Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thanks, maybe a quick question on the broadband market. You've seen some good comps on the net add side. What would you say is the primary driver for that improvement that we've seen after seeing some deceleration for a while? And along with that, have you seen any changes in the competitive environment to date? Thanks.","David N. Watson - Comcast Corp.","You go through competitive cycles and most certainly in broadband, and we saw there was just a little bit more promotional activity. But you have to look at I think the absolute performance in terms of how we look at it. The best, as Brian said, our net add performance was 363,000 broadband net additions, best in 10 years. And you look to the drivers, very solid churn. It's an attractive product. And we continue to differentiate, as I mentioned earlier.","Our focus is to have the best product in the marketplace, that we will have the best speeds, delivered now 1-gig availability. You have 70% of our customers that have 100 megabits and above. Where people are going, the expectations around broadband are going up in terms of all the different opportunities, whether it's streaming, applications, so there's a real appetite for better broadband. And the bar is being raised, not just in speed but in terms of in-home coverage. So we want to stand out in providing the best in-home experience, and we think we're delivering on that with xFi, and so all three, speed, coverage, and control.","And then you look at the results in terms of churn improvement but also the broadband ARPU going up at 4.5%, a little over 4%. We're real pleased with that too. I think it shows the overall value of broadband. So I think I like the runway. One of the main things to me too that speaks to the runway is our penetration, about 46.5%, the overall market place at 80%. There's room for growth. And we have markets \u2013 some of our local operating areas that are well above that average. We should do better, and so we're expecting to do so.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks, Dave.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, John. Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. I want to focus a little bit on NBC and NBCUniversal, and I guess as it relates to both the broadcast and cable networks. I guess, Steve, there's some concern that the virtual MVPDs are actually slowing, although opening comments would suggest otherwise. So can you talk about the pay-TV sub trends on the media side?","And then secondly on advertising, we know political is coming in really strong, but there have been some questions on underlying trends, especially in the auto category with trade wars with China. I don't know if NBC is just a different animal and trends have been stronger, so we shouldn't extrapolate. So any color on the ad side would be helpful too.","Stephen B. Burke - Comcast Corp.","So the television business, despite all the well-known factors that make it look like a less good business in the next 10 years than it has been in the last 10 years, our television business is very strong. We've had seven quarters in a row of 7% or better OCF growth on the cable side. Broadcast is doing just fine.","The advertising market is very strong. Scatter is strong. We had the best upfront we've ever had just a few months ago, and scatter is up very substantially. Political is way up. We're having a very, very strong political. I'm talking on the NBCUniversal side, not for Spotlight, although I think some of the same trends are there. A very, very strong political season, it looks more like a Presidential year than a midterm year.","In terms of sub trends, every single month if you look at the trailing 12 months and you add up traditional MVPDs and virtual MVPDs, every single month for literally the last year, those trends have gotten better. In the most recent month, those trends did not keep getting better. They stayed about the same. So I think maybe the growth of the virtual MVPDs is starting to plateau, at least for the last month. But those trends have been getting better, and it really comes from traditional MVPD sub losses. It's about the same. And then virtual MVPDs as they launched and got more aggressive growing, and that appears to be flattening.","But our television business continues to be very, very strong. And I think as the world pivots here toward more streaming, we want to make sure that we respect and nurture and continue to invest and continue to outperform on the television side wherever the world goes in terms of new technologies.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wolfe Research LLC","Great, thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Marci. Why don't we take one more question for this segment of the call?","Operator","That question will come from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi, thank you. First, Brian, congratulations on the Sky acquisition. For Cable, I want to return to the question about margins and capital intensity, if I could. The trends as you've discussed and as some of the questions have suggested are running meaningfully ahead of historical trends. With costs growing at near zero \u2013 non-programming costs growing at reasonably close to zero, have you changed your view of how high margins can get in this business? And similarly on capital intensity. I think you used to always say 15% was the long-term guide \u2013 goalpost, if you will. Is that lower now? Is your sense that capital intensity in this business could be meaningfully below the mid-teens?","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","Craig, it's Mike. I'll start and Dave can finish. Like I said earlier, I think the trends, the efforts, and the mix of business dynamics, efforts on the cost side and just the customer experience side, are improving margins, have improved them I think. We won't predict where they go from here, but just the idea that there are still efforts that will continue consistent with what we've seen.","And the same positive dynamics of the mix shift to connectivity, given the efficiency, as Dave described, of our hybrid plant for the long run looks to be very good. I won't go there in terms of capital intensity over the long term because I don't \u2013 actually, we've never really had long-term guidance like that. But I think we're pleased with the financial model and the prospects for the financial model in the cable system looking through years ahead.","David N. Watson - Comcast Corp.","I think just to add, I think everything starts, Craig, from our standpoint of driving healthy profitable revenue in that the high-margin connectivity businesses \u2013 that's why this is so important, broadband, but also Business Services. Bill Stemper and his team doing a terrific job driving all three segments, SMB, midmarket, and now enterprise, there's just room for growth there. So we're very focused on that.","The second thing that Mike has touched on that helps margins, we're incredibly focused and very consistent on improving the customer experience. I think this goes hand in hand. Taking transactions out of the cable business is good for the customer, it's good for the business. When you look at some of the results in the quarter, we've taken out over 5.5 million telephone calls. We've taken out a material amount of truck roll, and just we're just focused on onboarding, repeats. We're proactively looking at customer issues and solving them in the first place before they even call us. So this is where our focus is. I think it's really good. It takes out the unnecessary cost in the business. We're going to continue to be very focused on it, and I see a good runway for improvement there.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","I think it's a perfect transition point. Thank you, Craig, for that question because it underscores the strength and the momentum of the core company and the core businesses. And Cable Broadband, the pivot, best results in a decade. NBCUniversal, we've had a double-digit compounded rate of growth since we bought the company, and it sets us up for what's next. Jason?","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Brian. So we'll wrap up the third quarter earnings portion of our call there and transition now to a discussion of our recent acquisition of Sky. As a reminder, we'll take questions again at the end of this segment. Analysts must get back in the queue if you want to ask a question by pressing *1.","With that, let me turn things over once again to Brian.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","I'm delighted to have Jeremy Darroch here with us today, Sky's long-time successful CEO. We think Sky is an incredible and unique standalone business that fits perfectly with Comcast. And the best way for you to hopefully reach the same conclusion is to hear directly from Jeremy about Sky's market position, brand leadership, and strong growth potential. And then I'll talk a bit about how excited we are about the combined company and its prospects.","Jeremy, welcome.","David Jeremy Darroch - Sky Plc","Okay, thank you, Brian, and good morning, everybody. Today I'm going to cover two things. First, I'll explain a little bit about Sky's business, and then I'll talk about our existing plans to grow the business over the medium term and why I'm confident we'll succeed.","So let's get going on slide 4. The first thing to say is, of course, Europe is somewhat different from the U.S. Markets in Europe are generally less penetrated and therefore have much greater headroom for growth. The ability to acquire content exclusively is typically much greater. We are much less reliant on the big bundle. And of course, the competitive landscape is somewhat different in Europe to the U.S.","With that backdrop, Sky today is Europe's leader in entertainment and communications. We uniquely combine a scale direct-to-consumer business with a scale content business, and that means we're not just an aggregator of content. We have direct operational businesses in seven territories, including four of the five largest and most valuable TV markets in Western Europe.","Now you can also see on this slide the territories where our brand has a presence through services like Sky News, which of course starts to seed the ground for future development. We have 27 million households as customers. This includes 23 million direct relationships and 4 million customers who access Sky channels through other platforms such as cable in the UK, with both routes to market offering similar economics. As a result, we've got a high share of more than 60% on average in our core territories, that gives us real brand strength.","Turning to slide 5, we're Europe's leader in content by some margin. We have the number one channels in all of the genres that matter most to customers. So Sky One, Sky Atlantic, Sky Cinema, and Sky Sports are the must-have set of channels in each of our markets, generating over half of all pay viewing.","So when customers think about the key pay channels for drama, for example, they think about Sky Atlantic, which combines exclusive rights to the output of HBO and Showtime with our own high-quality and distinctive local content.","In our markets, having the best local content is important to success. So Gomorrah in Italy and Das Boot in Germany are just two recent examples where we're taking local stories and bringing them to customers with great success. Today, four out of the five top shows viewed on Sky One and Sky Atlantic will be Sky originals.","Similarly in Sky Cinema, customers are used to having a single destination for the best movies. It's the only place to see the latest and freshest titles months before any other channels or SVOD. So we have deals with all of the major studios. And in Italy and Germany, that's combined with local movies, which are very important to customers. For example, in Italy nine of the 10 most watched films on Sky Cinema were local.","Sky Sports is the leading broadcaster in each of our markets by a long way. We have over 90% of our rights already secured to 2021, including the majority of all soccer that matters and other key sports such as cricket and Formula 1 in the UK, handball in Germany, and motorsport in Italy.","Now our channels play a vital role in the success of our DTC business, which as you can see on slide 6, is built around four pillars. Firstly, we provide the very best and broadest range of content for every household and everyone in that household. Second, we deliver the best innovation across a broad range of products and services, and we're widely seen in Europe as a leader in this space.","Third, we deliver world-class customer service, and we make the Sky experience better than anywhere else.","And then finally, we underpin all of these through consumer data and insight. So right across the value chain, whether it be in content creation, product development, or customer care, we optimize our decisions to best serve customers, and we've built highly integrated operations to achieve this.","Turning now to slide 7, we have a very strong brand. It's the strongest brand in our space, and it's considered number one for entertainment. It's particularly well known across Europe and regularly reaches now some 120 million people, delivering good awareness should we want to roll out our services to new territories.","Over recent years, we've developed and launched a second brand, called NOW TV. Now this allows us to broaden our reach to all customer segments, and it provides us with additional ways to grow. So, we are the only significant virtual MVPD in our markets in a way that's highly complementary to our Sky service.","Now this brand strength gives us the legitimacy to offer customers more, and we know that they want to take more from us. So over time, we've driven penetration of new TV products such as high-definition, multi-screen, and now Sky Q, and we're expanding into home communications and mobile from a standing start. By extending our brands into more categories, we have a broader field of opportunity, we provide more value to customers and we get more in return.","We have a strong and experienced management team that have been together now for a long time and understand what it takes to win in dynamic and diverse European markets. We've executed a clear and consistent strategy over an extended period of time, and this has delivered growth in all conditions, including different competitive situations, technological change, and a variety of economic backdrops.","So as you can see on slide 8, over the last 10 years we've more than doubled our customer base. We've grown revenues by 11% compound. We've carefully managed cost to enable us to increase EBITDA by 9% and cash flows by 7% per year. At the same time, we've continued to invest for future growth in the short term for a much bigger longer-term gain.","So if that's a bit about who we are, I now wanted to focus on our plans for future growth. As you can see on slide 10, we've got a strong set of plans. And having put in place a number of building blocks over the last few years, we're now focused on executing these. I'll take a few moments to talk about the priority areas that will deliver future growth.","So if you can turn to slide 11. Our first priority is to grow in all segments of pay-TV. Today we have a range of products and services that meet customers' needs at a variety of price points. From pay-as-you-go NOW TV through to Sky Q for the ultimate experience, we believe that we've got a service and a product for you.","DTT in Italy is the latest example of how we've opened up that segment as another major route to market, and it provides access to an installed base of some 2 million homes not previously available to us.","And we've recently launched our first Sky service without the need for a satellite dish. This is potentially a major development for us. It opens up headroom in the existing markets for some customer segments. And just to shape that for you, we've estimated that as many as 6 million households today can't or don't want a dish. In addition, it provides another way to take Sky into new territories to broaden our growth opportunity further over time.","Now underpinning that growth in pay-TV is our investment in content. Today we spend around $9 billion each year on screen. As I've outlined on slide 12, we've got three priorities for investment: first, continuing to maintain our position as number one in both sports and movies; second, building our investment in Sky originals. So for example, this year we'll show 25% more hours of drama and around 50% will be returning series. In Germany and Austria, where local quality content is a particularly underserved market, we'll invest around four times more this year bringing the likes of Das Boot and 8 Tage to customer screens. Third, we'll continue to build partnerships, including adding the most relevant app providers in order to provide more choice and value to customers by aggregating all the important content in one place in a way that's easy to use for customers.","Now alongside that, we're increasingly able to make choices across our portfolio to optimize and save cost. So you should expect us to reduce our investment in things like second-tier sports rights where they're not delivering value, and to reduce the volume of more niche movies and linear entertainment channels because of the quality of the on-demand service that we've built.","Now in addition, you've also seen the savings we achieved with the new Premier League contract, and we could now choose to let that flow through the bottom line or invest some of it where we see further opportunity.","Turning now to slide 13, one of the reasons that I'm confident that we can keep delivering future growth is that we operate in attractive markets with significant headroom. Today we have access to potentially 118 million addressable households to sell our products and services into. However, with penetration at just 34%, there are some 78 million households yet to take pay-TV across our existing territories alone. And we don't need to capture much of that headroom to grow significantly. So just by way of example, if Sky captured 10% of that headroom, we'd grow by a further 8 million households, and I think that's something that's more than achievable given the strength of our brand and our market-leading proposition.","Growing customer base creates more headroom for cross-sell, and here too we've got a focused set of plans, which we've outlined on slide 14. Central to this are our plans in Italy, where we'll replicate what we did in the UK with, of course, great success. So following our deal with Open Fiber, we will launch triple play next year, offering true fiber-to-the-premise over their next-generation network. And not only will this allow us to increase the number of products per customer, it will also unlock further pay-TV headroom.","We also plan to grow the penetration of fiber within our UK broadband base, which has more than doubled in two years. There's good customer demand for higher speeds and with significantly lower pricing from our new agreement with BT Openreach, we can accelerate take-up whilst achieving good margins.","And then finally, we're going to scale Sky Mobile to be the UK's leading MVNO. We launched 18 months ago, and we've had a good start. We've added 650,000 customers to date, and we're taking strong share of new handset sales.","Now we also believe we can scale our adjacent businesses, leveraging the investments we're making in content and technology. So let me just give you a few examples, which I've laid out on slide 15, to bring that to life.","Sky Store, our transactional business, is already the number one digital retailer in the UK with a 30% to 40% share, and we've recently launched the service in our other markets to replicate this success.","Our advertising business already generates more than $1 billion a year. We'll scale it further by increasing our inventory and pricing whilst extending our leadership position in advanced advertising, which now contributes around 14% of fall ad revenues.","Now a key part of this story is Sky AdSmart. That's our targeted advertising platform, which has grown significantly since its launch. We've recently broadened its reach to new markets, services, and platforms, all of which should propel its growth further.","And then finally, we'll monetize our increased investment in original content to grow our international licensing revenues.","Turning to operating efficiency on slide 16, which has been a big area of focus over the last 10 years, we've developed it as a core capability within the organization, and our progress has been significant, reducing costs from 45% to 33% of revenue today.","Casting forward, we have a comprehensive set of initiatives across each of our markets built upon the four key pillars you can see on this slide. And with over $7 billion of non-programming costs to target, there's still a lot to aim for to continue our progress.","So if you bring all that together, slide 17 illustrates how our plan delivers continued growth over the medium term. It also gives us many choices about how we can grow, and it provides for our continued investment on-screen and in new innovation. Importantly, it's built on the same strategy that we've consistently executed over a number of years. We've already done a lot of the groundwork putting in place the foundations to secure it, and I'm confident we will continue to deliver strong returns.","So in summary on slide 18, as Europe's leading entertainment and communications business, we're in a strong position to succeed. We have the skills in place and a broad field of opportunity to exploit, and we have a clear and strong set of plans to deliver growth.","We're excited about being part of a broader, more global organization. Our initial interactions with Comcast have been really good, and I must just compliment the senior team here on the approach they've taken with us and the business they have built. I intend to stick around and I'm looking forward to leading Sky into the future. We're all energized by the next phase of growth and the additional opportunities that being part of Comcast will bring on top of delivering our existing plans.","So with that, I'll now hand you back to Brian.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Jeremy, really well done. Thank you.","So as you've just heard, Sky is a great business with terrific organic growth ahead, and they operate with leadership positions in attractive markets as well as having the premier brand. Jeremy along with Rupert and James Murdoch and so many others have built a sensational company, and that's why this process was so competitive.","Together, we make each other even better. The combined company is a broadly diversified global leader across video, broadband, content, and distribution, with 53 million high-value direct customer relationships in three of the world's five largest GDP economies and now the largest pay-TV operator and fixed broadband provider in developed economies, with number one positions in U.S. cable, number one U.S. broadband, and number one UK pay TV.","Sky triples our footprint of homes we can directly sell our TV products into, now nearly 200 million, and nearly doubles our broadband footprint. When you combine the NBC broadcast and cable channel portfolio and now include Sky-branded entertainment, sports, movies, news channels, we become the leader in viewership share across all four primary pay-TV geographies. And all of this is built around subscription-based and recurring revenue businesses, which has allowed us to grow EBITDA for 23 straight years, and Sky adds to this highly desirable formula.","Core to this formula is a great culture and strong leadership. In fact, as we spent more and more time with Sky's management in the past month, I've been struck by the similarity of mission, connect more people to the moments that matter with products and content that they love.","With a global footprint, Xfinity, Sky, NBC, and Universal now position Comcast to play an increasingly influential role in shaping media and technology for decades to come. That's why we're so excited.","Jason, over to you for questions.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Okay, thanks, Brian. Regina, let's open up this portion of the call for Q&A please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session for the acquisition of Sky. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I just had a question for Mr. Roberts. One of the most common questions we get from investors is how you got comfortable with paying the price you paid for Sky and still create economic value. And I was just wondering if you could, in simple terms, maybe try and disaggregate how much of it was your perception that Sky was just mispriced in the market as an undisturbed equity value before this process started in terms of whatever Sky's standalone business strategy was, and how much of it is a function of the new collection of assets and capabilities that you have as a pro forma entity. Thank you.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Okay, thanks, Jason. First of all, today we move forward, and we are excited about the road ahead. But to that question, you never know exactly how securities are priced and what the motivating factors are. But I do think it was mispriced, whether that's because for five years it's been in a variety of M&A flux because there was a large shareholder, because there was regulatory uncertainty, whatever it may be. There's also been a change in the actual market, as Jeremy just laid out, in terms of the sports rights and competitiveness and new business opportunities that are just about to emerge in Italy, launching broadband and other things that we just heard.","And then I look at the fact, as I said earlier, Disney bid 10% less, and that's exactly the amount we bid less than they did on FOX. These are super-desirable assets when put together with a company like Comcast, and the fit makes us stronger.","So first as a standalone, I think it supports the values. Together, I think it increases the value. Time will tell. And I go back to the people who have a tremendous knowledge of the company and the roadmaps we all want to develop and who our stockholders themselves would probably \u2013 a larger percentage of their net worth than anybody else are the senior employees. The senior employees are extremely energized and motivated that this transforms the company and gives us opportunity to build shareholder value, and we're hard at work to do that.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Jason, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you, so a couple for me, if possible. On the Sky side, Brian, do you think the asset is fully scaled as it is today, and is there anything that you can use potentially from the U.S. business to drive synergy upside, for example, maybe using your scale across a sub base of 50 million-plus to negotiate programming deals, for instance?","And secondly on the capital intensity front, both Comcast and Sky spend a lot of money on software. And obviously, there are similar products across both footprints. So could you help us understand what kind of upside we could see from that front? Thank you.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Let me kick that off. Those are all important aspects of work that's underway. Let me start with the question about Sky and opportunities for better scale. Absolutely, that's a big motivator of what will reveal itself for years and years to come. Some of it will be right away on some expenses. But the real opportunity is with north of 50 million homes, triple the footprint, innovation, purchasing, relationships, new products, where the world may head.","That's what makes it so exciting, and we've always believed scale mattered. That's been true. I think that's why our results at Comcast Cable were so stellar. It's why NBCUniversal has been able to grow as much as it has, and I think Sky is a leader in its market. So when you're doing something in a new market, you'd like to be the best. It's hard to build that when you're starting behind, and now we're fortunate to have the best products and the best leadership in the best markets. Jeremy?","David Jeremy Darroch - Sky Plc","Just a couple of things on that. First of all, it seems to me, if you think of the combined entity, now 50 million household relationships, monetizing it in the way that we're doing that, and with the level of relationship and penetration that we've got together, I can't think of another business that just has that element of scale to it today. And obviously, we'll be thinking about what does that mean and then how can we take advantage of that together.","I think Sky in the UK and Ireland clearly has got an outstanding market position, and from our own business has provided the footprint that we're now trying to roll out elsewhere. We're making really good progress in Italy. Germany is a less mature market, but it's got massive potential if we can get it right over the next few years. There's certainly a huge amount of growth to go for in our mind in Europe. And my strong belief is that as part of a broader group, we're just going to be better able to figure that out and take advantage of that opportunity from the position that we start with today.","I think in terms of your second point around software and capital intensity growth, we're at the outset now and starting to think about the opportunities together. There are obvious things I can immediately see that we'll exploit. We're not going to front-run those. We can obviously develop our plans and execute them. But some of our capabilities, for example, what Dave has just been talking about today in the core cable business, what are you doing with products like xFi, for example, immediately I can see opportunity for us to take some of those learnings and accelerate the position we've got in broadband in the UK today or as we get into the broadband market in Italy. So there will be more of that to come. I'm very confident.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Kannan, next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Can we talk about the combined company's DTC plans? I guess first on the SVOD side, you've got Disney and now AT&T talking about launching SVOD products. Given the combined capabilities of the company, what can we expect from Comcast in that regard?","And then maybe on the linear or virtual side, obviously you've got Sky now, and that's doing well. Maybe for Jeremy, as you talked about the growth in these new markets, is that going to be led by Sky now? And maybe talk a little bit about the economics of that product versus what we're seeing on the virtual side here in the U.S.? Thanks.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","With all the announcements of new streaming services, we'd be remiss if we didn't look at it very carefully. Where we come out is that streaming obviously is going to be part of our business but is not a substitute for what is currently a very good business in television.","By the way, our shows are very popular on streaming services. The Office is often the number one show on Netflix within a month. We're a big percentage of Hulu. Our kids products that are made by DreamWorks Animation are very popular on Netflix. So we have a lot of shows that are currently very popular on streaming services. And we're looking at different ways that we could accelerate our business in terms of streaming.","But we're doing everything with the notion that we have an existing business that's terrific that we want to protect and nurture and continue to build, and I think time will tell. I think there's been a little bit of a rush to the traditional television business is over and we've got to get into streaming. Streaming we think is very challenging economically and we don't want to rush into anything that in any way could take what has been a tremendous television business and make it worse.","David Jeremy Darroch - Sky Plc","I'd say in terms of Sky more generally, I'll come onto the second question on that as part of this. Look, first of all, we've stepped into and will continue to step into new consumer trends and technologies. So we started, for example, distributing over-the-top in the UK with a product called Sky Player as far back as 2005 I think.","Today in all of our markets, we seek to distribute overall technology, so whether it's over the cable networks, through our own Sky Satellite and hybrid systems, through OTT, through mobile networks, all the mobile operators, for example, would carry a service like NOW TV. And the reason is that we want to service most customers who are in all of our markets, and then do that in a complementary way. That's been an effective way that we've continued to deliver sustained growth over time.","Now as part of that, we've been testing new ways potentially to get into other markets. We've launched in Spain over the last 12 months. We've just actually \u2013 what we just completed in the last quarter at Sky is put in place a new strategic OTT streaming platform, which would allow us to light up any other country very, very quickly. We'll decide as and when is the right time to do that and what's the right brand to use. But I think all of the building blocks from a European point of view are coming in place. And to Steve's point, one of the things we're going to be doing is getting our heads together and thinking more generally now what that might mean.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, John, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. If I can ask two. Brian, if you put this deal in the context of say NBC and even going back all the way to AT&T Broadband, you guys invested in the asset out of the gate and grew the revenue base faster than it was growing before. If we look at Sky, it's been a mid-single-digit grower the last couple of years. Do you expect, if we think about the three to five-year view on Sky as similar, invest into the business and then grow the top line faster, or is this business just in a different place operationally than those deals?","And I'll just ask Jeremy, one of the things that I think people are focused on and you highlighted it in your prepared remarks is how much Sky has created value around licensing third-party content. You mentioned HBO. A lot of those companies are thinking strategically about going direct-to-consumer, including I would imagine in Europe. How do you think about the risks around that? Even if maybe financially it makes sense to stay with Sky, could strategically they make a move away from you? And then how do you manage the product and business in that event?","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","Let me start. I think that we're really excited and pleased with the management team at Sky and the people that we've met and the results that they've had. While there was wonderful people at AT&T and NBCUniversal, in both cases we made some early changes on day one. We are delighted that Jeremy and many of the team and the senior team we hope and believe are all going to stay with the new company. So in that regard there's a difference. But I think the trajectory of these businesses that excited us to want to own Sky is because there's growth, and Jeremy laid I think very compelling case out as to why Sky probably was misunderstood and maybe mispriced, back to that earlier question.","But it also \u2013 and you picked the right two deals. We've probably done over 100 deals over the career and the history of the company, but you picked the two that really were transformative. Why is that? Well, in the case of AT&T Broadband, it gave us scale in the U.S. It made us the number one cable company in terms of markets, and markets you can never get back. It was now or never in those great markets. It was really John Malone's life work and Amos Hostetter's life work. And NBCUniversal is a storied brand, and Lew Wasserman's life work, and the NBC and the iconic cable channels that they bought and created, and the theme parks and Telemundo and what we now enjoy as NBCUniversal.","And in the case of Sky, really Rupert Murdoch figured out a long time ago that television was going to transform itself and how could you be the number one brand. And he used a different technology than we used, and those technologies are becoming less and less relevant as we look forward in an IP digital world. But he understood that customers wanted choice, they wanted the best provider and that that was happening globally. And that allowed him to create all the content. That's the big difference. As Jeremy said, it's not an aggregator, it's really a creator, and that is a huge difference on the go-forward economics and the growth rates, depending on how we execute.","So I think it's stay tuned, but we feel as monumental a moment, at least I do, that this will open up the scale and the innovation and I hope in fullness of time, the revenues and the cash flow and ultimately shareholder value that we've successfully done at moments like this. And the first thing we had to do was go into the bond markets, an incredibly successful offering, oversubscribed, and now we have the job handed to the operating team to go execute. Jeremy?","David Jeremy Darroch - Sky Plc","Yeah, Ben, look, I think first of all, to your point, I think one of the reasons we've been so successful working with third parties is I would hope we're a partner that gets it right strategically for others, but also we get the economics right as well, and we understand that any long-term partnership needs to operate at both those levels. And I don't see any reason why we can't continue to do that for our major partners.","I think there are a number of things that underpin our position, which means that we're in a good place. I talked a little bit before about our broad distribution model and how we're seeking to monetize each of our markets across all customer segments. And of course, that allows us to create the biggest pool of revenue, which ultimately we can decide to push back to our partners and reward people for staying with Sky.","We've developed now an incredible range of content. In my tenure at Sky, that's probably been the single biggest thing that has changed. So the breadth now of content that we have on Sky and via our on-demand service has never been greater. And the good news from our point of view, that gives us a lot of optionality around what we do.","So we certainly have got a focus on sort of our key partners that we want to maintain, but there will be others where we can make choices, and we're happy to do that. And as part of that, of course, we've developed our own originated content to a much greater scale, whether that's in drama series or comedy or increasingly actually in local movies. So it gives us the opportunity to create more of that ourselves and create unique European stories that can complement what we do.","And thirdly, I think we've got outstanding reach. If you're a partner, there's no better business to get the customers, to showcase your content and to elevate it. And increasingly, we offer other services to partners as well, things like advertising sales, for example. We'll sell advertising on behalf of many of our partners, and that's just a very efficient way for them to tap into Sky and the broader services that we offer.","And then the final two things I'd point you to is just our brand and organization. I think we've got the number one brand. We've got a proven track record, I think, of taking other brands and helping them grow. And then we've got a lot of boots on the ground. We've got over 30,000 people directly, probably 0.25 million people indirectly, who can make sure that we're the best business to sell and then keep the product sold. And we know in this sector that being good at selling is only part of it, and managing churn and loyalty and keeping product sold is where you make your money. And we think we're pretty good at that.","So we'll see what happens in the future, but I feel that we've got a really incredible set of assets to enable us to navigate this world. And look, the record has to stand for something. I think if you look at our growth over the last 10, 15 years through a variety of technology changes, economic conditions, competitive environments, our businesses continue to grow strongly, and I don't see any reason if we keep doing those things, that will not continue in the future.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Ben. Regina, we'll take one more question, please.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks. Two if I may. Obviously, Comcast is very strong in the broadband business. Sky is a reseller. Is there any thought longer term to become a facilities-based provider for broadband in three very large markets in Europe?","And then now that you've had a chance to hopefully do more work in looking at internal opportunities at Sky, the $500 million of synergies you've identified, has that changed, or any sense of how fast that could come to us? Thanks so much.","Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corp.","Vijay, it's Mike. I'll start, and Jeremy can add on. In terms of synergies, we're confident, very confident in the $500 million of synergies that we talked about. We've been at it for a month and all the teams getting together on a variety of different opportunities there across the board both at Sky and at Comcast and NBC are very confident in what we penciled out and talked about publicly. And so that will come over the coming couple of years, but no changes to our guidance on that score.","And then in terms of future investment beyond the organic plans, at Sky I think we're going to run the organic plays as Jeremy described. Obviously, market structures are different in the U.S. from Europe, and that leads to great opportunities to capitalize on other folks' investment in their broadband plans. But, Jeremy, I don't know if you want to add to that at all.","David Jeremy Darroch - Sky Plc","Sure. I think, Vijay, at this stage, you're going to have to forgive us a little bit. I don't think it's probably too helpful to front-run ideas or giving a running commentary on those. We'll come back I think when we've got something more substantive to say.","And what I would say though is, we're connected already. We've had plenty of time to think about this at Sky, so we're well-organized. We've got a clear set of plans now as to how we get into this stuff and start to tease out and explore the bigger ideas and then how we might pursue those. And as Mike said, as they develop and come to fruition, we'll come back and talk to you a bit more about why we think they're great ideas and how we're going to go after them.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks so much.","David Jeremy Darroch - Sky Plc","On broadband, so just specifically, look. Again, I think it falls in the bucket of one of the things that we're going to be looking at. As you said, we've got, we have our own in the UK, just to be clear, we have our own broadband network. It's built around the Canal system actually in the UK. It connects to about 2,500 BT exchanges. We have a very good regulatory environment, which gives us access on cost-based economics, so we get the benefit of a lot of the aging and write-down of that infrastructure, and then we use largely BT's last-mile-to-the-home.","In Italy, we're doing a slightly different deal with Enel (1:20:10), who are the state-backed fiber-to-the-premises provider, and they're building out to something like 271, off the top of my head, urban and regional areas in Italy. And so we in a sense from a capability point of view, leapfrog what we've done in the UK, but largely execute the triple play commercial execution that we hold in the UK. So we're very excited about that because it would be a big idea in Italy.","And then look, from our point of view, the chance to tap into the capability of this organization in cable broadband communications is a big opportunity for us. So we'll think through those things over the coming months.","Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.","So let me just wrap up by saying thank you to everybody for giving us a little extra time, and I think it was time well spent to get a deeper understanding of Sky, why it's a great business, why it fits us so uniquely, and why we are as excited as we are. I think the results for the quarter speak for themselves, and we'll talk to you in 90 days.","Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.","Thank you, Brian.

Please go ahead, Mr. Armstrong.","Jason Armstrong","Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone. Joining me on this morning's call are Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh, Steve Burke, Dave Watson and Jeremy Darroch. Brian and Mike will make formal remarks; and Steve, Dave and Jeremy will also be available for Q&A.

In addition, in this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our 8-K and trending schedules for the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.","With that, let me turn the call over to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian?","Brian Roberts","Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong operational and financial results in the third quarter with each of our businesses contributing to our company's growth. Together, we surpassed 55 million customer relationships, grew pro forma EBITDA by 7%, delivered 16% growth in adjusted EPS, generated significant free cash flow and paid nearly $1 billion in dividends while further strengthening our balance sheet. Our results in the quarter and over many years are evidence that our strategy is working.","From my perspective, 4 things stood out as we wrapped up the quarter: our incredible strength in broadband; the enduring popularity of our premium content; our strong global footing just 1 year after the Sky acquisition; and how the combination of these things puts us in a unique position to compete, including in the streaming market.","Starting with Broadband. It goes without saying the utility and demand for high-speed and reliable Internet access are ever increasing. We see this in our customers' behavior, monthly data usage more than doubled in the last 3 years and our power users are connecting nearly 20 devices in their homes daily. That's great. It enables us to further differentiate ourselves from the competition, hence more customers continue to choose Xfinity.","The Cable team has done a tremendous job redefining broadband by expanding the basis of competition beyond speed to also include coverage and control. With these 3 pillars, speed, coverage and control, our xFi experience is resonating with customers.","And with Flex, we just added a fourth pillar, streaming, designed to meet the growing needs of customers who only consume video over-the-top. Flex enables these streamers to quickly and easily search, access and enjoy content across their favorite apps on the TV using our award-winning voice remote. It's a wonderful product, and now we are providing it to our broadband-only customers for free.","And at Sky, we plan to follow a similar playbook by using xFi to differentiate the experience for our broadband subscribers in Europe, starting with next year's launch in Italy. So our strengths and ongoing innovation are translating into record-breaking results. Cable added 379,000 broadband customers, the most for a third quarter in 10 years. This drove our best total customer net additions on record for any quarter, contributing to a 3.4% year-over-year increase in customer relationships. And we're also increasing the value of our relationships. EBITDA per customer relationship grew 3.2%. And what is even more impressive, our net cash flow per customer relationship grew 13%.","Moving beyond broadband, our content continues to resonate with consumers. NBCUniversal has the largest TV viewership share of any major media company in the U.S. and one of the leading film businesses in the world. In Europe, Sky is the 1 sports and entertainment brand. And these strengths continued in the third quarter. NBC plays 1 in prime time among adults 18 to 49 for the sixth consecutive 52-week season. Telemundo was 1 in Spanish-language weekday prime for the third consecutive season. Overall household viewership of Sky-branded channels increased 10% in the quarter, led by sports. And Sky's highly acclaimed Chernobyl received 10 Emmys, which bodes well for our newly created Sky Studios.","On top of all this, the teams at NBCUniversal and Sky are jointly producing and delivering content. For example, we've greenlit our first coproductions, shared over 1,000 hours of sports content and are creating a global news channel. In fact, it's hard to believe that we have owned Sky for only a year. Our company is strategically stronger today than we were a year ago. Sky brings 24 million customer relationships in Europe, including the 482,000 net additions in the last 12 months, plus additional premium content and exclusive sports all anchored by a leading European brand and an outstanding team. In what are tough macroeconomic conditions, Sky is doing a great job.","Finally, our recent announcements on Peacock and Flex are terrific examples of how our combined company is working together and well positioned to compete. With our leading scale in distribution and premium content, along with our focus on innovation, we can continue to produce superior products like these for our customers and deliver strong financial results for our shareholders.","So all in all, we had a great quarter, led by broadband. And it also demonstrates what a fantastic set of businesses and leaders we have that positions us well for the future.","Mike, over to you.","Michael Cavanagh","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 4 with our third quarter consolidated results. As a reminder, we completed our acquisition of Sky in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our reported results include Sky from the acquisition date, while pro forma results include Sky as if the transaction had occurred on January 1, 2017. Also, one housekeeping item on Peacock, our forthcoming streaming service. Similar to our approach with Xfinity Mobile, during its start-up phase, we will report Peacock's results in the Corporate and Other segment.","So now, let's move on to today's results. On a reported basis, revenue increased 21% to $26.8 billion, and adjusted EBITDA increased 17% to $8.6 billion. On a pro forma basis, revenue was consistent with the prior year and adjusted EBITDA increased 7.4%, reflecting growth across all 3 businesses. As Brian mentioned, adjusted earnings per share grew 16% to $0.79. And free cash flow was $2.1 billion, bringing the year-to-date total to $10.9 billion, an increase of 3.7% compared to the first 9 months of last year.","Now let's turn to our segment results, starting with Cable Communications on Slide 5. Cable delivered excellent results driven by our connectivity-centric strategy and highlighted by strong performance in three key metrics we use to run the business: growth in total customer relationships, EBITDA per customer relationship and net cash flow per customer relationship. Overall Cable revenue increased 4% to $14.6 billion in the third quarter, led by the increase in total customer relationships as well as higher ARPU. Total customer relationships increased 3.4% year-over-year to $31.2 million, including 309,000 customer net additions, the best on record. This growth was driven by 379,000 high-speed Internet customer net additions, the highest third quarter net additions in 10 years.","We've added 1.3 million broadband customers over the last 12 months. Overall, our connectivity businesses, residential broadband and business services, continue to drive the growth at Cable. Our revenue in these businesses collectively reached $6.7 billion in the quarter, up 9.3% year-over-year.","With broadband as the foundation of our customer relationships, we utilize additional products and services in a manner that profitably helps us attract and increase the lifetime value of the overall customer relationship. Video is still an important profitable component of most of our relationships, but we continue to be disciplined and are not chasing unprofitable subs. Total video subscribers declined by 2.8% year-over-year to 21.4 million. Xfinity Mobile is another important contributor to our growth as we pair it with broadband to provide our customers with a great wireless experience that helps them save money. We added 204,000 net customer lines in the third quarter and reduced our quarterly adjusted EBITDA losses at Xfinity Mobile to $94 million, an improvement from a $178 million loss in last year's third quarter, reflecting our progress in scaling and further improving our operations. And as Brian mentioned, Flex is another great product we'll use to add more value to our broadband-centric customer relationships.","Moving now to Cable expenses and margin on Slide 6. Total Cable expenses increased 2.3% year-over-year, reflecting strong cost management even as we increased customer relationships by 3.4%. Programming expense was flat, reflecting the timing of contract renewals and a lower volume in video. Non-programming expenses increased by 3.6% year-over-year but were relatively flat on a per-customer basis. We delivered outstanding growth in customer relationships and also improved our NPS scores while reducing total agent-handled calls by 15% and lowering truck rolls by 10% year-over-year.","Together, the growth in our connectivity businesses, the improvement in our performance at Xfinity Mobile and our ongoing focus on cost management, resulted in Cable adjusted EBITDA growth of 6.7% and margin expansion of 100 basis points to 39.8%. We continue to expect EBITDA margin improvement for the full year 2019 to be slightly above 100 basis points compared to the 2018 margin of 38.7% based on our strong performance year-to-date and our outlook for continued year-over-year margin improvement in the fourth quarter.","Cable capital expenditures in the third quarter decreased 6.7% to $1.8 billion, leading to capital expenditure intensity of 12.4%, primarily reflecting lower spending and scalable infrastructure and line extensions, partly due to the timing of plant construction and other network investments. However, as we said, consistent with the broader shift in our business toward connectivity, we will continue to invest in our network to stay firmly ahead of our customers' high and increasing expectations and to further enhance our leading competitive position in broadband.","We now expect Cable CapEx intensity for the full year 2019 to improve by at least 150 basis points compared to the 13.8% in 2018, driven partly by timing of network investment as well as decreased CPE spend as video subscribers decline and the rate of our deployment of X1 has moderated. This is an upgrade to our prior guidance of at least 100 basis points of improvement.","In summary, we're very happy with the team's strong performance. In the quarter, we delivered 3.4% growth in total customer relationships and 3.2% growth in adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship, which, coupled with the decrease in Cable capital intensity, drove a 13% increase in Cable net cash flow per customer relationship. We continue to see the benefits of consistently investing in our network, innovating to deliver the best-in-class products, services and experiences and increasing our operational efficiency. We believe our approach will continue to strengthen our leading competitive position and drive profitable growth.","With that, I'll turn to NBCUniversal's results on Slide 7. NBCUniversal EBITDA increased 1.6%, reflecting expected difficult studio comparisons in TV and film. Cable Networks revenue decreased 2.8% to $2.8 billion, and EBITDA was flat at $955 million primarily due to a 27% decline in content licensing and other revenue, reflecting a challenging timing-related comparison to last year.","As we noted last quarter, our studio benefited from the considerable level of programming licensed to third parties in 2018. Offsetting some of this decline was a 1.6% increase in distribution revenue, reflecting the ongoing benefits of previous renewal agreements, partially offset by subscriber losses that have moderately accelerated, driven by increased satellite losses and slowing virtual MVPD growth. Lastly, advertising revenue was consistent with last year's result as the strong pricing environment was offset by audience ratings declines.","Broadcast revenue decreased 9.1% to $2.2 billion, and EBITDA increased 5.1% to $338 million due to challenging comparisons in advertising and content licensing, more than offset by healthy growth in retrans and lower programming and production costs. Advertising revenue declined 12% primarily reflecting a difficult comparison to last year's results, which included Telemundo's broadcast of the FIFA World Cup. For the remainder of the year, we have a positive outlook on the ad market with the start of the NFL season and the return of original entertainment programming as well as the benefit from higher upfront pricing.","Content licensing declined 17%, reflecting a challenging comparison to last year's results due to the timing of delivery of content under our licensing agreements. Retrans revenue increased over 10% to nearly $500 million. Lastly, on the expense side, lower programming and production cost were primarily driven by costs associated with the FIFA World Cup in the prior year.","Filmed Entertainment revenue decreased 6.2% to $1.7 billion, and EBITDA declined 8.7% to $195 million. While the Fast & Furious spinoff, Hobbs & Shaw, delivered strong results in the quarter, it was a tough comparison to Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and a higher number of films in last year's third quarter. Despite experiencing a crowded box office so far in the second half of this year, we currently expect healthy growth in full year Film EBITDA over 2018 results. Looking ahead to 2020, we believe we can achieve even better results as our strategic slate includes 3 major animated sequels and another installment in our Fast & Furious franchise.","Theme Parks revenue increased 6.8% to $1.6 billion, and EBITDA increased about 1% to $731 million. These results reflect higher attendance as well as an increase in operating costs. The higher attendance was due, in part, to severe weather and natural disasters that negatively impacted attendance in Japan in last year's third quarter. While the parks business is subject to some ebbs and flows, we are pleased with our summer launches of Jurassic World in Hollywood and our Hagrid-themed Harry Potter coaster in Orlando. And we remain bullish on our growth opportunities with Super Nintendo World opening in Japan in 2020 and domestic launches thereafter, our new Beijing park opening in 2021 and our recently announced fourth gate in Orlando, Universal's Epic Universe.","Moving on now to Sky results on Slide 8. As a reminder, I will be referring to our pro forma results as if the Sky transaction had occurred on January 1, 2017, and growth rate's on a constant currency basis, consistent with what's reflected in our earnings release.","Revenue at Sky increased 0.9% to $4.6 billion, reflecting growth in direct-to-consumer and content revenue, partially offset by lower advertising revenue amid continued macro weakness in European markets. Direct-to-consumer revenue increased 1.9% to $3.8 billion, benefiting from customer growth, but partially offset by decline in average revenue per customer.","In the third quarter, customer relationships decreased by 99,000, following record streaming growth in the second quarter related to Game of Thrones and the debut of the highly acclaimed Sky Original, Chernobyl, both of which were exclusive to Sky Atlantic. Year-to-date, Sky added 317,000 customer relationships, and we expect to return to customer growth in the fourth quarter.","Content revenue increased 15% to $315 million, reflecting increased monetization of our original programming slate and the wholesaling of sports programming. Investment in sports continues to be a key differentiator. Audiences viewing tentpole sports programming are increasing, with household viewerships on Sky Sports channels up 21% year-over-year, reflecting great starts to the Premier League, Serie A, Bundesliga as well as broadcast of the Cricket World Cup in The Ashes.","Advertising revenue declined by 14% to $446 million, largely reflecting the impact from a change in legislation resulting in certain gambling advertising restrictions in the U.K. and Italy as well as advertising market weakness across all territories. Pro forma EBITDA at Sky increased 46% to $899 million. Excluding certain nonrecurring items in both periods, growth would have been in the mid-teens on a constant currency basis. For the full year, at today's currency rates, we expect Sky's reported EBITDA will be close to $3.1 billion.","Wrapping up on Slide 9 with free cash flow and capital allocation. For the third quarter, we generated $2.1 billion in free cash flow and paid $955 million in dividends. Free cash flow in the third quarter was largely impacted by the timing of Sky Sports rights payments, which are heavily weighted to the start of the new soccer season. Year-to-date, we generated $10.9 billion in free cash flow.","In the third quarter, we monetized a substantial portion of the minimum floor value we negotiated for Hulu, which brought in $5.2 billion in proceeds. In addition, starting in 2024, to the extent that total equity value in Hulu is worth more than the total floor value of $27.5 billion, we will realize our share of that upside.","Since the Sky acquisition, we continue to make very good progress in our deleveraging efforts. Year-to-date, we have paid down roughly $11 billion of our consolidated net debt, ending the third quarter at 2.9x net leverage, down from 3.3x at the end of 2018. We expect to meet our commitments to the rating agencies by year-end 2020. As a reminder, the rating agencies make certain adjustments in their leverage calculations that can add up to 0.25 turn to our leverage ratio.","In closing, our results today highlight the strength and consistency of our company's overall performance, and we couldn't be more pleased with our strategic and financial position. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to continue executing on our long-term growth strategy and to deliver value to our shareholders.","So with that, I'll turn it back to Jason to lead our Q&A.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks, Mike. Regina, let's open up for Q&A, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne","I want to just follow up on some of your comments on streaming, both from a Cable and an NBC perspective. For Brian or Dave, how are you guys thinking about Flex? What does that mean for the business over time in your view? And how do you think about investing in the X1 platform going forward? Obviously, the video business is going through a transition, but you've invested a lot of money into that platform. It's done well for you. I'm just curious how you're thinking about the product evolution there and how important it is to Comcast Cable.","And I'll just ask to Steve on Peacock and sort of the NBC strategy, how are you thinking about content exclusivity and sort of the volume of original programming that you want to see over time? And when you look at some of the numbers out there for talent and showrunners from the Apples and Netflixes of the world, what is your reaction? Do you view this as healthy or irrational? Or how do you see yourself navigating this spending landscape?","Brian Roberts","So let me just -- it's Brian. Let me just quickly kick it to Dave, and then we'll go to Steve to follow the order of your questions. But I'm very pleased with the innovation team and how we made a pivot a few years ago and I think the right call, which was to really focus on to broadband in addition to video and, in some ways, making that the lead part of where we're going. And one of the results was the xFi whole brand that's now stands for much more than speed.","And with Flex, in particular, we're just now going to market with a free box to broadband-only customers across the entire platform, whether you have our gateway or not. So there's real innovation ahead on that platform. And I think that, that can reveal itself over the time as we go forward, but the point being that the team, the recruiting, the retaining of the people to do the technology of this company, I think, is second to none, and I'm really pleased with it.","Dave?","David Watson","Thanks, Brian. Yes, Ben, so Flex, I think, is a great example of leveraging the innovation engine that we've had on X1 for some time. So we'll continue to make sure that relevant content is available and delivered through X1 and Flex. But it's -- we just have such scale with X1. It's a really efficient way to leverage this platform with Flex.","And our view with Flex in providing more value to broadband and with streaming, it's just a great option for those customers that want an integrated experience. I think we see often bolt-on, one-off options of different apps that are available. What we are delivering to our customers is just a great streaming experience with Flex, and it's completely integrated. The content is available through the voice remote, just like X1. So we're pleased with the innovation focus that's been able to put us in this position with Flex. So off we go, as Brian said, very soon.","Brian Roberts","Steve?","Stephen Burke","So regarding Peacock, we announced about a month ago the name and listed a fair number of shows that we're going to have on the service. I think the most important thing to think about as you're thinking about Peacock and its role inside NBCU and broader Comcast is we're not doing the same strategy that Netflix and people chasing Netflix have adopted. We're primarily working with the existing ecosystem and doing a lot of AVOD activity. And what that's going to do, we think, is make the -- is cut the investment pretty substantially because I think we're going to get to cruising altitude much more quickly than a subscription service.","We're also playing to our strengths. We happen to be part of a company that has 55 million video customers and is the biggest provider of television advertising in the United States. So we'll have a mix of originals, exclusive acquisitions like The Office and a lot of nonexclusive product as well. Importantly, we're going keep selling to other companies. We -- if you take movies, for example, we plan to keep selling into the premium window. We're not taking all of our movies off of premium platforms like HBO or Sky or other platforms around the world.","So I think our approach is different. I think it fits the strengths and characteristics of our company well. And with -- it's a very, very interesting time as everybody tries to figure out what their strategy is, and we're very optimistic. We're planning on launching in April. We're going to use the Olympics as sort of an afterburner after our launch, and then we'll be adding content pretty significantly throughout 2020. And I'm very pleased with the technical progress our team is making. It's a wonderful product. The product is beautiful and very different and I think something that we're all going to be very proud of when we launch in April.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jessica Reif Ehrlich","So a couple of questions. Just continuing on Peacock, can you talk about the ramp-up in spend? And is that the reason why there was such a big swing in working capital in this quarter? And then within Peacock, can you talk about the marketing plans within and outside the ecosystem and how confident you are in the advertising per sub that you guys have talked about?","And then different subject with Telemundo. Given the growth in ratings, excluding the World Cup, have you closed the revenue gap versus your ratings? And then the last question, on Cable, a number of your 10-year contracts are expiring in the next year. I don't know if you could talk about expectations for step-up in costs, but maybe how you're thinking about the next rounds of negotiations. What are the key considerations, especially as programmers roll out their own streaming options?","Michael Cavanagh","Jessica, it's Mike. I'll just jump in ahead of Steve on the working capital. Working capital this quarter, primarily the change is Sky, both the inclusion of Sky versus prior year together with second half of the year, particularly third quarter is when football rights payments across Bundesliga, Serie A and Premier League kick in. So that's what's going on in working capital. Pleased with working capital and free cash flow, obviously, for the year-to-date, but lumpiness in working capital.","Stephen Burke","So in terms of the Peacock spending, marketing plan, et cetera, I think we're going to remain pretty quiet until a month or 2 before launch in terms of the details for competitive reasons. Telemundo has been a huge success for our company. We've -- as Brian mentioned in his introduction, we've beaten Univision, which was at one point unthinkable. They were so far ahead. We've beaten Univision in prime time every year for the last 3 years, and we're making real progress during the daytime.","We have not closed the revenue gap in terms of retransmission consent, which leads into your next question about the cable channels. We have a lot of deals expiring in the next 12 to 24 months and channels like Telemundo that have made big strides. MSNBC is another one. MSNBC is solidly beating CNN almost every night and by a fair margin. And CNN has a much higher affiliate fee than we do. I think you can expect to see us make some real progress there. But we're not going to be precise about numbers until the negotiations are completed.","Jessica Reif Ehrlich","And the question for -- from the cable operator perspective.","David Watson","Jessica, Dave. So yes, so we won't comment in future time periods, but it's clear that a couple of years where it's going to cycle, we've had lower cost increases in programming. Certainly recognize that in future times there, that could change and have more headwinds. But a couple of things. One, the whole landscape is evolving and changing. For those that go directly to the consumer, that is game-changing. We all know that.","I think the key thing we talked a little bit before, X1 is strategically important to us. It just gives us flexibility and either the customer has choice, a ton of choice on different platforms to find content. And we want to be a great platform for all the content that makes sense for our customers. So we're going to be disciplined as we approach all these matters, and we're going to use data to understand the real value. And to the extent that it is available on other platforms, we'll consider all those things.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS.","John Hodulik","Maybe a couple of questions, more for Steve on D2C. First of all, will the Peacock product be bundled with Flex? And maybe more broadly, have you been surprised at how promotional the landscape has been on the D2C side thus far? And as you look out into 2020, do you think that all these launches and the uptake and, frankly, how aggressively these things have all been priced will have an incremental impact on the traditional ecosystem in terms of both viewership and subscribers?","Stephen Burke","Well, most definitely, Flex is a huge opportunity for Peacock, and Peacock will be front and center on Flex. And Dave may want to speak to that more. But I think it's not only an opportunity for Peacock, but it's a great opportunity for Flex to be able to give a lot of great NBC programming, shows like The Office, to people at no additional charge to a broadband sub or a cable sub.","I think in terms of the overall ecosystem and the promotional intensity, I don't -- it's not too surprising to me. I think you've got the 3 biggest media companies, Disney, Time Warner and NBCUniversal, all launching streaming platforms. And this is a moment in time and a lot of people are being very, very aggressive about it. And I would anticipate that to happen until, at some point, there'll be an inevitable slowing down and shakeout, and the market will get a little bit more rational. But I think it's a moment in time, and consumers are making their choices of apps and viewing habits, and you want to be aggressive to get in there and make sure that your service is one of the consumers' handful of favorite services.","David Watson","John, this is Dave. Just one other comment in the importance of Peacock to Flex and Cable, I think it's enormously important and a showcase on why it really matters how we work well together to make the experience even better. So we are very much going to be active and promotional, but we're very extremely focused on the experience, and it happens when the two teams are working so well together.","John Hodulik","Does it concern you guys that bundling these products together could accelerate the trends that we're seeing in terms of the traditional TV ecosystem?","David Watson","I think the trajectory is pretty clear and it's -- the marketplace is evolving anyway. And so Flex is, I think, going to be a targeted focus for us towards the high-speed Internet-only segment. We'll continue to do that, but we're going to make sure that all of our broadband customers know that will be included. And we think this is the right step and the right thing for that segment.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Douglas Mitchelson","Just on the broadband side, Dave, anything unusual driving the quarter? We're always asked and I imagine you're always asked about the longevity of subscriber growth in broadband. And so any update on DSL subs, the footprint and how you're competing against fiber and upside you see in broadband penetrations would be helpful. And then, Brian, and I guess -- and for you again, Dave, on the wireless side, obviously, a continued hot topic. Any thoughts about your MVNO and the leverage that you might be building as you grow that subscriber base, you grow the amount of revenue that you're paying out to Verizon And also, we're asked a lot about strand mounts. And if you've tested that, have any thoughts on the effectiveness of strand mounts and whether or not that would help the wireless network partner, that would be appreciated.","David Watson","Thanks, Doug. So let me start with broadband. Very pleased with the quarter, had solid performance in broadband all year. So it's another quarter -- consistent quarter of solid performance. And so clearly, well over another year of 1 million-plus net customer growth. And the drivers, I think, are very consistent. I think the marketplace is growing. We have penetration upside, and that's going to continue.","Our focus, as Brian said, has shifted gears. Our innovation engine has been absolutely focused on broadband. And so the key for us is to differentiate the product. And it's a combination of speed, coverage, control and now streaming with Flex, and this is all xFi. So we're -- I think we have a very different product in the marketplace.","And a key thing that we have is consistent focus. While others, that may change from time to time, we've been squarely focused across the entire enterprise on having a great broadband experience, and that's how we compete. So our innovation engine is all over the aspects that I talked about.","And so nothing has changed competitively. Nothing has changed in segments, whether it's Internet Essentials or anything else. There's been pretty normal activity in that regard. But what we've seen is broad-based strength across the entire geographic area and across all segments, so it's just robust growth. And I think an important point to bring up is not only share growth, but it's also strong financial results that we're delivering. Residential broadband ARPU is up 4.2%, and residential overall broadband revenue is up 9.3%. So just robust growth in both categories, so I like our position going forward.","In wireless, I would say that we're [indiscernible] is always to deliver also here the best experience that we can. And -- but we're absolutely looking at options and leveraging our infrastructure with wireless options. We're always studying and we are actively testing the options of being able to offload in any number of different ways. So we look at the trade-offs between price and volume and then the amount of data on our MVNO network and then when you offload data to our own network. So we will continue to test. We'll continue to look at this very closely. We think it's -- we'll be opportunistic when things come up. More to come later, but we'll actively consider that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wolfe Research.","Marci Ryvicker","Two questions. First, we've seen video subs decline at an accelerated pace for a while now. Can you just comment on who you're losing? And do you have any visibility into when video levels out? And are you at a point where you maintain those core customers who really appreciate the bundle? And then secondly, on Sky, what's driving expected customer growth in the fourth quarter? So we're still new to this asset. Can you remind us why Sky was down in the first couple of quarters of the year? Any seasonality we should think about? Anything in particular?","David Watson","Marci, Dave. So we start with video and remind everyone, our primary focus at Cable is in driving growth in the overall number of customer relationships and then driving the lifetime value of those relationships. So we segment the video base of customers, and we're focusing on growing profitable media relationships. And there are segments where customers are in lower-end packages, the skinny bundled video that -- and often, they're in promotional packages, and we work hard retaining customers. But if we can't profitably serve this segment, then we're going to move them to a broadband-only relationship. And so not chasing the lower end of the video segment is behind the difference, I think, in the video results.","To also remind folks, though, that we added a record 309,000 total customer relationships in Q3, ending the quarter at 31 million customer relationships, up 3.4% year-over-year. And EBITDA per customer relationship is up 3.2%, and net cash flow is up per customer relationship 13.2%.","So we've been able to make this transition. This has been consistent. We're going to -- video is important to us that it is profitable in key segments. And for those key segments, we package it with broadband. We'll continue to stay very disciplined and focused around that.","Brian Roberts","On Sky, Jeremy, you're on.","Jeremy Darroch","Yes. So yes, in terms of Q4, I'll talk on video, first of all. Christmas is a big -- always remains a bigger quarter for us in video in Europe. Bear in mind, of course, we've got lower penetration typically over here at our markets. So the idea of upgrading your TV for Christmas to Pay TV to Sky remains a strong idea for us here. It's not as acute as it used to be in the past when our business was very skewed, but it remains important. So the business really quite quickly now shifts to Christmas.","As part of that, we'll be driving Sky Q in particular very hard over the next quarter. Sky Q, which is I think Europe's best-quality, app-based TV experience by a long way is about 40% of our business today, and we think we can get it a lot higher. So that's going to be central to our plans. Alongside that, our programming mix really shifts. So at the back end of the summer, we're very focused on fall, the start of the football season is important here. We've had a strong schedules for this summer.","So our focus on screen really moves to entertainment and Sky Studios and our own originated content. We've got a succession of Sky Originals that will be coming to market in the next few weeks, and we'll really get behind that. And then cinema, where we have still really quite a strong leadership in terms of our cinema proposition.","Away from TV, it's pretty much steady as she goes, both in broadband and mobile. I'm very pleased with the progress, in particular, we're making on mobile, where we're seen now as a service leader against all of the mobile operators. So I think our growth from commerce business should be pretty strong, I hope, over the next 13 weeks. And again, mobile, continuing with handsets is quite a good Christmas product, so we'll get behind that.","Brian Roberts","Great. I would just add that, from my perspective, for the first 9 months of the year, I think Sky added in the last 12 months running close to 400,000 subs, I think, Jason or Jeremy? So I think it's tough economic headwinds over there. We read about it everyday, and uncertainty is never your friend in business climates, and there's an awful lot of uncertainty. But we're really pleased, I certainly am, with Sky 1 year later, what it's done for the whole company, giving us all the plans that Steve and Dave have been talking about. It's completely integrated. And Jeremy and his team, I think, are executing great. Jason?","Jason Armstrong","Thanks, Marci. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.","Brett Feldman","You continue to see, I think, slightly more than 100 basis points of margin expansion in Cable Communications this year. I believe you've done 100 basis points or more every quarter so far this year. So I'm wondering, are there going to be any headwinds in the fourth quarter that prevented you from improving that outlook?","And maybe just to be more specific, it does look like the technical and product support cost did grow a bit more quickly in the third quarter. I was hoping you could give us some insight into that. I think maybe your MVNO costs are in there. And then just the last accounting question on this. As Flex penetration grows, will we see that in OpEx or CapEx?","Michael Cavanagh","So Brett, it's Mike. I'll start. So we do -- we expect to be better than 100 basis points improvement in margin, as we've said. And in the fourth quarter, particularly, we expect to see healthy year-over-year margin improvement in Cable. But just remember that it's a political comp in that quarter as well. But net of all that, healthy fourth quarter margin growth coming in Cable, and that will flow through the full year.","David Watson","Brett, Dave. So specific to Q3, always remember Q3 is technically a little busier with back-to-school activity, and so I think that's always good, welcoming the kids back. So -- but Mike talked about Q4. Important are the fundamentals going forward of the non-programming expense and that are positively impacting margin. One, continued focus on the connectivity business is going to stay, business services, residential broadband, just improves margin in doing that. We're making significant improvements in serving customers through digital means.","So we're going to continue to press on that. We think it's a great opportunity. We're in early innings on that. And then overall cost control remain very focused on that as well. So I expect those fundamentals to carry forward. And to the point Mike made, given fourth quarter has the political tougher comparison, but we still expect healthy growth going forward.","Michael Cavanagh","And then on Flex, Flex, think of that as CapEx. But as we've said before, we don't give multiyear guidance. But on capital intensity, the improvement that we've seen of greater than 150 basis points projected for this year, we've always said the trends behind that are we expect to see them continue. And I don't think the initiative around Flex would -- is going to change that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Fritzsche with Wells Fargo.","Jennifer Fritzsche","Two, if I may. One, back to wireless. There's a number of spectrum auctions coming out, CBRS, next summer. CBNZ talked about even millimeter waves. Can you talk a little bit about spectrum ownership? If you look at these 3 options, is it something you could see participating in, in a more formal way if only to offload some more traffic from your MVNO to your hot spots or your own network?","And then secondly, if we look at the components of your CapEx, line extension and scalable infrastructure were down year-over-year. I know in the past, you had mentioned timing issues there. Should we expect that to continue to be on a steady decline? Or is it -- or should we not?","David Watson","So wireless, in terms of spectrum, we'll always be opportunistic. We'll evaluate every option. Nothing more really to cover on that, but we always look at different options. And to my earlier point, we're actively looking at models that may work in terms of leveraging our infrastructure. And to the extent that -- I think we're in a great position in regards to cable infrastructure, and we're going to lead the way in terms of understanding that in testing different options. But we'll be -- we'll evaluate as things come up.","In terms of CapEx, I think we continue to make very good progress in improving our CapEx intensity and, as mentioned, on track for at least another 150 basis points reduction this year. And it's a consistent approach that we're going to -- we'll continue to invest where we need to in the connectivity business, but we're going to realize the reductions as video CPE continues to not be a big driver for us. So I think expect going forward those fundamentals to continue.","Michael Cavanagh","It's Mike. I'd just add that those particular scalable infrastructure and the line extensions, that's more timing, third quarter versus -- I'd look at it over a 12-month period rather than quarterly on that one.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Philip Cusick with JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick","One, and then if I can, I guess, two follow-ups. So one, Mike, to just follow up on what you just said. It sounds like there's some push-out on the network CapEx side, expand on that a little bit. And then a follow-up for Jeremy on Sky. Can you break down the drivers of local revenue decelerating? Looks like the DTC revenue is fairly consistent in local, but ad revenue was down a lot. I know there's some issues around sports, and content sales were down as well. What if there was a onetime hit versus being more permanent?","And then just one other question. Growth in parks has been volatile around storms and maybe competitive issues, and you aren't opening gates like you had been once. How should we think about the underlying growth at the parks business?","Michael Cavanagh","So Phil, it's Mike. Not too much to add to what I've said thus far on Cable CapEx. I mean I do think hard to look at one quarter to the next to the next. The network, we're happy to invest in the network as usage of the network keeps going up and want to continue to stay ahead of customer expectations. So expect that's very healthy CapEx going into the network, but it just is a little lumpy. I wouldn't say things are pushed out so much that it follows its own timing based on what folks in the field are doing.","And so stepping back up, we are getting more efficient on capital intensity 2 years in a row now. This year, heading towards the 150 basis points of intensity improvement year-over-year. And as I said, we don't get into multiyear guidance, but I think the expectation of the ability to scale the network, scale the business and what's going on in CPE gives us confidence that those trends ought to continue. And again, that's despite the opportunity we have with Flex.","Jeremy Darroch","Yes. Jeremy here. In terms of revenue trends and ad revenue, I'd say broadly -- look, I'd say about 1\/3 of it is market, TV market. Advertising markets in Europe, as you know, are pretty much all under pressure with mid-single digit, perhaps a little bit more declines year-on-year. That's quite different from what you're seeing, I think, in the U.S. at the moment. And probably the balance of it is really down to gaming legislation change here, which is specific to the U.K. and Italy, how we've arrived in Germany. And we're probably disproportionately affected by that, of course, because we've got such a strong sports business and the sports leader in Europe. That will work its way through over the course of this year.","In terms of content sales, year-on-year, they're up. So the progress we're making in content sales, as we start to commission more of our own content, is good. It is down quarter-on-quarter, but there's nothing structural now. It's just a bit lumpy. Obviously, as we scale, hopefully some of that lumpiness will disappear. But at the moment, we see a little bit of that.","Stephen Burke","So in terms of the Theme Park business, 6 years ago, we made about $1 billion in the Theme Park business, and now we're at about $2.5 billion. So theme parks have been, historically, one of the fastest-growing parts of our portfolio. And we have a lot to look forward to. We're opening Nintendo in Japan, in Osaka, in our theme park in Osaka, which is very close to the headquarters of Nintendo in Kyoto.","And then if you go out into 2021, roughly 18 months from now, we open in Beijing. And Brian and I were there last week with Tom Williams, who runs our theme parks. It's going to be a spectacular park, and we're really looking forward to that. And we recently announced we're doing a fourth gate in Orlando in 2023. So we think the Theme Park business is a great business for us, and we're going to be making the investments to try to grow cash flow aggressively in the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.","Craig Moffett","Two questions for Dave, if I could. One, just to follow up on the questions that have been asked about wireless. Being able to offload traffic from the -- your own -- or from the MVNO agreement with Verizon onto your own small cells, as I understand, it will require eSIM programming. I'm sure you've tested that at this point given the eSIM inclusion in the new iPhones, for example. Can you just talk about how comfortable you are with your ability to manage traffic and direct it between your own small cells and the Verizon network just based on eSIM programming?","And then a second question. It's been a while since we've really talked about the commercial services business, but business services is now getting close to 14% of your Cable revenues. I wonder if you could just update us on your penetration levels in the various segments of business services and where the growth is coming from at this point? Is it -- are you really starting to take share in the enterprise market now? Or is it still primarily small, medium business?","David Watson","Craig, so first on wireless, we're absolutely testing the eSIM, dual-SIM capability on both, whether it's iOS and\/or Android. We think that is an opportunity, and we'll continue to look at that. And that does go with any offload strategy, so we're very active in thinking through that. And whatever -- in terms of the business model and the business planning around it, any potential shift will be a positive net economic outcome for us as we look at, but it's early still. But I do think that there's promising opportunities when you combine dual SIM with the cable infrastructure.","Second thing, in terms of business services, yes, it's a really important part of our growth and what has been, will continue to be. We're generating almost $8 billion in annualized margin-accretive revenue. And the addressable market now is about $50 billion when you include new product opportunities, everything from WiFi, security cameras, cell backup, SDWAN. So you add up all those things, we're -- for those products, it's still early innings on that. So we're going to continue to be very focused on this opportunity.","In all three segments, you asked about penetration, we still have opportunity in all 3. SMB is a little bit more mature, but there's growth opportunities there. In mid-market and certainly enterprise, we're in the high single digits at this point, working well, getting key clients on. So there's good upside. I think we have a competitive advantage across the board in every segment. We have a better product, superior product. We have better service in terms of how we locally deliver it and pull it all together. We have great pricing. And I think I like our position versus incumbents in this regard.","Jeremy Darroch","And we've talked about -- because we're going to -- we're also going to launch a broadband business offering here in the U.K., and that will be our first significant entry into that segment. We're doing it direct from the market-based team and probably brought one of the team across to lead that business here. So we'll broaden out from the residential market in the U.K. into the business services market and obviously try and replicate some of the success that we've seen Stateside. And that will be a big new segment for us, actually, to attack here in the U.K. And obviously, over time, when we get established in Italy, we'll be seeking to do that in Italy as well.","Brian Roberts","Yes. I just want to say, that's a great point, Jeremy. We -- between Matt Strauss going to Flex, from Flex to Peacock, technical leads and finance and, of course, now business services in the U.K. and there's a senior marketing team coming to Cable from Sky. The integration, as I said, is one of the real highlights and makes the company unique in the conversation we've been having here.","And then just on the wireless point, I just want to add in. There were a number of questions there. I think all of this is the trend is going in a way that is very supportive of our capital-light approach to wireless. We're getting scale. We're learning all the realities of a new business extremely well. And the technology, the innovation in the handsets, possibly spectrum, all the conversations we're having, all of those are net positives to where we're going. And we've seen this with Sky in one respect is when you get to a certain point of scale, a number of people want to compete to have relationships with you. And so all that put together, I'm really pleased with the team. And we've taken the leader of that mobile area and given some more responsibility, too. So just a lot of good momentum across the board.","Michael Cavanagh","Yes. Capital-light approach that Brian mentioned, what we're doing today is working. We're encouraging results and driving improving broadband retention. We're attracting new customers through different sales channels and achieving and working towards the path for positive stand-alone economics. So we're -- I'm real pleased with our current position, and we'll be opportunistic going forward.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi.","Michael Rollins","Just approaching Xfinity Mobile from a different direction. What's working from a selling and bundling perspective as you look at the success of adding customers on a platform now for more than 2 years? How important is the retail experience? And is this something that gets expanded to new direct and indirect locations over time?","And finally, how do you view the value of bundling OTT media content with the wireless service to create an additional hook, whether it's to acquire or retain customers?","Brian Roberts","Well, there's several things that are going on that are helping, starting with the fact that we have a great value proposition, and we offer by the gig. We offer a lot of choice in terms of unlimited to select plans that have some pieces of data that are included. So we have a lot of choice that we're delivering, and I think that's helping us achieve success in multiple segments. I think we're in a good position in regards to BYOD. So that helps. And then we're in a good position when great new products come out from Apple or on the Android side. So we kind of have like a full slate covered.","In terms of channels, retail, I think the good news is we're able to sort of upgrade our existing retail without having to spend a lot more in terms of new locations. We do add a few locations here and there along the way. But mostly, we've been focused on upgrading retail capability. And mobile is absolutely a key part of that. So -- and it's helping us, I think, attract new business when we do that.","So we've been competing, whether it's broadband, whether it's mobile, we look at OTT things. I think our value proposition is terrific as is. And we are extremely competitive with our base core offering. And there's a lot of choice out there in segments. We've been competing against those that have offered different kinds of OTT offers, and we've done quite well. And we respond competitively all the time to different kinds of offers. So I think we're in a good position.","Jason Armstrong","Okay. Thank you, Mike. And with that, we'll wrap up the call. We want to thank everybody for joining us today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Finance, Mr. Jason Armstrong. Please go ahead, Mr. Armstrong.","Jason Armstrong","Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone. Joining me on this morning's call are Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh, Steve Burke, Dave Watson and Jeremy Darroch. Brian and Mike will make formal remarks and Steve, Dave and Jeremy will also be available for Q&A.","As always, let me now refer you to slide number 2, which contains our Safe Harbor disclaimer and remind you this conference call may include forward-looking statements, subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, in this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our 8-K and trending schedules for the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.","With that, let me turn the call over to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian?","Brian Roberts","Thank you, Jason and good morning, everyone. 2018 was a successful and pivotal year for Comcast capped off by an outstanding fourth quarter where we grew pro forma EBITDA by 11%. For the full year, we generated record free cash flow. We are now truly a global company with our acquisition of Sky.","And as you'll hear, we had many other significant achievements route each of our businesses. This success is based on a few guiding principles. Be leaders in the markets in which we compete. Continuously improve everything so we can deliver the best products and experiences and keep building deep highly valuable recurring relationships with our customers. This is what allows us to have tremendous consistency and to think and compete for the long term.","Throughout this very busy year, one of the things that stands out for me is that the team did not miss a beat and they bring us to deliver exceptional operational and financial results for the fourth quarter and 2018. So let's turn to a few of the highlights as well as some of the growth opportunities we see in the coming years.","In Cable, we made a very successful transition to a connectivity centric model and that drove our fantastic performance in 2018. Strategy is clear, deliver the best products and experiences while improving our focus on keeping the customer at the center of everything we do. In the fourth quarter, customer relationships increased by 258,000 and EBITDA growth of 7.3% was the best for a fourth quarter in eight years. For the full year, we added 1 million net new customer relationships driven by our 13th consecutive year of over 1 million broadband net adds. Our connectivity businesses, residential broadband and business services in total grew revenue nearly 10% in 2018. We made progress in transforming the customer experience and taking unnecessary complexity and activity out of the business. Greater than 75% of transactions are now being completed through digital touch points. In the past 12 months alone, we have reduced agent handled calls by 15 million and truck rolls by 1.5 million all while adding a 1 million new customer relationships. Altogether, this resulted in Cable EBITDA growth of 6.5% the best for a full year in seven years and net cash flow growth of 13%.","Our focus on network differentiation and product innovation continue throughout the year. We rolled out gigabit speed availability to nearly all of the 58 million homes and businesses in our footprint and are redefining the in-home broadband experience for our customers with the best speed, coverage and control which we call xFi.","In video, we are leveraging our X1 platform to be the best aggregator of aggregators, delivering the broader selection of content. With our integration of YouTube, Netflix and most recently Amazon Prime Video in December, X1 is the best platform to consume live, on demand and streaming content on TV and on Xfinity Stream. Xfinity Mobile which has quickly become another important component of our bundled offerings for customers ended 2018 with 1.2 million subscriber lines. We're very pleased with this performance in Mobile so far and the value it adds to the bundle and are on track to achieve our primary objectives including positive standalone economics. Customer satisfaction is increasing and retention approve across all of our products in 2018, notably including the best broadband retention on record. So our Cable team is leading and their big strategic shifts are really paying off.","Looking ahead, we hope to build on this positive momentum. We expect connectivity will again be the growth engine of our Cable business in 2019 and beyond with sustainable benefits to our financial results as our mix shifts more towards these margin accretive businesses. We see lots of runway ahead and this should help us deliver another year of healthy customer and net cash flow growth in 2019.","NBCUniversal has had an incredible run with EBITDA growth at a double digit compound annual rate since our acquisition and we are well positioned to succeed for years to come with scale, must see content and I believe the premier management team in the media industry. NBCUniversal ended a very good year on a strong note. Fourth quarter EBITDA increased 12% driven by over 20% growth at our TV businesses. For the full year, TV EBITDA increased by 15% with growth across all revenue streams reflecting successful execution of our strategy focused on big events and must see entertainment, news and sports content. NBC had a notable year finishing the 52 week broadcast season at number one in total viewers for the first time in 16 years and number one in adults 18 to 49 for the 5th consecutive year in Prime. MSNBC was also a real standout, reaching record viewership for the full year and its largest ever lead over CNN.","Our Theme Parks and Film businesses were meaningful contributors to NBCUniversal profitability as well and Mike will take you through the details for the fourth quarter and full year.","Now looking to 2019 and beyond, as our 2018 results demonstrate, there is robust demand for our content across multiple platforms. The popularity of our programming is what gives us a great opportunity to create our own streaming service as we announced last week, which we plan to launch in 2020. This service will be distinct and compelling, offering current and prior season's library and some original content with a light advertising load all for free to pay TV customers. It's a great value proposition for consumers and provides marketers with unique targetable digital advertising in high quality premium programming. It will harness all of the things that make our companies so unique, NBCUniversal's premium programming, below franchises and industry leading advertising sales capabilities and Cable and Sky's broad distribution to 54 million direct customer relationships across the U.S. and Europe and top notch IP video capabilities and infrastructure including the NOW TV OTT platform.","We believe that we can generate significant value with this service over time by enhancing our content monetization, strengthening the value of pay TV, becoming a leader in targeted digital streaming advertising and expanding our reach through direct customer relationships. At the same time, our approach to monetizing our content will remain balanced. We will continue to sponsor a broad very distribution environment and see this platform as being a valuable addition to this highly effective strategy.","In Film, we have a terrific slate in 2019, which includes the third installment in DreamWorks' How to Train Your Dragon franchise. The next chapter in Illumination's brilliant Secret Life of Pets and the return of the Fast and Furious franchise with Hobbs & Shaw. Finally, we have some wonderful attractions opening at our Theme Parks in 2019 with Jurassic World in Hollywood and a pretty thrilling new Harry Potter Coaster in Orlando. In addition with occupancy above 90% even as we more than doubled our on-site hotel rooms at the park over the last five years, we are looking forward to opening Phase I of the 2,800 room Endless Summer Resort in Orlando in 2019. We are confident in the long term growth potential at our parks with an exciting roadmap as our partnership with Nintendo debuts at Universal Studios Japan in 2020 and we bring a brand new large park to Beijing the next year.","Turning to Sky, which we have viewed for years as a truly unique company that combines a direct-to-consumer business similar to Comcast Cable with brands and content ownership economics like we have in NBCUniversal. Sky operates in significantly under penetrated markets and has terrific long term growth ahead of it including the potential to expand into new markets.","As our teams have come together, the brand leadership, impressive customer loyalty, premier content and innovation driven culture that attracted us to Sky in the first place have become even more apparent. The team at Sky delivered a healthy fourth quarter, its first as part of Comcast. Sky's achievements in 2018 underscores some of the reasons we are so excited about this business. Sky grew its customer base in each of its territories with 735,000 total net additions in 2018 including a record second half of the year, bringing its customer relationships to nearly 24 million. It continue to innovate and scale its best-in-class Sky Q platform and launched a new TV offering in Italy with Sky over digital terrestrial television.","Highlighting Sky's proven cross selling abilities, fiber penetration increased and mobile customers continue to scale in the UK. Sky's successful original programming strategy drove strong viewing with Sky originals representing nine out of the top 10 rated shows on its wholly owned and partner entertainment channels in 2018. Sky enhanced its differentiated sports offering securing Premier League soccer rights at a lower cost and Serie A in Italy with more exclusive games. And finally, the team is extending Sky's leadership and customer service while continuing to improve operating efficiency with its digital first initiatives.","We are enthusiastic about Sky's organic growth prospects as well as the opportunities created by the combined company in 2019 and beyond.","So in summary, this was a really important year for our company, underscored by an excellent fourth quarter. Our consistent track record which now includes 24 straight years of EBITDA growth and confidence in our outlook for continued strong and profitable growth is what enables us to announce that we are raising our dividend by 10% for 2019. We're really just getting started on this next chapter in our company's history and we've a lot of excitement about the future.","Over to you Mike.","Michael Cavanagh","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slides 4 and 5 with our fourth quarter and full year consolidated results. As a reminder, we completed our acquisition of Sky in the fourth quarter. As a result, our reported results include a partial quarter of Sky from October 9th, while pro forma results are resist the Sky transaction that occurred on January 1st, 2017.","Revenue increased 26.1% to $27.8 billion on a reported basis and 5.2% on a pro forma basis for the fourth quarter and increased 11.1% to $94.5 billion on a reported basis and 6.4% on a pro forma basis for the full year.","Adjusted EBITDA increased 21.6% to $8.2 billion on a reported basis and 11.1% on a pro forma basis for the fourth quarter and increased 7.9% to $30.2 billion on a reported basis and 4.8% on a pro forma basis for the full year.","In the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 7.3% at Cable, 12.3% at NBCUniversal and 8.9% at Sky on a pro forma basis or 12.4% on a constant currency basis.","Adjusted earnings per share increased 36.2% to $0.64 for the quarter and 25.6% to $2.55 for the year. This growth reflects the benefit of a lower effective tax rate throughout 2018, due to Tax Reform, as well as our strong operational performance.","Finally, free cash flow was $2.1 billion in the quarter and $12.6 billion for the full year. These earnings per share and free cash flow results include a partial quarter of Sky results in the fourth quarter.","Now let's turn to Cable communications on Slide 6. Starting with a few highlights from Cable's results for the full year, revenue increased 3.9%, EBITDDA increased 6.5% and net cash flow increased 13.3%. Total customer relationships grew by 1 million or 3.4% year-over-year to 30.3 million. On a per relationship basis, EBITDA grew 3.4% and net cash flow grew an impressive 9.9%. As Brian mentioned, retention improved across all of our products including the best on record for broadband.","For the fourth quarter, Cable revenue increased 5.2% to $14.1 billion, EBITDA increased 7.3% to $5.8 billion and net cash flow increased 8.4% to $3.1 billion. Total customer relationships increased 3.4% year-over-year including 258,000 net additions in the fourth quarter. On a per relationship basis, EBITDA increased 3.8% and net cash flow increased 4.8%.","These strong operational and financial results for the fourth quarter and full year reflect our overall focus on driving profitable growth and the benefits as our model shifts more towards our high margin connectivity businesses, residential high speed Internet and business services.","Now diving into the details of Cable's fourth quarter results. High speed Internet revenue was the largest contributor to overall Cable revenue growth increasing 10.1% to $4.4 billion. We added 323,000 net new residential broadband customers in the fourth quarter bringing full year net additions to 1.2 million. This performance demonstrates our broadband offerings attractive positioning in the market which is a result of the investments we've made in product innovation and into the capacity of our network. We've raised the bar for broadband by offering gigabit speeds, the best customer equipment for wall to wall Wi-Fi coverage in the home and innovative control features to help customers manage their networks and devices. We are delivering more value in our offering and the utility of broadband continues to grow. Our customer's median monthly data usage was over 170 gigabits per month for the second half of 2018, up over 30% year-over-year. We believe we are well positioned to continue to grow as the size of the broadband market increases and we take greater share with our differentiated product and highly capable network.","Having broadband at the center of our offering and go-to-market strategy gives us the opportunity to deepen our relationship with the customer and drive additional value by attaching other complementary products. Video is one of these important supporting parts of the bundle. Our best-in-class X1 platform enables us to compete well for customers who want the most content and a premium experience. And it further underscores the value of our broadband by bringing together the best streaming content with linear TV. However as we saw throughout 2018, the video market remains competitive, including the impact of virtual MVPDs. We expect this dynamics to continue in 2019 and remain focused on driving video in the Customer segments we can serve profitably.","Xfinity Mobile also highlights another opportunity to add value to our core business by bundling with broadband. We ended the year with 1.2 million customer lines having added 227,000 in the quarter and 854,000 for the full year. Early results are supportive of our key objectives in wireless as we are seeing benefits to overall customer satisfaction and improve broadband retention when Xfinity Mobile is attached. Xfinity Mobile EBITDA losses which are included in the Corporate and Other segment were $191 million for the fourth quarter and $743 million for the full year.","Lastly on Mobile, one housekeeping item, which is that starting with our first quarter 2019 results, we will report Xfinity Mobile as part of the Cable segment.","Moving on to business services, revenue increased 9.5% to $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter, driven by a 5.7% increase in business customers to 2.3 million and a 3.5% increase in revenue per business customer. We are taking share in each of our customer segments, small, mid-size and enterprise by leading with our connectivity expertise. In enterprise in particular, we're still in the early stages of penetrating a significant addressable market with great traction so far. As we continue to drive growth in enterprise, there can be some lumpiness in revenue due to the timing of bringing new customers online which was a factor in our fourth quarter comparison.","Overall, we ended the year at over $7 billion in business services revenue and with at least a $40 billion market opportunity in our footprint, we see substantial runway ahead for this margin accretive growth business.","Collectively, our connectivity business has generated over $24 billion of revenue and grew nearly 10% in 2018. As we begin 2019, we are optimistic that we will continue to grow at similarly strong levels, thanks to our network and product differentiation. And finally, advertising was again a driver of Cable revenue growth in the fourth quarter increasing 27.7%, due to record political advertising spending. Excluding political, advertising increased 3%, driven by growth in our advertising technology platforms.","Moving now to Cable expense and margin on Slide 7. Total Cable expenses increased 3.8% in the fourth quarter, driven by 4.5% growth in non-programming expenses or 1% growth on a per relationship basis. The increase in non-programming expenses reflects cost associated with increased advertising sales activity due to political and costs related to our X1 syndication business. Partially offsetting this growth was a 2.5% decrease in customer service expenses even as our customer base grew 3.4%. This reflects reduced call volumes and truck rolls as we continue to make progress in providing a better overall experience and eliminating unnecessary activity and transactions including through more digital service tools.","Programming cost increased 2.9% in the fourth quarter. Following elevated growth in 2016 and 2017 due to the timing of renewals, we said the rate of programming cost growth should be meaningfully lower for a period of time. We saw this in 2018 with 2.7% growth for the full year and expect a similar level in 2019.","Cable EBITDA and margins were 40.9% in the fourth quarter, up 80 basis points year-over-year and 40.7% for the full year, up 100 basis points. For 2019, we believe our margins on our currently reporting basis could improve by up to 50 basis points compared to 2018 benefiting from our high margin connectivity driven growth and ongoing customer service efforts. The same margin improvement of up to 50 basis points will also apply after we restate our Cable financials to include Xfinity Mobile results in the first quarter of 2019.","Fourth quarter Cable capital expenditures increased by 7.6% to $2.3 billion, driven by increased investment in scalable infrastructure as well as higher customer premise equipment investment, due to typical seasonal spending patterns. For the full year, capital expenditures decreased 3% to $7.7 billion, reflecting a decline in customer premise equipment spending, partially offset by increased investment and scalable infrastructure and line extensions.","Capital expenditure intensity was 14% for the full year, an improvement of 100 basis points year-over-year. In 2019, we expect 50 basis points of improvement and capital expenditure intensity primarily reflecting continued decreases in video centric CPE spending consistent with the broader shift in our business towards connectivity.","Overall, I'm really pleased with the results in Cable in 2018 and have confidence that we are well positioned to deliver another year of healthy growth in 2019.","Now moving on to NBCUniversal's results on Slide 8. NBCUniversal revenue increased 7.1% to $9.4 billion and EBITDA increased 12.3% to $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter, driven by growth in our TV businesses.","Cable network's revenue grew by 8.9% to $2.9 billion and EBITDA increased 4.3% to $1 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in distribution and content licensing revenue.","Distribution revenue increased 10.3% driven by the ongoing benefits of previous renewal agreements, as well as another quarter of improved subscriber trends at our Cable networks relative to the 1.5% to 2% declines we were experiencing earlier, due to consumer adoption of virtual MVPDs.","Content licensing revenue increased 28.4%, driven by the delivery of content under our existing licensing agreements and reflecting overall strong demand for our content.","Advertising revenue was consistent with the prior year as growth from MSNBC and overall higher rates were offset by ratings declines at our Cable networks.","Broadcast revenue increased 3.7% to $3.1 billion, driven by growth in retrans and advertising. Retrans increased about 25% to $440 million, bringing the full year to $1.7 billion, up over 20% compared to $1.4 billion in 2017. We expect retrans of $1.9 billion in 2019 and we believe our successful content and big event strategy at NBC and Telemundo position us well for continued growth in the retrans over time.","Fourth quarter advertising increased 2.1% as overall higher pricing, record political advertising and strong Sunday Night Football ratings more than offset the comparison to Thursday Night Football and last year's fourth quarter and ratings declines another programming.","Broadcast EBITDA increased by $215 million to $412 million, reflecting higher revenue, as well as lower programming and production expenses due to the comparison to Thursday Night Football rights costs in last year's fourth quarter.","Lastly in TV, we are excited about NBCUniversal's recent announcement of a new streaming service. We believe our unique proposition offering premium programming and a late advertising load offered free to pay TV customers will be well received by both consumers and marketers. As Brian outlined, we believe this approach will create significant value over time and leverage the strengths and resources of Comcast NBCUniversal. We anticipate a manageable level of investment will be required to build out and scale the service over several years with a negligible impact to our financial results in 2019. We measured in our production of streaming originals, aligning the levels of spend with the consumer and financial scale of the service over time. We have a balance strategy that promotes a broad very distribution environment for our content and our new streaming service will be a complementary part of this approach.","Turning to Film. Revenue increased 14% to $2 billion, driven by the theatrical success of The Grinch in the fourth quarter, while EBITDA decreased 23.6% to $179 million, due to a tough comparison to our 2017 slate. We are optimistic about our Film slate and outlook for growth in 2019 underscored by an increased number of animated titles and the return of The Fast And The Furious franchise.","Theme Parks' revenue increased 3.5% to $1.5 billion and EBITDA increased by 0.7% to $666 million in the fourth quarter as record results from the annual Halloween Horror Nights event at our domestic parks were offset by continued weakness at Universal Studios Japan as the park recovers from the lingering effects of the natural disasters that occurred in the third quarter. We remain bullish on the outlook for our parks over the next several years as we're investing in a robust pipeline that includes Harry Potter and Jurassic World attractions in our domestic parks in 2019, a new resort hotel opening in Orlando this summer, Nintendo coming to our park starting with Japan in 2020 and a new park opening in Beijing.","Turning to Sky on Slide 9. We are pleased with Sky's execution of results in the fourth quarter. On a reported basis, Sky is included in our financials as of October 9th, 2018. As I go through Sky's performance in more detail, I'll refer to our pro forma results as if the transaction had occurred on January 1st, 2017 and growth rates on a constant currency basis, consistent with what's reflected in the earnings release and will be our go forward approach for discussing Sky's results.","For the fourth quarter, Sky's revenue increase 5.6% to $5 billion, reflecting healthy growth across direct-to-consumer, content and advertising. Direct-to-consumer revenue increase 4%, driven by improved product penetration for pay TV, growth in Sky Mobile and Sky Fiber customers, as well as rate adjustments in the UK. Sky's total customer relationships grew 3.2% year-over-year to $23.6 million including net additions of 164,000 in the fourth quarter, reflecting customer growth in each of its markets. Sky added 735,000 net new customer relationships for the full year with growth in all markets led by Italy, driven by the successful launch of its new DTT TV product and benefiting from an enhanced sports offering there with new Serie A Champions League and Europa League deals. Sky Mobile customer lines reached 785,000 at year end and Fiber penetration has increased to 47% of Sky's broadband customer base up from 34% a year ago.","Sky's content revenue increased 35.7% in the fourth quarter, reflecting the whole selling of sports programming including Sky's newly acquired exclusive sports rights in Italy and Germany, increased penetration of Sky's premium sports and movie channels on third party pay TV networks in the UK and monetization of its successful slate of original programming. Sky maintained its position as the number one pay TV provider in core markets. Sports viewing was up 10% in the fourth quarter with growth in each territory and strong performances from key sports rights like Formula One in the UK and Italy and UEFA Champions League Soccer in Italy and Germany. Advertising revenue increased 2.9%, reflecting increased sports inventory in Italy and Germany and advanced advertising growth in the UK.","Sky's fourth quarter EBITDA increased 12.4% to $765 million, driven by healthy revenue growth partially offset by a 4.5% increase in operating expenses, due to growth in programming cost driven by new contracts for Serie A and UEFA Champions League soccer rights in Italy and Germany.","Sky's total capital was $1.6 billion for the full year, primarily reflecting its ongoing deployment of Sky Q, which was rolled out to 3.4 million homes throughout Sky's footprint over the past 12 months to end the year at 5.5 million homes.","For the full year, pro forma revenue increased 4.5% to $19.8 billion and EBITDA decreased 5.3% to $2.9 billion. This reflects contract terminations costs and costs related to a settlement that impacted Sky's second and third quarter 2018 results tolling $231 million for the year. Excluding these costs, Sky's EBITDA would have increased about 2% for the full year, reflecting growth in direct-to-consumer, content and advertising revenue, partially offset by increased programming expenses and customer acquisition costs associated with Sky's new product launch in Italy.","Looking ahead to 2019, we expect Sky to deliver healthy full year EBITDA growth by executing on its strategy of growing its TV penetration and attaching additional products, including exciting new opportunities like the launch of broadband in Italy, as well as monetizing its investments in original content. Sky's EBITDA growth in 2019 will be back half weighted, primarily reflecting the timing of sports rights costs, which will increase in the first half, due to increased costs associated with its new Serie A and Champions League contracts, which commenced in August of 2018.","In the second half, Sky will benefit from lapping these contracts, as well as from the new lower cost Premier League contract which begins in August 2019. Additionally, the teams across Cable, NBCUniversal and Sky are highly engaged and working together to leverage our capabilities throughout the company and further strengthen each other's growth opportunities giving us continued confidence in our previously announced synergy expectations and our ability to make good progress through the year towards a healthy exit rate for 2019.","Wrapping up on Slide 10 with return of capital, we generated $12.6 billion of free cash flow in 2018 and returned $8.4 billion of that to shareholders, comprised of $5 billion in share repurchases and $3.4 in dividends. We are pleased to announce a 10% increase in our dividend, our 11th consecutive annual increase, reflecting our confidence and outlook for growth going forward. We ended the year with pro forma net leverage of about $3.3 times.","As we said in October, we are pausing our share repurchase program in 2019 as part of our commitment to returning to leverage levels consistent with our current ratings.","Overall, I'm pleased with our results and successful execution in 2018. We have a lot to be excited about across the business as we start 2019.","And with that I'll turn it over to Jason for Q&A.","Jason Armstrong","Okay. Thanks Mike. Regina, let's open up the call for Q&A please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen","Thank you. I have two questions. First on direct-to-consumer, the video business has transitioned faster than I think many of the expected and your DTC service seems like an ecosystem friendly way to kind of address that. Can you talk about what the service looks like in 2020 at launch and beyond like where do you see it going, where you bring in, you know what content and\/or marketing partners will you bring in? And can you talk a little bit about the financial impact in 2020, because it seems fairly low cost?","And on the second question on Sky. This is the first time Sky's included in your call. Can you - Brian and Mike, you both talked about underlying opportunities at Sky, is it what's more than increasing penetration in existing in new markets and what does NBCU and Comcast Cable bring to Sky, like what can you do together that you couldn't do separately?","Steve Burke","Okay. So, I will answer the first question on direct-to-consumer. First of all, we're really excited about our approach, we spent a lot of time on it and we're excited to get going in and stand up a management team and get going on entering the business. I think our excitement comes from the fact that the way that we're entering the business really addresses the real objective we have which is as viewership goes online, how do we monetize that viewership better. One of the good things about what's going on right now in the television business is people are watching professionally produced content at higher levels than ever, we're just not monetizing as well online as we should. And so what we've come up with is we're taking some of the most popular shows on television that we produce and we're going to offer them for free to 80% of the people in the United States who are multi-channel customers for free to Sky customers in Europe and also to people who are not part of the eco system at a fee that would be comparable to other people in the SVOD business.","The servers will have a very light ad load of targetable ads. And we know there's a huge demand for digital advertising, interactive digital advertising. In fact, we were constantly trying to find more ad inventory because advertisers want to be in very, very good professionally produced content. So our idea to enter the business is to leverage Sky's technology, it's called NOW TV in Europe and also parts of what we've been doing at NBC and Comcast Cable. We think this approach has a much better chance to get scale quickly. There's nothing better than free for consumers and we have enough product that consumers are currently viewing on other platforms online for free and charge that we think putting it all together in one place very, very good technology and then leveraging our relationship with Comcast Cable and Sky. There are a lot of approaches to get into the market and we think this one is attractive to consumers. We also think financially it's more attractive because you get scale more quickly and we think it's highly likely that will reduce the amount of investment we need to make coming into the business and also accelerate our ability to get to breakeven. So that's what we're doing. We plan to launch in the first half of 2020 and we're spending a lot of time right now developing the technology, getting the management team in place so that we can get going soon enough.","Brian Roberts","I think that's a pretty complete answer and if there's other questions on that we can come back to it. But I think we're uniquely positioned to do all the things Steve just described. I think as we look at the Sky, part of the answer just getting off the bat, it is what Steve just described, the amount of media companies and potential partners that have reached out to me and to us and to Jeremy and his team, since we announced Sky, is surprising and overwhelmingly positive in my opinion. Sky's position is just, it's quite unique So today we focused more on sort of operations which we did on the last earnings call, Jeremy you may want to talk a little bit about the specifics of some of the integration work we're doing in the early days, but at the highest level, it gives the company a reach with a very healthy business that is quite enviable and desired and that's changed the dialogue we're having with our partners and within our own company. And the first evidence of that is the global OTT that Steve just described.","Jeremy, you have anything you want to add on that?","Jeremy Darroch","Yeah, I mean look I strongly think that Sky's business is going to be able to grow faster and further as part of the broader Comcast organization. I mean bear in mind still 78 million households just in the markets we're in, don't take pay TV. We're found by the underpenetrated markets. I think by combining overall good, means we're going to be better for customers. I think we'll able to innovate faster, we'll be able to develop better content, there's obvious areas like procurement and best practice where we can share learnings, insights on part of roadmaps. And I think all of those things overtime will come through both for customers importantly but also for shareholders. I mean we can just start to see the early wins emerging. So to give you two or three examples, we're going to be deploying xFi into Italy for our broadband launch that particularly important because the number of homes in Italy there are NBCU's all quite know housing stocks of Wi-Fi coverage in the home is a real world customer opportunity for us to improve.","We really like the Comcast voice platform. We're going to be incorporating that to the Sky Q and will consolidate that and use the technology there. And as Steve mentioned, we're already sharing our expertise, a lot of the infrastructure we build for the NOW TV service here into the NBCU's OTT service launch. So these are - it's early days, only 15 weeks in, but encouraging I think we are starting to see some really important tangible evidence of working together as part of the broader group.","Jessica Reif Cohen","Thank you.","Jason Armstrong","Thank you, Jessica. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Swinburne","Thank you. Good morning. Sticking with the NBC announcement, Steve when you think about particularly that business outside the United States where there as Jeremy just laid out, there's a lot of non-pay TV households. What led you to the decision to sort of bundle this or link this with the broader NBC bouquet of channels in terms of positioning it for consumers. I know it's going to be available I think for a subscription outside of the bundle, but it seems like it's positioned primarily for bundled customers and outside the U.S. the definition of the bundle gets sort of murky and Sky's been a leader in sort of offering those more skinny tailored bundles. So how do you think about this outside the U.S.?","And then on the licensing side, it sounds like where we shouldn't expect the big impact of financials. I think when I add up 2018's licensing revenues at NBC, it is north of 6 billion across all your businesses and that's been a huge growth driver over the years. How do you think about pulling some of your big titles like the office back on platform overtime and why did you sort of land, where you landed on that approach?","Steve Burke","So, in the United States, 80% of the addressable households are multi-channel subscribers, that's obviously not the case in many places around the world. But between the United States and Sky's footprint in the U.K., we think we should start and try to gain as much scale as possible with an ad supported free to consumer service. There will be countries where we launch. SVOD only, countries that don't have the kind of advertising ecosystem that we have in the United States or in parts of Europe, there will be places where we have different strategies and obviously or the rights we have, the shows we have will vary by country. But if you look at Comcast and Sky alone, Comcast Cable and Sky alone, you're well over 50 million customers. And so the ability have launched to have those 50 million customers, get all those great programming for free, we think not only gets us to scale but is also good for Comcast Cable and Sky. You're going to be offering a lot of good things to people who are subscribing to those services and we'll have those discussions with Charter and DIRECTV and everybody around the world that's a multichannel supplier.","In terms of content and taking things that are currently licensed elsewhere and moving them to the platform, I think it's going to be very positive for us financially because in effect, we're going to be a brand new buyer. So we have long sold to everyone, we've sold to SVOD, we've sold to cable channels that we don't own and even broadcast channels that we don't own. What's our feeling is, if you're in the television business, you should work with the best people, have the best shows and sell them wherever it makes the most sense. And we'll have the same philosophy ourselves. We do feel we under monetize significantly on the Internet and we under monetize on free platforms and we also under monetize on SVOD platforms. So as more and more content becomes available, I think a lot is going to be on our platform, but we will continue to sell on other platforms depending on the show, depending on the prices that we can command for those products. And so I think it's fair to assume that when we launch, we'll have a lot of content, we have a significant amount of content to launch that will only increase overtime. But we'll go show-by-show, instance by instance and figure out what makes sense at the time those rights come back to us.","Benjamin Swinburne","Thank you. That's helpful.","Jason Armstrong","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John Hodulik","Great, thanks. Three question on Cable for Dave. You know lot of focus on the broadband business but the video business is holding up better than we expected, both from a subscriber and a revenue standpoint. Maybe you could just comment a little bit about what you're seeing from a competitive standpoint maybe in terms of code cutting trends as well and given the sort of higher than typical price increases we saw late and early this year, can the revenue improvement that we've seen in that line continue into 2019 versus what we saw in 2018? Thanks.","David Watson","Thanks, John. Well, video remains very competitive area. And I really don't think it's going to change anytime soon. And our game plan is going to remain the same that we're going after and will attract the most profitable video customer relationships that we can. And we're going to continue to manage the shift as Brian and Mike's talked about and focusing very much on the connectivity business. But improving the connectivity business and competing, video still remains an important part of packaging.","So I think the competitive environment remains challenging, we'll watch it closely. And what happens, we always make adjustments and if there are opportunities based on what the competitive landscape is then our packaging will be there to benefit from it. But our main focus is continuing to take X1 leverage that with broadband and we have other opportunities in Mobile to be able to package things. So we're really not changing our approach and it's improved. Overall the financial performance, you look at the overall customer relationships 1 million customer relationships that we've added, obviously fueled and helped by broadband. But when you couple great video with great broadband then I think that it helps us financially. And we'll see what happens in terms of video share but we're so for pleased with this quarter and can't comment too much further into next year.","Brian Roberts","Let me just add that, kudos to the X1 team. I think they launched Amazon really flawlessly at year-end, Amazon Prime video following up on Netflix and YouTube. We've transformed that product every year and made it better. And at the same time, we have a disciplined under Dave's team to look for profitable video as we've made this transition. So it's this alchemy of leading with broadband now, we have way more broadband customers and we do video customers that's a huge shift in the company and we've managed that shift I think to intelligently still invest in our video business but not chase every single subscriber all the time. And I think the balance is why you see great cash flow growth, RGU growth, customer relationship growth, lowest churn, more digital interactions, less cost and free cash flow therefore growing at its best clip in a number of years. So I think it's a real balanced job and led by still a lot of passion around X1 and video.","John Hodulik","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Jason Armstrong","Thank you, John. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip Cusick","Hi, guys, thanks. Can you expand on Cable costs and margins, it looks like you did a similar price increase to last year and you've said that programming costs should again be muted. How do you think we should - how should we think about trends in non-programming OpEx for customer, are you focused on bringing those numbers down further like calls and truck rolls or is margins expansion more a function of mix shifting to broadband and business? And if all that's right, is anything else going on that would mean that margin growth at 50 basis points is the high-end versus the 80 bps you did in 2018? Thanks.","Michael Cavanagh","So Phil, it's Mike. I'll start and Dave can pile on. But I think it's all in 50 basis points of margin improvement. It's some of all of the above, but I think as I've said repeatedly that Dave and team are doing the same things on an ongoing basis in terms of staying focused on non-programming expenses which is the customer experience journey which has been of great value to our customers. And so a virtuous cycle that continues to continue to make it a better more digitized experience which brings out cost in the businesses, gets reinvested in other parts of the experience. But all that's going to continue. And I think confident that non-program expenses will be managed well going forward and it's embedded in that 50 basis points of margin improvement. We said the kind of another lower year of programming expense growth as we predicted two, three years back that that would be the trend. And so again it's all in there.","And there is there is a mix shift going on as you point out and the more we see a shift to connectivity, which we have in the revenue mix that's long term positive trend for the margins in the Cable business as well. And hopefully we beat our expectations like we did last year, but our expectations are 50 basis points of improvement.","Stephen Burke","If I can follow-up\u2026","Brian Roberts","In addition to the connectivity focus that we have which is helps margin that helps us overall in terms of growth, they are emphasize what Brian said just the focus on packaging and going after the profitable customer relationships that we are broadband and video. And we've remained very optimistic about taking transactions out of the business, we spend a lot of time thinking about the digital experience for customers and just the best way to take out unnecessary telephone calls, truck rolls by just letting customers handle their solutions independently. So I think Mike gave the guidance in terms of expectations and margin, but extremely focused on non-programming expense.","Philip Cusick","Mike, if I can follow-up. Now that Dave owns the wireless side, can we assume that those losses have probably peaked?","Michael Cavanagh","We're you know at a level where we're really pleased with what we see happening in the mobility business and hence the move into the cable business. I think we've said for a while now that we're running now at a level of ads that the losses are going to be commensurate with what the ad trajectory looks like from here. So let myself get pinned down on that one but that is the two will go hand in glove with each other and we like the pace of growth that we've had in the business over the course of 2018, I think hopefully we get something similar in 2019.","Philip Cusick","Thanks, guys.","Jason Armstrong","Thank you, Phil. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield with BTIG. Please go ahead.","Rich Greenfield","Hi. Wondering about programming, so DISH dropped Univision earlier this year or late middle of last year and really hasn't seen any meaningful negative impact. We've got the RSNs from Fox which after Fox got out of buying them, looks like they're about to be orphaned. Just curious how you think about rightsizing content within the bundle to provide cheaper packages, we've seen a lot of the vMVPs with much lower cost bundles. And as you kind of have added more of these third party apps, you were just talking about Netflix, Amazon, YouTube being on the set top box, just thinking about like is there the potential to really transform programming cost or bundle dynamics over the next couple of years as deals come up?","Brian Roberts","Thanks, Rich. So a couple of things. I think you raise a very good point. Our focus, we've been very disciplined in our approach to programming and how we value content and the use of data to understand this. So what goes into packaging and so that that has been something that we've been doing for several years now. That's not brand new but we're very focused on understanding the content value. The point you make in X1 is game changing in that as we look at it and we aggregate all the different apps and all the content that's available and the ability to connect all these assets through the great voice recognition capability delivered 9 billion voice commands last year. So X1 just gives a strategic flexibility with programming options. And so and we look at it very broadly that way and we provide I think the best of live, the on demand in terms of DVR and then now with all this new content that comes on, I think that just gives us the strategic flexibility. So I think it's a very good point and we look at it that way.","Jason Armstrong","Thank you, Rich. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Craig Moffett","Hi. Good morning. Brian, I got a strategic question for you on the wireless business. Now that you've had your wireless MVNO operating for about a year now and seem to have settled into a sort of solid growth pattern. What have you learned and how do you think about the relationship with Verizon going forward and sort of where would you like that relationship to go? And then as a related issue, how does that inform, you are thinking about the 600 megahertz spectrum that you purchased in the last auction?","Brian Roberts","Well, I don't think we have any new revelations on that last part of the question on the 600 megahertz. But I think we're very pleased with the relationship with Verizon, big companies there's always going to be some issue somewhere between those one moment in time or another. But if you step back and say we've become a meaningful contributor to the wireless net adds in our markets where constantly looking to innovate the product and make sure we have the latest offerings available, sometimes we're successful that, sometimes where we're not perfect. And I think we've hit a good stride as Mike and Dave were just talking about it. So I think the strategy to become a meaningful part of some other folk's networks rather than go out and build our own very comfortable with that broad category of question. There's plenty in the detail that is always being worked on.","Dave, you're closer to it. I just want to add one of the point then before that is what we learned. We've learned the wireless can really achieve what we thought, which is to reduce churn for the customers who take all our products. And if you go back to the Uber view that we're now looking for profitable relationships and make those relationships deeper, more digital, better experience and better value, wireless checks a lot of those boxes particularly on value, the way we are structured, simple offer, there is only two options, customers get it. Most of the people take by the gig and that is how our relationship with Verizon works. So it sets up economically to be some particle. And I think we're on a trajectory that we believe we can get to as we said standalone economics that support the business and we're on our way.","David Watson","Yeah, I would add that we participate as Brian said in the mobile business and pleased with the progress that we're making. We also participate in wireless. We generate a lot of data traffic over Wi-Fi in the home, over 80% of the data traffic on smart phones is delivered through Wi-Fi. So I think we're beneficial to each other's networks in that way. We're pleased in that the reason - one of the main reasons as Brian mentioned, we looked at broadband retention. it's early days but it's working and the contribution of that when mobile consideration is people go to retail and look at other sales channels that we have and they are asking about mobile than they consider other lines of business. So all of these things are encouraging and I'm pleased with our progress.","Craig Moffett","Thank you.","Jason Armstrong","Thank you, Craig. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Doug Mitchelson","Thank you so much. Good morning. One for Steve, one for Dave. Steve, it seems like the media trends, advertising and pay TV subs are a bit better than investors might have expected. And last quarter, you mentioned that virtually MVPDs have plateaued and suggesting core kicked in commentary this quarter, pay TV sub and trends are improving suggest the offer. I just want to get my bearings on what you saw for video subscriber trends in 2018 on your fully distributed channels, since you have the broadest distribution of any media company and what you expect in 2019?","And I'll just throw the question for Dave in there as well. Just any update on trends for high speed Internet subscriber growth in 2019 and the pricing environment as well. I do note in 2018, a lot of the high speed Internet customers came from single play which was different from 2017 and prior. And any thoughts as to whether that boosted growth in 2018 or whether you feel that was a pretty normal steady state type growth rate would be helpful? Thanks.","Steve Burke","So, I think we've always felt that the television ecosystem was healthier than maybe some people thought. We really had an extraordinary television year this year we grew EBITDA by 15% which was way in excess of what we thought we would grow EBITDA and there were a whole bunch of factors in there. In terms of subscribers, we were - we had better year in terms of subscribers than we had budgeted and were entered 2019 better than we had forecast. It's very hard to predict the virtual MVPDs. If you look quarterly. The virtual MVPD growth somebody who might be the fastest growing and the first quarter might be the slowest and the second quarter as they change strategies and people figure out the market. But virtual MVPD growth was faster than we thought in 2018. At some point, we do believe it's going to slow down but we've did not - certainly did not see that in 2018. 2018 and the early part of 2019 are also very strong years for advertising. We had the strongest up front we've ever had. The network, primetime you know our ad sales were up double digits. The scatter market is extremely strong right now. So the television business you know we obviously have pressure on ratings as people migrated to digital and that's why one of the reasons why we're launching the direct-to-consumer product, but it's a very, very healthy business and we think it's going to be healthy for years to come.","David Watson","Hey, Doug, Dave. So you know thinking about broadband, you know we feel about broadband in 2019 as we have in 2018 that it's our growth engine. And you know there as Brian mentioned, there's a consistency that we have had in broadband you know the 13th year in a row consecutively delivering over 1 million net additions. And so behind that going into 2019, feel the market continues to grow, you look you look at things like homes, employment, you look at macro conditions. But just as important as anything you look at the overall market penetration of 80%, there is room for growth there, you look at our penetration you know 47%, there is absolutely room for growth there. So you know in our view is that customers' expectations you know continue to go up in terms of how they're interacting with broadband, how they're leveraging it. So you know our focus is Brian as said is deliver the very best broadband product in the marketplace and xFi is that brand, the best of speed, coverage and control. And so in 2019, we're going to continue to do that.","And along with that your point on single product and packaging, we've made some adjustments along the way. I think that it's more - our game plan is consistent, will be consistent, we do offer a great options for both. And if somebody wants to start off with the high speed only, that's great, but we also have wonderful packaging options that will talk to them about. So as important as anything as you look at the balancing share growth and rate, so you look at that I feel confident as well, in 2018 you know we along with great share, we grew the resi ARPU by more than 4% year-over-year for 2018. And if you look at then combining the overall continuity business, Bryan and Mike has mention that you look at business services, you know a big part of that is broadband and resi broadband you know it's growing nearly 10%, 24 billion. So we like our momentum, we like our game plan, I think it's very consistent and we're just going to focus on execution.","Douglas Mitchelson","Thanks so much.","Jason Armstrong","Great, Thank you, Doug. Regina, let's take one more question please.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Marci Ryvicker","Thank you. I have one for Steve and then one for Mike. Steve, as you launch the OTT business, I know you're not going to have a tremendous amount of incremental investment then. But as you do, where is that going to flow through the financial, is that going to be in the separate segments, is that going to be in the studios, I guess just trying to figure out what we're looking for?","And then second for Mike. You talked about healthy EBITDA growth for Sky for 2019. When you say healthy do you mean the same 2% adjusted for 2018 or are you talking more mid-single-digits, I'm just trying to understand what your messaging? Thanks.","Stephen Burke","So we currently have a several very profitable and successful television studios, cable one and a broadcast one and an international one and those studios will continue to produce for our existing channels. And increasingly over time, produce for direct-to-consumer and we will figure out the right kind of transfer pricing and margin for those services, so that everybody's to produce and continue to produce for all different outlets.","Michael Cavanagh","And I am Mike. For Sky, healthy means you know really growth in customers, growth across all markets and you know growth in financial results which is better you know higher than last year is what I would say healthy is mid-single-digits is a fair you know level to think about. And I did point out that will be more back and waited for the reasons I have mentioned earlier just sports rights you know coming, reset for Italy in August of last year, so we'll have to in the second half of the year we'll lap that and we'll see the improved rates for Premier League and the UK business kick in in the second half. So we'll achieve that healthy growth over the course of the year with back half lighter and back end second half heavier.","Brian Roberts","So let me just end the call by saying really how please we were at 2018 and we're off to a great start in 2019. I think just that last answer that Mike gave, we look at Sky as really unique, it's different than Cable and it's taking all of us time to understand those differences and the same thing, it's got the content company and it's covers the entire footprint where it offers its product. So as it renegotiates, it's probably got different characteristics than either of our two businesses. But I think you're going to like what you see and it's going to add to our capabilities worldwide. And those capabilities really do come together I think in the OTT announcement just to pick that as an example because not only will it draw out the best of our content creation capabilities whether that's in film or television, whether that's original or you know recurring series, it needs broadband to get the great capabilities of that streaming service and that's the core of where the cable companies focused. As we discuss this morning and that broadband had a fantastic 2018. And xFi has a roadmap of innovation unto itself in 2019 and beyond which is as exciting as what we've done previously on great speed and now we're looking at other ways. And all this takes advantage of X1 and Q which are the best capabilities in the world in what we do. We can always do better, we had 500 engineers meeting yesterday in our new Technology Center and we've just got a real you know I think credibility in the technology space now to keep innovating. And it all comes back to what we give our customers and we see how well Sky's performance has been and customer experience and NPS make great progress on the cable side taking truck rolls out and calls as we've heard NPS performance improvement.","So all in all you know that's what's giving us the confidence to raise the dividend and to start 2019 off to a great start. So thank you to the team.","Jason Armstrong","Thank you everyone for joining us today.

Please refer to our 8-K for the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.","With that, let me turn the call to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian?","Brian Roberts","Thanks, Marlene, and good morning everyone. I\u2019m really pleased with this quarters results particularly the outstanding growth in high speed internet and a strong performance across NBC Universal\u2019s businesses, leading us to having a very solid second quarter with revenue growth of 7%, cash flow growth of more than 8% and record second quarter free cash flow of nearly $2 billion.","Michael will discuss these results in more detail. Let me start by providing some highlights. Cable had another strong quarter with revenue and cash flow growth of nearly 6% and high speed internet business services and video continuing to power our growth. Business services has impressive organic momentum with the highest growth rate of all our businesses at 26%. We once again improved our year-over-year customer performance. We added an 189,000 combined video, voice, internet customers, which is a 37% increase from last year\u2019s second quarter.","High speed internet led the way with 20% growth or 187,000 net additions. This was our highest level of high speed internet performance in net ads in the second quarter in the last five years. Our voice business also had another strong quarter with a 161,000 net additions and consistent with our goal of ongoing improvement in video, we reduced video losses by nearly 17,000 year-over-year. So helping to drive these results is our innovation which is delivering increasing differentiated and better services.","In the last six months, we substantially increased the speeds of our high speed Internet service for nearly 14 million customers or 70% of our base. And in the last year, we've increased service speeds across our entire footprint.","We also continued to expand the availability of Wi-Fi which is at the center of our strategy to offer our customers the fastest online experience across devices both inside and out of the home. We have now installed more than 4 million wireless gateways and increased our Wi-Fi coverage to 250,000 hotspots through both our cable partnership and our home hotspot initiative.","In video we have launched X1, our new cloud-enabled platform to more than half of our footprint and we're on track to have X1 available nationwide by yearend. Many of you have seen our demonstration of X2 and we will have this enhanced user interface in the market by yearend.","X2 illustrates how quickly we can now upgrade via software to provide a brand new experience to our customers on the same X1 hardware and platform. All-in-all, cable's having a great first half of the year and Neil Smit and his team continue to execute really well.","Let me now switch to NBCUniversal where we also have strong momentum. In the second quarter, every one of the NBCUniversal businesses contributed to revenue growth of nearly 9% and operating cash flow growth of 21%. Our Cable Networks drove strong cash flow performance in the second quarter. And we also benefited from steady progress at the theme park and in broadcast as expected.","We saw strengthening results from our cable entertainment networks particularly at USA and Bravo as well as strong sports performance from NBC's sports network which enjoyed its most watched NHL Playoffs in record and golf channel which recorded its most watched second quarter ever.","Just last week, we announced the 10-year agreement that will bring NASCAR to our broadcasting cable properties beginning in 2015. The quantity and quality of content in this deal is a really significant step for the NBC's sports group.","In film, our focus is to continue to build franchises and we've had some ups and downs but we've had two big successes with Fast 6 in the second quarter and more recently with Despicable Me 2 from Chris Meledandri and a talented team at Illumination.","This is our first full quarter of ownership of all of NBCUniversal, and given the strong performance and market conditions that we had at the time we made our decision, I feel really great about the timing and structure of the purchase of the 49% interest. So the entire company is executing really well in our many different businesses. And with such a strong quarter and a great first half of the year, it makes us optimistic about our fantastic combination of businesses that have so many growth opportunities ahead.","Let me now pass to Michael to cover the second quarter results in detail.","Michael Angelakis","Good morning. Thank you, Brian. Let me begin by briefly reviewing our second quarter consolidated financial results starting on slide 4. Overall, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance which demonstrates consistent execution, profitable growth and the fundamental strength in our businesses.","Second quarter consolidated revenue increased 7% to 16.3 billion and operating cash flow increased 8.4% to 5.4 billion reflecting strong organic growth in both our Cable Communications and NBCUniversal businesses.","Free cash flow for the second quarter which excludes any impact of the economic stimulus increased 25.4% to 1.9 billion and free cash flow per share increased 28.1% to $0.73 per share in the quarter.","This growth was primarily driven by increases in consolidated operating cash flow and improvements in working capital that reflected strong performance of our film slate and timing of production, which was partially offset by increased capital expenditures and cash taxes.","Earnings per share for the quarter increased 30% to $0.65 per share compared to $0.50 per share in the second quarter of 2012. On a consolidated basis, these are strong results. Now let's review the results of our businesses in more detail starting with Cable Communications on slide 5.","We are pleased with our second quarter performance of healthy revenue growth and improved customer metrics in our Cable Communications business. We continue to focus on executing the appropriate balance between customer and financial growth. In the second quarter, Cable Communications' revenue increased 5.8% to 10.5 billion driven by continued strength in high-speed Internet and business services as well as higher video and voice revenue.","As a result, total revenue per video customer increased 7.4% to $160 per month. Contributing to the revenue growth our rate adjustments, growth in our customer base and increase in the number of customers receiving higher levels of our services and an increasing number of customers taking multiple products.","From a customer relationship standpoint, we continued to make progress on our bundling strategy and at the end of the second quarter, 77% of our video customers took at least two products and 42% took all three services.","Despite the typical second quarter seasonality in many of our markets, we experienced strong growth in our customer metrics and showed year-over-year improvements across all our products. Combined video, high-speed Internet and voice customers increased by 189,000, a 37% increase in net customer additions compared to the second quarter of 2012.","We improved our video losses by 10% as we lost 159,000 video subscribers in the second quarter compared to a loss of 176,000 in last year's second quarter. As Brian mentioned, these are the best second quarter customer results for both our video and high-speed Internet services in the past five years.","Our second quarter video revenue increased 2.7% driven by the intact of rate increases partially offset by lower pay-per-view revenue which reflects fewer events in this quarter. In addition, the higher revenue reflects an increasing number of customers taking advanced services.","In the second quarter, we added 51,000 advanced service customers and now have 12.1 million Hi-Def into our DVR customer\u2019s equals 55% of our video customers. High-speed Internet revenue was again the largest contributor to cable revenue growth with revenue increasing 8% driven by rate adjustments and continued growth in our customer base as we added 187,000 new high-speed Internet customers, a 20% improvement over last year.","We continue to improve and differentiate a high-speed Internet service and over the last year we have increased service speeds across our entire footprint, increasing our primary service from 15 to 20 or 25 megabits and doubled our blast service 25 megabits to 50 megabits.","At the end of the quarter, 33% of our residential high-speed customers take a higher speed tier above our primary service and our penetration was now at 37% of home stats. With regards to our voice service revenue, it increased 2.4% for the quarter reflecting growth in our customer base as we continue to focus on the value of our triple play bundle.","In the second quarter, we added 161,000 new voice customers, a 2% increase over last year as we successfully converted single and double play customers to triple play and acquired new triple play customer relationships. At the end of the second quarter, our voice penetration was 19% of home stats.","Moving from our consumer to our commercial businesses, we continued to experience momentum in business services which was our second largest contributor to cable revenue growth during the second quarter with revenue increasing 26.4% to 788 million for the quarter.","The small end of the market where businesses with less than 20 employees account for nearly 85% of business services revenue and continue to be a significant driver of our growth. The midsized business which is growing at a higher than 50% annualized rate continues to represent approximately 15% of this group's revenue.","Switching to our cable advertising group, revenue increased 1% during the second quarter. However, when you exclude the impact of last year's political revenue, our core cable advertising revenue grew by 5%.","Please move to slide six. Second quarter cable communication\u2019s operating cash flow increased 5.7% to $4.3 billion representing a consistent margin of 41.4%. In the second quarter total expenses in cable increased 5.8%, primarily reflecting higher programming expenses and advertising and marketing promotional expenses as well as additional costs related to the expansion of business services in XFINITY Home.","Programming expenses increases 8.1% in the second quarter reflecting higher rates in step ups related to certain agreements, increasing retransmission consent fees and our expanding content lined up on multiple platforms partially offset by a delay in certain network launches. We are pleased with our management of these costs year-to-date but continue to expect programming expense growth to accelerate to low double-digits in the second half of 2013 due to planned step ups in certain contracts and the timing of network launches. As a result we expect our full-year programming expanses to increase by approximately 10%.","In addition advertising, marketing and promotion expenses increased 8% reflecting higher overall media spend and a continued investment in direct sales to support growth and enhance our competitive position in both our residential and commercial businesses. These increased marketing efforts have had a positive impact on our core customer metrics as well as promoting new products such as X1 in XFINITY Home. We continue to offset these increased expenses through modest rate adjustments, in improving product mix, an increasing number of customers upgrading to higher levels of service such as HD and DVRs and faster internet speeds as well as further efficiency gains.","We continue to pursue efficiency gains in the second quarter as we reduced our activity levels by nearly 1 million truck rolls even as we added 189,000 total new customers. Customers continue to elect self-installations, which in the second quarter accounted for 40% of our total installations, compared to 28% in the second quarter of last year. In addition, we now have 31% of our customers managing their accounts online.","All of these improvements result in a better experience for our customers and improve productivity for our cable operations. Now let\u2019s move on to NBCUniversal\u2019s results, please refer to slide seven. For the second quarter of 2013 NBCUniversal\u2019s revenue increased 8.9% and operating cash flow increased 21.3%. Now to take a closer look at the individual segment\u2019s at NBCUniversal.","For the second quarter cable networks generated revenue of $2.4 million an increase of 7.7% driven by an new content licensing agreement, a 4.4% increase in distribution revenue and a 5.7% increase in advertising revenue as ratings pressure at some of our cable networks was more than offset by a strong scatter market. Cable networks operating cash flow increased 8.9% to $860 million in the second quarter reflecting improved revenue performance and lower advertising, marketing and promotional expense partially offset by a 9% increase in programming and production cost as we continue to invest in original programming to enhance our franchises.","With regards to our broadcast television segment, revenue increased 11.6% to $1.7 billion in the second quarter reflecting an increase in advertising due to higher prime time ratings driven by the timing of key shows primarily the voice and higher retransmission consent fees offset by lower content licensing revenue due to the timing of content availability. Broadcast\u2019s operating cash flow increase 6.4% to $206 million in the second quarter reflecting higher revenue in increased programming and production costs associated with the timing of certain shows and our prime time schedule.","Moving to film entertainment, our second quarter revenue increased 12.8% to $1.4 billion driven by higher theatrical revenue from the strong box office performance of \u201cFast & Furious 6, from higher content licensing revenue from the availability of prior films in the international TV market and higher home entertainment revenue driven by the continued success of \u201cLes Miserables\u201d. Films operating cash flow increased $116 million to $33 million reflecting a strong performance of the studio\u2019s film slate.","Switching to our theme park segment, revenue increased 1.1% to $546 million and operating cash flow decreased 1.6% to $231 million reflecting the fact that the holidays occurred in the first quarter of this year compared to the second quarter of last year. Even with this shift theme parks are performing well as a solid result are driven by healthy attendance and increased per capita spending which continue to benefit from the success of the Harry Potter attraction in Orlando and the Transformers attraction in Hollywood partially offset by an increase in operating cost to support the addition of new attractions.","Let\u2019s move to slide eight, to review our consolidated in-segment capital expenditures. Consistent with our plan in the second quarter consolidated capital expenditures increased 17.1% to $1.5 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the second quarter of 2012. In year-to-date capital expenditures have increased 16.5% to $2.9 billion reflecting increased investments at both cable and NBCUniversal. Cable Communications, second quarter capital expenditures increased $160 million or 10.4% to $1.2 billion, equal to 11.9% of cable revenue versus 11.4% in the second quarter of 2012.","The increase primarily reflects higher spending on CPE such as advanced digital box\u2019s including X1 in wireless gateways, our continued investments in network infrastructure to ensure our leadership in video and high-speed internet, as well as the expansion of new services that will generate attractive returns such as business services and XFINITY Home. Year-to-date cable communications capital expenditures have increased 7.1% to $2.3 billion representing 11.3% of cable revenue. We continue to expect that for the full-year of 2013 cable capital expenditures will increase by approximately 10% compared to 2012.","At NBCUniversal capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2013 increased $104 million to $260 million and year-to-date have increased $256 million to $523 million. This higher CapEx is primarily driven by the increased investments in theme parks as we build new attractions. We're now accelerating NBCUniversal\u2019s capital investment plan primarily driven by the theme parks investment in new attractions such as Transformers and expansion of Harry Porter in Orlando as well as Despicable Me in Hollywood. As a result of this acceleration we now expect NBCUniversal\u2019s full-year 2013 capital investment plan will increase by approximately 50% from 2012 to approximately $1.1 billion.","The investments we\u2019ve made in our theme parks over the last few years have reset the level of our parks profitability and have yielded very strong returns. We expect these investments to do the same. Please refer to slide nine.","As I mentioned earlier, we generated consolidated free cash flow of $1.9 billion in the second quarter, an increase of 25.4% compared to last years second quarter. This result translates in a free cash flow per share increase of 28.1% to $0.73 per share. For the first half of the year we generated $5.1 billion in free cash flow an increase of 10.7% over the first half of 2012. In year-to-date free cash flow per share has increased 13% to $1.90 per share.","We ended the second quarter with consolidated debt of $46.6 billion plus $725 million of subsidiary preferred stock resulting in a debt to operating cash flow leverage ratio of 2.3 times. We view our balance sheet as a strategic asset and are focused on strengthening our financial position over the next few years with the medium-term leverage ratio target of 1.5 to 2 times.","We are executing on our 2013 financial plan, and year-to-date we have returned $1.9 billion of capital to shareholders including share repurchases totaling $1 billion and dividend payments totaling $942 million. Overall we're very pleased with the operational and financial progress we have made during the first six months of this year. We believe that our disciplined investments along with our focus on execution will continue to generate healthy organic growth and yield positive results.","Now let me turn the call over to Marlene for Q&A.","Marlene Donner","Thanks, Michael. Operator, let\u2019s open up the call for Q&A please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator instructions). Our first question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. One Cable and one NBCUniversal. On Cable, I'd love to get your views on M&A. Is there any room for Comcast to grow either domestically or internationally?","Brian Roberts","Okay, why don't I take that question? Morning, Jessica. I mean with regards to M&A, I think you can tell by the results we have just posted, we are really focused on executing our business plan and we really think there is a lot of organic growth opportunities in the business. That being said, we always want to look at everything, we want to be educated, we really want to spend time internationally. We have about $4.5 billion of our roughly $65 billion revenue base in international, so we're bit underweight and every country is very different and certainly relates to NBCUniversal and some of their business. So I would say number one, we're really focused on just running the business and executing our plan. Number two, we remain very disciplined and we have these strategic and financial filters that we utilize for all M&A. And number three, we want to make sure we're very well educated on what the market is in those kinds of items. So I think that sort of summarizes how we view M&A both domestically and internationally.","Jessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a follow-up on that one but how big are you legally? Is there a limit in terms of how big you can get in the U.S. in Cable?","Brian Roberts","I don't think there really is. There's been a number of rulemakings that have been knocked down, but obviously that's a gray area.","Jessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then I guess turning to NBCUniversal, you guys in the past have spoken about an entitlement gap and I was just wondering if you could address that in terms of where you are on both affiliate fees and CPMs for the cable networks? And I guess the same question on broadcast in terms of CPMs and retrans?","Brian Roberts","So just to define it, entitlement gap is what we call a gap between the true performance of our cable channels and broadcast network and what our CPMs are relative to other like channels and what our affiliate fees our. On the affiliate fees side, we've reset about 25% of our affiliate deals in the last year or so and made good progress, but the other 75% will occur in the years to come and we think there's clearly a gap in terms of what we deserve to be paid and what we are paid based on where the marketplace is. On the advertising side, we have the same kind of gap and the same kind of opportunity. In some instances there are cable channels and broadcast channels that get over 20% more than we do on a CPM basis. And I think over time we'll have the opportunity to eliminate that gap or start to chip away at that gap. We just finished the upfront and we made good progress toward eliminating that gap both from the broadcast side and on the cable side. On the broadcast side, net of the Olympics, we sold about 13% more that we sold last year. Our ratings in CPM performance on the NBC side were the best we've had in about nine years and we made up relative performance versus our other competitors. On the cable side, we also had good results. Our cable CPMs were up in the 7% to 8% range. USA and Bravo did very well. And one of the ways that we accomplished this was we sold all of our properties together, which for a company like ours with so many different television properties, allowed us to go into the market with a one-stop shop being sort of the full integrated approach and we think that worked. So, we're chipping away at the entitlement gap. We think it's a big opportunity for the company. It's not something that we're going to get in the quarter or even a year, but I think over the next two, three, four years you'll see real progress there.","Jessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Marlene Dooner","Thank you, Jessica. Operator, let's go to the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs","Great, thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions both on the Cable side. I guess first video and broadband metrics both better in the quarter and better in the quarter and better year-over-year. Is there any sort of promotional activity you'd call out that maybe contributed to and above current quarter and 2Q or as we think forward about this, should we continue to expect sort of year-over-year improvement in those metrics? And then second, just on the content cost, 8.1% growth this quarter I think. You obviously talked about it accelerating in the back half of the year. Are we supposed to think of this as sort of relative the initial guidance we've sort of pushed out a number of the resets by maybe six months or so to some of this sold into 2014? Thanks.","Neil Smit","Hi, Jason. It's Neil. On the video and broadband side, I'd say that there was no unique promotional activity this quarter that would have driven the performance in the sub numbers. I think on the video side, we're putting out a great product and the X1 product is out over half our footprint right now. We reduced losses by 17k, so we're executing well. The channel performance has been strong in the online channel. So I think it's just a combination of execution on the channel side as well as just getting better product out there that's helping on the video front. With HSV we've done speed upgrades in the first half of the year. We have about 14 million customers, that's 70% of our footprint. We did speed upgrades. We're putting out the new fastest gateways to have the fastest Wi-Fi in the household. So I think our product is fundamentally a better product and I think customers are recognizing that. With regards to the programming side, yes our costs were below what we expected. We had an NHL rebate and some delays in channel launches or network launches. However, we do expect double digit increases in the out half of the year and we expect to come in on the year at about 10%. The costs are driven by sports programming, retrans and getting more rights across more platforms which we're able to leverage into more value and a better value proposition for the customer.","Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs","Okay, thank you.","Marlene Dooner","Thanks, Jason. Operator, let's go to the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Marlene Dooner","Doug?","Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank","I'm sorry about that. Good morning. For Neil or Brian, with so many major tech companies working towards online video services, do you feel any building pressure to accelerate getting the X1 and X2 versions of your video service into customers homes and is there a way to accelerate the rollout of advanced user interfaces whether it's X1, X2 or for lack of a better phase a dumdum version of X2? And if I could just throw in the question for Neil which is the RBOC posted strong net adds year-over-year but I don't feel the competitive impact in your numbers. Did you see a competitive impact from the RBOC and made it up against satellite or was the market just better in the second quarter? Thanks.","Neil Smit","I'll take the questions in a reverse order, Doug. We did see year-over-year about a 200 basis point increase in RBOC mostly by AT&T. That's about 1 million subs, so we think our performance given that is we're very pleased with our performance in reducing video losses and I think it comes out to execution. With regards to X1 and X2, we've got X1 out about \u2013 across 53% of our market. We're launching in foreign markets every day, this week seven new markets and the customer response has been very favorable. VOD views are up about 20%. 55% of the people react very favorably to this product over existing guys, premiums are up. It's too early to tell on churn yet but I think there might be some favorable trends there. We'd like to accelerate \u2013 we're going to rollout X2 and it kind of shows a benefit of having everything up in the cloud. We're getting X1 across the country of course this year and X2 will already be coming in before the end of the year. So I think that really demonstrates the flexibility and nimbleness of having the platform structured the way it is.","Brian Roberts","Let me just add, I don't want to be redundant but I think Neil's point on the 1 million extra homes from RBOC competition does make the results even more impressive in my opinion. And we've all seen an overbuild but that first year is the hardest year, and so anytime you have a lot of new homes, so be it and you have to deal with that in certain markets. That's part of the motive for rolling out X1 faster, but the real part of the motive for rolling out X1 faster is it is so well received and the ability to be more flexible. So your question is a great question that we don't have a perfect answer on right this minute which is, is there a way to get a version of it to more customers faster and we're looking at a whole lot of ideas around that question all the time and we'll probably experiment with a few. And so stay tuned, but we\u2019re all in all it\u2019s a high class opportunity that we\u2019re very pleased with the development. Right now the plan is steady as she goes, but it\u2019s a good question.","Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank","Thank you very much.","Marlene Dooner","Thanks, Doug. Operator, let\u2019s go to the next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason Bazinet with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Jason Bazinet - Citigroup","I just had a question for Mr. Burke. Given the capital investments that you\u2019re making in the theme park portion of NBCU, I was wondering if there is any sort of heuristic that you will be willing to share in terms of, how much a specific amount of capital you\u2019d expect to translate in the incremental attendance growth? Thank you.","Steve Burke","I\u2019m not sure I even know what the words heuristic means, but let me try to answer your question.","Jason Bazinet - Citigroup","Rule of thumb.","Steve Burke","Every single one of our projects has a IRR and we\u2019ve a hurdle and we always look at that and analyze that before we spend the money we do believe the theme park business is a great business that we\u2019ve a very talented team both from the operations and the creative side and that investments they\u2019re going to pay off. If you look at just Florida, when we open Harry Potter, the first Harry Potter, our attendance went up over 40% and we\u2019re opening a secondary Potter just as a \u2013 by way of example next year fantastic attraction going to be connected to the first one in a very innovative way, very creative and that project like every other project goes through rigorous financial model. I happen to believe that on these projects for the foreseeable future, we\u2019re going to beat our IRR substantially because we\u2019re starting to get some real critical path \u2013 critical mass and here is a little bit of an add on effect. But we look at it all, and wouldn\u2019t be making the investments if we didn\u2019t think they clear our hurdle rates.","Michael Angelakis","Let me just pile on a little bit. Obviously, these things go through pretty rigorous analysis, but also the team has done a fabulous job when you look at Harry Potter, King Kong, Transformers, some of the more recent projects, they\u2019ve clearly exceeded our return threshold, both on attendance and on per capita spend. So, the theme parks really have some momentum and we\u2019re going to continue to invest in those project areas where we think the IRRs are really attractive.","Jason Bazinet - Citigroup","Thank you.","Marlene Dooner","Thanks, Jason. Operator, let\u2019s go to the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ben Swinburne - Morgan Stanley","Thanks. Good morning. Michael, I want to come back to the AT&T build out, I think a lot of their targets seems to be around commercial. So just curious if you guys are taking about how you invest in that business or run that business differently if you\u2019re seeing them more aggressive in the market. They certainly spend a lot of time on their call on trying to defend the small business side of the business, their business. And then, Steve just on the NBC upfront which clearly looks like a big success, given the rating strength last year. How much of that 13% increase were you selling more inventory versus just stronger audience guarantees versus last year to clearly got a lot of momentum with the voice in some other shows heading into the fall? Thanks.","Steve Burke","I will take the business services question Ben. The business had a great quarter growing at 26.5%. Its still about 85% small business and 15% mid size, but the mid size is growing at a faster rate more really pleased with the growth there. In terms of CapEx investment, we continue to invest behind the business. It\u2019s a high growth business, our highest growth business. The absolute dollars are growing in the nice way and we\u2019re \u2013 primarily our CapEx is invested in extending the network and in CPE. Bill Stemper has done a great job organizing the team and so I think we\u2019ll continue with the investment behind it. Michael anything you would add?","Michael Angelakis","I would just add also, I think we made this point in the last quarter that last year and this year we reclassified about a $165 million -- $160 million of revenue, which was really sort of hotels and bars and some commercial. That\u2019s not growing very fast. So, if you really at the core business services, which is the one Neil is talking about you\u2019ve to add about 200 basis points in growth. So, really for the quarter grew about 28% plus, which listen the business is doing well comparatively to executing and we\u2019re investing behind it. So, on an apples-to-apples basis, I\u2019d say that we\u2019re looking at high 20s in terms of comparisons.","Steve Burke","And on the competition front, we\u2019re seeing AT&T and Verizon advertise more their services. We feel we\u2019re only about 10% penetrated and we\u2019ve got lot of room for growth there.","Ben Swinburne - Morgan Stanley","Thanks.","Michael Angelakis","So back in NBC in terms of the upfront, the CPM increase is for prime time we\u2019re in the 7% to 8% range and we sold a little bit more, because we have more demand. I think we \u2013 overall we feel like we had on a relative basis a good year in terms of ratings and then we were able to get a little bit more of the what we call the entitlement gap.","Ben Swinburne - Morgan Stanley","Thank you.","Marlene Dooner","Thanks, Ben. Operator, let\u2019s go to the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Phil Cusick - JPMorgan","Hey guys, I guess two one broadband. The follow-up a little bit from an earlier one, is there still a lot of penetration potential in broadband? Other people seem to be slowing down, doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s happening for you and despite again as you pointed out he telco competition. Is there still potential to continue at this pace for another year or two? And then second on the Wi-Fi side, how big can you remind us, are you going to get here and how do you think of the business model? What\u2019s really the customer proposition? Thanks.","Steve Burke","I think 37% penetration in broadband we still see a lot of room for growth. There is still significant DSL market out there and we feel we\u2019ve got fundamentally a better product. We continue to invest \u2013 behind the network and in both capacity and speed as well as in the Wi-Fi gateways that we\u2019re putting out now that have a just better throughput and better capacity. On the Wi-Fi side, we look at in two forms. One is the household Wi-Fi. I mean, people are hanging more devices off their Wi-Fi, routers everyday and our new Wi-Fi gateways will put through 250 megabit versus the previous versions at 80. So we can use lot more capacity for more devices and we see that as a fundamental proposition to the customer. We are also building out Wi-Fi on the metro side and we\u2019ve about 250,000 access points, both our own as well as with the cable alliance. And people are using it more and more with the usage going up, unique usage going up, and it\u2019s a real value proposition on the data side that the customers will continue investing behind Wi-Fi growth.","Michael Angelakis","I just want to add maybe a perspective to that question. I don\u2019t think any of us can perfectly see the future and therefore that I don\u2019t know the answer how far and how long it goes. But one of the things that I think the team here has done incredibly well is we redefined the product from connecting a wire to a PC to bringing your home to be the most enabled way to get that, which is important to you. So for instance, the momentum in tablets, the momentum in content being distributed, the momentum in apps and the innovation around the entire sector and mobile devices, the best way to enjoy all of that is to start by getting our high-speed data product, and that\u2019s because it connects to our home gateways and to Wi-Fi and all the things Neil just talked about. And that\u2019s why I think we want to \u2013 as we set our site to just be the best platform for a consumer and starts with getting one of or products for taking our bundle. And I think that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing better growth each year and as you say 37% in that regard doesn\u2019t sound like a number we can\u2019t continue to grow off of.","Philip Cusick - JPMorgan","Thanks, Michael.","Marlene Dooner","Thank you, Phil. Operator, lets go to the next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks, I have two questions, one for cable one NBCU, so first for Michael and Neil, in cable is there anything that you can say about the long-term CapEx trends in cable with the roll out of X1 and X2, I mean is there any reason to think that at some point CapEx would show a more significant year-over-year increase than the 10% you\u2019re guiding to for \u201913. And then on the NBCU side, Steve any thoughts on how the launch of Fox Sports 1 might impact NBCU and the desire for more sports programming down the line?","Michael Angelakis","Hi, it's Michael Marci, how are you? Why don\u2019t I take the long-term CapEx question; really we don\u2019t \u2013 I think you know \u2013 provide any guidance beyond sort of the first year. I would say with regards to this year we increased capital a bit more than last year. The majority of that additional capital was for, what I would think is really exciting projects whether it's the launch of X1 in sort of further deployment of that of XFINITY Home or business services or the wireless gateways we just talked about. All of those projects have really attractive returns for our Company. So we\u2019re delighted to invest in them, we think that they\u2019re sort of adding customer lifetime value to our customer base. As we look at \u201914 I think it's a bit too early but we still have some of the same opportunities ahead of us and one of the other folks asked earlier about X1 and X2 and we\u2019re going to continue to push broadband and continue to push wireless gateways. So I don\u2019t have a crystal ball of '14 in future years but we have a number of organic opportunities ahead of us that we think are very attractive.","Brian Roberts","Regarding Fox Sports 1, I don't think it changes the playing field for NBC Sports too much one way or the other. We've always had a lot of competition for rights between ESPN and Fox and Turner and others. A lot of people have been in the sports business competing with rights with us for a long time. I do think things look very good for both NBC Sports on the network and the NBC Sports network, partly because we recently won the rights to NASCAR. And we look at NASCAR as being a very, very important thing for the NBC Sports network and the network itself, because it basically gives us 20 weekends a year at a time when the NHL was not playing. So now we have year round professional sports very highly rated and that was a big win for the NBC Sports network. But I don't really think Fox Sports 1 plays into that too much. It's always been competitive, it always will be, and we think we have a unique way of looking at sports and a real place in the marketplace.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities","Thank you.","Marlene Dooner","Thanks, Marci. Operator, let's go to the next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Craig Moffett with Moffett Research. Please go ahead.","Craig Moffett - Moffett Research","Good morning. Two quick questions if I may. One, with John Malone having spoken so much about the balance sheet capacity in the M&A story and willingness to take leverage levels up to four times or so, Michael, has any of that conversation led you to reevaluate your own comfort levels with different leverage and would you consider adding any more leverage to the balance sheet? And then a question for Neil, as you roll out the Wi-Fi gateways that you're doing, have you changed your thinking at all on the prospect of offering a sort of wireless service that is Wi-Fi based using that as a platform?","Michael Angelakis","Why don't I obviously take the balance sheet question? I think the answer, Craig, is no. I think we've obviously given substantial thought and consideration to our balance sheet. Given the total amount of debt that we have which is approximately $48 billion, we feel that we're very comfortable in the range that we've set which is 1.5 to 2 times. I think that we really prefer to have a bit of conservatism in our balance that provides appropriate flexibility and obviously we've given this a tremendous amount of thought and are pleased with where we're going right now.","Neil Smit","With regards to the Wi-Fi question, as I mentioned we continued to build up the network. All these gateways we're putting in the households now are holding hotspots as well, they have dual SSIDs and we're doing that with small business as well, so the network is getting denser as we continue to build out the gateway and the wireless gateways. With regards to wireless service, as you know we have an MVNO agreement with Verizon Wireless but we have at this point no plans to build out a wireless network.","Craig Moffett - Moffett Research","Thank you.","Marlene Dooner","Thanks, Craig. Operator, let's have the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike McCormack with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Michael McCormack - Nomura","Hi, guys. Thanks. Just thinking about the increased usage in the home, obviously we're hearing a lot about and you guys have people moving up in the various tiers, but is there at some point where you need to think more about the network infrastructure. I know you're investing there, but do we hit a wall on capital at some point or we need to do something more dramatic, maybe you can just walk through some of the stuff you're doing there? And then secondly, you mentioned medium-sized business as being a decent driver in commercial services. How is the product set comparing against some of your competitors there? Is there something you need to add to that? Thanks.","Neil Smit","With regard to usage and capacity, we feel the network is flexible and has plenty of opportunity to grow in capacity whether it's through extending fiber deeper into the network which we do with our business services product, the Metro E product or whether it's splitting nodes or new technologies such as DOCSIS 3.1 which will be coming in over the next few years. So we feel very good about the future growth capacity of the network. With regards to midsized business, we have great products out there. We have Metro E. We have a hosted voice solution. We have a video product. We just upped our speeds and they were received very well by the customers. So we feel like our product set is very strong and we keep innovating on that front. And I think there's a lot of upside room for growth in the midsized business.","Michael McCormack - Nomura","Just on the pricing side and then\u2026","Brian Roberts","\u2026which is that the more the consumer desires speed, the better that is for our company in my opinion and that that we have myriad solutions as Neil just outlined. We can take more of the video bandwidth and apply it to digital and apply it to broadband. There's a lot of ways to go. That's what makes DOCSIS 3.1 a promising technology. At the cable convention, we demonstrated 3 gigabits of speed with over an existing plan. There's a lot of good things. So really that innovation will power more applications which will power more demand and I think that that will create more differentiation between us and any competitor. So it's where we'd like to see the world go.","Michael McCormack - Nomura","Great, thanks guys.","Marlene Dooner","Thank you, Mike. Operator, let's go to the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Bryan Kraft - Evercore Partners","Thanks. On NBCUniversal, how do you anticipate the Legendary Entertainment partnership impacting NBCU's division from a revenue and cost perspective? Then also just on the affiliate and retrans renewals, is your objective to secure really long-term deals, say, 7 to 10 years in duration or are you trying to achieve more traditional three to five-year contract periods? Thank you.","Brian Roberts","So the way the Legendary deal will work and it will take a while to get moving is, Legendary is going to make some of their own films. They love large films dedicated to what they call the fanboy audience but very large films. And no, they will contribute capital and production resources and creative expertise into making those films. We will co-finance some of those films. And then in addition, Legendary will co-finance some of our films. When we look at our overall film strategy, we think it's a very important element of our strategy going forward. We have Illumination for animated films, couldn't be happier with that, Despicable Me 2 is going to end up being the single most profitable film in the 100-year history of Universal Studios, so we love Illumination. And then on the big film side, the riskiest and in some ways hardest part of the business right now we'll have a partner in Legendary that has a real passion for that. And then Universal will concentrate on everything else. So we think we now have a very coherent strategy. We're really excited it was a competitive auction to see who would end up with the Legendary film relationship and we won that auction. And we're pleased to have that business on a going forward basis.","Marlene Dooner","Thank you, Bryan. Operator, let's go to the last question now. Thanks.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead, sir.","Frank Louthan - Raymond James","Great, thank you. Within the SME business, are you seeing any change in your rate of growth coming from increasing revenue from existing customers, or I guess in other words what percentage of your growth is coming from existing customers versus getting traction with some new logos?","Brian Roberts","Most of the growth is coming from new customer acquisitions. However, we are introducing products to get up-sell products to our existing customers, such as for example we go out and buy \u2013 resell arrangements with software providers for services like financial management to our payroll and whatnot and these small businesses who aren't accustomed to going out and finding those solutions can get an entire package from us and we can offer them those at a discounted rate. So we are now beginning to focus on up-selling existing customers but the growth to-date has been from new customers.","Frank Louthan - Raymond James","Okay, great.","Marlene Dooner","Thank you, Frank.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Jason Armstrong. Please go ahead, Mr. Armstrong.","Jason Armstrong","Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone. Joining me on this morning\u2019s call are Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh, Steve Burke, and Neil Smit. Brian and Mike will make formal remarks, and Steve and Neil will also be available for Q&A.","As always, let me now refer you to Slide #2, which contains our Safe Harbor disclaimer, and remind you that this conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties.

Please refer to our 8-K for the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.","With that, let me turn the call to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian?","Brian Roberts","Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to report very strong third quarter results. This is a real reflection of how well the various parts of our business are working, and more importantly, how well they are working together.","In the quarter, we grew revenue by a 11.2% and operating cash flow by 8.4%. Our performance was broad-based with broadband, business services, film, and theme parks leading the way. Over in Cable Communications, our investments in our network, our X1 platform, and customer service are all paying off.","Revenue and operating cash flow growth were each over 6%. We added 156,000 customer relationships up over 90% from the prior year. Our video results were the best for a third quarter and nine years, and our broadband results were the best for a third quarter in six years. Similar to last quarter, churn was a standout, as we saw an improvement across every category.","We continue to push harder on X1 and have now accelerated our deployment to over 40,000 boxes per day. Roughly 25% of our video subscribers now have X1, and the reaction from our customers together with the financial benefits that we\u2019re seeing continues to indicate we should go even faster in taking that rate higher.","Encouragingly, as we get further into our base, the magnitude of favorable impacts on churn additional outlets VOD viewing and DVR uptake remain at a high level. In addition, there\u2019s a deep list of initiatives that are adding to our value proposition for our customers. Last quarter, we talked about launching a voice remote. To-date, we\u2019ve already deployed nearly 1.5 million of them, and we\u2019re confident that we have unrivaled content rights, which makes it much more important for us to facilitate the discovery of that content.","The voice remote is exactly the type of solution and the customer feedback has been terrific. In addition, we scaled our Xfinity On Campus offering, nearly quadrupling the number of participating universities versus last year to 26. Business Services delivered another excellent quarter with revenue growth of nearly 20%. We continue our progress in small business, have established ourselves as a strong competitor in the mid-size segment, and recently announced that we created a new enterprise services group targeting Fortune 1000 customers, where we\u2019ve already had some good early success.","At NBCUniversal, things continue to exceed our expectations. I\u2019m thrilled to report a 17% operating cash flow growth for the quarter, which is the same number for year-to-date. At film, the third quarter was remarkable in many ways and continued the terrific run we\u2019ve had this year. Minions and Jurassic world sustained our box office streak into the third quarter.","On August 5, we surpassed the prior record for the highest grossing year ever for a movie studio in worldwide box office. And this is the first time any studio has had three films crossed the $1 billion mark and theatrical receipts in the same year. At our broadcast and cable networks while industry-wide ratings remain challenged, we had some real success in this past quarter.","NBC was the number one broadcast network for the fifth summer in a row and has continued the momentum into the fall winning premier week for the fourth straight year. The relative strength and broadcast is diversified across sports with the number one rated show on TV and Sunday Night Football paired with the number one rated reality show, and we\u2019re number one in Nightly News and in Late Night. Now, we have the fall\u2019s top rated new show with Blind Spot.","In our Cable Networks, NBC Sports Network put up its most-watched third quarter ever. Thanks to NASCAR\u2019s debut and continued growth in viewership for the English Premier League. At USA Network, Mr. Robot was the number two new basic cable drama of the summer. We\u2019re delighted about our progress in the theme parks and more specifically about our ability to manage for growth and returns.","Parks delivered another quarter of double-digit revenue and operating cash flow growth. Notably, we had record attendance despite the anniversary of our launch of the new Harry Potter attraction in Orlando.","Also, during the quarter, we announced our intention to acquire a 51% stake in Universal Studios Japan. We believe that in Japan and in other parks, the combination of wonderful intellectual property and new attractions along with great service and value for families translates into very strong performance. As we look at our overall results, the third quarter and year-to-date are reflective of a special company with businesses that are working well together and focused on execution.","Our operating cash flow is increasing. We\u2019re reinvesting back in the businesses for growth, and also looking for strategic investments along the way, such as Universal Studios Japan. And importantly, we\u2019re returning a significant amount of cash to our shareholders. We believe that we\u2019re on the right path to continue to successfully create value for our customers and shareholders, and we\u2019re confident and excited about our future.","I\u2019d like to now turn it over to Mike, who with a full quarter under his belt has made a really seamless and excellent transition into Comcast. Over to you for a more detailed review of the quarter.","Michael Cavanagh","Good morning, everybody. Let me begin by briefly reviewing our third quarter consolidated financial results, starting on Slide 4. As Brian highlighted, consolidated revenue for the third quarter increased a 11.2% to $18.7 billion with consolidated operating cash flow increasing 8.4% to $6.2 billion. The primary drivers of this growth were high-speed data and business services at cable and film and parks at NBCUniversal.","Earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.80, an increase of 9.6% when you exclude $724 million of tax adjustments and $49 million of transaction-related costs that were in last year\u2019s third quarter results.","Free cash flow for the quarter increased 6.8% to $2.7 billion, and free cash flow per share of $1.6 was up a 11.6%, driven by strong operating cash flow growth, partially offset by higher capital expenditures and cash taxes. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow increased 13.5% to $7.3 billion, and free cash flow per share of $2.90 has grown 17.9%.","Now, let\u2019s go into the results of the businesses in more detail starting with Cable Communications on Slide 5. We are very pleased with the strength of our Cable Communications results. Cable revenue increased 6.3% to $11.7 billion, as we added 156,000 customer relationships and 90% improvement compared to last year\u2019s third quarter, and increased total revenue per customer relationship by over 4% to $143 per month. These results demonstrate the strength and health of our business and were driven by strong growth and high-speed data and business services, as well as higher video revenue.","Taking a closer look at our video business, third quarter revenue increased 3.3%, reflecting rate adjustments and an increasing number of customers adding advanced outlets and services like high-definition TV and DVR services. In fact, we added nearly 2.5 times the number of advanced customers in the quarter compared to last year, as customers are recognizing the value in our innovative X1 platform, and extensive amounts of programming. This also contributed to us improving our customer losses by 41% over last year\u2019 results. We lost the combined 48,000 video customers in the quarter, primarily driven by another quarter of improved churn.","We\u2019re pleased with the progress we\u2019ve been making in rolling out X1, which accounted for nearly 60% of video connects in the quarter. We added nearly 1 million X1 customers in the quarter, including both new customers and existing customers upgrading to the platform.","X1 net adds increased more than 20% from the second quarter and were up nearly 50% compared to last year with X1 customers now representing roughly one quarter of our total video customer base. The positive benefits from X1 continued in the third quarter. X1 customers have significantly lower voluntary churn, over 50% higher DVR penetration, and take a greater number of advanced outlets. This results in higher average revenue per customer for X1 base. As the X1 customer base expands, we see the positive impact on our overall video results.","A final comment on video, we are responding to different customer preferences, segmenting the market effectively with a variety of video packages and offers, like our Internet Plus offering to appeal to customers that might otherwise choose to purchase only broadband from us. Providing the right introduction to our products allows us to better retain our customers and potentially migrate them to higher end packages over time, improving our customer lifetime value.","The strong momentum in our high-speed data business continued. Revenue increased 10.2% during the quarter, making it again the leading contributor to overall cable revenue growth, driven by impressive growth in our customer base, as well as rate adjustments, and an increasing number of customers taking higher-speed services. We added a combined 320,000 data customers during the quarter with 73% of our customers now receiving speeds of 50 megabits per second or greater.","We continue to differentiate our product through speed upgrades and the fastest in-home Wi-Fi with our advanced wireless gateways. Over 70% of our residential high-speed data customers now have one of our gateways, which are also fueling our impressive growth in Wi-Fi hotspots. Our hotspots now number more than 11.7 million across our footprint, compared to 4.9 million in last year\u2019s third quarter.","Voice revenue declined by 1.4% in the third quarter. As we expanded eligibility of X1 to Double Play customers, our combined voice customer net additions slowed 17,000, and ARPU had declined modestly. However, voice remains an important product for our customers, and we believe adds value to the bundle.","Turning to Business Services, it has been the second largest contributor to overall cable revenue growth for 18 of the last 19 quarters with third quarter revenue increasing 19.5% to $1.2 billion. This rate of growth is especially impressive, given that business services is approaching a $5 billion run rate business annually. Over 70% of that revenue was generated by small businesses, where our performance is especially strong, with growth driven by customer additions and higher rates.","At the same time, the contribution from mid-sized businesses continues to increase. We feel great about our run rate for growth and business services even more so with the recently announced creation of a new division that will target Fortune 1000 companies and other large enterprises.","If you look under the hood at many of the businesses we\u2019re targeting, they resemble an aggregation of small businesses, those with brand systems such as banks, retailers, and restaurant chains. In these cases, the needs of the local branches look very much like the small and medium-sized business customers we serve so well today. We\u2019re in the early stages of pursuing the enterprise opportunity, but believe it adds yet another avenue of growth for this already robust business.","And lastly on Slide 5, Cable Advertising revenue was relatively flat during the third quarter, due to lower political revenue. Excluding political, our Cable Advertising revenue increased 8%, primarily driven by increased media advertising and ahead of the launch of the fall TV season. This level of increased spending was timing related and should be lower in the fourth quarter. Also, keep in mind, we will have a difficult comparison in the fourth quarter, as we had 110 million of political revenue during last year\u2019s fourth quarter fueled by election year spending.","Turning to Slide 6, third quarter Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 6.4% to $4.7 billion. During the second quarter call, we detailed our plans to increase our investment in the customer experience, as well as continue our aggressive X1 rollout, which would drive higher customer service and technical operation expense. While this is reflected in what was in the third quarter, our better revenue performance and lower program expense growth allowed us to deliver flat margins at 40.4%.","Third quarter program expenses increased 6.4%. This rate of growth is lower than the 9.6% increase we reported in the second quarter, due to the lower pay-per-view costs and timing of programming deals. We expect fourth quarter program expense to increase at a similar rate of growth, and as a result, our full-year 2015 program expense growth will be slightly lower than our previous guidance of about 8%.","As we look beyond 2015, we expect programming cost growth to remain elevated, driven in part by continued increases in retransmission consent these and higher sports programming costs, as well as our commitment to further expand our content rights for our on-demand and TV Everywhere platforms. We plan to continue to add more content out of home rights, stacking rights, and back seasons, ensuring that we have the most compelling and competitive video product on the market.","In the third quarter, non-programming costs continue to bear the impact of the X1 rollout and our investment in the customer experience with technical and product support costs up by 8%, and customer service expenses up 8.4%. At the beginning of the year, we indicated stable margins were expected. Through the first three quarters, we\u2019ve delivered on that with our year-to-date margin of 40.7%, right around last year\u2019s result of 40.9%.","We feel confident, we can continue to largely offset these higher expenses with an improving business mix, as high-margin businesses like high-speed data and business services continue to grow, and ongoing improvement in efficiencies as our investment in X1 and customer service begin to payoff.","Overall, Cable\u2019s results prove. We are executing well and competing effectively with innovative products and services that provide a great value to our customers. We\u2019re focused on continuing to deliver strong and profitable growth along with healthy customer results.","Now, let\u2019s move onto NBCUniversal\u2019s results. So on Slide 7, you can see NBCUniversal delivered exceptional results in the third quarter, as revenue increased nearly 21%, and operating cash flow increased 17%, driven by films record-breaking theatrical slate and strong Parks results.","At Cable Networks, third quarter revenue increased 7%, primarily driven by an 8.6% increase in distribution revenue, which partially reflects higher affiliate fees associated with the premiere of NASCAR on our NBC Sports Network during the quarter. The first quarter in our new 10-year deal. In addition, advertising revenue grew 2%, as the positive contribution from NASCAR advertising more than offset what would have been a modest decrease in advertising revenue overall since rating declines across many of our networks more than offset increases in prices and volume.","Last, we benefited from higher content licensing revenue reflecting the timing of content delivered under our licensing agreements. Cable Networks operating cash flow declined 3.9% due to higher program expenses that include the timing of our NASCAR rights fees. In broadcast, we did well this quarter with entertainment, sports, news and Telemundo, all contributing to revenue growth of just over 11%.","This growth was driven by strong retrans and content licensing revenue, which reflects the timing of content provided under our licensing agreements, as well as new syndication deals for law and order. In addition, advertising revenue increased 3% despite the difficult comparison created by one less NFL game this quarter compared to last year.","The fact that we were still able to report modestly positive advertising growth speaks to the strong scatter market with the third quarter trending better than the first-half of the year. Importantly, this higher demand in the scatter market has continued into the fourth quarter.","Finally, operating cash flow at broadcast increased 6%, as expenses increased in the third quarter, primarily driven by higher studio production costs. At film, our focus on well-known intellectual property is delivering exceptional results. In the third quarter, film delivered revenue growth of 64%, and operating cash flow of more than doubled to $376 million, compared to last year, driven by the record-breaking performances of Minions, and Jurassic World. This was the second most profitable quarter in Universal\u2019s history topped only by our second quarter 2015 results.","In the fourth quarter, we have fewer theatrical releases, where we will continue to benefit from our successful film slate, as these films move to the home entertainment and content licensing windows. And at Theme Parks, record attendance this summer fueled 14% revenue growth, despite lapping the July 2014 opening of Harry Potter Diagon Alley and Hogwarts Express.","Three quarters of our Orlando guests now purchase park to park tickets. Hollywood also contributed to our third quarter growth, driven by the success of Fast & Furious Supercharged, which opened strong on June 25. With higher attendance and healthy per capita spending growth at both parks, operating cash flow grew 14%, net of $18 million of transaction-related costs associated with our plans to develop a theme park in China.","Lastly recall that last summer was more of a soft opening for Potter, so while we believe the momentum Harry Potter will continue, the growth rates will likely slow in the fourth quarter, as we compare against the fully opened Harry Potter.","Now, let\u2019s move to Slide 8 to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. Consolidated capital expenditures continue to track to our investment plan and increased 11% to $2.2 billion, driven by increased investments at Cable. At Cable Communications, third quarter capital expenditures increased 12.6% to $1.9 billion, equal to 15.8% of cable revenue compared to 14.9% in the third quarter of 2014.","We expect the fourth quarter to be another quarter of heavy activity, reflecting continued investments in customer premise equipment like X1 and wireless gateways. In addition, we plan to increase spending on cloud-based initiatives, such as our cloud, DVR service, business services reflecting the expansion into the mid and enterprise markets, and network capacity, bringing our full-year CapEx as a percent of cable revenue to be right around 15%.","At NBCUniversal, third quarter capital expenditures remained relatively stable at $289 million with the majority of our spending at Theme Parks, as we build new attractions, including Harry Potter in Hollywood and King Kong in Orlando. We continue to expect that NBCUniversal\u2019s 2015 capital expenditures will remain relatively stable at 2014\u2019s level with over half directed to our Theme Park segment, as the investments we\u2019re making in our parks are clearly generating strong returns, as they drive increased attendance and per capita spending.","Moving to Slide 9, as I mentioned earlier, we generated $2.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, and $7.3 billion of free cash flow year-to-date. In the third quarter, we returned $2.8 billion of capital shareholders, an increase of 111% compared to the third quarter of 2014, including dividend payments totaling $623 million and share repurchases totaling $2.2 billion.","We bought back more stock in the quarter than the typical pro rata amount, given the weakness in share price in late August and September, as well as a desire to get ahead of the blackout period that will accompany the plan to merge the A&K shares. On a full-year basis, we continue to expect to achieve our planned repurchase of $6.75 billion of our common shares.","In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter at 1.9 times net leverage. The pending acquisition of a 51% stake in Universal Studios Japan would have taken that to about two times net leverage. As I said before, we expect to continue to operate with leverage in this range. As a reminder, we\u2019ll talk about 2016 capital plans on our next quarter\u2019s earnings call.","Yesterday, we announced our plan to reclassify each share of Comcast Class A special common stock into one share of Comcast Class A common stock. We believe the reclassification will benefit our shareholders by among other things eliminating investor confusion caused by having two classes of publicly traded stock and improving the trading liquidity of our publicly traded stock. The reclassification will require approval by each class, which we anticipate will occur at a Shareholders Meeting by year-end.","Thanks everybody for dialing in. And now, I\u2019ll hand it over to Jason for Q&A.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks, Mike. Regina, let\u2019s open up the call for Q&A, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Craig Moffett","Hi, good morning. Brian, I wonder if you could update us a bit on your thinking about wireless, and how it fits into the longer-term business plan? There has been reports this quarter about exercising the option for the Verizon MVNO, and where, I guess, about a month away from filing a short form for the 600 megahertz option. Could you just talk about this two things and what your thinking is at the moment for how wireless fits?","Brian Roberts","Well, we don\u2019t have any news today. So let me say that, we believe that wireless obviously is an important area for consumers and how they are in the future. And today, we have incredible success with our Wi-Fi network, which is the largest in-home Wi-Fi network, as well as a terrific out of home Wi-Fi, we\u2019re seeing a majority of bits travel over the Wi-Fi network.","But it takes about six months to activate the MVNO. We\u2019ve had told everybody that before, we were going to trial some things and test some things after we activate and we\u2019ll update people as that progresses. But it\u2019s an opportunity to take the network and the investments we\u2019ve made \u2013 a successful investment that we\u2019ve made, and try and see if we can continue relationships and product innovation that the team is working on.","Regarding the auction, again, no news today. We\u2019ve seen some of the opportunity for NBC in that part of the auction and certainly something that we\u2019re likely to participate in and beyond that. We\u2019re studying it, and we always look at all the options for the company, but we\u2019re pretty excited about the roadmap that we\u2019re trying to develop. Neil, anything you want to add?","Neil Smit","I think, you covered it, Brian. We\u2019re in the test and learn mode and I think is a natural part of the evolution of our country or participation in the mobile space beyond Wi-Fi. But we\u2019re testing and learning and nothing new to report.","Craig Moffett","Would you think that longer-term an MVNO is a satisfactory end point, or would you think of it more as a starting point and then eventually you would want to have owner\u2019s economics if you pursue that business?","Neil Smit","We don\u2019t know, we\u2019re evaluating opportunities.","Brian Roberts","I think we\u2019ve always felt it\u2019s a part of a product set. I don\u2019t think we feel that we have to necessarily in anyway seek owner\u2019s economics. And just to clarify what I was \u2013 make sure it was clear, at the NBC side, we tend to participate, the cable side something we\u2019ll continue to study.","Craig Moffett","All right. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful, Brian.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks, Craig. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you. Good morning, I\u2019ll try two. Mike, can you talk about the leverage comfort zone for the company around that two times? In other words, how high would you go, if you saw something really compelling on the acquisition front, and how low would you drift before you would sort of default to buybacks, if you didn\u2019t see anything out there?","And then I will ask my second question to Neil. You guys talked a lot about X1 in the prepared remarks. Can you talk broadly about your customer segmentation that\u2019s allowing you to put out kind of 2% customer growth every quarter, things like Internet Plus, Internet Pro, and I believe you\u2019ve been testing a stream product that\u2019s sort of pure over the top. Any color on sort of the ongoing customer segmentation activities and new product pipeline? Thanks. Thank you both.","Michael Cavanagh","Thanks, Ben. So it\u2019s Mike. So on leverage, we used to say and I changed this in the last quarter that would be at the 1.5 to 2 times net leverage was the range that the company was drifting down towards from being at a higher level post GE. I think we sit now 1.9 times net leverage at the end of the third quarter.","But as I said earlier, when you pro forma for the deal we did in the Japan Parks that takes us right at two times, feel quite good at around two times. But that gives us the ability to do all we need to do to return lots of capital to shareholders to invest in the business organically and give us some flexibility around things like Vox, BuzzFeed, parks and so forth.","So in that range right around two is fine to allow us to do all that, and I won\u2019t speculate on any larger M&A, as Brian said before, we\u2019re pretty comfortable with the portfolio businesses we have.","Neil Smit","Concerning segmentation X1 was up 60% of our connects this quarter, and so we\u2019re seeing a healthy growth X1. We offer different products based on the segment, for example, the Internet Plus applies well to millennials who want a great Internet product and a lighter video product. On those customers we \u2013 after they\u2019ve \u2013 after \u2013 the churn is consider we up sell about 30% of those. So we\u2019re able to get new people into the system and then up sell or upgrade them.","The on-campus product has been a great success. We are on 26 campuses now and continue to grow. It\u2019s a great product. It serves the video to where the customer in this case, the student wants to have consume it, which is in their dorm room, we stream direct. We launched the stream product in the trial market and that also applies to millennials or younger audience.","And finally Watchables we launched earlier this month, and that\u2019s about 32 providers of semi professional content. So it\u2019s getting to content that\u2019s not normally what we\u2019ve been carrying in the past, and we that will attract another segment. So we\u2019re very careful on how we segment the audiences and we\u2019re getting a better quality customer and holding on to them for longer.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks, Ben. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John Hodulik","Great. Thanks. It was for Neil. Can you comment on the strategy and timing of the DOCSIS 3.1 rollout? And if we look back, you\u2019ve been adding about 1.2 million, 1.39 million new HSD subs per year for the last few years. Does this initiative sort of help you maintain that growth, or could we see some acceleration again on the sub side or ARPU, as you get further down the path there? Thanks.","Neil Smit","Well, as you said, we\u2019ve continued to add over 1 million for nine years now. And that we\u2019ve done 16 speed increases in the past 13 years. So we continue to increase speeds and that\u2019s the value that customers are receiving. We\u2019ve also, as Mike mentioned in his comments increased the wireless gateways to our in-home Wi-Fi, is a very strong value add.","The \u2013 in terms of DOCSIS 3.1, it\u2019s what we have in the labs. We plan on rolling it out early next year, and we think that will give us more speed capability, and we\u2019re also working on products that will increase the \u2013 let\u2019s just call the smartness of the Internet, not just speed.","So we think we can continue to grow market share and the market is growing only 70% of customers have a high-speed connection, so there\u2019s market growth opportunity there as well.","John Hodulik","Okay. Thanks.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks, John. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jessica Reif Cohen","Thanks. I guess, two questions. First, can you talk about what you\u2019re doing in terms of mining data and driving targeted more relevant advertising across all your platforms, so across Comcast Cable and also NBCUniversal businesses?","Brian Roberts","Well, let me start by just saying that, we see the two company \u2013 the two parts of the company working together is really part of what\u2019s powering these earnings results and across the board. And one of the areas that we\u2019ve identified as management team is that question, there\u2019s a importantly how do we improve the technology, so we have a better targeted information. What\u2019s the data that can assist the advertisers and the networks in having the right relationship with what they\u2019re offering.","And it\u2019s an important area to the company because of both parts of the company have a lot of advertising dollars. It\u2019s nice to see the spot market being very successful right now and supportive of this space. So I think there\u2019s a lot of chance for us to perform well. The other thing with data is sort of measurement and having buyers be more knowledgeable to whatever means that that data gets to the marketplace. And so we\u2019re looking at all those opportunities across the company. Steve or Neil, you please jump in?","Stephen Burke","Well, our advertising group, which is now unified under Linda Yaccarino for all the cable channels, all broadcast, and all digital, she is currently not only allowing advertisers to sell across all those platforms, but to do so in a way that\u2019s informed by information or complemented by target ability on the Comcast side, which is obviously a very, very unique product in a world, where advertisers want to marry the proven storyteller \u2013 storytelling of a television spot with a target ability of the Internet. So she is in the market with those products right now. They are doing very well. And those products are going to get more sophisticated, as we complement them with more information, more set-top box data et cetera.","Jessica Reif Cohen","Thank you.","Jason Armstrong","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Phil Cusick","Hey, guys. If I can squeeze in a clarification and a question. First on -- following up on Ben\u2019s question on the balance sheet size. We \u2013 in the past you\u2019ve talked about the size of the balance sheet being as important as leverage and the $50 billion range being sort of the high level. But with more and more companies at $100 billion debt balance, are you more comfortable that you can ladder out maturities enough to take the balance sheet substantially higher?","And then second, you mentioned programming expense coming in below 8% this quarter and the comment about continued investment rights. How should we think about that for 2016? What could accelerate growth, or we should we think about that 8% as a reasonable run rate? Thank you.","Michael Cavanagh","It\u2019s Mike. On the balance sheet size or the size the debt issuance of the company, I think that continues and should continue to be a factor that we think about. It\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re a large issuer and we want to make sure that through the course of time, we\u2019re always able to carry the balances at good rates through time.","Stephen Burke","And concerning the programming costs, this is a lower quarter than usual in terms of percentage of increase. We do see that increasing will be slightly below our 8% number that we\u2019ve given previous guidance on. And I think we\u2019re not done with the budgeting process yet for 2016, so we\u2019re not prepared to comment on that yet.","Phil Cusick","Thanks, guys.","Brian Roberts","Thanks, Phil. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Vijay Jayant","Thanks. Just continuing from one prior question, in terms of the Internet Plus offering, can you talk about \u2013 because the step-up is pretty substantial. Can you talk about what customers do after their one-year promotional price given that you already have that experience?","And I just wanted to get a sort of philosophical question about all thesis come to U..S mainland, I\u2019m talking about 40% margins for cable companies that are one-fourth the size of Comcast, and you are already at 40%. So any thoughts about is there opportunity on the margin side on cable given some of the strategies they are contemplating? Thank you.","Brian Roberts","Concerning Internet Plus, as I mentioned, when they roll off promotional rate some people step up to higher level packages more video about 30% do. Some people roll off or churn off and some people extend in the existing to step up in their pricing. So we find it\u2019s a attractive way of getting customers who are initially only interested in Internet onto a video product and then expand the package from there, get a foot in the door.","Concerning Altice, it\u2019s good to see others recognize the value in the cable market as we have. There is always things we can learn. They do some things \u2013 some interesting things with self-service, their IT consolidation, their structural approach, and we\u2019re always open to learning.","Vijay Jayant","Thanks.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks, Vijay. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brett Feldman","Thanks for taking the question. If we could just talk a little bit about your view on the competitive environment in the video market, because if we look at some of your biggest competitors, it feels like their emphasis has shifted. Verizon is very focused on custom TV, AT&T is pivoting away from U-verse, DISH seems very interested in Sling versus its traditional product and you\u2019ve obviously invested a lot in some of your premium offers. And so the question is, sort of, how do you feel about the competitive intensity? And then just in general, you\u2019ve been showing improved trends year-over-year, do you feel like that\u2019s sustainable?","Neil Smit","I think the competitive intensity is much the same as it has been in the past. The base offers, their attractive promotional offers, but the base rate remains in the same ballpark. I think, different people are trying different things. We feel the X1 platform is something we can build on. It \u2013 there\u2019s greater viewership. There\u2019s more VOD consumption, both transactional and non-transactional. The churn reduction is significant and there are more AOs, more DVR usage. So we\u2019re investing behind the X1 platform, and we feel we can continue to \u2013 our objective is to continue to improve year-over-year on an ongoing basis.","Brian Roberts","I would just add that the thing that I feel good about is the video product that we\u2019re offering has tremendous momentum. It\u2019s the best in the market. Just \u2013 people that don\u2019t live in Philadelphia or one of our markets when they see it, they go, wow, I wish I could get that. With the ease now of the voice remote we\u2019ll put millions of those out in the next several quarters, and it just makes it even that much better. And our service initiatives and improvements that are being made and the reliability and on time and the network reliability, there\u2019s a tremendous focus here, and I think that\u2019s improving as well. And so you put all that together, I really think we have a great momentum and a good strategy.","Neil Smit","I complement Dave Watson and the operating teams in the field who are really driving the X1 out and targeting selective segments in the offer.","Brian Roberts","20,000 a day, that\u2019s huge push.","Brett Feldman","Great. Thanks for taking the question.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks, Brett. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Marci Ryvicker","Hi, thanks. And I have two questions. The first, Mike, you talked about the enterprise unit being sort of an aggregation of small businesses. So it sounds like there will not be a need for a major upgrade to the network, and there is not going to be a need for major investment there. So just want to confirm that I\u2019m reading right from your comments.","And then the second question is for Brian. And you mentioned I think during our press conference around Universal Studio Japan that this is going to be the beginning of your international expansion. So I just wanted you to just provide some more color around that comment? Thanks.","Michael Cavanagh","Marci, it\u2019s Michael. I\u2019ll start and you can finish, but on business services enterprise growth its continuation of what we\u2019re doing, the needs are similar and we are investing and it is a big source of capital investment that you\u2019ve seen in the recent past and that\u2019s going to continue. But we\u2019re going to lay around businesses of a bigger scale that have the profile the medium-size enterprises that we already have.","Brian Roberts","And I\u2019d just add that we\u2019re targeting the Fortune 1000 companies and other large enterprises have 300 locations or more. And if you think about it this type of enterprise customer we\u2019re looking at entities with branches such a banks, restaurants, retailers, and we these are \u2013 those are small customers like a assembly of small customers. So we have managed services to more than 20 large enterprise customers already and already signed multiple 8 figure deals.","Neil Smit","So one of the things that NBCUniversal does for Comcast and I think Steve, focused on it right from the gecko when we moved Jeff Shell to London was to really use this as a way to how the company look at broader opportunities not just United States but around the world. And we\u2019re really happy with the Osaka and Japan Theme Park 51% announcement.","But as we\u2019ve said and I think that what I was really referring to was our China opportunity. We have partnership that we\u2019re in the process of getting completed all the approvals necessary to go forward. But we are looking forward to building entire new Universal in Beijing and that\u2019s a continuation of that \u2013 because we\u2019re in the Theme Park business when we bought the company there were no owned assets outside the United States.","And we will have perhaps the largest or one of the largest Theme Park will be China. And when you see Universal Japan its thriving business that we think we can grow and we\u2019ve we\u2019re in the process of putting into managing it coming from Florida there\u2019s Chief Financial Officer of Universal Park he is going to move there and their team is really ready for these kind of opportunities and kind of hit the ground running.","So there\u2019s nothing else this much high and that we\u2019re working on specifically like that but this is a unique opportunity and where it complements what we are going to do in Beijing.","Marci Ryvicker","All right. Thank you very much.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks Marci. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike McCormick with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Mike McCormick","Hey, guys, thanks. Maybe we can just circle back on Brett\u2019s question the competitive landscape. And more specifically talking about the recent combination of AT&T and DirecTV AT&T is out there with pretty aggressive wireless and DirecTV bundles with pretty good bounties and sort of build credits if you will. Just trying to get a sense for if you\u2019ve seen any significant change in appetite for that combined wireless video bundle. And then just secondly on the retrans side if you can give us an update on the pacing there any risks to that trajectory?","Brian Roberts","I think on the competitive side as I said we haven\u2019t seen a meaningful difference in approach or sub-numbers. Our churn \u2013 our numbers were the best in nine years and it\u2019s driven by churn. So you think that if there was a very attractive offer it\u2019s the higher churn but our churn numbers remain lower. And concerning the retrans.","Neil Smit","Retrans, we were talking to you or Steve.","Brian Roberts","I think our retrans generally speaking are continuing on a steady curve and there\u2019s no real lumpiness in that number.","Mike McCormick","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks, Mike. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan Kraft","Good morning. There seems to be some elevated activity in Washington and also in local government arenas to facilitate more fiber at the home deployment. And like in some of the Google fiber markets, it seem to be increasingly leaning toward allowing redlining. And so I guess the first I was wondering if you\u2019ve the same assessment?","And second, how much of a concern is this for you that competitors might be able to sort of cream skim and not have to serve the higher cost areas? And what are you \u2013 if you have any expectations around how that could play out, I would just be interested in any thoughts you have on that? Thank you.","Brian Roberts","Look, we \u2013 we\u2019ve seen this is not a new thing. There were similar thoughts when the Bells were building that was not Universal. We can\u2019t per se control that we obviously want to have as level playing field as one can. But a pro competitive strategy in our opinion is better than a pro regulatory strategy and if there\u2019s more competition that something that where we\u2019ve been facing for years and nothing we\u2019re going to do to change that or want to change that I think it if anything it\u2019s a reminder to regulators how competitive this industry is and will be in the future. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s so critical that we continue to perform well and sharpen our operating skills and we\u2019re showing that.","Bryan Kraft","Okay. Thank you.","Brian Roberts","Thanks, Brian. Regina, we got time for one more question.","Operator","So final question comes from the line of James Ratcliffe with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","James Ratcliffe","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just to dig into the video churn improvement you\u2019ve been seeing how much of that is really X1 driven and how much of it is the benefit from the investment customer experience. And so how much incremental run rate is there on that both in terms of expanding X1 in terms of the customer service investments? Thanks.","Brian Roberts","I think it\u2019s been a combination of a number of factors. One is getting people on the X1 platform is having affect on churn. The second is we have more people on contracts. And third is that there\u2019s more people using TV Everywhere there\u2019s third of our customers using TV Everywhere on a monthly basis. And finally I think our customer experience improvements of health significantly I mean if we can get the right customers and keep them longer it\u2019s going to impact churn.","So our customer experience things in terms of reducing phone calls, reducing truck rolls, getting things right the first time and really super serving our customers is having an impact as well.","Neil Smit","I just want to sum up from my perspective what was so good about this quarter from where I have said is the company working really well together, it was a terrific first nine months of the year this quarter being in video the best in nine years, and broadband the best in six years. NBCUniversal would basically now had doubled the cash flow and a run rate to do that strength is across so many different parts of the company that are participating in the technology change that\u2019s happening.","As we talked about the millennials, we talk also about NBC and investments in Vox and BuzzFeed and the ability to now hopefully have advertising that can take some of our content and their content and bring it to advertisers doing all this, while still maintaining the leverage, it allows us to buyback shares and the dividend and Mike Cavanagh, joining us here and changing sort of the trajectory of that buyback in anticipation of things.","And ultimately, it\u2019s giving customers what they want and having a company with the unique set of assets that can do that. And I think we really and so many different fronts of the company did that this quarter. So were really pleased and thank you for your questions and support.","Jason Armstrong","Thanks, Brian,andthanks everyone for joining us. That will conclude today\u2019s call. Regina, back to you.","Operator","There will be a replay available of today\u2019s call starting at 12:30 PM Eastern time, it will run through Tuesday November 3, at midnight Eastern time.
