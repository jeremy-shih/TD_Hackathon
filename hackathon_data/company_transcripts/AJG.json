Your lines will be opened to questions following the presentation. Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Some of the comments made during this conference call, including answers given in response to questions, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that will be discussed on this call, and which are also described in the company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today.","It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. J. Patrick Gallagher, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Arthur J. Gallagher & Company. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the third quarter call. This morning, as is the norm, I am joined by Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions.","I'm very pleased with our quarter. When you look at all operations, all-in, adjusted revenues are up 9%, adjusted EBITDAC is up 11%, all-in organic growth was 4.1% and total company-adjusted EPS is up 15%.","Our Brokerage results were strong again, adjusted revenues up 10%, 3% of which were organic, adjusted EBITDAC is up 10% and our margins expanded by about 10 basis points. Risk Management had an outstanding quarter. Revenues were up 9%, all of which is organic. Adjusted EBITDAC is up 15% and margins improved by 90 basis points. And our clean energy investments had a terrific quarter. All in all, just a great quarter, which I think is a testament to our strong sales culture. We work very hard to serve our clients and to aggressively pursue new ones every single day.","Mergers and acquisitions continues to be a key strategy for us. In the quarter, we completed five mergers, all in the Brokerage segment. Our first nine months, we've done nearly 30 acquisitions, with about $180 million of new revenues, and our pipeline remains very strong. As I do every quarter, I want to thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm welcome to our growing family.","Our late-2013 and mid-2014 larger acquisitions are integrating very well. In the last few months, I've had a chance to visit many of our new branches in New Jersey, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the U.K., and I thought I would comment on those today. First, let me start with New Jersey. That's our Bollinger acquisition that we did in the fall of 2013. We're done with integration and fully converted onto the AJG platform.","We separated the retail, benefits and wholesale businesses into our respective verticals, merged four offices, brought in their accounting; migrated 800 folks onto our payroll, email and VOIP systems, converted all of our customers onto our agency management system and rebranded to Arthur J. Gallagher. And we did it in about 18 months start to stop and we believe we're now the largest broker in New Jersey.","In September, I was in our New Zealand and Australia offices, which we purchased in June of 2014. Barely with us just a year, Steve Lockwood and his team had already separated our IT structure from Wesfarmers, built a new data center, migrated employees onto our systems and rebranded our Australian business to Gallagher. The only thing we have left in early 2016 is to decommission an old data center, which is less than $1 million, and we will be done.","I also visited our Canadian offices, which we purchased in July 2014. Ken Keenan and his team have fully separated from the former parent and are rolling out the new agency management system, which is the same one we use in the U.S., which should give us good economies of scale. We are rebranding; we are upgrading infrastructure. While there's some effort left in 2016, the cost to complete the integration should be less than $5 million.","Finally, I was in the U.K. in June and more recent progress reports show Chily and his team are doing a fantastic job pushing forward the integration of the businesses we purchased in 2014. Remember, Giles, Oval, our legacy Gallagher, plus remnants of Heath and a dozen smaller mergers occurred in 2014. Well, rebranding is done, offices are being consolidated. We moved from nine data centers to two. Legal entities are being consolidated. We started with nearly 200 and by the end of 2016, we'll be down to 25 or 30 key operating entities.","We had about 100 duplicative IT applications; we've decommissioned 25 and expect another 20 to be gone by mid-2016. More impressive, we've migrated nearly 250,000 retail customers onto our key retail platform. We expect to spend about $30 million in the U.K. during 2016 to finalize the integration process. I'll be there again in two weeks and I'm sure the progress will be impressive.","And while that was a lot of about building a great fighter jet, let me talk about the pilots, our producers and field sales leaders. In every single location I visited, they are pumped up. They're excited about how their local relationships, combined with Gallagher's global resources, can sell more insurance. They're using our niches. They're using our sales playbooks. They're sourcing nice tuck-in mergers. They're interacting with our professionals globally, as if they've been part of the family for decades. Simply put, they embody our unique Gallagher culture.","Let me move now to the property casualty rate environment. With the exception of large catastrophe-exposed property, rates are by and large flat and very much in line with what we saw in the second quarter. All in, rates and economy negatively influenced our organic results by less than a point in the quarter. Internationally, Australia and New Zealand are seeing by far the most downward pressure, especially in auto. The U.K. is similar to the U.S. and Canada is flat to up a bit.","Our wholesale business, Risk Placement Services, had a strong quarter. Remember, RPS places a number of large catastrophe-exposed property schedules, so to post over 6% organic growth in spite of the softening property market is really good work.","Our employee benefits team is very busy assisting our customers as they manage their benefits and HR needs. In August, we released the results of our annual benefits strategy and benchmarking survey, one of the largest of its kind, with over 3,000 U.S. businesses participating. Interest in the results of this research is greater than ever and we are finding that employers are still struggling to navigate the impact of the Affordable Care Act. Balancing increasing cost and complexity with the need to attract and retain the best and the brightest, this environment presents us with ongoing growth opportunities, as our depth of resources and professionalism of our consultants continues to distinguish Gallagher.","In addition, our private label insurance exchange, the Gallagher Marketplace, is seeing very high interest and a good number of clients have committed to moving to the exchange. Year-to-date, we have 79 clients in the exchange and estimate that the number of enrolled and committed employee lives will be about 40,000 by year-end.","As I said earlier, our Risk Management business, Gallagher Bassett, had a great quarter, with top-line growth of 9% and all of which is organic. We've mentioned Gallagher Bassett's investments and their product offerings in the past. Let me give you an example. During the third quarter, we introduced the new RISX-FACS, our proprietary claims management system and Luminos, our state-of-the-art risk management information system platform. All these systems have been in production for a short period of time and both of them have been extremely well received by GB's clients, business partners and employees. Gallagher Bassett's stated goal is simply to provide our clients globally with the best claims outcomes.","So all in all, what I think is really a great quarter. And I'll turn it over to you, Doug.","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. Like you said, the third quarter was another strong quarter for Gallagher, so it's nice to have three of them behind us this year.","Let's start with the first page, the Brokerage segment adjusted EPS was $0.57. As for foreign currency, you'll see about $0.02 this quarter and we expect that amount again in the fourth quarter, but very low impact in 2016 assuming today's exchange rates.","But foreign currency still seems to be the biggest modeling challenge. So, to control for the impact of foreign currency, I think you should go back and first reduce your 2014 fourth quarter total reported revenues by about $25 million. That will get you to about $770 million last year fourth quarter. Then apply your organic growth pick to that number. Next, add rollover revenues from M&A that we show on page 15 of our Investor Supplement, plus your pick for new M&A in the fourth quarter and assume most of those close in December. If you follow this approach, in that order, that should help you refine your models.","As for integration, Pat spent a lot of time today going over the status of each of our integration efforts around the world and our expected cost to complete in 2016. In total, we're seeing that add up to about $0.08 or so of integration costs in the fourth quarter of 2015, then down to about $0.06 in the first quarter of 2016, $0.05 in Q2, $0.03 in Q3 and in Q4 of 2016, and by then we should be done.","Turning to page three to the Brokerage segment organic revenue growth. First, note that all of our larger international mergers are now fully reflected in our organic computations. In total, they posted about 2.5% organic growth. The U.K. portion was over 3%, Canada was over 6%, New Zealand was 2% and Australia was down about 4% reflecting a soft market Pat mentioned a few minutes ago. I think this is absolutely outstanding performance, especially given they're still working through integration and just getting to be comfortable working within the Gallagher family of professionals.","Moving to page four, to the Brokerage segment adjusted EBITDAC margin table near the bottom of the page. As we forecasted in our last call, margins came in about flat \u2013 actually up about 10 basis points, which is actually really good work by the team in a 3% organic growth environment. Looking forward, last year, our Brokerage segment posted about 24.4 points of adjusted margin in the fourth quarter. If we post 3% this coming fourth quarter, and I'm not saying we will or we won't post that, I wouldn't expect to see margins above 25% if we did.","Finally, on the Brokerage segment, here are some noncash estimates for the fourth quarter. For depreciation, assume about $17 million of expense; for amortization, about $58 million. Acquisition earn-out amortization expense, assume about $5 million. And then as we do more M&A, for every dollar we spend, you'll need to increase amortization about 1% of the purchase price per quarter, and that should get you close.","Now, let's turn to the Risk Management segment on page five. As Pat said a couple times, really an excellent quarter across the board. Of the 9.3% organic growth, domestic was about 9% and international was pushing 11%. Looking forward, as you model the fourth quarter, two items to remember: First, you need to reduce fourth quarter 2014 revenues by about $5 million for FX and then also reduce it again by about $4.5 million for the large Australian client that went into runoff last year. That should give you an adjusted 2014 fourth quarter total revenue of about $162 million of revenues. Then apply your organic growth percentage pick to that adjusted number.","As for margins, we again blew past our 16.5% target margin this quarter, but that said, I see us more towards that 16.5% target in the fourth quarter of 2015. Also, for Risk Management depreciation, model about $6 million in the fourth quarter and you'll get close.","Okay. Let's now shift to page six, to the Corporate segment shortcut table. Two items make it a little noisy, so please take time to look at footnotes three and four to that shortcut table. In note three, you'll see the $22.3 million net gain from the litigation settlement. And then in note four, you'll read that we had positive timing on our clean energy investments that pulled about $11 million of earnings from the fourth quarter into the third, which again results mostly to the timing of the litigation settlement hitting in the third quarter.","Next, flip to page seven to the table where we show what we might ultimately earn from our clean energy investments. The team made tremendous progress in the third quarter. Demand for our plants surged and we're now down to only a few plants that are not earmarked for a host utility. Footnote one to that table says we won't fully reach the numbers in 2016 but by 2017, we should have a decent chance at hitting them. If we do, we'll see about 15% year-on-year growth in both 2016 and 2017 from our clean energy investments.","Then if you turn to page 14 of our Investor Supplement, we've updated our estimates for the fourth quarter of 2015 to reflect the timing I just mentioned and as you work on your 2016 models, just assume about $17 million of interest expense per quarter, about $2 million of M&A costs per quarter, $5 million of corporate costs, and about $4.5 million of litigation settlement costs. Then for clean energy, just bump up 2015 quarterly numbers by about 15% and that will get you close enough for now. I'll update all this in our January call. Also to be clear, all of the numbers I just gave you were after-tax net earnings.","Finally, some comments on our M&A program. To-date, our average multiple paid is 6.8 times EBITDAC. Our weighted average multiple is 7.6 and if you exclude the one platform deal that we did, all of the other mergers' weighted average multiple paid is less than 7 times EBITDAC. When I look at our fourth quarter pipeline, I see the potential to close another dozen or so tuck-in mergers, also at about a 7x multiple. Simply put, we're looking for committed partners that want to stay in the business, join our family of professionals, use our capabilities to sell more insurance and take a fair price for their agency. Based on that pipeline, we intend on using cash and debt to fund most all of it. If so, our forecasted fully diluted weighted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter will be about flat to this quarter.","So, those are my comments for this quarter and like I said to start, another really strong quarter. Back to you, Pat.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. Manny, I think we're ready for questions now and hopefully, some answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question is from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","First question, I was hoping in terms of the Brokerage organic growth, was there any seasonality when we look at the 3% kind of number overall, just to kind of set expectations for the fourth quarter? Anything that impacted that seasonally or any one-timer is in that number?","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","No. That would've been reflected already in that. So our international deals, our international operations, they do have slightly lower seasonality in the third quarter, but nothing that would impact it dramatically.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then just to make sure, when you gave the organic growth numbers, that was just for the acquisitions, right, in the Brokerage segment? How was the organic growth for the U.S. overall and also internationally just on an overall basis?","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","The U.S. organic was just a tad below 3%, international is just a touch above 3%, so not too terribly far off either way.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then I noticed the integration costs, I think they were a bit higher than you had pointed to this quarter; is that because some charges were pushed up and you kind of \u2013 some of the integration is getting done sooner than you had previously expected?","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","In there, there's $0.02 of a balance sheet clean-up item that we cleaned up that actually was a non-cash clean-up item that drove that number up just a little bit, but it had nothing to do with the current operations or the current activities. It just was a balance sheet receivable that didn't come in.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's great. And then it was \u2013 you gave a great outlook in terms of the markets globally. In terms of Australia, would you say \u2013 it seems like overall \u2013 I know that's been a bit of a troubling market, but have things changed? Or it's more just kind of being consistent with what you've seen throughout the year?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's been very consistent. It's a soft market, and that's downward pressure. It's the old soft market playbook.","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","Yes. Actually, it's consistent with the market when we bought the OAMPS acquisition down there. As a matter of fact, the Australian operations actually are coming in at their budget or slightly better, so the reality of it is, the market is a \u2013 it's been a known market for us there. It's nothing surprising to us. It's just the reality of the market.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And their economy is soft.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks so much, and congrats on a great quarter.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Elyse.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ryan Tunis of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, thanks. Good morning.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Ryan.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","First question is just on Brokerage margins. I think this one's probably for Doug. But thinking back to last call, I think comparing it to the third quarter of last year when you guys did 26.8%, I think Doug called out some headwinds for why that would be difficult perhaps to repeat. I'm just wondering, from your perspective, what allowed you to deliver better than that this quarter? Were there maybe some expenses that got pushed to the fourth quarter or anything along those lines?","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","Actually, the team did a great job of just hitting their budget. We forecasted it to be flat. We mentioned that in our last call. The fact that we posted 3% all-in organic growth, that's about where we thought it would be, so there was nothing special in that.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. And then just on wholesale, I guess another strong quarter there. What's driving that? And how should we think about the outlook there, I guess, over the next \u2013 in the near to medium term, given some of the pricing headwinds I think Pat called out in property?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, part of that, Ryan, we're the largest MGA in the country, and so our underwriting operations are doing very, very well. But, our open market broking folks are as well. So, it's \u2013 we're soft on the property placements and that's a big part of what they do, but we're doing a very good job of generating new business. We've had some nice acquisitions there that are performing well over the last couple of years and our MGAs are doing extremely well.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks, guys.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Ryan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Sean Dargan of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks, good morning. Just following up on Elyse's question about Australia, in talking to some people down there, they've indicated that Steadfast and Austbrokers have been pretty aggressive in trying to pick off your producers. And I realize it's a slowing economy and a soft market, but to what degree has stepped-up competition among local players impacted your organic growth there?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Very little. I'd say at the very outset of the acquisition, we had a blip in some turnover and the turnover is very nicely under control now. So, we're not seeing an excessive turnover whatsoever. As I said, my trip down there was exciting because the team is young and pumped up, and they've got a lot of good things going and there are a lot of things that we're bringing to the table for them that \u2013 our strategies and capabilities that they weren't doing under the conglomerate, Wesfarmers. Not that Wesfarmers had anything wrong; it was just a piece of a conglomerate. This is the business we're in. So, we're not losing people by and large to our competitors down there and in fact, I think they're excited about the fact that we bring them a lot more capabilities.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And then I believe you have about 30% market share in New Zealand with Crombie Lockwood; is there any room to expand that? Or is that about as deep as you can go there?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We think we can expand it. Now, it's a small country and we've got a big share. But, truthfully, we're underrepresented in the corporate marketplace there and we're not represented in the public sector clients there, and those are two things that we're very strong in the United States. So, we've got people traveling to New Zealand and Australia from the U.S. in our vertical niche capabilities and we think we can expand that.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then just one last question about the clean energy strategy. I think some investors were more surprised to see the 15% annualized growth through 2017. And there's a steady drumbeat of articles in the press about natural gas killing off coal and I think some folks were concerned about the administration's clean air proposal. I'm just wondering if you can give us any color about what's driving the utilization of your plants?","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","Yes. Great question. First, I don't know why anybody was surprised. I've said that \u2013 essentially, if you go back a year ago, we said that 2016 \u2013 or 2015 would be a little bit of a flat year compared to the 2014, and then we'd have another step-up in 2016 and 2017. So that message has been very consistent for the last 15 months. The surge in activity, we actually talked about that also in our call that we get a lot of surge of activity in August and September as host utilities look at their capital budgets for next year, so that's when the robust activity occurs.","Now, next \u2013 in your question, let's work backwards from the Clean Air Act. That really takes effect in 2022. If it goes in and it's graded into 2030, those \u2013 remember, our plants last produce tax credits in 2021. So, we don't see those as having a big issue, or that law having a big issue with respect to running our plants through 2021. Next, we \u2013 our plants are better, they're more efficient. Or excuse me, the host utilities where we put our plants are better, they're more efficient, they're earlier on in the dispatch curve. And so, as a result, they're less likely to be retired than the broader fleet. So, I don't think it's good to use historical trends to predict what will happen to our 20 different locations. There's about 600 different utility plants out there and we're operating about 20 of them, and they're better and less likely to retire.","Second of all, the displacement of natural gas, you can go out to the Energy Information Administration web site and you can see that the displacement of coal to use natural gas, there was a surge in that over the last five years. But, even that official site doesn't predict that happening, certainly not between 2021.","So, we think our plants are better-positioned. I think they're less likely \u2013 and frankly, we sit at the strategic table with our host utilities and we know in advance of what their plans are. And frankly, if they're going to retire a plant, we won't put in one of our clean energy plants. So we believe our plants will run through 2021. They're at better locations. They're not subjected to natural gas. They're better placed in the dispatch curve, better placed regionally in terms of coal versus natural gas utilization. So, I don't see the risk that these plants will be displaced the way the broader fleet might have been.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you.","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","Sure.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Sean.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Adam Klauber of William Blair. Please go ahead.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","A couple of different questions. On the share count, you've issued roughly \u2013 sorry, you've issued roughly 12 million shares. In the release, I think you identify 7 million due to acquisitions and earn-outs. What are the other 5 million for?","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","Let's see. I don't know where you got your 12 million from, but the difference in there year-to-date that excludes the secondary offering that we did in 2014 numbers. So, the 7 million of shares \u2013 I'd have to look to see where you're getting the 12 million number. Sorry, I don't know.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","The 12 million, you started the year at, I believe, 164 million \u2013 164.5 million, and I think you're at 176.5 million as far as...","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","Oh, I see what you're asking. It's the dribble-out shares that are in there when we did our ATM.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","I'm sorry, what are those shares for \u2013 being used for?","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","Well, we use those for acquisitions throughout the year. Remember, we used the dribble-out in order to really buy the William Gallagher agency.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay.","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","So the 12 million shares, if you go back to year-to-date, those are the shares that went out to fund acquisitions this year. I don't believe we're going to use any here in the fourth quarter and our outlook for 2016 is not to use hardly any shares either.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then as far as the William Gallagher deal, what's the earn-out on that deal?","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","We don't have an earn-out.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","There's no earn-out.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","No earn-out. Okay. And then as far as, you laid out the acquisition costs for this year and next year. In the press release, you have two different lines. You've got acquisition costs, but then you've got workforce or restructuring. Is the number you laid out...","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","That's workforce & lease terminations, yes.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you. Is the number laid out, does that include the lease termination?","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, it does.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","That does? Okay.","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","But lease termination related to other activities and lease termination primarily not related to the acquisition. If it's integration-related severance or lease termination, it goes in the acquisition integration line. If it's just other workforce and lease termination that we're doing as we downsize some of our locations just through natural \u2013 that's where we put it, in the workforce and lease termination line.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then as far as operating cash flow related to working capital, do you think that will add to cash flow this year or take away from cash flow?","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","What was the question, Adam? Just say again. Sorry.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Sure. Operating cash flow related to working capital, do you think that's going to help operating cash flow or hurt operating cash flow this year?","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","I think that we're going to have a positive to cash flow on working capital because as we go through the integration and we consolidate massive amounts of \u2013 like for instance, we have over 400 different bank accounts related to the acquisitions that we did with Giles, Oval primarily. As we consolidate those bank accounts, we believe we'll be able to free up more cash. Right now, we have about $200 million of cash in the banks around the world that we can scrape together and use more efficiently once we go through the remaining pieces of our integration efforts. So that should improve working capital.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","So should that be more 2016, or will \u2013 should that be more 2016?","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, I think we'll shake most of it out in 2016.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Adam.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good morning.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Congratulations on the quarter. Maybe just a little bit more about the types of deals that you're looking for prospectively and maybe in the context of, obviously, some areas have become more competitive in terms of looking for types of deals, are you ending up looking at things in different geographies than you were say a few months ago and such?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, if you recall, one of the things we were excited about as we came into 2015 is the fact that these moves that we made in New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the U.K. gave us credible platforms to be able to do bolt-on and tuck-in acquisitions. And we signaled that we would be back to doing our normal acquisitions and that's in fact what we've done. If you look at 29 transactions and about $180 million, you get an idea of kind of what our average revenue is on these deals.","And I will tell you that the pipelines that have built in Australia, New Zealand, the U.K. and Canada are becoming more robust every single month. So it's absolutely working the way that we had hoped it would work. We're a credible buyer now in those geographies; which just one year ago, we really weren't.","In the United States, we've got 30 years of activity that has continued to build our pipeline. We've got a very strong pipeline. As Doug mentioned, we think we'll close a good number of additional transactions in the fourth quarter and we see a continuation into 2016 of our typical tuck-in acquisitions. And these are anywhere from $2 million to $10 million that don't frankly demand the same level of multiple that some of the larger transactions that some of our competitors are doing, and that fits right in with the formula we've been doing for 30 years.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay, fantastic. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Bob Glasspiegel of Janney Capital. Please go ahead.","Robert R. Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Good morning, Arthur J. Gallagher.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Bob Glasspiegel.","Robert R. Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","The old man can learn a few tricks here, change his ways. The U.K. settlement, I mean, it's good news we get dollars in upfront, but I'm a little confused about the incremental expenses that follow on that you highlighted in footnote three. Is that sort of rebuilding the organization and hiring?","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","No, Bob. What those are, those are incremental, really retention agreements that we needed to do to solidify our folks there and some additional head count that was required in order to work on this. These are incremental expenses and if you add it all up, it ends up being fairly close to what the settlement ended up being. So, those are just the ongoing costs and because you're doing them on a retention basis, you amortize those expenses over the future period of the retention, not against the gain. So you get the gain this quarter, and then you add up all the small little costs that go out through the mid-part of 2017, and they get pretty close to washing out between the two.","Robert R. Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","You're housing those in Corporate and I assume adjusting them out. Is there not any sort of business relationship between the retention bonuses you're paying and their production?","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","These \u2013 well, first and foremost, we put it in Corporate to keep it clean, to keep it matched up into the right \u2013 into the same line, so we can track it a little bit easier over time. Second of all, these are the incremental amounts that we would view as related to the defection of the management team, and not to the core basic business of running the brokerage operation...","Robert R. Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","So, there's no revenues associated with these?","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","...this is up in the business.","Robert R. Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","These are not production \u2013 these are not producers that you're paying these retention bonuses to? They're management, that they're sort of replacing the old team? Is that the way to think about it?","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","The lion's share is in the management ranks.","Robert R. Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. I got it. Great. Thanks a lot.","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Bob.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Dan Farrell with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Daniel D. Farrell - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Daniel D. Farrell - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Pat, thanks for some of the commentary around the integration. It sounds like that's progressing well. I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit on where you think you stand on achieving some of the synergies that you thought you might be able to get from some of these deals? Thank you.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I feel really good about it. As Doug mentioned, we don't publish budgets and the like, but these enterprises are essentially on plan as we came into 2015. We knew that Australia was going to face a soft market, as was New Zealand, so we took that into account. Whenever you do significant large deals, I think the very first thing you're looking to is, are you going to renew that book of business and are you going to show some growth? Are there going to be opportunities for people the sell more as you rebrand? And there's good and bad about rebranding. I mean, I think that's change and people oftentimes have a difficult time with change. But, by and large, I'm incredibly positive.","So, I'll give you an example. I was in Melbourne, Australia just a few weeks ago. We had our Australian branch managers there and it was a terrific meeting. You'd think that these people had had meetings like this all the time when they were under Wesfarmers and the fact is, they really hadn't and didn't have the tools we're brining. Just examples of cross-selling, you know, where we've been able to help each other opened new opportunities. We've got our public sector people down there a number of times this year. So, things like that are going very well and when I see all the enterprises, with the exception of Australia, showing organic growth in the very first operating year after the acquisition, I'm extremely pleased.","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, Dan, I think on the cost side too, the synergies are there. As I mentioned or as Pat mentioned that the Canadian operations are going to go under the same system that we're running here in the U.S., so that will be helpful. Also, I think in terms of just getting to where we \u2013 when we do a small tuck-in acquisition, probably six months to nine months into it, they're pretty well up and running into Gallagher. They've kind of integrated themselves into the operation. I think on these larger deals, it has taken us more like 18 months to get them fully into us, getting them trading with some of our folks in the U.S., understanding our capabilities, understanding what we can do to help them to sell more business, getting our niche leaders in their organization. That takes about 18 months or so. And we're at that point right now, and truthfully when you add them all up, the organic was 2.5% for all the large deals kind of pushed together. So I think that's pretty good.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And in my prepared remarks, Dan, I made a couple of comments on taking down data centers and migrating people to systems. That is where we see some synergies as well, getting numbers of key operating units from 200 down to 50, that's good work.","Daniel D. Farrell - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","That's helpful. Thank you. And then, Doug, just a quick thing on cash balance, about $370 million at the end of the quarter. How much of that is usable cash, would you say?","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","About $200 million of that is usable. But, again, it's in a lot of bank accounts that I've got to pool together and consolidate in order to really get the efficiency. But that's okay; it's there; it's ours to use; it's just going to take me a little bit longer to pull it together.","Daniel D. Farrell - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. All right. Great. Thank you very much.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Sarah DeWitt of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","A follow-up on the clean coal earnings. Is there a point at which you're utilizing all the clean coal credits, so the earnings there should level out at some point? Or how do you think about the earnings trajectory of those investments beyond 2017?","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","I would say they're flat through 2017. But, at that point, we'll be harvesting more cash out of them than probably the GAAP earnings. Right now, the GAAP earnings are slightly higher than the cash earnings on that, but that will flip in 2017 where the actual cash earnings are higher than the GAAP earnings. So at that point, I'll lay that all out and show it to you. But, I would say that we've still got ramp up in 2016 and 2017, and maybe there's a touch in 2018. But, I think that 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 will be largely flat to 2017. But, cash will be \u2013 cash harvest will be bigger.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Sarah.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Sarah.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Seth Canetto of KBW. Please go ahead.","Seth Canetto - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Good morning.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Seth.","Seth Canetto - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","I just had a question on the Risk Management. It seems like the higher Risk Management margin improvement, is that sustainable? And probably even more impressive than just the higher margin is the organic growth. How are you guys achieving such strong results in Risk Management? And are there any areas that are specifically driving strong double-digit organic growth there?","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I'll take the margin one and let Pat talk about the growth. The margin, we run that business \u2013 as we've been saying for the last couple years, we're making investments to better our service offering to our customers and that's really starting to take hold. Customers are seeing that the issue is not the service on the claims and the costs of the claims; it's really the claim outcome. And we're demonstrating that we can help them get their folks back to work, get them healthy much faster by using our proprietary methods, techniques and systems.","So that's the reason why the business is doing well and that leads to the margin expansion on it. But, there is a heavy investment load going into that business to make sure that we're offering a competitive environment. We used to be at 16 points of margin for our targets. We've moved it up to 16.5% for this year. We'll go through the budget process this fall and we'll come to a conclusion with them about what's the margin target for 2016, what kind of investment level there is. But, right now, in that 16% to 17% margin range is comfortable for what we need to offer the clients.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And I think Doug made a comment in his prepared remarks that look to the fourth quarter to be closer to 16.5%. As far as the top line goes, I think we've just found a very solid new business. We're blessed to have a terrific organization in Australia. And in the U.K., they're contributing significantly. The United States is, of course, where we've been recognized as leaders in that industry for years and years and our pipeline of new business continues to build and we're hitting on all cylinders.","Our renewals are sensational. We renew more than our revenue that is expiring. We typically renew in the area of 101% to 102% of revenue. That comes from claim count growth and the organic growth of our clients. That doesn't just come \u2013 that's not rate increases. But, when you've got that kind of a retention and you can put some good new business on, you start to see those types of numbers.","Seth Canetto - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. And this is probably a question for Doug, but given the lower energy prices we're seeing, is there any impact to the utilization of the Chem-Mod products? And could there potentially be any hurdles there?","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","Well, like I mentioned a little bit ago, we believe that our \u2013 where we've locate our clean energy treatment facilities at host utilities, we think they're less likely to experience retirements, shutdowns, slowdowns relative to the broader industry trends that you read about. There's about 700 locations out there in the country. We're operating in about 20 of them, and even within those 20, we're not operating at all of their boilers. We're operating at their most optimal boilers that they intend to use.","And if you know something about electricity, is there's a dispatch curve. The first things that get uses are nuke and solar, and then they move up the dispatch curve and then some of the last producing units can be natural gas units that are way out on the dispatch curve.","So if a utility is operating at 50% to 75% or 90% of \u2013 or if there's a demand that's in the 50th to 75th percentile of demand, most of our plants are positioned where they'll first be turned on before they go to other sources. So we don't see \u2013 and by the way, it takes a long time to displace a plant that's burning coal with natural gas. You've got to get the pipes there. You've got to \u2013 and pretty well, most of that infrastructure and that development was done between 2008 and 2014. So that continued decrease in fuel costs by natural gas should not have a dramatic effect on us over the next five to six years.","Seth Canetto - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","All right. Great. And then I believe you guys mentioned earlier in the call that lower insurance rate and the softening market only impacted organic growth by less than one point in the quarter. So, I guess how do you guys think of the insurance brokerage organic growth, given the concerns in London specialty, Australia and New Zealand?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think that \u2013 go ahead, Doug.","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","I think those are baked into our numbers. The softening \u2013 I don't want to use softening. The weakening that we saw in those areas, softening in Australia, they're in our numbers for the third quarter. So I would expect that to be similar in the fourth quarter.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And I'll tell you, my prepared remarks, I said besides cat-exposed property, things are still flattish. If you go back and take a look at the hard market\/soft market cycles that we've lived with since the 1960s, a soft market typically sees prices coming down 10%, 15% a year and that can go on for a decade. We're not seeing that.","If there's an account that needs a rate increase, the market is still trying very hard to put forward a rate increase. By the same token, if our people come across a very nice account that hasn't been marketed for a while, has been very successful and has not burned the market and it deserves a 15% to 20% decrease, it's going to get it. I consider that to be a professional kind of deliberate flattish market.","So if rates are down in one line or another \u2013 take workers' compensation, or directors and officers \u2013 if rates are down 3%, 4%, that's going to impact organic. But, it's 3%, 4%; we'll outsell that. If it's up 2% or 3%, I still say in that band of 5%, you're talking flat, and that's kind of how the market feels.","Seth Canetto - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","All right. Great. Thanks a lot for the answers.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Seth.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Charles Sebaski of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning. Thanks.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Charles.","Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","First question, just curious about not the clean coal, but exposure to energy. If I'm thinking about some of the larger recent acquisitions, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, what's the exposure to the energy infrastructure of those books of business? And what's your level of concern given the challenges the energy sector's gone on regarding your businesses there?","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I look to mention, first of all, in Australia, New Zealand and Canada we have about $15 million of total revenues related to energy-related clients. Now, I can't say what's the trickle-down effect of some of those, but it's a very small portion of our $2.5 billion worth of revenue. So our energy exposure in those countries that have large commodity-related economies is about $15 million.","If you look here in the U.S., we might have $30 million but a lot of that, maybe half of that's in the benefits space even. So we're talking about having \u2013 they're still employing. We are \u2013 we do have nice practices in Houston and we will see a little bit there. In London, we trade generally through our specialty lines there, in energy, we might have $20 million of revenues. So as you can see, if you add all this up, we're somewhere in the $50 million to $70 million of direct energy-related revenues out of $2.5 billion of Brokerage and then $4.5 billion in total.","So, I'd say in Gallagher Bassett, that's very little exposure to that. Remember, most of our business is in the SME and the mid-market area; those areas are pretty resilient to this type of change in the marketplace.","Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Excellent. Thank you. I guess the other one is on acquisitions and on your use of equity versus cash and debt. Do you look at that equally when you're contemplating offering shares for acquisitions? Is the \u2013 I guess the question is, is the hurdle higher if you need to issue equity versus some of the tuck-ins from cash flow or debt utilization?","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","Well, first of all, we always want to use cash first and equity second. That's just the way we do it. There are times, however, because of the structure of the transaction, if we want to do a tax-free exchange, where the seller will demand stock, and if that's the case, we'll do that. At this point, there isn't \u2013 we always think that equity is more precious. We've been in such a huge growth spurt over the last three years that we've needed to use equity, but I just don't see us needing to use that much equity based on our current pipeline of nice tuck-in acquisitions.","If we're out there doing them at 7x and we're paying cash for them, we've got \u2013 as our \u2013 we'll have more capacity for debt. I just don't see us using a lot of equity going forward.","Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And what would you say the debt capacity is now relative to outstanding authorizations and plus your relative take on leverage?","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","I think that we would probably do another $200 million to $300 million of permanent debt at this point.","Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Excellent. Thank you very much for the answers.","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","All right.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Chuck.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thank you.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So to follow up on Chuck's question on the acquisition and equity issuance, I just wondered what's your take on the use of free cash flow going forward, the balance between doing acquisitions, grow your business, as well as shareholder returns, including buybacks?","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","Well, right now, I think that we'll take \u2013 for any merger partner that would like to join us that has great relationships with their customers, wants to use our capabilities, wants to trade with our \u2013 in our niches, use our offshore centers of excellence, use our internship program \u2013 if they're willing to sell to us in that six to eight times range, I think we'd prefer to do that every day versus buying back shares.","So, right now, we are in a \u2013 we think there's tremendous opportunities to still pick up partners that are committed to be in the business, they want to sell insurance and they want to do it as a part of a global organization that bring in capabilities, we'd much rather do that than we would buy shares at this point.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And we still have the strongest dividend payout.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. But just in terms of EPS growth going forward, you believe it is, incrementally, it's more positive by acquiring this business, the earning contribution from it more than offset the diluting effects of share issuance?","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","I don't think that we're going to be issuing a lot of shares going forward, so I wouldn't think there's a dilutive impact going forward.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And Kai, we don't dilute ever on purpose.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. All right. That's great to hear. A second question on the industry consolidation, just what's your take on that, is the potential impact of benefits to both your businesses, on the broker side as well as administrative side?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, you're referring to the carrier consolidation?","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Look, I think that on the benefit side, we've seen significant carrier consolidation that has changed that industry significantly over the last 20 years and continues to push us to be more consultants than brokers. We're not \u2013 we're no longer really going out to very many clients on the benefits side and talking about what the rate environment is this year.","It's all around consulting about what their human capital needs are and how we're going to help them to maintain their employee base. And I think consolidation in the property casualty business is a long cry away from what we saw in benefits and I think you're going to see more of it. I think in this environment, this economic environment and this return environment, that's one way you're going to see growth.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you so much.","Douglas K. Howell - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Kai.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Manny, I think that's about it. I think we're towards the end here. Why don't I just give a few wrap-up comments and we'll call it a day?","At the outset of the call, I mentioned that I was pleased with our organic growth. All in, 4% \u2013 4.1% is a very strong result. Over the past decade, we've invested heavily in our new business and retention strategies. We've brought in sales training and sales management. Our cross-selling efforts between our wholesale, PC and our benefits teams are at all-time highs. Our international and U.S. teams are working seamlessly on all types of new business. Our merger and acquisition pipeline is strong. So, it's safe to say that our aggressive sales culture is alive and well.","We're pleased with the quarter and appreciate you being with us today.

Unfortunately, there will likely be more claims filed over the coming weeks driven by the wild fires in California. 2017 could be one of the costliest insured natural catastrophe loss years on record, with catastrophe modeling firms estimating more than $100 billion of insured losses from the US hurricanes and Mexico earthquakes alone.","In my opinion, this is the time for our industry, the insurance industry to shine as losses get paid and lives get put back together. I'm honored to work in an industry responsible for such an important task.","Now, I'd like to go on to my comments regarding our third quarter. In our usual fashion, Doug and I are going to touch on the four key components of our value creation strategy. I'll address three of those, number one, organic growth; number two growing through mergers and acquisitions and number three, maintaining our very unique Gallagher culture.","And Doug will touch on the fourth, which is improving our productivity and quality. Once again, the team delivered on all of our strategic priorities. I am extremely pleased with our performance in the quarter and through the first nine months of 2017.","First, let me make some comments on our brokerage segment. Third quarter organic growth was 3.5% all in, base commission and fee growth was 3.7, with supplemental and contingence coming in flat as we had forecasted at our September 15, investor day. Let me give you some more detail around the organic growth in the quarter.","Domestic retail property and casualty was just a touch below 3%. Domestic wholesale was flat. Employee benefits was around 2%, but there was some negative timing we expect to catch up in the fourth quarter. UK and Bermuda property and casualty was over 5% with some positive timing from the fourth quarter that about offset the negative domestic benefit timing. Canada and South America was 3% and last but not least Australia and New Zealand really crushed it with over 8% organic growth.","Let me move to the rate environment. I recently returned from the counsel of insurance agents and brokers annual meeting where I met with many insurance carriers. Based on my conversations with carriers and consistent with what I'm hearing from our folks in the field, there's likely to be some modest hardening in the property rates coming. Carriers are reacting rationally, but focusing on those catastrophe exposed lines and they're not just looking for rate increases across the board.","Having said that, we're also seeing many casualty lines continuing reform, while it does take some time for price increases to be reflected in our results, the internal pricing data does indicate some upward movement in pricing. In addition over the last month, I met with our international leaders from our UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand operations.","So let me give you some details on our international property and casualty pricing as it does vary quite a bit by geography. For example, Australia and New Zealand are experiencing about 5% upward movement in pricing. Our UK retail and Canada operations are seeing a stable rate environment and London specialty continues to see pricing in negative territory.","Finally, on the topic of rate, our internal data shows global PC pricing flat in the third quarter. That's an improvement over the second quarter. With our own data confirming what I'm hearing from carriers and the feedback I'm receiving from our folks on the ground, I think global pricing could continue to increase and be a possible small tailwind for our business.","I remain optimistic that we can deliver full year 2017 organic growth similar to or perhaps even better than our 2016 result. Adding the potential for some modest increases in rates, I think 2018 brokerage organic could even be better than 2017.","Second, let me talk about brokerage merger and acquisition growth. We completed six tuck-in brokerage acquisitions this quarter at fair prices. The average size of the six tuck-ins we completed in the quarter was $6 million in annualized revenue. Through the first nine months, we completed 27 tuck-in mergers and our weighted average multiple paid is about eight times. Our pipeline of potential merger partners is very full and looking at our internal merger and acquisition report, I see over $250 million of revenues associated with around 50 term sheets either agreed upon or being prepared.","Not all these acquisitions will close, but I feel good about our ability to continue attracting our typical small tuck-in acquisition partners at fair prices will value our capabilities and know that we can be better together. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals.","So let me wrap up the brokerage segment. The team posted 8% total adjusted revenue growth and 3.5% organic, adjusted EBITDAC growth of 8% and adjusted EBITDAC margin 27.9%, up 5 basis points over the third quarter in 2016, really strong results for the brokerage team.","Next, I'd like to move to our risk management segment, which is primarily Gallagher Bassett Services. Third quarter organic growth was 10.2%, which benefited from about 2 points of favorable audit fees. So if the 8% organic, we saw about 8.5 in the US and about 6% international.","In the US, we had a nice lift from our insurance carrier of captive books and internationally we had excellent sales in New Zealand and the UK. Regardless of geography, our customers can see that we're delivering superior claim outcomes. With year-to-date organic over 5%, I'm pleased with our risk management as rebounded from 2016.","So far, this year our risk management team has completed three acquisitions including one during the third quarter. Third quarter merger partner was a US based trucking focused claims adjuster. This particular franchise has a specialized service offering that will be very complimentary to our risk management segment's operations. A great example of the type of partner we're trying to attract.","And finally let me talk about our culture. October 2 marked Gallagher's 90th anniversary and all of our global operations took time throughout the day to commemorate this special occasion. Well, clearly a time to celebrate on all that we have accomplished as an organization, we decided to mark our 90th anniversary by setting a companywide goal of 90,000 hours of charitable work over the next 12 months.","Our company is committed to our local communities and in any one of our locations around the world, our culture hangs together, a culture that is grounded on a rock-solid foundation of ethics, superior client service, dedication to our community and encapsulated in the Gallagher way. I'm confident our culture will thrive for another 90 years and beyond.","An excellent quarter, really great first nine months of the year. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?","Doug Howell","Thanks, Pat and hello, everyone. A really terrific third quarter, the highlight of which is our brokerage and risk management segment combined to post 4.6% organic growth, that's really, really excellent work in this environment.","Today, I'll touch on some modeling items using the CFO commentary document that we posted on our website. I'll provide some comments on margins, clean energy, M&A and cash, then as Pat said, I'll wrap up with some comments on productivity and quality, one of our four value creation strategies.","First, to page 2 of the CFO commentary, you'll see that all of the third quarter 2017 actual came in very close to the estimates we provided during our September 15 investor day. We really appreciate everyone that attends or listens to our quarterly updates and those of you that spend the extra time to update your models after those meetings. Our next IR day will be on December 12.","First, let's move to page 2 of the CFO commentary, to foreign currency. With the dollar weakening relative to fourth quarter 2016, FX should now flip to a small tailwind here in the fourth quarter of 2017. You'll see how we expect foreign currency to be about 10 million of tailwind in the brokerage segment revenues in the fourth quarter, which will then offset the headwinds during the year and end up with only about 20 million of headwind for the full year. That's the impact on revenue, but you'll see there's not really that much impact on EPS.","Second, turning to page 5 of the CFO commentary, we've given our best guess after rolling revenues from mergers that we've completed till yesterday and we'll update this information on December 12 IR day. Like I said last quarter, we understand making an estimate for rolling revenues is a difficult pick, but it can really be quite sensitive on EPS, so time is well spent on that.","Let's move away from the CFO commentary back to the earnings release to page 5, to the brokerage segment margins. For the year, we're up 57 basis points. This quarter, just like last year's third quarter and also in line with what we said on our September 15 IR day, we effectively held margins flat, actually up about 5 basis points.","You'll note on that page also that we would have posted about 30 basis points of margin expansion if you exclude new mergers, which don't have the seasonality that we do. We saw that same situation in the second quarter if you recall. Both our second and third quarter margins are higher than what our new mergers are coming in at for the full year.","Now looking forward, last year brokerage adjusted margins were 25.8% in the fourth quarter, but at today's FX rates that would be about 25.5%. Last year fourth quarter, we posted 30 basis points of expansion on about 3.5% organic. It feels like we could have similar results in the fourth quarter of 2017 if we again hit 3.5% organic.","Let's move to the risk management segment, as Pat said a really terrific quarter, but admittedly a bit noisy. You're reading the release and the way we think about it is to strip our revenues of about $4 million of audit fee timing that came from the fourth quarter and then also take out 3 million of special items at operating cost. You will end up with 8% organic and about 17.5 points margin. Even without the noise, those results are terrific.","As we look forward to the fourth quarter, risk management organic however, will be challenged by the shift in the $4 million audit revenues from the fourth quarter into the third and we also again expect little to know performance bonus income, which was $1.4 million last year. So when you stack up those fourth quarter headwinds, we're seeing fourth quarter of 2017 organic of around 2% in the risk management segment. That would still bring our full year ended around 5%, so little up and down by quarter, but looking like a great year nonetheless.","As for fourth quarter margins, 2% organic, margins should come in between 16.5 and 17 points, which would still result in achieving our full year target margin of over 17%.","I'll turn now to the corporate segment. First, to clean energy, we had an excellent third quarter production and our earnings came in a bit over the high end of our estimates and you'll see on page 3 of the CFO commentary that our fourth quarter estimates are right on what we provided on our September 15 IR day, so there's really no news there. However, I must mention that weather can move those estimates by a few million dollars either way.","At September 30, we have over 600 million of tax credits on our balance sheet, effectively $600 million receivable from the government. This asset will reduce our future cash taxes paid for many years to come.","As for cash, at September 30 we had around 275 million of available cash on our balance sheet and with our strong cash flows, it looks like we can fund all of 2017 M&A with free cash and debt.","Now, let me shift back to some comments on our productivity and quality initiatives. The systems and process we've developed over the last decade have allowed us to significantly control our workforce head count. In the last two years, on a middle and back office space of about 16,000 associates, we're only up 200 positions, excluding the acquired businesses.","If our headcount have grown in large step with our organic growth over the same period, we would have grown by over 1,100 positions. Yes, we've grown our offshore centers of excellence a bit, but those positions carry substantially lower cost. What's more exciting is, our quality has dramatically improved over that time.","A couple of examples, first several years ago it took us a couple of days to turn around a certificate insurance and our quality was in the mid 80% range. Now we can turn a certificate in 30 minutes and quality is over 99% and now over two million of certificates issued over the last year. That's really meaningful for a contract if it's trying its crew working to get something in 30 minutes.","As another example, we now check policies for accuracy and under 80 minutes, also at over 99% accuracy. That's down from several hours a few years ago and if you go back a decade, frankly it was a hodgepodge process that frustrated our clients. We've solved that problem and I believe that we've absolute best executives in the business. To put them to perspective, we're reviewing about 200,000 policies a year.","And finally, our efficiency, quality and headcount discipline enable to think differently about real estate. Over the last five years, we've substantially modernized in a right size our real estate footprint. Looking forward, we have some sizable opportunities coming in the fourth quarter. I'll have some estimates of the onetime charges and expected future savings by December 12 investor day. All of this shows the power of our scale and our constant focus on getting better, faster and cheaper.","Those are my comments. We had really great organic this quarter, solid execution on our M&A program, excellent operational discipline and margin expansion and we have a really strong cash position. Back to you Pat.","Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Doug and Karen, we're ready for some questions-and-answers. Hopefully answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The call is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good evening.","Patrick Gallagher","Good evening.","Elyse Greenspan","My first question - so I was just helping to get a little bit more color on just on how you guys are seeing the market, obviously there is a pretty big delta out there in terms of the potential insured losses in the third event we've actually seen disclosed and I think that's led to a lot of dialogue around how much price we could actually get out there and you did allude to the potential performer prices in the U.S. We are kind of magnitude; do you think that we could see, and do you think that this is depending upon seeing insured losses and reported loses get close to about that $100 billion figure that's been floated around?","Patrick Gallagher","Well, Elyse, this is Pat. I think it's pretty earlier in the game right now. These processes are still very fresh and one thing we know from the past is awful lot of the modeling firms those models don't necessarily hold up when it comes to these catastrophes. So we don't know. I think right that $100 billion is somewhere close to what realty will be. There is plenty of capacity beyond that, but we are seeing people already talking to our folks in particular around catastrophe exposed properties. It's not across the board, but they say look need increases and it's reasonable. We got about 23 quarters by our estimate of decreasing property rates and that was I mean that was fair because the clients really want putting a bunch of loses into the market. So to see something on the order of 5 to 15 to 20 wouldn't be unreasonable.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay great. And then in terms of the organic growth outlook, in the prepared remarks was that you were trying to make the - trying to point out that the organic could end up around 3.5% also for the fourth quarter and then in terms of the go-forward view, you were saying '18 to look at a little bit better than '17. What type of price are you start going into that outlook, just so we can idea of prices exceed as I will look at the additives your initial view.","Doug Howell","No, let's clarifying. I said that we are pricing if we had 3.5 points of margin - 3.5 points of organic in the fourth quarter we probably could post about 30 basis points of margin expansion, so I was just giving the sensitivity of flat 3 points probably not much margin expansion of that - if 4 points may be a little bit more. So that was the context of that. I wasn't really prognosticating on what the fourth quarter organic would be for right now, it feels a lot like the second and third quarter.","Elyse Greenspan","And then in terms of what kind of pricing applications you guys are taking about when you say next year could be a little bit better than this year?","Doug Howell","I think that it is one of those things that last year maybe I think all of 2017 we might end up getting a head win from weight of maybe a half a point to a point. So if you think the mixture feels a lot like this, maybe you would see it go up another half a point to a point.","Elyse Greenspan","And that's an all in view meaning if there is any impact from these storms on your level of contingency you kind of affect that element letting us fill that?","Doug Howell","Yes, correct.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then I know that you guys let us know what your investor day that supplemental and contingent, they came out in my expectation to be about flat. Why I guess why were you expecting them to flat and do you have any kind of initial view on what we could expect in the fourth quarter?","Patrick Gallagher","Rates have been decreasing slightly over the past year plus. Loss ratios are up, and contingence are contingent and, so I think that as you go into next year, we will have to see what - the capacities themselves are not going to have huge pyramid, they may in their whole sale side, but across the PC operation globally shouldn't be a bigger impact, but if rates don't firm [ph] or at least hold stable loss ratios rolls high and there will be pressure on contingent.","Doug Howell","Yeah, in this quarter in particular as a couple of million bucks in our wholesale operations domestically on a couple of our programs not related to the catastrophes. just on some of these general liability line and some of the loss of our property line in insurance parts and primarily casualty lines and so that's why we said the domestic wholesale is about flat this quarter and that's also the reason why contingents are about flat.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, that's great. Thank you very much.","Patrick Gallagher","Thank you, Elyse.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Kai Pan","Thank you and good afternoon. By the way thank you for moving - making this call this afternoon making our life a little easier tomorrow morning.","Patrick Gallagher","Well, thanks for being here.","Kai Pan","So the first question a follow-on Elyse's question on the pricing outlook. I just wonder what you tell your brokers right now you are producing it out there and just say in DC modeling and how should we help our clients. From your past experience is what you are experiencing like big catastrophe losses or potential rising prices. Is the environment for you to sort of like is a better or worse environment for you to retain customers or gain market shares?","Patrick Gallagher","That's a great question Kai and one of the things we realize is we probably got about 12 to 13 years of new hirers that have never had to take a price increase to a client. We brought in terms and reduced prices. So one of the things we are doing is putting out into the field some real training those are sort of little longer truth of been through a poor hard markets and nothing makes a client more unhappy than a surprise. So the idea that pricing is likely to move around these catastrophes and again being able to explain to a client that for 23 quarters we brought it cheaper prices which he deserved balance sheets were flush. Now you are going to have a hundred plus billion-dollar payout. It makes some sense. By the way pricing and catastrophe exposed areas of Florida at July first renewals were about equal to or less than 1992 when Andrew hit so to go back and say you know what it's time to reload these balance sheets in a 5% to 15% increase is not unwanted. You got to get out from that early because if you are surprise a client they are not happy, and we don't have people who had been trained in this so we working on it really hard.","Kai Pan","All right. So in the past - this sort of an environment does you think that you will be able on top of the price increase you will be able to sort of gain market share?","Patrick Gallagher","Yes definitely. There is no question about it. There is nothing better than consternation in the market for our professionals to go out and solve some problems.","Kai Pan","Okay that's great. And then just two quick follow up for Doug and one is on the clean curve and do you have sort of indication what is 2018 going to be like - they higher than the current levels or going to be sort of you will reach a steady stay levels.","Doug Howell","Yeah, I think we have said that were pretty close to steady stay most of plants are putting production and our programs got in out of four years running on it, so we are pretty close to steady state on that. Obviously, there is an administrative favorability to call right now. So hopefully the plants will run little bit more than we originally projected but right now we see it flat up just lightly.","Kai Pan","Okay. And then the other one is on - any comments on the pending accounting changes how would that change your sort of income statements for 2018?","Doug Howell","We are still working on it. I think it's probably premature to comment on.","Kai Pan","Okay, when will we be able to find it out its or you said in the fourth quarter -","Doug Howell","Late in the fourth quarter we should some idea and certainly early in the first quarter. Clearly there will be movement by quarter because it will level out some of the seasonality that's been in our business, but what the actual impact is on four-year results, we are still working on that.","Kai Pan","Okay, great. Thank you, so much and good luck.","Doug Howell","Thanks Kai.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joshua Shanker of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Joshua Shanker","Yeah, thank you. I want a follow up Kai's question what's on in the clients somewhat not - one of the under where as you mentioned earlier on a call today that positive property pricing could be too the inversion in the other monitoring lines that you are trying to work through in entire package for our customer. What do you think happens as you rise property prices is that bad of the casualty pricing cycle or where do you see its going right now?","Patrick Gallagher","No, I think what you got is a different market than we have seen - yeah, I have through four market cycles and had been the same since 2005. I think that the general market cycle is dead. I think you are going to have many market cycles based on lines coverage. So workers comp is soft, rates are going down make sense. The clients are better. Property looks like it's probably go up a bit. We got transportation, trucking and automobile it's definitely going up. So I think by-line across the board rates are going to move based on basically what needs to happen on that line. So I do not believe that higher prices on property especially when it comes to Catastrophe [ph] exposed property are going to have any impact on casualty at all.","Joshua Shanker","Okay that was very forceful. Additionally looking at the pipeline on acquisitions an even now in the markets for a while overseas, are you finding the equity markets in the U.S. equally for over the ones overseas. If the Gallagher name out of the same extent that people know that you want to find good people to people to join the team and where will that stand within the next few years, where the folks will be on bringing new team members on?","Patrick Gallagher","Tremendous opportunities you know go back to 2014 and I think basically everybody was kind of had a wait and see add it to around whether Gallagher could truly integrate and have operations in New Zealand and Australia, Canada and the U.K. Those people are all aboard. We just finished our engagement serving globally with 93% participate and taking our survey. 95% of the people had answered the surveys and they understood the Gallagher are cultured to be unique and important and that's across those geographies and so the name is getting out there more and more tuck in acquisitions are that the pipeline is growing and is solid in every one of those locations. So we are seeing opportunities in New Zealand, Australia, Canada, the U.K. and Latin America and of course in the United States is very robust.","Joshua Shanker","Thank you very much, best answers.","Patrick Gallagher","Thanks Joe.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Ryan Tunis","Okay, thanks. Good evening guys.","Patrick Gallagher","Good evening.","Ryan Tunis","Just following up more I guess on the conversation with some of the clients and thinking about maybe some of the unattended consequences of higher rates. I guess only answer is about is all these quarters you have gone back with lower property prices. Do you think that most of your clients have probably - have you been able to get a lot of clients to respond by buying more of other types of insurance arguably with some of the savings in that rate and is one of the difficulties in this conversation if that's true do you thinking if you are passing 10 to 20% rate increases is there - could it be an organic loss set from them maybe buying less elsewhere?","Patrick Gallagher","Well, clearly, we have in fact sold more insurance around the fact that rates have decreased over that period of time. People have extended both their limits and what they are buying one of the greatest examples of course is Cyber and I think you could see some cut tax. There are some clients that will say simply I paid excess zero in pay and tax this year. You tell me we are having a cut back. But I don't see that be in a predominant thing especially when you think about first of all your [ph] exposed property is one line of cover in a multi-line coverage of map. And if that goes up 5 to 15% its' not really impacting whether you want the causality limits at a 150 or a 100. I don't see that. So there could be some pressure, but I think that careers seem to be very reasonable in the approach we are taking now. After 2001 that was our last need jerk full on hard market. So it's been sixteen years and that's not over seen here.","Ryan Tunis","Understood, that's helpful and then just give me a little more color on what's going on in Australia and New Zealand some depraving commentaries pretty good there and at this point how much I guess how big is that book for you guys.","Doug Howell","About 300 million between Australia and New Zealand and we are seeing pricing increase down there around 5% or a little bit more. I think the real spark in what's happening down there is that we have been together now for three years and I think that they are seeing that the sales and service model is helping them sell more customers to so it's not just a rate story down there.","Ryan Tunis","Okay and then my last one was I appreciate the commentary on maybe being able to accelerate organic growth next year, but hearing Doug talk about some of the efficiency initiatives, is real level of organic growth that you think you need be in regard even if it's not acceleration or you think you can still get margin expansion in '18 given this efficiency initiatives.","Doug Howell","You know our standard answer on that is that it pretty tough to show any margin expansion should have got more than 3% organic growth. I think that we have only talk about how we are starting to have some of our other locations like Australia, Canada and the U.K. come on to our service platform that will provide a little bit of lift next year, but remember even if we got to the optimal point we are talking about 25 to $30 million extra of the EBITDA from those location. So on from that stand point that can certainly handle up and add a lot more weight I think that we can be in a position of sixteen thousand associates now, maybe fifteen thousand associates in two years even. So I think that we got the capabilities there, there are some pretty exciting stuff that we are doing them internally with lot of what you might refer to as in short or service and, so I think there is lot sum of opportunity there for us still to get better. And more important our quality at every point we are measuring quality and that's something that we absolutely know is very hard to we are working on that for 12 years now.","Ryan Tunis","Thanks for the answers.","Doug Howell","Thanks, Ryan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Klauber of William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Adam Klauber","Good afternoon guys.","Doug Howell","Hi, Adam.","Adam Klauber","A couple of questions one on the liability causality side, are you seeing a tough environment and is that to some extend what's flowing through some of the tough casualty results these days?","Patrick Gallagher","I don't know if I would say it is a tougher legal environment. I have been around since as best as started really raised ugly had and exceed TEs going raise its ugly head and I think that the plan of as far as pretty good finding places to go so I wouldn't call it any tougher I just say its continuing to be a very look - just the United States in pick to its location.","Doug Howell","Yeah. I don't know over the frequency of severity issue on that had better question for the carriers that really deep knowledge on what's coming in on the client side, but I am not seeing any run-away supplements happening so if it's anything it's a frequency issue. In the frequency issue would be triggered by economic growth because more things happen, more things can go bad. So it is the frequency lead charge that economically driven if that is necessarily because of the legal environment.","Adam Klauber","Okay. That's helpful. And then as far as all the avoid - in particular is taken, but taken some pretty big of - how big of a partner are they for the top 5, top 3?","Patrick Gallagher","No, probably top 4.","Adam Klauber","Okay, okay. My understanding is avoids in the particular is pushing hard for rate would you say that is true?","Patrick Gallagher","Yes.","Douglas K. Howell","Yeah.","Adam Klauber","Yeah. Okay as far as the balance sheet it looks like net debt modeling in last year I guess what level are you confident with going forward?","Patrick Gallagher","I think we are right now, our net debt to - adjusted that is probably about the same Adam, we have been running 25 and 26 on a covenant basis and that's been pretty steady on an adjusted basis in fact, so I don't know exactly what you are looking it might be the way you are detecting some of the cashes on the balance sheet. I don't know if you're picking up respecting cash or not, but I can tell you that we have been pretty steady right now and on a covered basis we feel investment grade to somewhere between 2.5 times to 2.8 times and that's what or about we would like to be.","Adam Klauber","Okay, that's helpful. And then finally for the first nine months of this year the last year has operating flow grown, grow materially?","Patrick Gallagher","Yeah and as you know it's very hard to find that from the GAAP cash flow statement, but yes obviously our cash flow is up substantially we are on integration is behind us building that new office building is done in behind us and this is cash flows off the businesses we grow more or up. So yeah, we are substantially stronger cash flow today. Now operating cash flows grown just nicely with respect to organic I mean as we grow organically our cash flows here as we expand margin our cash flow, but kind of one timers that have been that we have been spending cash on behind us at this point.","Adam Klauber","Okay great. Thanks a lot.","Patrick Gallagher","Thanks Adam.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mark Hughes from of SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Hughes","Yeah, thank you good afternoon.","Patrick Gallagher","Good afternoon Mark.","Mark Hughes","The question of Lloyds, I assume they're pushing on CAT exposed properties. Are they pushing on casualty as well?","Patrick Gallagher","No.","Mark Hughes","Okay.","Patrick Gallagher","Casualty market in the UK is soft.","Mark Hughes","Okay, how about the domestic in the ENS market?","Patrick Gallagher","No, property, casualty is flat.","Mark Hughes","Did you touch on the benefits with health reform on\/off again et cetera? Is that having much of a difference, how has that performed organically?","Patrick Gallagher","Well, organically for the quarter we're about 2%. As we said, we had some stuff that sort of moved to the fourth quarter. So organically we're doing well. The consternation around the ACA is both good and bad for Gallagher. The confusion and the compliance requirements are good for Gallagher because we are out consulting with our clients. The bad news is that the confusion in the compliance drag our people away from just going out and knocking on doors and getting business. So it's a plus and a minus. Overall, I would the ACA is a big plus for Gallagher because it is complicated and now you've got the President basically saying that subsidies to insurance carriers are going to be withheld. You got insurance carriers that are basically committed to rates for 2018. You got all kinds of compliance rules around the carriers' loss ratios and things like that that are kind of influx and it's creating a bunch of consternation, which I think will flow through the next year depending on what happens with whether or not the subsidies are in fact killed, which will put immense stress on the whole system a year from now. So it's good for Gallagher then.","Doug Howell","Yeah, I think one of the things Mark, just look at it this way. The capabilities that we have in our Gallagher Benefit services unit, the consulting capabilities and the tools that they have really allow us to distinguish ourselves and throughout they're competing and many times substantially smaller than us. The smaller a benefits broker, doesn't have any other resources capabilities or the expertise that we have and eventually they have to make choice, either they sell to us and join us because they want our resources, or they watch for clients eventually come our way. And so I think that scale matters in this, expertise matters, and lot of these small benefit brokers are terrific field folks, they've got great relationship with their customers and so as a result of that they look to us to join through mergers because they know that we can be better together. So there's that opportunity for us as a broker that's growing substantially to bring out more smart people that really are good benefit folks and just want our capabilities. So to me I see there's a positive on that side when you look at the M&A aspect of it.","Mark Hughes","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Glasspiegel of Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed with your question.","Bob Glasspiegel","Good afternoon and happy anniversary. You guys don't look 90 years old.","Patrick Gallagher","You've seen it from the inside Bob.","Bob Glasspiegel","That's right, especially in the new location, which is quite impressive.","Patrick Gallagher","Thank you.","Bob Glasspiegel","I also didn't think I was going to hang out rather than long enough to see you throw the word tailwind, whether it's pricing or foreign exchange. It seems like you've been using headwinds a lot more, but now that you think you're going to have some tailwinds in property, couple of questions. What does that mean to you as a company or how you manage day to day deal? Do you do anything differently in a hardening property market and softening property market? This is the second question; did you say that Doug that it cost you - your rates cost you 50 bps in organic in 2017 or did I miss that extremely?","Doug Howell","In '17 we'll probably end up about 50 basis points in organic as a result of rates. Last year it was more like a 4 point in '16, so I think -","Bob Glasspiegel","It's negative you were saying.","Doug Howell","Yes, that's correct, so we'll be covered by half a point this year.","Bob Glasspiegel","Right and so if we said we're in a hard market for property, does that get you to what?","Doug Howell","Maybe another point, not sure.","Bob Glasspiegel","So it gets you 50 bps - so it would be a 100 bps swinging from minus 50 to plus 50, if you got to that sort of environment?","Doug Howell","That's right.","Bob Glasspiegel","And Pat, how would you run the company differently if you knew that for sure. Would you hire more people, would you move people in the property or would you just let if all go to the bottom line?","Patrick Gallagher","Bob, I think the main thing right now that I'm concerned about is making sure that the people who've joined over the 12 years really get out in front of their clients. Again, I don't think it's jolting hard market somewhere to 2001 and 2011, but any kind of price pressure on the upwardly mobile price, we got to be out explaining to clients why it's happening. Now, memories get really short, so everybody that survived a hurricane or a huge flood this month, they're shaking their head I get it. By April, they're going to be saying, what are you talking about, you're bringing a rate increase. So you got to be out talking to those April renewals and those July renewals now and that's a training exercise Bob. And I don't think it's big enough to say that what we do is take this - I'm not looking at this as a windfall, but definitively I'm looking at it as something that really - we have to just take a moment and make sure people can explain why the market is dynamic. And our people are smart people and by the way our buyers are smart people, they'll get it.","Bob Glasspiegel","There's no differed adversity you would now consider in a great scenario that I'm trying to create for you, where things are improving, and your organic be growing 4% of 4.5%, if you get 100 basis point swing, there's nothing that you need to invest in or there's no resources you need to service from your perspective?","Doug Howell","No, just a reminder guys they've got. There were interesting things, we'll make sure when a lot of customers are shown up to rate increases, I think that they may - people have a tendency to shop more when the prices are growing up and I think that lets our folks get in there and demonstrate our capabilities from somebody that's been opening up their mail and getting price decreases for 10 years. Also now, they'll take that appointment, so you'll see that happening, so we got to protect those - to well inform them and for those other brokers out there that are sleep at the wheel, that's our opportunity coming and showing our ways and they are terrific capabilities and our clients will really like to see.","Patrick Gallagher","That's actually a really, really good point. I would hope that we would see some increased opportunities around the fact that our competition in particular this month - and you know this. We now measure, and we know that 90% of the time when we go out to compete on an account, we're competing with a smaller broker. So this is our opportunity to go out and say, hey, we really could help you navigate this market. There's a change in market, we're very good at this, we're one of the largest property placers in the excess and surplus markets, we know what we're doing, we've got the guns, let us help you.","Bob Glasspiegel","Great, thank you.","Doug Howell","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Our next question comes from [indiscernible] of KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks. First question, I know you said multiple times that you're competing against firms that are smaller 90% of the time. I'm just curious, how does that percentage change when you look outside the US?","Patrick Gallagher","It's about the same.","Unidentified Analyst","The other question I had, when you look back KRW and Olfa, it's look their property CAT index in the US had gone up in '06, but then went down in '07 and '08. Would you expect it to be here similarly this time around or is there any reason you think it would perhaps be different?","Patrick Gallagher","Depends on how much capital flows in. If the whole bunch of capital moves to Bermuda and starts taking CAT risk, it will slop in quickly.","Unidentified Analyst","Fine, makes sense. Thank you for the answers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Newsome","Good evening, everyone. One of our peers - one of the insurance companies suggested that sort of a key component of whether a market that gets really hot or not is whether are not the MGAs are essentially are abounded by some of the backers, reinsurance backers. So my question is, do you agree with the promise and if so how do you think that might may or may not unfold? Is there sort of certain time that we should be looking at that happening and getting these thoughts about just doing well?","Patrick Gallagher","So first of all Promise is absolutely right on it. By the way we're the largest MGA in the United States, so that's really an important market for us and those programs are critical to us. But again remember, this market is not - this is not a major across the board. All ships are raising on high tide this is catastrophe exposed property that had a bad ninety day this is going to need to have some balance replenishment. This is not a threat to the industry in terms of the size of the loss its putting a capital repair and we are not seeing stress on our MGAs that outside the cared property market at all. So the answer to your question is yes, in fact what you said occurred we are across all the whole MGA book. Things gone withdrawn and our capacity got withdrawn that would be pretty dramatic. But that's not what is happening.","Paul Newsome","That's great, thank you.","Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Kai Pan","Thank you for the follow up. Just a larger picture question and you know you are traditionally having focused on the into market clients, do you have a small basis insurance clients and how do you serving, how you have you been serving, and do you see that as a close of 20 for you because there is a lot of talk about that in the market place.","Patrick Gallagher","Yes, we see that as a huge opportunity for us in fact we had a project to put for the last 24 months importantly on a globally basis looking at how we service and changes the way we service small business. From doing it the way we had our middle market and upper middle market business in the very specific service centers that will do it better with a higher level of quality and will allow us to drive substantial margins which we will then invest in the marketing around and really try to drive small business into the company. We think there is a tremendous opportunity in small business. And that is both on a benefits and property casualty basis on a global basis. So - these efforts are put in Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand and the U.K.","Kai Pan","Could you size it in term of the potential or opportunities in terms of percentage of overall look?","Patrick Gallagher","I don't think I can off the top of my head Kai.","Kai Pan","All right. Thank you so much for your time.","Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Kai. Karen, looks like that's about it?","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","Patrick Gallagher","Let me make just a quick closing comment. I want to thank you again for being with us this afternoon. In closing I am extremely pleased with our 2017 performance thus far and I believe we will have a very strong finish to the year. And we look forward to speaking with you again in January and thank you all for being with us this evening. Thank you, Karen.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call.

Gallagher & Co.'s Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect your lines at this time.","Some of the comments made during this conference call, including answers given in response to questions, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that will be discussed on this call and which are described in the company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today.","It is now my pleasure to introduce J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr., Chairman, President and CEO of Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thank you, Brenda. And welcome, everyone, to our second quarter call. We appreciate you being with us this morning. Today, I'm joined by Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the division heads that run our businesses around the world.","I'm very pleased with our second quarter and our first 6 months. For our Brokerage segment, on an adjusted basis, revenue in the quarter, up 16%, 17% for 6 months; EBITDAC up 20%, up 23% for 6 months; EPS up 13% in the quarter, up 16% year-to-date. Margins improved in the quarter by 90 basis points, and we did just short of 6% organic growth, a really great quarter for Brokerage.","And for Risk Management as well. On an adjusted basis, revenue was up 10%, 11% year-to-date. EBITDAC is up 14% in the quarter, 13% year-to-date. Earnings-per-share, up 11% and 11% year-to-date. Our margins improved by 50 basis points, and we had 10.4% organic growth in the quarter.","When you look at our Brokerage and Risk Management units together, we produced 7% organic growth for the quarter. All in all, a great quarter and a terrific first half of the year.","Mergers continue to be an important part of our growth story. For the quarter, we completed 5 transactions for about $36 million in annualized total revenue. Through June 30, we've completed 9 transactions for about $41 million of annualized revenue. As I mentioned last quarter, the first half of 2013 is a little slower in the M&A front than we were in 2012. But the pipeline is very robust and we expect to have a number of mergers closed in the second half of 2013.","I want to welcome and thank all of our new partners. We're honored to have you join Gallagher. I know you had choices and I'm proud you chose to join our growing family.","Usually in these calls, I like to hit some high points on the 4 things we work on every single day, which is organic growth, mergers and acquisitions, productivity and margin improvement and culture. I can tell you that in all 4 areas, we're firing on all cylinders. So rather than going into detail there, I think our time is better spent drilling into what we're seeing in the rate environment.","First, I mentioned earlier that our Brokerage segment reported 5.9% organic growth in base commissions and fees in the second quarter. Of that, slightly less than 1% came from rate. The remainder was simply better new business and better retention of existing business. Our professionals continue to help our clients find ways to mitigate the carriers' requests for rate increases by finding creative solutions in the structure of their insurance programs. Less than 1% from rate is consistent with what we've seen for the last 6 quarters.","Second, let me give you some flavor from our July renewals in our domestic PC units compared to last year, renewals on the same accounts, these are July 1 renewals. Property compared to July 2012, 55% of our renewals are showing rate increases. 22% renewed about flat and 22% had slight decreases.","In workers compensation, this is a line that's troubled. No matter how we look at it, carriers are looking for rates to repair the line. Greater than 95% are showing rate increases over the last year on July 1. Casually, other than work comp, compared to July 2012, 60% are showing rate increases; 30% are about flat; and less than 10% are showing any decrease in rate.","And let me give you some flavor as to how we see the momentum of rate through 2013 compared to other renewals in the first half. So take for instance, April 1 renewals versus what we're seeing in July. Obviously, these are not the exact same accounts but similar accounts. Property, compared to the first half, 60%, we are seeing July rates being comparable to earlier in the year. 15% saw further increases and 25% were slightly down. Workers comp, compared to renewals in the first half, 40% of the July renewals saw further increases, 50% were about comparable and only 10% are showing any kind of lower increase. But there's still increases in work comp across-the-board. Any one that was flat with work comp had great loss experience.","In casualty, other than work comp, 20% of the accounts renewed in July had further increases, 60% were comparable and 17% lower. So we are seeing carriers ask for rate increases on most lines of coverage and in most geographies. This is really a great environment for us. And while we're seeing a bit of slowdown in the property area, the rest of the lines continue to have strong momentum.","Moving on to our international Brokerage front. We continue to see strong organic growth especially in our London wholesale business and continued merger opportunities throughout the world. Our wholesale business, Risk Placement Services, continues to see increasing submissions, emanating from rate increase requests and new business startups, and we're getting more orders as the standard markets withdraw from some lines that typically would be in the ENS market.","On the benefit side, the Affordable Care Act continues to keep our consultants very busy. Having the employer mandate move back to 2015 has not really slowed the amount of help our clients need. Businesses are realizing that a host of new regulations are going into effect in 2014, and they need our help. We've invested substantially in tools our clients need to comply with the new law and we know that this business will continue to be a growth business for us throughout all of 2014.","On the risk management side, as I said earlier, a great quarter. Our team in Australia continues their strong performance. We've ramped up our business on the work comp program for South Australia, which is providing very nice organic growth. Also, Gallagher Bassett hired a number of experts and analytics in workers compensation in the quarter, which has bolstered our client service capabilities.","So our growth story continues. Across all geographies in every business unit, we continue to see growth and lots and lots of new business opportunities in the future. Doug?","Douglas K. Howell","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on the first page with the Brokerage segment, which you heard Pat say they had another excellent quarter.","First is the Heath Lambert integration cost of $0.02, which is in line with what we guided last quarter. Please recall that we expect about $0.03 to $0.04 of integration cost in the third quarter, which relates to consolidating much of our combined London operations into new office space. Then the integration will be done.","Second, you'll see a couple pennies of earnout-related adjustments. Recall these adjustments arise when we change our estimates for the ultimate amount of earnouts and those will always be a little bit volatile.","Moving down to Risk Management, a nice clean quarter also with excellent results. So let's flip to the Brokerage segment organic growth tables on the lower half of Page 2. Another very strong quarter, up 5.9%. We saw about 5.7% domestically and about 6.5% internationally. And as Pat said, a little less than 1% from rate, not much from exposure growth. So it was really a nice new business and retention performance in the quarter.","Moving next to the bottom of Page 3. You'll see our Brokerage segment expanded adjusted EBITDAC margins another 90 basis points. This marks our seventh straight quarter of margin expansion. In fact, I look back, we've expanded margins 14 out of the last 18 quarters.","Let me spend a minute more on margin expansion relative to organic growth. Stay on Page 3 but go to the top. It's to the Brokerage compensation table. You'll read in the note that incentive compensation is up 210 basis points in the second quarter. On a year-to-date basis, that equates to incentive comp being up 130 basis points.","Our incentive comp is up through June 30 because our field folks are further along in achieving their objectives and therefore, they are more likely to reach their bonus targets than they were at this time, last year. In fact, last year, many didn't look like they would hit their bogeys until we were well into the fourth quarter. In other words, there's an element of timing here.","So if you levelized for this timing, we would have posted margin expansion for the quarter and year-to-date of well over 200 basis points. Relative to organic growth in the 5-plus percent range, we think that expansion is tremendous work by the team. Let's move to the top of Page 4 to the risk management organic table.","Gallagher Bassett had another terrific quarter, up organically over 10%. Even without our new Australian client, to be up over 7% organically shows nice continued improvement in that business, even in an economy that isn't seeing much employment growth.","Also on Page 4, our Risk Management segment continues to improve its compensation and operating ratios, resulting in EBITDAC margins 30 basis points above our full year target of 16%. Looking towards the third and the fourth quarters, we might ramp up some of our investments in product and service enhancements, which have caused us to give a little of that back, so don't model more than 15.8% of margin in those quarters.","All right, let's turn to Page 5 to the shortcut table for our Corporate segment. Our clean energy investments also had a good quarter. And accordingly, the Corporate segment posted $0.10 of earnings, which was towards the upper end of the range we provided last quarter. But please note that $0.01 or so of that is timing pulled in to the second quarter from the third quarter.","Looking forward, we've again provided a range of estimates for the third and fourth quarter on Page 14 of the investor supplement that we post on our website. When compared to our last supplement, not much change related to the third quarter after you consider the timing I just discussed. But if we look further out to the fourth quarter, we are getting revised production estimates from our utility partners, which are lower than we provided before. We are told these reductions are mostly due to possible routine maintenance outages. Like we've seen before, we are subject to a utilities change in production estimates that can cause a swing in our earnings estimates.","For example, even a few weeks of difference in forecast and production can swing our results by a couple of pennies either way. That said, stepping back, we are really pleased that we're still on track to more than double our clean energy earnings here in 2013. The team is making great progress rolling out and ramping up our remaining plants. This bodes well for even better results in 2014.","All right, those were my comments. It's great to have a strong quarter on all fronts. Back to you, Pat.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks. Brenda, I think we're ready for questions and answers. Hopefully, some answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Mark Hughes with SunTrust.","Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","You talked about the -- your producers are more likely to be hitting their objectives earlier in the year. It sounds like the rate impact is steady. I think you described in your release that the customers were kind of slowly getting better. What accounts for the better productivity in the part of the broker force?","J. Patrick Gallagher","This is Pat. We just had a very solid new business retention and retention first half of the year. The team just did very, very well.","Douglas K. Howell","We're not seeing much in the way of exposure growth. But when we did our polling here for the July 1 renewals, our customers are saying that more of them than not are saying their business has started -- is growing. And very few of them said that there's much contraction in the business, not necessarily in the unemployment front but just in general, they're starting to grow. We don't see it yet in our numbers but exposure units look like they're not decreasing at this point.","Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Right. Was there any new incentive program in place that counterspent?","J. Patrick Gallagher","No.","Douglas K. Howell","No. And by the way, the targets we're talking about, it's not just for the production folks, it's for the field management folks also, which -- so when you said that it was for producers, it's for all of the field, which would include the management layer also.","Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Right. How about claims frequency on the Risk Management side, what's going on in terms of underlying claims in workers\u2019 comp?","J. Patrick Gallagher","They're up about 2% or 3%.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Arash Soleimani with KBW.","Arash Soleimani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to continue on the organic growth, you mentioned most of that is coming from new business. I just wanted to, I guess, dig into that a bit more, is that market share gains or -- what is that exactly stemming from?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Well, Arash, we'll write about 12% to 13% new business depending on the unit against trailing revenues. And we typically then will lose somewhere between 4% and 6%, depending again on the unit. As long as rate is neutral to up slightly, we will show solid organic growth as long as we continue to have that kind of new business growth. And we're a new business machine. I mean, all of us are involved in production every single day, that's what we do. So we're involved in helping clients solve problems, we're involved in bringing new clients on, and as long as I said, that the rate environment stays beneficial to us, we should continue to post solid organic growth.","Arash Soleimani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And you had mentioned that again exposure unit -- exposure unit growth wasn't really causing much in the way of organic growth this quarter. So I guess my question there is once that picks up, let's assume new business wins and everything stays pretty consistent, should we expect the level of organic then to even expand further at that point, or...","J. Patrick Gallagher","There's a number of things that could impact that, Arash. And yes, I think you could. If we start to get some really solid economic growth that then comes through in exposure units both in audits for our clients as well as having to increase their exposure units going forward on renewals. Our team will work very hard to mitigate any increase in cost to our clients, that's what we do. That's why although we are in a rate environment that's up 4% or 5%, you see less than 1% impact in our numbers. And by the way, that less that 1% includes exposure units. So its exposures and rate are producing less than 1% of our organic. But if that starts to move nicely, yes, I think you'd see organic expand as well.","Arash Soleimani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And in terms of the margin expansion, is that something -- I think you mentioned it's 6 or 7 quarters in a row, where they've been expanding. Is that something we should expect also to continue into 2014, or would you say most of the margin gains have already been realized?","Douglas K. Howell","No. Let's go back. I think that this year, if you go back to my commentary in the past, it's generally, we feel that anything below 3% organic growth, it's difficult to expand margin. When you get above 3%, you can start taking some of that to the bottom line. This year, because of the actions that we took at the end of last year, more of that is hitting the bottom line than would be normal going forward. So I think that if you model organic growth greater than 3% out in 2014 and beyond, there would be some margin expansion to that. But clearly, not 250 basis points of that.","Arash Soleimani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then just final question. You had mentioned that 2 half -- or the second half of 2013 should be a bit stronger on the M&A front. Is there any, I guess, guidance you can provide there, or?","J. Patrick Gallagher","No.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to just understand why you think exposures aren't moving up. I mean, it seems like, I mean, obviously the team is killing it. If we get some rate and we get some exposure, I mean, everything is going to continue to accelerate. And I'm sort of wondering, what's holding back exposure in your opinion and what would cause that to go higher?","J. Patrick Gallagher","I think the world is afraid to hire people, Greg. I just think that our customers out there are -- they're very cautious. The 2008, 2009 downturn was incredibly painful. And we had clients in the construction world that were doing $100 million, $200 million of construction a year and that dropped to $25 million and $50 million. Their company survived. But I think that is -- I also think the Affordable Health Care Act is going to keep employers doing every -- you're not going to have 51 employees. That's not going to happen. You'll stop at 48. And so I think there's a ton of that going on as well. I think people are -- the idea that this Affordable Health Care Act is somehow going to save us all money. Well, I'm looking at my budget for next year and I can tell you, we're not going to save any money. It's going to be frightfully expensive. And so I just think there's a lot of it going on. People have long memories, they're not going to add folks.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And has exposure been roughly flat for a while?","J. Patrick Gallagher","I'd say yes. And, Greg, actually, maybe up [indiscernible]. I mean, we've said in the past, we've seen clients maybe up 1%, 1.5%, 2%. But yes, I'd say it's relatively flattish over the last couple of years.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, okay. So I guess, and a lot of people were all asking about organic and organic was great in the quarter, but it doesn't seem like you'll get the tailwinds of price and exposure anytime soon. At least, that's not in your base case, it sounds like. It sounds like you're just going to continue to do very well on the new business front.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Well, let me be clear. If we could have a property\/casualty rate environment that is flat to up 3% or 4% for the rest of my career, I'd sign up for that right now. I mean, that is a -- this is a great environment for Gallagher. We've got tremendous depth of capabilities. Those capabilities we are very good at teaming on accounts and bringing the best resources to the point-of-sale. And we're not competing with just the larger competitors every day, day in and day out, we're competing across an entire spectrum of competitors. And we are going to win more than they are when we compete with them head to head.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, okay. Great. And then one for Doug. If there's one negative -- and again, an excellent quarter, it would just be the slippage on the clean energy side. I guess the reason is the production schedule's out of utilities. I'm just wondering, as CFO, you put out ranges and guidance and whatnot, how do you bracket this? How do you think about it, as you put out numbers and -- to us and whatnot? I'm sort of wondering the range of outcomes and possibilities, as we think about this line and into next year and beyond?","Douglas K. Howell","Well, listen, I can tell you. It's with mixed emotion, if you asked me how I feel about it. I think that I'm ecstatic that -- and extremely happy that we're going to double what we did last year. Am I a little disappointed that the estimates, the guesses of the future that are highly dependent on what's going on in the utility, especially putting in an experimental new technology. Sure, I would love to have the precision of forecasting that we have in other areas in our business. On the other hand, during this rollup and ramp-out -- rollout and ramp-up period of all these plants, because we don't have all of them and running at ultimate levels yet, I don't have some of the shock absorbers that I'll have in the future when we have 29 plants that we own less than 50% of. So any one change in one plant shouldn't alter our estimates significantly. So during this ramp-up period, I can understand why it's a little frustrating for you trying to take a guess on what we're going to make in the future. I think you should look back to say, gee, they're well ahead of where they were last year There's more plants that could come online. And eventually, when we get to a portfolio of 29 of them, the volatility on that should go away or at least be substantially less. So I have mixed emotions about it. I'm ecstatic that we're nearly on track to double. But giving some guidance, I'd love to be able to pick it to within $0.01 every time, but I don't think that's going to be possible.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, okay. Great. And it seems like -- you just track kind of how the guidance has come in. Like for the third quarter, you've been able to, with one quarter forward, have an excellent rate of precision on this and then it gets more fuzzy as you move out. Is that the right read?","Douglas K. Howell","Yes.","Teague Sanders","So we should feel real good about the third quarter, a little worse about the fourth, and then who knows what will happen from there?","Douglas K. Howell","Yes, but I think that's right. I think, but I think when you look out for 2014, I think that the progress we're making should be better than what we're doing here in '13.","Douglas K. Howell","So that's -- on a quarterly basis, I have -- your assessment is right. It's a little bit difficult. But if you just step back and look at it, we'll get the rest of our plants in and we get to the -- get the operational tweaking done, we should have a much better '14 than we do '13 even.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I'm looking at the -- obviously, the acquisition pipeline. It hasn't been as robust this year as last year. And I'm not asking you guys to apply [ph] it on your stock price, but I'd also like to hear about what you think about the pipeline and the percentage of cash you'd like to be allocating versus stock, given where your stock trades today.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Well, I'll let Doug handle the financial side of that question, Josh. I'll take the pipeline. We all knew that last year was an extraordinary year for acquisitions. We did 60-plus of them, that's 1 every 4 working days last year. And so we knew we were clearing the shelf a bit. And I think that was driven by 2 things. The Affordable Health Care Act again, as well as the tax law changes. So we had cleaned the cupboard a bit as we came into this year. But we filled it up again and we've got a very, very solid pipeline. But as you know, acquisitions are -- they're a sale. They come at their own pace. You can't really -- you can't say, I start one in March, I finish it in June. Each one is different. Each one has its own personality. And we've got a great pipeline, we've got a number of people that are out talking to folks every single day. And we think we'll have a very good second half. And Doug, you want to talk about the stock price?","Douglas K. Howell","Yes, in terms of stock price, generally, the stock price isn't an indicator of whether we use stock in an acquisition. It usually is -- in fact, it is always the outcome of how much free cash do we have, how much borrowing capacity, and then we use the rest with stock. Generally, the way you should think about it is that our free cash is first used to pay the dividends, second, in order to buy brokers and risk managers, then we'll -- then we try to run somewhere around 2x EBITDA in debt. So we'd borrow up to that and the rest we'd use in stock in the deals. There are exceptions to that. If a seller wants to do a tax reexchange, there are requirements of how much of stock that you have to give in order for them to protect their tax-free reorg status. So if they want stock, we'll give them stock. And then there are some sellers that really, really have a strong desire just to hold our stock. And of course, we'd be happy to have them be in the same boat with us when we're rowing together. So the answer to your question is that we have $115 million to $125 million of free cash sitting in our balance sheet right now. We -- the first and second quarters are our smallest cash flow quarters. We generate substantially more cash. In fact, I think we generate about 75% to 80% of our cash in the last 2 quarters. So we'll have strong cash flows coming to the second half and we still have some borrowing capacity to keep us at less than 2x EBITDA and the rest we'd use in stock.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So if I'm understanding you correctly, if the acquisition pace were to taper, obviously compared to last year, but in general, you would be an all-cash acquirer. You would not use stock if you didn't have to in order to top things off?","Douglas K. Howell","That's correct. And we really haven't used any stock since about the third quarter of last year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question, Doug, just following up on your comment about Risk Management margins in the back half of the year. You talked about the investments you're making. How should we think about the offset of those investments in terms of margin expansion opportunities in '14?","Douglas K. Howell","Listen, I think that if you go back and if you look at the history for Risk Management, the team has just done a remarkable job with targeting investments that are delivering value to customers. If you go back last year at this time, they launched into the analytic workbench toolbox that our clients are raving about, the prospects are looking at as being best in class. And they did these projects. These are $1 million to $2 million type projects where they go in and they reshape the product and service offering they do for their customers. They have a list of those things that they would like to do and when they start hitting it at the beginning of the year when we sit down and we say, \"Listen, 16 points of margin is where you need to be for the year. Let's see how we do in the first couple of quarters.\" And now they're at the period, at the point of saying, we'd like to launch these continuous -- these other improvement projects. And so if they can do it without margins dropping below 15.8%, they should be able to bring the year in at 16%. So that's the way we sit down and do it. It's a continuous cycle and looking for opportunities to invest in, but also making sure that we hit our target margin expectations.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Remember, Mike, this is Pat. There's not the same leverage in the claims businesses as there is in the Brokerage business. When they get revenue, they get claims. And they better have the people on board, on deck to handle those claims when they start coming in. And there's a lag in time, but it's not a great deal of time. You got to get the bodies onboard, trained and ready to go. And as you saw in some of our previous quarters, we had a substantial ramp-up in South Australia. So 16 points of margin has been a consistent direction that we've given to the street for literally a decade. And that's our target margin.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Are there any trends that you see in the market that you think will lead to more outsourcing in terms of claims management, or maybe as companies look to try and move down policy size spectrum ahead of building the infrastructure themselves?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Yes, I think you're hitting on something that we see as a huge opportunity. Both from new capital, places like Bermuda coming on to shore and needing outsourcing help, as well as from standard mainline carriers that may want to open in different states, that may want to open with different lines. And they are outsourcing that work to Gallagher Bassett. And when you start to take a look at the size of Gallagher Bassett versus some of our -- the insurance companies we trade with, we are actually paying in some instances, thousands and thousands more claims than they are. So we've invested in that -- and that's we've invested in systems, in people and expertise that is probably better outsourced by many insurance companies than it is being handled in-house.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And when would we expect or could we expect to start to see that inflection point in terms of the top line? I mean, is that something that's just a gradual process? Or just given the -- how much alternative capital is permeated and the movement of carriers from one part of the market to the other, do you -- should we start to see some of that really flow through this year? Or are you expecting that to happen kind of more than you thought, maybe 6 months ago?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Well, no. It is happening that's why we're up 10.4% organically. That's included in the mix.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I've got you. And that's a big part of that change then?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Glasspiegel with Janney Capital Markets.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I'm on Josh's wavelength on acquisitions. On the Heath, you said you're -- you've got your -- all the hard work behind you, no more integration costs. Where do you stand in your overall U.K. integration, is there a desire to be bigger in that specific region?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Yes, we're going to be very active in that region. If you -- as you recall, one of the reasons we were excited about the Heath transaction, which did take us a good 18 months to integrate. There was an awful lot of work there. The team did great, great, great work. But part of that reason for doing that was to give us good retail presence in the U.K. that we can now go bolt on other acquisitions. And we did, we did 4 acquisitions last year and bolted those in. Those were mostly affinity acquisitions. But we bolted them into the Heath platform and they are going extremely well for us.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","How big could U.K. be, or Europe as a region? I mean, how much bigger than your current state? And what sort of platform do you need that you don't have as far as product or...","J. Patrick Gallagher","I'd say right now, Bob, where we are probably weak in the U.K. is -- what we would do in the United States is as a standard, commercial middle-market business, that the local contractor, the local auto dealer, the grocery firm, that type of thing. We're very good in the London wholesale specialty business, that's grown extremely nicely for us. We're very, very good in energy and natural resources, that's a global play. We're very good at affinity in the U.K. and MGA and MGU business. But we're probably a little light when it comes to just your standard middle-market fare.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens, Inc.","John Campbell - Stephens Inc., Research Division","It's John Campbell in for Brett Huff. Back on the Brokerage segment, I mean, continued nice margin growth there. It sounds like rate is providing some benefit to some degree, as well as just a general uptick in the exposure units. But Doug, I mean, if you could just maybe give a little more color on the various pieces of that margin expansion? Or just maybe more specifically, just to what degree is cost take out above and beyond the actions taken last year, a piece of that?","Douglas K. Howell","Yes. I think the margin expansion, you'd have, let's say a 5% organic growth, then you would have a point of natural expansion just because of a larger -- more organic growth. When you look at where we're seeing savings opportunities right now, obviously, as we get more productive, we've shifted more work to our offshore centers of excellence. So that's helped us control our headcount here in the U.S. and in the U.K. When it comes to operational savings in the op expense line, we're seeing some savings from rent. That's probably being offset a little more by the travel costs that are going up. Airlines and hotels are going up. We do have some nice projects that we're working on now that will make us more productive in what we call the middle office and the back office layer. But we're really not seeing the results of that yet and we wouldn't see that until 2014 or 2015. But those are efforts that would help us control inflation in our other operating expense line. They're not going to be projects that drop a ton of money to the bottom line but they could help us with the control on inflation. We're not seeing wage pressures right now except for maybe in some of the IT areas where that -- there's more demand for certain resources there, so we are seeing some comp pressure there. But that's not a huge part of our payroll. So that's the flavor of where we're seeing margin expansion coming from.","John Campbell - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. Thanks for that additional color. And then just as a follow-up. I mean, I'm seeing a common theme that we've been seeing in just 2Q earnings just across the market in general, it's just kind of sluggish international results, I mean, particularly out of U.K. So if you guys could just maybe talk a little bit about U.K. results in 2Q and then if those results were relatively sluggish, then to what degree is that [indiscernible]?","Douglas K. Howell","Well, actually we had 6.5% growth in our international operations on the Brokerage side. Our U.K. operations is, in our view, is performing at a level of expectation and -- or higher than expectation, which is a high expectation.","J. Patrick Gallagher","And that includes Australia, as well.","Douglas K. Howell","Yes, and Australia is doing well, too. But the transformative Heath acquisition that we did over there has provided us some energy in the U.K. It has provided new opportunities for us. And our organic growth is 6.5%. So we're not seeing sluggish operations coming out of the U.K. We don't have a lot of exposure to mainland Europe, so we see tremendous results coming from those folks right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber with William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","A couple of different questions. How did RPS do with their growth above or below with what the average was for the Brokerage?","J. Patrick Gallagher","It was above.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, so another good quarter.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Very, very solid quarter.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","What's the rate outlook in surplus lines, property versus casualty for the rest of the year?","J. Patrick Gallagher","If you take a look -- the property market, Adam, is squishy. The cat-exposed stuff in Florida is flat to down. Oklahoma and that region is in a full-on hard market. Regular middle-market commercial property is probably flattish to up a bit.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, okay. That's helpful. On the benefit side -- yes, I know you've been doing more and more business there. Has the mix been shifting more towards consulting, or is it still predominately the traditional placement business?","J. Patrick Gallagher","No. I'd say, Adam, over the last decade, that switched almost 100% to consulting. While we get paid on commission because clients are comfortable with that, we've been completely transparent in that business since ERISA and it's a consulting play.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, okay. And then on the health care exchange, and I know it's a very, very early, early stage, but are you seeing any traction for enrollment for next year, and any way you could quantify, that would be great.","J. Patrick Gallagher","We don't have any traction at this point. And we've seen there's interest but we don't really have any orders to speak of at this point. We got a good partner in Liazon, and we think we've got a good product offering. It is going to be an important part of the product offering. We will not have one exchange. We'll trade with a lot of exchanges across the country whether they're run by the state or whether they're private. And it will be part of the mix. But at this point in time, it hasn't really -- it hasn't grabbed a lot of traction.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Alison Jacobowitz with Bank of America.","Alison Jacobowitz - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I didn't hear -- I don't think I heard it and I don't know if I ever heard it, I'm just curious and I don't know if you can answer it. But do you have a range or something, an outlook of what the clean air facilities could produce if everything was up and running and everything was working perfectly? What kind of earnings that would produce?","Douglas K. Howell","Yes, Alison, I think that if you were to look at Page 5 of the earnings release, over there, we try to provide the ultimate after-tax earnings estimates for the plants that we currently have up and running or on the drawing board. And if you add that up, the number gets somewhere around $100 million of after-tax annual profits. We did $33 million last year, we're on target to $67 million to $71 million this year. So if -- now granted, those plans won't all run at ultimate levels, that's what the footnote says there, but that gives you a size indicator of how much Gallagher could earn off of those plants. There are other plants that we haven't put in place yet, there's another 6 of them. And I couldn't tell you whether those are going to go into big locations or small locations at this point, that's why we put not estimable on there. But that's probably a good guide post. Will we be at that level starting 1\/1\/14? I don't know. We'll see. We have a little bit of low that happens generally in the summers as utilities are producing a substantial amount of electricity, they're not so willing to put in new technologies during the summer. And we saw this last year and then we had a nice uptick of activity in September and October. So hopefully by October, I'll be able to start giving you some more feel for next year. But as of now, I would guess that we're going to be better than the $67 million to $70 million that we did this year.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Any more questions, Brenda?","Operator","It seems there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Pat Gallagher for closing comments.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thank you very much. Thanks, everyone, for being with us this morning. We appreciate it. We're very pleased with the 2 great quarters that we've had this year. The team is very turned on. We're helping our clients. We're selling a lot of new business and we think we're on track for a very strong finish to 2013. So thank you for being with us this morning.

Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Rob, thank you very much, and good morning everyone, welcome to our third quarter call. This morning, I\u2019m joined by Doug Howell, Chief Financial Officer as well as the heads of our operating division.","For those of you that are out east, we hope your families are safe that\u2019s cleared your weather a heck of a monster storm. For the safety of our people we did close many of our offices as well, we\u2019re working very hard to get back to our offices to handle the thousands of claims that we know we filed after the safety of our people servicing our clients is our number one priority. So hope all of you are well today.","As our customer make some remarks about the quarter and Doug will add additional color and we\u2019ll get pretty quickly to questions-and-answers. Again this quarter I\u2019m very pleased with our results, across all of our operating businesses globally we\u2019re producing growth for our shareholders and getting stronger in our capabilities to serve our clients. I believe these capabilities are evident in the numbers that we posted with you last night.","Adjusted brokerage revenue is up 14% in the quarter, 17% year-to-date with organic growth of 4% is another excellent quarter. Adjusted EBITDAC in the brokerage up 20%, 22% year-to-date with margins up by 141 basis points is also excellent, year-to-date we\u2019ve closed 43 acquisitions bringing in over a $170 million of additional revenue to our company. We\u2019ve acquired businesses across all of our operating divisions five internationally and our pipeline continues to be very, very strong.","Our risk management segment had revenue growth on adjusted basis of 5%, EBITDAC was up adjusted 6%, organic growth in our base, domestic and international fees was 5%, when you put the two segments together our brokerage and risk management together, adjusted revenues grew 12% and adjusted EBITDAC grew 18%. I could not be proud of our team, our sales culture is strong. We continued to sell new accounts and to keep those accounts we have. Account retention remains nicely in the mid 90s which we view as continuing to be very strong and everyday everywhere in the world our sales teams are explaining why Gallagher is the right risk management partner to help client\u2019s deal with this risky world.","Let me touch on a number of the individual operations and I\u2019ll start with the brokerage segment. In our property casualty retail area we continue to see rate increases across most of the lines of coverage in across all geographic locations. Any rate environment that is flat or a little better is extremely helpful to our growth.","From 2003 through 2011, we saw consistent and persistent rate decreases. We return from the CIAB that\u2019s the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokerage meeting at the end of last month, I can tell you that after many meetings with the management teams of our largest trading partners it was very apparent, they know where they\u2019re making or losing money, they understand their loss costs are inflating and they are committed to continuing the rate increases.","Let me touch just briefly on the economy, we believe that we are still seeing our clients businesses improving. Now this is a slow no higher recovery that we\u2019re feeling and it does feel fragile that positive audits continue to come through our system and it appears that our clients businesses are improving. Our international brokerage is having a very strong year and a very solid quarter, as I said last quarter, our Heath acquisition has brought many new opportunities to grow our business. Internationally we\u2019ve closed five acquisitions this year, having a solid retail platform in the UK is working and we\u2019re recruiting new sales talent that we couldn\u2019t have attracted before this transaction. Our global growth is a growing and exciting part of our story.","Our wholesale and NGA business had another strong quarter, submissions are up as are the number and the percent of those submissions that are actually becoming orders. Clearly business is moving back into the access and surplus market.","Our benefits business solid year so far we\u2019ve completed 23 acquisitions for over $50 million of revenue this year. We believe this is affirmation that\u2019s small benefits brokers are recognizing, they need our expertise and modeling capabilities to survive. In the quarter we announced the formation of a private exchange and partnership with liaison, we believed private exchanges will be an important alternative under the new law and we wanted our clients to know we are committed to providing solutions for their benefits needs, whether to find benefits or to find contributions, Gallagher has the capabilities to help.","The new Healthcare Reform referred to as Obamacare creates ever more opportunities us to help our customers navigate the changes that are underway. As I mentioned our merger and acquisition activity is strong and we\u2019ve completed 43 acquisitions for a total of a $170 million of revenue, clearly this strategy is very important for our growth and it\u2019s a key component for our team. We\u2019ve literally dozens of additional opportunities in our pipeline.","As I do every quarter, I want to stop a moment and thank those great firms who joined us this quarter, I know you had choices and I\u2019m proud you chose Gallagher, welcome to our growing family.","Let me move to risk management, another strong financial quarter, organic growth on our base, domestic and international fees of 5% continue to be strong. We\u2019ve successfully wand down the work we were doing for the New Zealand earthquake authority and we\u2019ve added another significant account to our Australian business that Doug will mention in his comments. We successfully launched a number of new tools to our risk facts IT system, we call this the analytics workbench which provides a whole host of new analytic tools for clients to better understand and manage their cost to risk.","In the quarter we also invested in and brought a board a new Chief Client Officer to continue our pursuit and providing the industry\u2019s top and best client experience. We continue to work very hard to prove to our clients that Gallagher Bassett claim handling will reduce claim costs. We\u2019ve mentioned many times on these calls that a Gallagher we focus on four strategic areas and so organic growth, mergers and acquisitions, productivity and addition maintaining our unique culture.","I can tell you our culture is strong, our company works in teams throughout the world concentrating and helping our most important stakeholder our clients. We get up everyday committed to serving and keeping clients, getting new business in the door, improving productivity and margins. I\u2019m pleased those efforts helped us produce a solid result in the third quarter.","Over to you, Doug.","Douglas Howell","Thanks, Pat, and good morning everyone. And as Pat said, best of luck to all of those in the east coast that are suffering from the storm.","Okay, overall it\u2019s nice to post another strong quarter, let\u2019s start on the first page of the earnings release in the brokerage segment. You\u2019ll see two sense of Heath Lambert integration cost and a penny of severance which is right inline with our comments from the last conference call. The team is doing a great job of integrating our UK operations and we still believe we are on track to rap up that process in mid 2013. So as a reminder, you\u2019ll continue to see $0.02 to $0.03 a quarter of integration charges until then.","Turning to page two, another really solid organic growth quarter, I\u2019ve note, it\u2019s our seventh straight quarter of organic growth in positive territory which is fantastic after having endured 14 quarters of negative or no organic growth during the great recession. And we\u2019re particularly pleased that we saw a 4% organic in our domestic P&C operations about 4% organic growth in our domestic benefit operations and about 4% growth in international, so clearly across the board nice growth in each of our units.","In terms of supplemental and contingent commissions they came in right inline with what we said last quarter and at that time we explained that deteriorating loss ratios on a couple whole selling programs would not pay as much as they did in 2011. As for the fourth quarter, we\u2019re seeing supplemental and contingent commissions about flat the prior year.","Turning to page three, our brokerage segment continued to show improvement in our comp ratio and our operating expense ratio, resulting in a 141 basis point improvement in our adjusted EBITDAC margin, this marks the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion, clearly that\u2019s excellent work by the team.","Moving to the risk management segment on page four, you\u2019ll see solid organic growth continued success and earning performance bonus revenues and that we\u2019ve longed down most of our work on settling the New Zealand earthquake claims. As for margin, we are heading our targeted margin of about 16% and still making important investments into the business.","Two special items to note for the fourth quarter in our risk management segment, first a reminder that in 2007 we earned well over a penny from the New Zealand earthquake claim settling process and that won\u2019t repeat this year. And second, we picked up a very large account in Australia effective January 1st 2013. Ramp up cost in the fourth quarter will costs us really $0.02 of share but from 2013 we expect to generate about $20 million of revenues from that client. So while just to ramp up cost this year it\u2019s a really, really great win for our team down under coming into 2013.","Next, let\u2019s turn to page five to the corporate segment. I\u2019ll give you some help on building your fourth quarter models then I\u2019ll give you some early thinking around 2013. Running down the table on page five, here is how we\u2019re seeing the fourth quarter 2012, all of these amounts of are net of tax. Assume about $7 million of interest and banking costs in the fourth quarter. About $2 million of acquisition costs, about $3 million to $4 million of corporate cost and then assume about $5 to $9 million of clean energy investment earnings in the fourth quarter.","When you get done, the corporate segment should show a loss in the fourth quarter of about $0.04 to $0.07, I know that\u2019s somewhat of a wide range but we simply do not have clear insight of fourth quarter clean energy production levels and we also be spending more to ramp up 2013 production. So when we look out towards 2013 we suggest that you model the quarterly interest in banking acquisition and corporate cost lines about the same as the fourth quarter of 2012 and now will get you close.","Then please take a few minutes to read the paragraphs on page five about our clean energy investments and you\u2019ll see that we\u2019re gaining significant momentum getting idle plants producing. If you add up the numbers on page five for the ultimate production levels, then cushion it a bit for timing, maintenance and operational tweaking, you\u2019ll see that our 2013 earnings from clean energy investments can total $70 million to $90 million in 2013.","If we make that much from the investments, it will more than cover the interest M&A and corporate costs and in fact of corporate segment could post $0.15 to $0.30 per share of earnings for the full year of 2013.","On a quarterly basis, assume that the corporate segment might break, might get to break even for the first quarter and then spread the $0.15 to $0.30 across the last three quarters. Clearly that\u2019s an early and rough estimate in a wide range but it should give you a start.","As for capital management, we have a robust M&A pipeline but we believe our cash position will allow us to do mostly cash deals that are here in the fourth quarter.","So those are my comments and just as a rap up comment, it\u2019s been an excellent nine month on all front and our team is working very hard to close out 2012 strong and get after 2013.","So those are my comments, back to you Pat.","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Thank you. Rob, we\u2019re ready to open the lines for questions-and-answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line Greg Locraft of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi, good morning guys.","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Good morning. Greg, how are you?","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Good, good. It\u2019s been a busy few days here and actually you\u2019re the first call for the industry, so I know it\u2019s likely much early to judge, but any thoughts on Sandy and the implications for the industry from your vantage point?","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Well Greg, you hit on it. It\u2019s awfully early but historically when we look back at major storms going all the way back to \u201892 with Andrew obviously Katrina, I\u2019ll be giving a presentation down in Florida in a couple of weeks and I did go to the insurance information institute and get some information on the top 10 storms and Katrina was by far the largest. And then, second to that was a storm that was probably came in been around 15 billion to 20 billion. So you got the northeast, we\u2019ve talked for years about the fact that a storm that took that track could in fact be the biggest storm ever because the value concentration that there in the northeast.","Storm surge I know was unbelievably huge, but the winds weren\u2019t as rough as it could have been. So I have no dollar amount and the industry, there is people rattling around through all numbers all left and right and I just think it\u2019s way too early to tell. I will tell you from my experience though, the first numbers that you hear as the week unfolds that is next week unfolds, multiply it by two or three.","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, great. And then back to kind of pricing, sounds like at the top of the organizations the rhetoric is matching what needs to happening and the industry is more unified than previous cycles. Can you \u2013 how does things look from your vantage point into next year on the pricing front? There is \u2013 some of the data is showing kind of a flattening of pricing power at actually pretty nice levels and we\u2019re lapping last year\u2019s increases, but what do you see in the marketplace through next year?","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","I actually mentioned this to the CEOs of the people we met with at the CIAB. This is my fourth cycle and it\u2019s the first time in my career that what the CEOs of the insurance companies were saying is actually what the people on the street were seeing. Typically there is a disconnect there and it\u2019s interesting. I think that the managements of the insurance companies today are supplied with much better information, their IT systems are solid. They know where they\u2019re making money, where they\u2019re losing money and why. They\u2019re absolutely clear in their knowledge of what lost costs are doing. And lost costs are up in every instance.","They recognize very clearly that there is no return on their investments that\u2019s going on safe and then they have to have \u2013 they have to get their loss ratios in line. It\u2019s an industry that hasn\u2019t covered its cost of capital, but for a couple of years out of the last 30, they\u2019re clear on that and they recognize in order to get any kind of ROE. They\u2019ve got to be driving results in the mid to low 90s on combined loss ratio. So I think it\u2019s a very positive circumstance.","About a year ago, we would sit around and question whether these rate increases could stick given the surplus in the market. These are not balance sheet problems and they\u2019ll all say that. We don\u2019t have a problem right risk. We\u2019ve got the balance sheet. It\u2019s just we\u2019re not going to put our capital out and not get a return. And so that resolve I think quite honestly, Greg, has actually got stronger as they\u2019ve had more success getting the rates they need.","Now if you take a look at the worker\u2019s compensation line, it\u2019s a disaster. And they know that, they\u2019ve been very clear on where they\u2019re making and not making money. So I think you\u2019re going to see continued pressure to continue to get 4%, 5%, 6% increases and it looks like that could continue for quite a while.","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys.","Douglas Howell","Thanks Greg.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brett Huff of Stevens Incorporated. Please proceed with your question.","Brett Huff \u2013 Stevens Incorporated","Good morning guys.","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Good morning Brett.","Douglas Howell","Hi, Brett.","Brett Huff \u2013 Stevens Incorporated","Can you talk a little bit about \u2013 your organic growth has been better than your peers kind of for the last several quarters at least and continues to be so. Based on what you\u2019re seeing, is that you guys taking share or are you just able to take more advantage of the rate and the exposure that might increase your scene. You just give us your thoughts on that.","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Yeah, I mean, I\u2019m not going to comment on any of our competition, I\u2019m just really pleased with our team. Our new business is solid, retention is very, very good and we\u2019re out everyday chasing new accounts from the top of the organization down to the person in the mailroom. I mean that\u2019s what we do. And I think it\u2019s paying off. I also think that in our niche marketing approach where we concentrate our efforts on places where we really understand people\u2019s business that creates better retention and actually better new business than anybody who is out there is just a generalist.","And I think culturally we have an advantage, I mean one of the things that we do at this company very, very well is get the best talent we have in the marketplace at point of sale anywhere globally and the team comes together and does very, very well. It\u2019s not unusual to have someone from London, someone from Houston, someone from Calgary and someone from Oklahoma City all work it on an energy account together and it\u2019s very fluent. So I do believe that maybe we\u2019re seeing the benefit of utilizing salesforce.com and their chatter product. It is in fact helping us bring our intellectual capital across the world together every day, you see request for help and the system all the time and frankly I just think we\u2019ve got a culture of getting out and getting new business.","Brett Huff \u2013 Stevens Incorporated","Okay. And then can you comment again on the, in terms of the organic growth looking forward, can you give us a sense of where you think it\u2019ll go for 4Q and maybe end of \u201813 especially given your commentary on rates?","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","We don\u2019t give a lot of guidance, Doug, do you want to comment?","Douglas Howell","I think that we mentioned though this is our seventh consecutive quarter of organic growth. The fourth quarter of last year was a particularly strong quarter and if you recall, we had an outstanding benefits quarter that quarter. And I think if the careers continue to push for rate if the economy doesn\u2019t sputter and there is nights flat or up in exposure units, I think that you\u2019re going to see a low to mid single digits type organic growth for the next few quarters.","It might have some year-over-year compare issues in the fourth quarter because of our fourth quarter last year was so strong. But I don\u2019t see this is a plus 10% type in organic growth environment. We would be very happy to constantly be stamping out 3%, 4%, 5% organic growth in this environment based on everything we\u2019re hearing.","Brett Huff \u2013 Stevens Incorporated","Great. That\u2019s what I needed. Thank you.","Douglas Howell","Thanks.","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Thanks Brett.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Meyer Shields with Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed with your question.","Meyer Shields \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Thanks. Good morning. A couple of background question.","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Good morning Meyer.","Meyer Shields \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Good morning, I\u2019m sorry. I want to look over your shoulders in Gallagher Bassett for a second. Are you seeing any inflexion in medical cost inflation for workers\u2019 comp claims or other claims?","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","We\u2019re seeing continued and constant inflation in medical cost and insight comp, yes. That\u2019s an industry-wide problem.","Meyer Shields \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Right. That\u2019s not getting worse recently.","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","No, I wouldn\u2019t say \u2013 it\u2019s continuing to inflate on a pretty consistent basis.","Meyer Shields \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Obviously the amount of M&A has picked up pretty impressively. Is there any drag on margins initially when that happens?","Douglas Howell","Meyer, this is Doug. We see most of our merger partners having margins very consistent with what our larger, what the overall book of business is showing. We did have an exception on that with Heath Lambert if you call that was margin lager compare that our other operations and we\u2019ve been working hard to improve that but by and large most of the deals that we\u2019re doing have margins very similar to ours and that\u2019s one of our strategies. We try not to buy turnarounds, we try not to buy retirements, we try not to buy one-trick pony type agencies, we want to buy strong agencies and brokers that have a desire to join our niches to bring expertise to us and then \u2013 and use that to help continue to sell their clients and sell larger clients too, so very similar to our margins.","Meyer Shields \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. And there is no timing issue where expenses come up before the revenue is for a recent acquisition.","Douglas Howell","Not really, the integration cost on these deals is \u2013 it takes a lot of effort from internal resources, but by and large our integration costs don\u2019t drag us down for more than two or three months on these deals and they\u2019re pretty modest.","Meyer Shields \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. And I apologize in advance because this is need to keep it, but obviously brokerage organic growth did slow a little bit in the quarter. I was wondering whether there is anything aware of that just the niche with business.","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","I think that when it comes to organic growth I think that you\u2019re going to see some bouncing around of organic growth. You saw it in all the other brokers that came out in the market are came out before us. I think that this is the sales process and this is a retention and I think our business is not a linear business where you\u2019re going to see organic growth that\u2019s consistently going up 1% every quarter or something like that. I think that we\u2019re very pleased with 4% in this environment right now and the hard work that\u2019s going on that we\u2019d be very happy with 4%. And if it bounces with 5% to one quarter and down to 3% for one quarter, I don\u2019t think you can read anything into that.","And if you think about our business that\u2019s $400 million worth of business this quarter \u2013 of volume this quarter, one point of organic growth is $4 million. When you spread that across 300 locations around the country I guess that\u2019d be less 100 \u2013 like 200 locations on a brokerage side. We\u2019re not talking about something that\u2019s a systemic risk or a systemic change in the business.","Douglas Howell","Also remember Meyer our job is to mitigate increases. One of the things we do for our clients is when the increases come in make sure that we\u2019ve got the best product in the market at the best price. So we\u2019re working against those increases in many instances.","Meyer Shields \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Fraser \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi, thanks. It\u2019s Eric Fraser for Mike. Good morning.","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Good morning Eric.","Eric Fraser \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Quick question about the deals completed in the quarter. It looks like the share count as well as the amortization expense picked up pretty meaningfully this quarter. Can you talk about the relationship there with the deals or is it something else?","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Well it\u2019s exactly what it is.","Douglas Howell","Yeah, we did have a lot of activity. Share count, we use shares this \u2013 the share count increased this quarter arises really from three different pieces, shares that we used in acquisitions, shares that we used in our earn outs and then just the natural dilution that\u2019s happening because the stock price last year was $27 a share and this it was $35, $36, so we had dilution just because of the increase of the share price.","In terms of using shares in acquisitions, we don\u2019t expect to use a lot of them in the fourth quarter. You\u2019ll see us use some shares in the first quarter next year because that\u2019s our seasonally by far our smallest quarter. In terms of the amortization, we \u2013 when you do these small deals like that a significant portion of the purchase price is allocated towards amortization rather than goodwill, I think we value everyone on an individual basis. So we do produce significantly more amortization from small deals than we would do if we did a very large deal on a big portion of that goes to goodwill. But again, its non-cash and we think a better metric to look at us on an EBITAC basis.","Eric Fraser \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Sure. Is the pace of amortization expense this quarter, a run rate or is it a comeback down given that it related to purchase price?","Douglas Howell","I think the best thing to do is to probably look at, I\u2019ll pull it out here and I\u2019m talking to you, if you use our quarterly supplement and you go to page four of the supplements post on the website, we give it you the brokerage segment on an adjusted basis so that\u2019ll take out any, if we have some small valuation write-offs or something, but it looks to me like amortization is, if you go back to the first quarter of 2001 it was $16 million a quarter, fourth quarter of 2011 pardon me, fourth quarter was $19 million and then now we get $20 million, $22 million, $24 million because of the acquisition activity it\u2019s going to priced up $2 million a quarter if we continue at the same level of acquisitions.","Eric Fraser \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great. One more on M&A, now that the pace of the international M&A has picked up, if you had to choose between doing a deal overseas versus in the U.S., how do you think about that that cash allocation?","Douglas Howell","Well I think that we look at it on, when we look at international deal, one of the big things that we try to look at is, what kind of trade can they do with our existing operations in London, just like we do here in the U.S. If we have an acquisition target that we think that\u2019s nicely in one of our niches, that\u2019s a much more attractive acquisition and then something that\u2019s just going to stand on its own and not trade with other parts of Gallagher.","I don\u2019t think that that at this point, we look at every deal and we think the returns both international and domestic were about the same. So at this point, we\u2019re not waiving one versus another.","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Now I think it\u2019s important now that we\u2019ve done 43 transactions this year and people look at that and say, oh my god your activity is way up and how could you manage that. What have you? The company now has literally dozens and dozens of operations throughout the world who either joined us through the merger and acquisition process or are run by people who have done transactions. And so we have a pipeline that we manage every single month that is a global pipeline that these 43 transactions are, they\u2019re long-term efforts to bring people aboard in our company. So we really don\u2019t get to a point where we say we\u2019re going to emphasize this division this month and this division next quarter whether it\u2019s international or domestic. We\u2019ve got people who are talking to and coding around the world all the time and when they\u2019re ready to join us, we\u2019re ready to make the deal happen.","Eric Fraser \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, great. And then just lastly, can you just talk a little bit more about what you\u2019re seeing on the exposure side, is there any dispersion by account size. And if you are seeing declines, what\u2019s driving that?","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Well let me address that and it\u2019s all anecdotal all right, so I don\u2019t have \u2013 I\u2019m not an economist and I don\u2019t have any facts, but I do think that when I get a chance to talk to clients what I\u2019m hearing is that their businesses are improving a bit. Now some of that is in areas like construction interestingly enough where there is a little bit more construction activity going on and our construction offices are doing better this year.","Now better from a few years ago, being flat on their back, our temporary health businesses are doing extremely well. As some of our banking businesses are now coming back and doing better. It seems to be those that have survived the great recession actually have stronger businesses. I will tell you, as I said in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re not seeing hire folks, there seems to be a real reluctance people are \u2013 I think one of the reasons our top health businesses are doing so well is that people are really actually reluctant to convert temporaries to full-time. So this is not \u2013 I\u2019m not saying that we\u2019re seeing 5% and 6% economic growth but I do think when you read The New York Times, Chicago Tribune this weekend and that\u2019s 1.5% to 2% growth, I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing.","Eric Fraser \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, great. Thanks.","Douglas Howell","Thanks Eric.","Operator","Our next question comes is from the line of Ray Iardella with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.","Ray Iardella \u2013 Macquarie","Thanks and good morning.","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Hi Ray.","Ray Iardella \u2013 Macquarie","Hey how are you guys. One quick question in terms of contingent commissions, how should we think about that I think for 2013, I guess a given, I guess your view on (inaudible) and then Sandy I guess impacting the industry.","Douglas Howell","I think that it\u2019s probably a little early for us to digest what\u2019s going to happen with Sandy. I\u2019ll tell you that right now, but I think in terms of overall supplementals and contingents\u2019 of the careers are still getting the rate that they\u2019re \u2013 that they need to do in order to get their distribution system and I think that supplementals and contingents are going to hang in there next year. It will be interesting to see there is starting to be a little bit more push to move from supplementals into contingents and remember if that\u2019s the case, we wouldn\u2019t be accruing supplementals next year it would push into a contingent in January, February of 2014.","So by the time we do our January call I should be able to give you a better feel for that because I think our teams have been talking to the careers and have a better understanding, but I don\u2019t see a dramatic shift in contingents or supplementals one way or another next year.","Ray Iardella \u2013 Macquarie","Okay, now that\u2019s helpful. And then lastly just quickly sort of debt, just curious, how much capacity do you guys believe you have in terms of debt, I mean debt to total capital right now is around I think 31% if I\u2019m calculated that correctly and how do you look at that debt to EBITA, debt to capital or sort of all the above?","Douglas Howell","I think that we have $200 million to $300 million capacity that would be kind of below the industry standard of 18, 19. I think that we have about $125 million to $130 million of cash on our balance sheet right now. In terms of thinking about long-term, we did go to 2.75 times EBITAC and still be NAIC 2 rated and since we use the private placement market for most of our \u2013 for all of our borrowing, there is substantial capacity on that. That would be $500 million to $700 million of debt capacity there.","Right now I think we\u2019re looking at what we want to do with debt and we\u2019ll look at in I think the rates are pretty favorable right now. I think our M&A pipeline is strong and so it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll take a look at between now and January.","Ray Iardella \u2013 Macquarie","Okay, thanks again for all the answers.","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Scott Heleniak with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Heleniak \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Hi, good morning.","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Good morning.","Scott Heleniak \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","First question I wanted to touch on was just the private exchange that you mentioned there, is that \u2013 so is that fully in line. Can you talk about kind of the opportunity there long-term particularly versus some of your competitors?","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Yeah, we\u2019re very, very excited about this opportunity. It\u2019s clear that some of our clients are going to move to more of a defined contribution approach to their health insurance. And that, individual employees are going to have to shop online for the coverage that they want, the employer will stay very active in that making sure they vet the types of choices that the clients have. And employers really look at this as overall part of their reward package or reward package for hiring people. So we think what it does is put us in line to be able to work with those clients and say look I really, I want to be sure that my people have good choices but I want them to make those choices. And we think it\u2019ll be an important part of the market.","Scott Heleniak \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. So is that actually online right now?","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Yeah, up and ready to go.","Scott Heleniak \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then I just, sort of quick question about the clean coal guidance that you gave, Doug, next year for the 2013 to 2015 to $0.30. Is that going to be mostly driven by higher revenues or cost coming down or is it a combination of both? How do we get to that $0.15 to $0.30 given the first quarter is going to be counter breakeven?","Douglas Howell","Well just to make sure I\u2019m clear, it\u2019s $0.15 to $0.30 for the total corporate segment in the clean energy line we think we can make $70 million and $90 million based on the plants that we currently have in process of resuming production. So when you read on page five, there are still six plants that haven\u2019t been contemplated in that guidance that we have not, while we think that we have year marked to few locations and we\u2019re holding them for some utilities and they\u2019re looking at them, almost all the growth \u2013 in fact all the growth that I\u2019m telling you about is coming from just getting idle plants back into production. As we find utility partners that want to have a long-term contract with us.","So there will be, there is six plants that we\u2019re not contemplated in that those numbers that hopefully in January we\u2019ll tell you that we\u2019ve got some more utilities interest with them, but almost all the growth that we\u2019re talking about is just get \u2013 in fact all the growth just getting the plants that are currently ideal back into long-term production.","Scott Heleniak \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then the other question I have was the, I don\u2019t know if you typically do this but is there any way you could give some sense of what the organic producer count is right now versus the end of the year and how that\u2019s changed over the year, well that\u2019s been up couple of percent or flash or what are you seeing that?","Douglas Howell","Well I think that we don\u2019t actually give information with respect to producer at headcount but I can tell you that we do have a growing producer headcount population. One of the key strategies of doing these small tuck in acquisition is entirely that, there is a work trying to get producer count. So if you count the acquisition adds for producers were up substantially, organically, we still are having success attracting producers to come to Gallagher, we have an extremely stable management team that\u2019s in the brokerage space right \u2013 brokerage segment right now, and we\u2019re finding that producers that know how to sell and if they want to work with our niches they find a nice home at Gallagher. So we\u2019ve been successful in recruiting some producers to us also.","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Scott, just a week ago we had what we call our edge training group in, and edge training is all of our what we refer to is externs, people that have joined us through the internship program and it goes across all of our divisions. I spoke to them and I had lunch with them twice last week and I\u2019d say we had a 150 young people that are just now coming into our industry that have been recruited from places all around, whether it\u2019s from the insurance industry or from pharmaceuticals or whatever, we\u2019re bringing them in, teaching them insurance, putting them back out into the field and light them up, and that\u2019s a big part of what we do.","As you might recall, we talked in the summer about having a 150 interns, these are usually sophomores and juniors in college that we hope to turn into externs and edge participants, and it\u2019s working. So every year we\u2019re driving new young people into our industry, we\u2019ve got people out this week at a number of campuses recruiting and that\u2019s again recruiting for sophomores so that\u2019s kind of a little unusual, but it\u2019s something we do culturally very, very well. And I think over time you\u2019ll see that even be a bigger effort.","Scott Heleniak \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","All right, sounds like positive. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mark Hughes, SunTrust Robinson. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Yeah thank you, good morning.","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Good morning, Mark.","Douglas Howell","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Corporate compensation expense for next year, anything we should expect, any change in philosophy, is there some upward pressure on compensation, how you\u2019re looking that going into the next year and Doug, any updates on \u2013 I know you\u2019ve talked in the past about potential for stream lining, where are you thinking about that for 2013?","Douglas Howell","Well I think that in terms of headcount I think that the teams understand the controlling headcount is important in this environment using our offshore centers of excellent in order to provide a lower cost labor thing as in our D&A now, we\u2019re doing a great job with looking at work that can be pushing to lower labor locations. I think there is modest wage inflation pressure out there but not \u2013 it\u2019s not ramped at this point. So I think that we can\u2019t control the inflation on it.","And in terms of productivity gains, we have productivity opportunities within our workforce, we think technology can be a way to improve our productivity. And then on the operating expense side we continue to see, continuing to harvest winds out of the real estate, out of a real estate footprint but there is also a little inflation you\u2019re seeing travel inflation, you\u2019re seeing airlines and hotels being a little bit up.","So next year as we look out, headcount control would be very important and then it\u2019s continuing to use our offshore centers of excellence.","Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","So if we get to say that 3% to 5% organic growth the compensation line as a percentage of revenue is a good opportunity for that to come down?","Douglas Howell","Little bit but not a lot, I think that I\u2019ve said all along. If we\u2019re at 3% organic growth don\u2019t expect much margin expansion. We\u2019ve expanded margins like I said earlier five straight quarters now and 140 basis point improvement and this quarter is really great work by the team. I wouldn\u2019t expect substantial margin expansion in a 2% to 3% organic growth rate and even at 4% we\u2019d be happy to hold margins in there the way they are.","Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","One final question, the workers comp claims trend in the quarter within risk management, did you touch on that?","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","I did not. What\u2019s the question?","Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","What was the number? Was it up, down, sideways?","Douglas Howell","Well, what we saw from existing operations was about 2.5% growth in terms of claim counts and year-to-date we\u2019re kind of around 4% but that include new business also.","Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Right. So on an organic basis is that 2.5% is that a good same store?","Douglas Howell","Yeah that\u2019s all organic.","Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Yeah okay. All right great, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yeah. Good morning everyone.","Douglas Howell","Good morning, Josh.","Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Good morning. I want to talk about deal pipeline in the fourth quarter as it relates to the election or maybe that\u2019s just a waste of time conversation.","Douglas Howell","Well, deal pipeline \u2013 we think our deal pipeline is very good I mean there is, I mean we say it all the time it\u2019s strong but it is really strong. We are more than happy to move quickly for those people that we\u2019ve known for long time but we\u2019re not interested in just pushing to get a deal done. We\u2019re not in an hurry to do a bad deal by year end just because the sellers might be worried about capital gains rates changing, we have a tremendous pipeline right now, the benefit space is extremely hot right not, they looked us as benefit brokers as Pat said are looking to jump on our expertise.","So I don\u2019t think the election is going to have a big change from where we sit right now one way or another.","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","And then also I\u2019d say, if we\u2019ve got someone that\u2019s waking up to the change of capital gains rules now, well that\u2019s probably not someone we want to do a transaction with. As I said, these transactions take a long time, we spend a lot of time with these people, we expect them to come here and spend a lot of time kicking the tires, they do a considerable amount of due diligence as we do on their business.","And so we\u2019ll have a number of transactions in the fourth quarter but these will not be things that we\u2019re spat up and rush through the door.","Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Well, or to the extents that they feel there is slow down that someone you know in trust said, look, we\u2019re going to sell our business to you, we\u2019re not sure when but if depending on the election that might push us over the edge.","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","No, we\u2019ve had virtually no conversation like that, that has never come up.","Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay.","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","We\u2019ve had a ton of conversations, the earlier part of your phrase there we have this all the time, look, we think that you\u2019d probably be the right people to sell to but we\u2019re just not ready that just stays in the pipeline and we keep talking to them.","Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","All right, I appreciate the call, thank you.","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from the line of Chris Lakim of William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Lakim \u2013 William Blair","Hi, good morning.","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Good morning.","Douglas Howell","Good morning.","Chris Lakim \u2013 William Blair","Just wanted to follow-up real quick on the deal on the exchange side, would you guys mind of just walking through the mechanics the partnership and sort of how that process works?","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Sure, I\u2019ll throw that to Jim Durkin.","James Durkin","I don\u2019t know how familiar you are with liaison but they are clearly a leader in this space. We did a lot of due diligence, looked at a number of different partners and shows them because of their experience because the fact that they are up and running have been doing this for a while. What they bring to the table is a deep, deep knowledge and a platform that really helps us in the middle market, which is where a big part of our concentration in terms of our focus is.","It\u2019s a partnership, it\u2019s not exclusive partnership, we will most likely partner with other private insurance exchanges. And the reason for that is that I don\u2019t believe one exchange will be able to meet the needs of all of our customers across the country. I don\u2019t know if that adds any insight into it.","Chris Lakim \u2013 William Blair","Yeah, no that\u2019s helpful. Yeah I just wanted to get some character around the partnership. And then on the Heath side, I just wanted to know if you guys could talk to sort of the demand environment that Heath seeing in the UK and sort of what kind of expectations you have for the business in 2013?","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Well the European economy is not what we\u2019d like it to be, England is probably better than the continent but the nice thing about our business and the wonderful thing about insurance is you got to buy it whether you want to or not. So from a demand side we\u2019re seeing consistent renewals and we are seeing organic growth in the Heath book. It\u2019s been a lot of work, we\u2019ve spent a lot of time on this integration and team has done an excellent job but when you add their natural growth because they do have a good sales culture in many of the operations outside of the city of London and in London for that matter.","If you add that sales cultured and we\u2019re bringing an awful lot of spec to that as well and our acquisitions and our organic recruiting we\u2019ve got very big plans continuing to grow that business.","Chris Lakim \u2013 William Blair","Okay great, I appreciate it. Thank you.","Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","All right. I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got time for, so I\u2019ve got just a quick rap up comment. It\u2019s good to have three solid quarters behind us in 2012. Doug mentioned this, if rates continue to firm or hold firming and the economy holds up we will perform well in 2012 and we should have done good momentum going into 2013.","Our team is excited, in return to that and we\u2019re winning and we like that. So thanks for being with us this morning and all of you out east, best to you and hope things get better quickly. Thank you, Rob.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time."],"2973":["Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.

Participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. Your lines will be open for questions following the presentation. Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Some of the comments made during the conference including answers given in response to questions may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties discussed on this call are described in the Company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements.","In addition, for reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures discussed on this call, as well as other information regarding these measures, please refer to the most recent earnings release and other materials in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website.","It is now my pleasure to introduce J. Patrick Gallagher, Chairman, President, and CEO of Arthur J Gallagher & Company. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.","Patrick Gallagher","Thank you, Darren. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. With me this afternoon is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating division.","As I do each quarter, today I'm going to touch on the four key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value. Number one, organic growth; number two, growing through mergers and acquisitions; number three, improving our productivity, quality, and margins; and fourth, maintaining our very unique Gallagher culture. The team once again executed an all four of these this quarter and well what a great quarter and a fantastic year.","Last year, around this same time I said that 2017 brokerage organic felt like it would be similar to 2016 and it turned out to be better at 4.4%. I also said that I expected our 2017 risk management segment organic would improve over 2016 and it came in better at 5.2%. Putting the two together, for the year, the combined brokerage and risk management segments posted 4.5% organic, truly a fantastic year that reflects our incredibly strong sales and service culture.","Now back to the fourth quarter results, starting with some comments about our brokerage segment. First organic growth. Fourth quarter organic growth was 6.8% all-in representing strong growth across all of our business units both domestically and internationally.","In the U.S., our PC brokerage business generated 5.7% organic growth in the fourth quarter, with retail up 5.6% and wholesale up 6.3%. In terms of the PC pricing environment in the U.S., we're seeing commercial auto up about 3%, property up about 1.5%, other cash reliance up about 1.6%, specialty lines up towards a point, professional lines are flat, workers compensation down towards two points, and frankly, when I look at that, that's a flat market. So very little impact on our domestic PC brokerage organic in the quarter, which is a slight improvement from what we had been experiencing earlier in 2017.","When it comes to exposures; we are seeing some better signs of exposure growth in the recent couple of quarters. International property\/casualty brokerage organic growth was 7% in the quarter. Australia and New Zealand were up around 9%, the UK was up 5%, and Canada was up 6%. In terms of PC pricing outside the U.S., Australia and New Zealand are experiencing the strong price increases in the mid-single-digit range. Our UK retail and Canadian operations are seeing a more stable rate environment while London specialty operations are now seeing a bottoming as underwriters are asking for rate. Time will tell if that sticks.","Our Employee Benefits business generated organic growth of 7% in the fourth quarter and surpassed $1 billion of revenue for the year, a testament to the outstanding work of our more than 4,000 benefits teammates. I'm proud of how this business has delivered so much valued advice to our clients over the years, trying to navigate the ups and downs of the ACA as they tackle the task of managing their total employment costs in a competitive employment environment.","Next, let me move to merger and acquisition growth. During the fourth quarter we completed nine brokerage acquisitions at their multiples. The average size of the nine tuck-ins we completed in the quarter was $3 million of annual revenue. Our mergered acquisition pipeline remains robust with over $300 million of revenues associated with more than 40 term sheets either agreed upon, issued, or being prepared. The pipeline is full of excellent golden opportunities mostly in the United States but also some good opportunities around the world.","Not all these acquisition transactions will close, but I feel good about our ability to attract acquisition partners in our typical small tuck-in size at fair prices. Our merger partners see our vast capabilities, believe in our unique culture, and realize that we could be more successful together. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals.","So how did we do for the year in our brokerage segment? 9% total adjusted revenue growth of which 4.4% is organic, adjusted EBITDAC growth of 11%, adjusted EBITDAC margin 27.4%, up 52 basis points over 2016. That's an excellent year for our brokerage business. Looking forward, I think 2018 brokerage organic will be similar to 2017 perhaps even a little better if PC pricing and exposures continue to improve.","Next I'd like to move to our risk management segment which is primarily Gallagher Bassett. Fourth quarter organic growth was 3.3%. The call we posted over 10% organic in the third quarter and accordingly we forecasted 2% to 3% organic in our December IR Day. So a bit lumpy by quarter, but a 5.2% for the year a terrific uptick over 2016. Stronger organic in the quarter was the primary driver of our adjusted EBITDAC margin of 17.4%, a great result.","In terms of productivity and quality at Gallagher Bassett we have an outstanding differentiated value proposition that continues to be recognized as best-in-class. For example, in the 2017 advice and claims satisfaction survey, Gallagher Bassett was the highest regarded in casualty claims handling. Not only where we rated significantly higher than all the TPAs, we also ranked ahead of all carriers recognized in the survey.","Our technology was also recently recognized. In the Independent 2018 PRIMUS report issued by two industry veterans, our Luminos System was recognized as the TPA leader with the highest net promoter score and most comprehensive in system capabilities and solutions offered among all TPAs. These are just two accolades that highlight the continuous investments we're making in the very best people, processes, and technology that are necessary to increase productivity, while consistently delivering the highest quality and to marchably superior outcomes for our clients.","So for the year in our risk management segment, 7% total adjusted revenue growth of which 5.2% is organic, adjusted EBITDAC margin was 17.4%. A very good result and we expect our risk management segment's 2018 organic and margin performance will be similar to the full-year of 2017.","And finally, our culture. We've built a very talented team of professionals who work across geographies, across divisions to deliver high quality insurance, risk management and consulting solutions to our clients every day. And we run the business according to a core set of tenants which are focused on teamwork, ethics, outstanding client service, and a dedication to the communities we operate in.","A great example of our culture is when we celebrated our 90th anniversary this past October. We set a companywide goal of 90,000 hours of curable work over the next 12 months. I'm proud of how our colleagues have responded already. Just four months in and we are well on our way to exceeding that goal.","Okay, a great quarter a fantastic year. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?","Doug Howell","Thanks, Pat and hello everyone. Like Pat said a truly excellent fourth quarter and full-year 2017.","Today, I\u2019ll highlight a couple of items behind the headline numbers in the earnings release. I'll then move to the CFO commentary document that we posted on our website to help you think about 2018 and tax reform, and then I will end with some comments on the forthcoming new revenue recognition standard.","Okay, to the earnings release. Page 4 to the brokerage segment organic growth table, 6.8% all-in organic, what a great quarter and terrific finish by our sales and service professionals. Under the 6.8% we did have some minor timing. Recall in our third quarter I explained that we had some negative timing that would catch up in the fourth quarter and so it did. That said, even levelizing for that timing, we would have posted about 6% organic growth still really excellent performance.","Next turning to Page 5 to the brokerage segment EBITDAC margin table at the bottom. Headline adjusted EBITDAC margin was up 37 basis points in the quarter underlying that we did have two one-off items that compressed our margin expansion. First, our partially owned Mexico based affiliate had a tough quarter due to the Earthquake in late September that cost us about $1.5 million; and second, we did have a one-off technology improvement project in our U.S. brokerage operation that cost us about $2 million. Without those one-off items, margins would have expanded about 70 basis points and that feels about right on organic around 6%.","Looking towards 2018, it would be hard for us to expand margins on organic growth at 3% or less but there could be some margin expansion on organic over 4%.","As for risk management nothing under the headline results, just really solid year, a really solid year at 5.2% organic and adjusted margins is 17.4%. And like Pat said we see for the risk management segment 2018 a lot like 2017 in terms of organic growth and adjusted EBITDAC margin.","Next let's turn to Page 7 of the earnings release to the corporate segment and then look at the clean energy line. You'll see we had an excellent fourth quarter for clean energy. A bit of that was due to the cold snap we had in late December but have capped off another excellent year, a $133 million of after-tax earnings that's up 16% over 2016. We also had some better than expected results on the corporate line, mostly due to tax benefits from additional stock option exercises in the quarter.","Finally, in the corporate table, you will see that we added a new line that shows the changes as a result of the U.S. Federal Income tax law changes. It came in a bit better than we estimated on December 22, when put out our special tax reform related commentary.","As for cash, at December 31, we had about $315 million available on our balance sheet. With our strong cash flows we should be able to fund M&A with free cash and debt coming to 2018 as well as the bump up in our dividend that we announced yesterday.","Let's leave the earnings release and move to the CFO commentary document that we posted on our website. I'll talk about pages 2 and 3. On Page 2, you will see that nearly all of the fourth quarter 2017 actuals came in very close to our estimates that we provided at our December 12 Investor Relations Day. Also on both Pages 2 and 3 that we took a shot at some estimates for full-year 2018. However because of the new revenue recognition standard at this time, we are not comfortable providing 2018 quarterly estimate. We hope to provide quarterly spreads at our next Investor Day.","A couple noteworthy items related to 2018 estimates. On Page 2, you will see that with the dollar weakening, FX could turn to a slight tailwind in 2018. In today's rate, it might feel EPS by a penny a quarter or so.","On Page 3 in the pink box you will see that most of the corporate line estimates for 2019 are consistent with 2017, except when we now get a federal tax benefit of 21% versus 35%.","As for our clean energy estimates for 2018 also that we show on Page 3 a couple of comments. First, we're still working with our utility partners but at this time it looks like production levels in 2018 could be similar to what we experienced in 2017. And we also believe that production cost in 2018 would be similar to 2017, however those costs are now tax benefited at a federal rate of 21% versus 35%.","So you will see that our range of earnings in 2018 is in the $105 million to $115 million range versus the $133 million we posted this year. We still expect those investments to generate over $225 million of tax credits. So tax reform does not reduce the amount of tax credits we can generate, that's a really great outcome.","At December 31, 2017, we have approximately $700 million of tax credits that will reduce our cash taxes paid for a very long time and that doesn't change much with tax reform either.","So talking about tax reform, flip to Page 6 of the CFO commentary, we have again provided our best look at comparing our pro forma for 2017 as if tax reform happened January 1st of 2017. We hope that is helpful in understanding the impact on EPS. But a couple of important note. First, you'll see that our core brokerage and risk management operations benefit substantially from tax reform, but our corporate cost don't benefit as much.","Second, I have always said that be careful, as you digest in your thinking, when looking at EPS, when it comes to clean energy, it is not a core business but rather an investment that generates some cash that can be reinvested into our core operation. So being a bit down in EPS really shouldn't matter.","Third, the most notable number to me is the amount of cash taxes paid. In 2017, we will pay about $56 million in cash taxes globally. When we pro forma 2017 for tax reform, you will see we would have effectively had no cash taxes paid. That's globally. We believe that will be the case in 2018. So regardless of how you measure it, tax reform deliver substantially more positive cash flow. When you look at it longer-term here is how we think about it, because we have nearly $700 million of tax credits on our balance sheet and because we believe we can generate about $225 million of credits annually in 2018 and 2019 and then about $180 million of credit annually in 2020 and 2021, it looks on a global basis, our net cash taxes paid will be about 1% of our EBITDAC for the next three of four years since starting in 2011 or 2022 globally we will be paying taxes of about 7% to 10% of our EBITDAC through the late 2020. Clearly a lot can change over the next decade but that shows the cash generation power of tax credit and investment. So that was an upchange for you to digest.","Let me offer a few comments on the forthcoming accounting change related to revenue recognition. First, we're well and along in our implementation of the new standard.","Second, we plan on doing a full retrospective method. That means we will recap all the historical numbers for each quarter going back to January 1, 2016. We will provide a reconciliation between old GAAP and new GAAP that explains the changes and also provide it in a format that allows you to easily compare the quarterly numbers under new GAAP.","Third, we hope to have a special Investor Day in late March or first week of April to give you that reconciliation and the new GAAP numbers. That should give you time to digest prior to us releasing our first quarter 2018 results which will be solely on the new GAAP basis.","Fourth, here's what we now as of now all which could change over the coming years. First, we believe that our cumulative effective of the change will be positive. One could interpret that to mean than old GAAP was more conservative than new GAAP for us. We also believe that new GAAP will change our quarterly seasonality in both the brokerage segment and for clean energy investment earnings that are reported in our corporate segment, but that won't have -- but the new GAAP will not have much quarterly movement at all-in our risk management segment. And then, third, we believe that new GAAP will change our annual earnings upward in the brokerage segment but no real impact annually to the risk management segment or to the corporate segment.","Okay, with that said let me once again congratulate our sales and service professionals for a fantastic quarter and a great year. We had terrific momentum coming into 2018. Back to you, Pat?","Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Doug. Darren, you want to open this up for questions, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The call is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions].","Our first question is coming from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Please state your question.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi good evening. Congrats on a really strong growth quarter. I guess my first question in terms of the organic you guys said it was about 6% when you adjust for some seasonality in the shifting. So when you're setting your outlook for I guess about 4.4% which is or a little bit higher which was a full-year 2017 level, what do you think, things will change I mean it doesn't sound like other than the shifting that things won't maybe get better from here, if you get some more price in 2018.","Patrick Gallagher","Well, I think what we're saying is right now, we think what we did in 2017 can repeat in 2018 maybe a little better, if pricing continues. We did see an uptick in the fourth quarter. As a matter of fact, we went think 3% in the first quarter, 4%, 4% 6% I don't think you can count on 6% in 2018. We had a terrific quarter and we had a really strong delivery on several of our units but so we feel somewhere in that mid 4% range is better for 2018.","Elyse Greenspan","And when you think like the mid 4% range for 2018 what type of pricing environment are you guys assuming in there?","Patrick Gallagher","Essentially flat.","Elyse Greenspan","So if prices pickup, there could be some upside to that number.","Patrick Gallagher","That's right. We're seeing some price increases across various lines for instance that is most properties getting some bump, transportation is but there's still some softening areas like workers' compensation, overall flat.","Doug Howell","Yes, I think the bigger story for us would be exposure growth and you really do have an acceleration of the economy that drops in pretty quickly. Sometimes prices come out strong but customers have the ability to opt out of price not so they have the ability to take deductibles up, buy less cover on the top end, so they will control their annual spend on insurance and we talk about opting in and opting out all the time.","Exposure group is something different. It's harder for them to control. If they add another truck, they've got to ensure the other truck and so if we get a hard economy exposure growth could help us top over that top over 4.4%.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. And then in terms of that you guys provided a lot of disclosure on the pro forma impact of tax reform. I know part of it is, should that your, if we looked at the details you guys provided about a year ago probably a little bit more of an upside to 2016 and 2017 numbers. And I think part of that was due to some deductions that you guys are losing. Could you just give us a little bit of color there, so we could understand the delta more between the two years?","Doug Howell","Right. There's about three things there let's go to the first one. First and foremost when we provided our commentary last year related to 2016 like I said, I think the most important number is the cash taxes that we pay globally. Last year I think by my memory is right, we would have said that we would have paid in 2016, we paid about $66 million of taxes and had tax reform happen at 2016. We would have paid about $40 million, so only about a $26 million improvement in cash.","Our results now in 2017 will show about a over $50 million less cash taxes paid, so that's a good outcome. Some things that take on the rates, I think our outlook last year was done on a 20% rate and we're at 21% now. I think that there were deductions that we lost in tax reform, that we didn't anticipate in the 6 -- when we were looking at 2016 results, so you add all that up, and then the other -- the last thing is the shift in income we have, last year we had substantially more integration expense in our international operations that's not there now. So as a result those were operating higher tax jurisdictions now that erode some of that differential between the years. But by and large if you focus on the cash number all these things will end up in a better cash flow situation despite how it looks on an EPS basis or a pro forma basis.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. And then one another question you guys are, the growth that you guys saw in the contingents and supplementals also looked pretty strong in the quarter was there some seasonality there and then what's the outlook I know it's included within your all-in number but for contingents and supplementals for 2018?","Patrick Gallagher","No, nothing special in the fourth quarter and looking forward, we're not seeing a lot of pressure right now obviously our Mexico affiliate got hit because of the earthquake that hurt us a little bit this quarter but that comes through a different line. But I'm not [indiscernible] contingent or supplemental coming into the year at all.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arash Soleimani of KBW. Proceed with your question.","Arash Soleimani","Thanks. Just the first question in terms of the benefits to the broker segment from tax reform obviously has a pretty -- it's a pretty nice tailwind there. To what extent you expect that to fall to the bottom line versus resulting in higher compensation or other sorts of items that could reduce the bottom line impact.","Doug Howell","We don't run our company based on what the after-tax numbers are. We're an EBITDA focused company. So I think that's something that we'll continue to do is focus on that number. Second of all, when you really look at the information we gave you, interestingly enough, we're showing you the statutory rates. I think it's important to know had we recapped the last years pro forma and used really when you get out a few years 5.25% is what we will be paying in income tax in our domestic operations, when you get out about three or four years from now because of the tax credit, the gearing that you would see in the brokerage and risk management segment would go up lot. So here -- it's already up 15% now in those core segments together, you move that 21% rate down and the math down to 5% you'll pick up a ton more increase there.","Arash Soleimani","Okay. So based on the comments where you're obviously you're basing everything -- you're running the company based on EBITDA sounds like that's something where it really should be expected to kind of hit the bottom line and it kind of if anything gives you more, capacity for M&A.","Doug Howell","That's right.","Patrick Gallagher","That's right.","Arash Soleimani","Okay. And the IT refresh that you mentioned can you just remind like how often would something like that would occur in the business.","Doug Howell","Here everyone is where we have an opportunity to really see an opportunity to improve something and so we took at this quarter. So it's a little hit or miss whenever we do that.","Operator","Our next question is from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Kai Pan","Good evening. Thank you and congrats on the strong finish. My first question just follow-up on the Elyse question on the organic growth in the fourth quarter. Can you give a little more color as to what's really behind the 6-plus-percent organic growth and why it's not repeatable?","Patrick Gallagher","Well, Kai, this is, Pat. We snatched it in the fourth quarter. Our sales people killed it and that just don't happen every quarter.","Kai Pan","All right. I take that. Then the on the margin front I just wondering like you grow about 4% and if you look at the margin for the full-year actually it could expand even more, especially I'm looking at your comp expense ratio for the full-year roughly flat year-over-year. So why wouldn't it have more sort of wage or like expense leverage.","Doug Howell","Well, first and foremost, remember what makes the money for the stockowners that\u2019s our people and a lot we pay our producers based on what they produce and they participate in that so we like a comp ratio or it's been. That comp ratio is kind of being the comp ratio for us for 30 years, 40 years something like that. So there is opportunities for some leverage in that but really we still have opportunities in our operating expenses. And I know there are wage pressures that are out there -- there is -- as we reach full employment in many of the countries it's more competitive for people. So we can hold the comp ratio where it is continue to go after our productivity list on the operating expenses we see that as the way we will expand margins that if we come in somewhere in the mid 4s.","Kai Pan","Okay. And one last question is a number question is that if you look at your reported in a pro forma for the corporate segments and especially the corporate lines it you looks like under the new tax law looks like the losses will be double the prior so a tax regime. So but if you look at a forecast for your net earnings or net losses in that line in 2018 is roughly the same as the 2017 I just wondering why is the losses not more in the corporate line.","Doug Howell","There were some one-off items in the corporate item that we just don't see repeated again. I think especially if you throw in the move and the tax reform items and that the -- there were matters related to the litigation that we won three years ago, that we're running through there, there is some cost that won\u2019t repeat. So that is why we think it\u2019s we will perform about as well even after-tax reform.","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","Our next question comes from James Naklicki of Citi. Please proceed with your questions.","James Naklicki","Yes thanks guys. I don't want to beat a dead horse here, but when we met with you guys in December I believe the guidance in brokerage was for 3% to 3.5% and you did 6%, so was there sort of a lot of upside to that number in the second half of December or was there organic pulled from the first quarter of 2018 into that fourth quarter number. I guess that's my first question there, I have a follow-up as well.","Doug Howell","The answer to that is no. I will go to the guidance remember our guidance in the third quarter I don\u2019t think when we actually said 3% to 3.5% if we did maybe we will be just a little conservative on that. I think our guidance really was and we didn\u2019t expect any margin expansion and we ended up getting 40 to 70 basis points on how we measure that. But we said that and at the time when we're sitting there in December week we had a terrific December, so based on through November we are probably some place in that, 3% to 4% range so.","James Naklicki","Got it. So strong December got it, okay.","Doug Howell","Yes.","James Naklicki","And then my follow-up is on corporate, so before the adjustments I thought you guys were looking for a profit there and there was a little bit of a loss, so can you just walk me through what the weakness was for net income before the adjustments.","Doug Howell","All right. Let's go for the corporate segment if you look at what we expected and what we published on December 12, we hit exactly what we thought on interest expenses maybe a little bit better, so got better there. We blew the doors off, as Pat said, on clean energy. So we came at the higher end of the range on our earnings on that, and we also have less loss on the corporate line of corporate there and maybe we didn't really forecast any lease move related to our headquarters, so that came in right. So maybe you are looking at I don\u2019t know what you are exactly looking at but we did book our tax reform adjustments which was about $29 million charge, as we adjusted our deferred tax assets as we adjusted our transition tax, and a few other items that we adjusted some actual to current differences there but returned to actual provision items there. But by and large I think all of our numbers actually beat the expectations that we laid out in December.","James Naklicki","Got it, got it. So is tax reform. Okay, thank you very much.","Doug Howell","[Indiscernible] why you are not looking through?","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Klauber of William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Adam Klauber","Good morning guys, couple of different questions. Wholesale had a good quarter after the tough weather, are you seeing more inflow of risk into the market?","Patrick Gallagher","Yes I would say that's especially around the catastrophe stuff. There is an awful lot more marketing going on; people are pushing to rate there. It\u2019s not holding across the board but yes more people are in the U.S. market.","Adam Klauber","And so can you remind me what the seasonality for the property renewals, is it pretty even does more stuff come up before the summer?","Patrick Gallagher","No it's pretty much second and third quarter.","Adam Klauber","Second and third quarter all right, those are the bigger quarters, right?","Patrick Gallagher","Yes.","Doug Howell","Yes, right.","Adam Klauber","Yes, yes. So, we will probably get a good idea of after the second quarter if there is more of an increase in some of that properties; is that right?","Patrick Gallagher","Yes, correct.","Adam Klauber","Okay. As far as the benefits business, I think you mentioned 6% that seems better than it has been I\u2019m not sure who said that number but what's driving the growth there?","Patrick Gallagher","Probably I think that whenever we benefit from confusion and change. And when you got the reform stuff going on and Washington, changes to the ACA, our people need an awful lot of help of that. Now the other thing that's driving it is we're making sure that our clients realize that we\u2019re not just about health instance, what we are doing is trying to help employers become the destination employer and in this work environment we are approaching full employment that's important stuff. So our voluntary numbers are up, our consulting numbers and HR are up, our health insurance numbers are up nicely but it really is across the board.","Adam Klauber","And I know you have added in the last couple of years, you've invested in this practice added a fair amount to it, is that allowing to go up market a bit, I'm not talking about the Jumbo\u2019s but are you getting some of our declines also?","Patrick Gallagher","Yes. Yes it is definitely. We're competing well on multithousand life cases now against some of the stronger competitors.","Adam Klauber","Great, that makes sense, okay. What was -- if you could give us a general idea, what was the growth in your producer force in 2017 versus 2016 and I guess what are your thoughts on 2018?","Patrick Gallagher","Well I got it.","Doug Howell","Our producer headcount was up 1% excluding acquisitions.","Patrick Gallagher","If you add acquisitions, which is accretive to production headcount you got that number.","Doug Howell","See if I can get there for you, Adam.","Adam Klauber","Okay, yes, I would be interested in the total number. And then as far as one, there's an investigation going on in London it would be interesting your thought there in. Do you have a wholesale London business and if so how big is that?","Patrick Gallagher","Really big, really big. I mean I don\u2019t have a revenue number for you off the top of my head but it\u2019s really one of the largest London brokers in the London market and yes the FCA is looking at the entire wholesale industry and we always believe that we do it right for the client and frankly we support the FCA's effort to look at that.","Doug Howell","Thanks. The nature of our wholesale business in there is moving business into the London marketplace, it's not nearly as big when you look at side cars and programs and that. So it's not really that type of business that the popular press is talking about.","Adam Klauber","Right, right. So my understanding you haven't done a lot of the big facilities, a lot of the big programs that some of the other -- some of your other competitors have is that in general is that on point?","Patrick Gallagher","That's correct.","Adam Klauber","Okay, okay. Very helpful. Thanks guys.","Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Adam.","Doug Howell","Thanks Adam.","Patrick Gallagher","Have a good night.","Doug Howell","We are adding about 5% producer headcount as a result of acquisitions last year, also the follow-up.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Hughes of SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Hughes","Thank you. The M&A environment with tax rates going down is that pushing out multipliers are either in private equity or you all paying more for these after-tax dollars?","Doug Howell","Yes, I think there will probably be a one turn and a multiple as a result of it.","Mark Hughes","Is that going to bring more deals to the market, or should that be a tailwind in 2018?","Doug Howell","Yes, I think so. I think that -- I think this -- but remember the real motivation for somebody to join us is they want our capabilities and our resources and that is also accelerating even more rapidly. So the money will be better for those folks that are selling. But I think that the reality of this as this gets to be much more of a complicated business especially take our benefits practices we just talked about, it is very confusing and we have some really, really great smaller brokers out there that when they join us, they continue to grow great service to their customers when they throw in our capabilities. We see is really right environment next year.","Mark Hughes","And then any restrictions on private equity leveraging up with tax reforms is that going to make a difference?","Doug Howell","You know I haven't really looked at the math but when it comes to the interest non-deductibility matter but again to be honest if somebody is interested in selling to a PE firm they're probably not interested in adding capabilities to our resources they just want to be a part of a friend [ph], of a label. We don't -- we don't do well with people that don't have any interest in our capabilities and the resources that we bring. So I don't see it as impacting our results, the number of what that we'll have next year will be up and maybe for PE too, but I think there is plenty of them amount there.","Mark Hughes","And then on risk management, we think about workers comp claims any commentary on the underlying trend there, any indication that the stronger economy could lead to increased frequency?","Patrick Gallagher","So far, we're seeing Mark about a 1% uptick and not a huge uptick there.","Mark Hughes","So that's just the same no, no changes?","Patrick Gallagher","Not so far.","Mark Hughes","Yes. Okay.","Doug Howell","Payrolls go up especially if we get into any big infrastructure spend that the financial type job they don\u2019t have nearly as many workers comp claims, but we if get into a big construction boom here in the U.S. you'll see those numbers go up.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arash Soleimani of KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Arash Soleimani","Thanks. I just had a quick follow-up. When you said the organic in 2018 would need to be closer to 4% and 3% for margin expansion can just remind me why it would be a higher organic requirement next year or this year?","Doug Howell","We've always said that. We've always said tough to expand margins if it's 3% or less. There's a little wage pressure out there right now. So if we get to 4% there's margin expansion probably, someplace between 3% and 4% we will see how the year comes out. I would hope so but you just never now in this environment, being a low cost on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Kai Pan","Yes. I have two follow-ups. Number one is that could you talk a bit more about your technology investment and how do you think sort of technology could disrupt the brokerage business.","Patrick Gallagher","Well, I think if you take a look at the numbers around and InsurTech investments there is billions of dollars flowing into this industry. We're doing I think a pretty good job of watching that. And we're of course doing all we can to utilize technology to continue improve our business. But so far the things that we watched and followed some are very clever but I don't see them as being a drastic disruptor in particular where we stake out our position in the marketplace is as a trusted advisor.","Yes, we do have some electronic broking that we do around cyber, we will quote a couple hundred cyber quotes a month literally touch free and that's actually a day when I think about its not a month, it\u2019s a day, but that's not a huge part of our business where we make our money and where we hold onto our clients is by being the person that they rely on for advice and I don't think that's going away.","Doug Howell","And two things. If you look at InsurTech that's really improvement of service tech. We have some pretty exciting things going on in terms of helping us improve our service to the customers when it comes to distribution RPS on the wholesale side is the place that's putting good wholesaler to broker type capability then it will allow them to quick quote cyber umbrella etcetera. So those are the places that have but when it comes to just pure distribution tech selling insurance in their way pretty hard when our customers are buying four, five different policies on the account. Because typically those are 1-type -- one single coverage type policies, and that's really not what we specialize in. We're a little further upmarket than that.","Kai Pan","Okay, that's helpful. But my last one is on your tax strategy, you have Glencoe business to lower your effective tax rate but now the U.S. tax law sort of changes the playing field is more less leveled are you going to pursue other tax strategy after expiration of Glencoe in 2021.","Doug Howell","Well, there is two different questions. I just want to make sure that our tax credit strategy was always there to take our rate from the regular rate today and T-rate so that goes -- used to go from 35% to 20%. Now with the way while our work we will be able to take our rate from 21% to 5.25%. So it's almost exactly the same 15% setbacks in the rate, so the amount that it produces for us is nearly identical.","When it comes to the longevity of the program right now we have credits that we believe even with some rapid growth in the U.S. if you just model it out that our tax credit will last as well as into the late 2020. So what the next up in tax credits, you got a decade or more to figure it out. So it's not something I feel like we need to rush and do today. To put more money into something that we don't need tax credit say until 2030. But I think we're pretty well-positioned right now for the next ten-plus-years of our lives when it comes to a really paying, we can pay 5% U.S corporate tax for the next 10 to 12, 13 years that will be terrific wouldn't it.","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, thank you. So I had a follow-up question on revenue recognition. So Doug you mentioned this split I believe be positive for your earnings. It's my understanding that for the most part annual revenue should be unchanged please correct me if I'm wrong, so and as we think about you guys adopting revenue recognition for 2018 I guess that's margin accretive and then when we think about I know another broker had said that they had seen an expense benefit in 2018 kind of like a one-year adjustment for the deferral of some expenses. Is your comment that it is positive to your earnings stream is that an ongoing not just a one-year comment, can you just kind of tie a few of those things together.","Doug Howell","Yes, I'll do the best I can. It's highly complicated and but I think that you characterized it correctly I wasn't commenting on any one-time item other than the cumulative effect of the change that comes in, in January -- that will book basically 12\/31\/15 or January 1, 2016.","In terms of why their earnings elevate is in general revenues will go up, there'll be a small impact on EBITDA that will go up. I guess that would probably wash out in the margin to a certain extent but really we've been pretty conservative on when we recognize contingent commissions and also direct sales for carrier bills or installment bill policies. So that will be something that pulls forward. But then you also have the stuff we initiated that we get pushed back but there is a net uplift in it.","Elyse Greenspan","And when is the plan that you guys are going to give us I guess the pro forma's for 2017.","Doug Howell","I think, I said in my open commentary that we hope to have that here by late March or early April, so.","Elyse Greenspan","And at that point you'll also give us the corporate earnings projections by quarter for 2018 because I notice we just got the full-year outlook.","Doug Howell","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then one last question I know there were some an earlier question just in terms of I guess the fact that things seem to have gotten better towards the end of December after your Investor Day. Do you guys have an initial view on how January has been that you can share with us entirely your full-year outlook for 2018.","Doug Howell","No, because if we have that -- if we have that capability I would have been able to tell you on December 12 it doesn't all happen on the last day of the month. So I wish I did. But there's a sales business I know there is a rush at the end of the month in order get things booked. But I think at this point I really don't have a look at January at this point.","Operator","There are no further questions in queue at this time.","Patrick Gallagher","Great. I will make a quick comment as I wrap up. As we said a number of times 2017 was a fantastic year for Gallagher. I'd like to thank each and every one of our nearly 27,000 colleagues for their hard work. As we enter 2018 our focus remains on executing on each component of our value creation strategy growing organically, growing through tuck-in acquisitions, improving our quality and productivity, and maintaining our unique Gallagher culture. Thank you for being with us this afternoon and have a great evening.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time."],"2975":["Arthur J.

Participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. Your lines will be open for questions following the presentation. Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Some of the comments made during this conference call, including answers given in response to questions, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws.

Patrick Gallagher, Chairman, President and CEO of Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions.","Today, I'm going to start with some general comments on the quarter, then Doug and I are going to touch on the four key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value. I'll address two of the four: organic growth including the results of our mid-year rate survey, trends in the employee benefits market and claim counts within Gallagher Bassett. And then I'll talk about our true differentiator, our culture. After my comments, Doug will address the other two, which are growing through mergers and acquisitions, and improving our productivity and quality.","Frankly the team crushed at this quarter, delivering on all measures. For the quarter, our combined brokerage and risk management segments generated organic revenue growth of 6.6%, adjusted EBITDAC margin expanded 89 basis points and adjusted EBITDAC increased 14%.","In addition, we completed 12 mergers in the quarter, which should add about $145 million of annualized revenue. I would like to extend a very warm welcome to all of our new merger partners, and we really had a strong clean energy performance as well. These are outstanding results from the team and the outcome of hard work, dedication and execution from our nearly 30,000 Gallagher professionals all around the world.","Let me dive a bit deeper behind the organic growth numbers and provide some data points on the rate environment based on our mid-year rate survey and internal data. First in our brokerage segment, 5.9% all in organic reflecting strong growth across all of our divisions globally. Within this, we believe improving rates and exposures contributed about 60 basis points of that number. Our internal mid-year rate survey indicated a continued trend of increasing property, casualty pricing and exposure growth around the globe.","Let me start with the United States, our retail property, casualty brokerage business generated about 5.5% organic in the second quarter, and pricing is positive across almost all lines of business. For example, both property and commercial auto pricing are up about 5%. Casualty and specialty lines are flat to up 1-point or 2 points. Workers' compensation is the only major line down and even that is only weaker by 1-point.","Staying in the United States, our wholesale organic was around 6% with average pricing a point higher than in the retail business. Property lines in total are up 7% with catastrophe-exposed property up about 10%. Most casualty lines, including specialty lines, are up between 2% to 4%.","In the UK, I was there in June and I'm really pleased with how our businesses come together and I'm excited about the team's performance. Our UK retail organic was over 4% in the quarter and pricing is up about 1.5%. Commercial property pricing is flat. Casualty lines, including specialty classes, are up 2% to 3%. Our UK wholesale organic was 7% and rates are flat. Pricing in most classes appears to a bottom and we're cautiously optimistic for rates to firm in the future.","In Australia and New Zealand, organic was about 7% and rate is up mid-single digits. Property rates were up 8% to 9%; casualty and specialty lines were up 4% to 6% on average. So, when I sum it up around the world, PC rates in a growing economy are providing a tailwind to organic growth which means we should be able to post better organic in 2018 than we did in 2017.","Okay. Moving on to our employee benefits operations. Our benefits business had a fantastic quarter generating all-in organic revenue growth of around 7%, similar both in the U.S. and internationally. Employment growth across the U.S., the UK, Australia and Canada, our major benefits footprints, continues to trend higher. Average employment growth in these countries over the past 12 months is close to 2%, an increase over the previous three-year average of 1.5%.","This past quarter, I also attended our annual IBIS Academy Conference in Berlin. The conference has been running straight for 48 years, making it the longest running international HR conference in the world. The three-day conference had hundreds of attendees with numerous breakout sessions focused on the top issues facing global HR and benefits professionals today.","This is just one example of how we leverage the best minds in the industry to deliver value-added insights to our clients and prospects. Our thought leadership, tools, high-quality service combined with a modest tailwind from employment growth positions our benefits business very well for the future.","Next, I'd like to move to our risk management segment, which is primarily Gallagher Bassett. Second quarter organic growth was a stellar 10.1%. It was helped by $2 million of additional Australian performance bonus fees and a $2.5 million ramp up fee also in Australia. Excluding these two items, organic was up about 8%, still an excellent performance.","In the U.S., organic growth was 7% in the quarter. Our insurance carrier business continues to grow nicely and we are beginning to see a modest pickup in claim counts. Both workers' comp and liability claim counts in the U.S. have been creeping higher this year. And total claim counts are up about 1.5% year-to-date versus the flattish environment last year.","Internationally, we had a great quarter and even after excluding the additional client ramp up fees, organic growth was 14%. I also visited our UK and Australian operations this quarter and I continue to be impressed with our international Gallagher Bassett team. The organic growth in the first half of the year has been fantastic. Everywhere around the globe clients are realizing more and more that Gallagher Bassett can deliver superior claim outcomes in our new business and organic growth are a reflection of that.","I'll close my comments today talking about our true differentiator, our culture. We believe our culture is unique and that it delivers better results. Our mission statement is four simple philosophies: be passionate and professional in our craft, all the while placing our customers first; be the best employer and take care of our associates; be excellent trading partners with the underwriting community striving for win-win delivery of our advice and service; and deliver excellent and consistent return to shareholders. Every day all our teammates get up and work diligently to maintain our culture, to promote our culture and to live our culture.","Okay. An outstanding quarter on all measures, a tremendous first half on all measures. I'll stop now and turn it over Doug. Doug?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon everyone. As Pat said, what a truly terrific second quarter. And combined with our excellent first quarter, we're in really great shape here, halfway through the year. Today, I'll first make some comments referencing the CFO commentary document that we posted on our website and I'll move back into the earnings release.","Okay. Some takeaways from page 2 of the CFO commentary document, to the foreign exchange line. It's consistent with what we published at our June 13 Investor Day and it's still looking like we'll get a small tailwind from FX this year based on current exchange rates. On the integration line, we didn't have any during the first half of this year, but looking forward, we forecast that we all have about $0.01 a quarter as we integrate Pronto and Coverdale.","Turning to page 3 to the corporate segment, to the interest and banking line. Our second quarter results were right in line with the midpoint of the estimates we provided in our June Investor Day. As we look forward, our estimates are now just a little lesser in the third and the fourth quarter.","On the clean energy line, you'll see that we had a strong quarter coming $0.015 above the midpoint of our June 13 estimates. And looking forward, we have revised upward our estimates for the third and the fourth quarter. However, as I always must caution, predicting the weather plays a big part in our estimates. So, these estimates are never really locked in stone.","On the M&A line, we're up a little this quarter due to the recent acquisitions of Pronto and Coverdale, but no change in our estimates for the third and the fourth quarter at this time.","On the corporate line, we came in $0.01 below our June 13 estimates. One reason, we concluded that we might be on soft ground related to new interpretations of a 2016 VAT tax matter in the UK. So, we booked a $1.7 million reserve this quarter. We don't have that issue in 2017 nor in 2018 or even going forward. So, consider this a one-timer. Looking forward, not much change in our third and fourth quarter estimates from what we provided in June.","And the final line in the corporate segment is the impact of U.S. tax reform. Recall from our first quarter call, this line is where we're tracking the impact from digesting the new tax legislation, both on our initial December 31, 2017 balance sheet estimates as well as the ongoing impacts such as non-deductible compensation and entertainment expenses and as well as a portion of our foreign earnings.","We guided that we would have some, but we were not in a position to give estimates during our first quarter call or our June IR Day. We've had more time to review. We're a long ways along in preparing our tax returns. So, we're now providing an estimate for the third and the fourth quarter. But as we said then and we say now, these items are effectively just book expense items and they will not cause us to pay more cash taxes because we have an abundance of tax credits.","In the end, we believe tax reform has been a really terrific outcome for Gallagher. While it does eliminate some small deductions and it does cause a portion of foreign earnings to be taxed, those amounts are peanuts when compared to the rate reduction and the fact that it preserved both our AMT and our clean energy tax credits, which total over $750 million at June 30, and it also preserved our ability to generate future tax credits through our clean energy investments. And at current production levels, that may total another $700 million through 2021. These credits are extremely valuable and they should reduce our cash taxes paid for the next decade. They could also help us reduce the friction cost as we repatriate more cash from around the world.","All that said, I do appreciate that modeling our tax credits can be difficult. Perhaps the best way is to arrive at when you're computing free cash, when you're building your models is to assume that we're going to pay global taxes of only about 3% to 4% of our core brokerage and risk management EBITDAC for the next three years, and then bump that up from 6% to 9% in the next five to seven years. And I think that'll get you close.","Of course, lesser taxes paid allows us to fund our M&A strategy. Through today, in 2018, we have closed 26 mergers, 24 in brokerage and 2 in risk management for total annualized revenues of about $240 million. That's already more revenue than we purchased in all of 2017. And what's more important, we've completed these at fair pricing that gives us a nice arbitrage to our trading multiple. And we've done it with nearly all free cash and debt.","Looking forward, we have a full pipeline of attractive tuck-in merger opportunities. Right now, we have about 60 term sheets either signed or being prepared for about $300 million of annualized revenues. Clearly, we don't expect all of these acquisitions to close; however, we believe we'll get our fair share.","At June 30, we had about $350 million of available cash on our balance sheet. So that, plus our expected free cash flow in the second half of the year, should fund our M&A strategy as we sit today for the remainder of 2018.","Let's move to some comments on productivity and quality. If you turn now to the bottom of page 5 of the earnings release to the brokerage segment adjusted margin table, we're up 80 basis points in the second quarter on 5.9% organic. That's really nice work by the team to optimize our real estate footprint, to harmonize our agency management systems and to automate and ship work to our lower cost operating centers.","Looking forward, the third quarter is historically the quarter we show very little margin expansion. This arises because we give our raises mid-year. In addition, this year, two of our recent mergers have seasonally lower EBITDAC margins in the third quarter. So that will make margin expansion just a bit harder too. But like we say, and when you look at a year, we still believe that it's difficult to expand margins below 3% organic but much more likely if organic is over 4%.","Next let's turn to page 7 of the earnings release, to the risk management adjusted margin table at the top of the page; up 139 basis points to 17.7%. However that is influenced by the two revenue items Pat mentioned earlier, so when you level set these revenue items and the associated expenses and incentive compensation, our risk management segment would have delivered margin a bit over 17%, which is still nicely up over 70 basis points compared to prior year. Looking forward, we're still targeting margins over 17% for the rest of the year at our risk management segment.","So those are my comments. An outstanding quarter, an outstanding first half, I think we're in terrific position to continue our success in the second half of 2018 and beyond. Back to you, Pat.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thank you, Doug. Operator, I think we're ready to take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, and good afternoon.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Good afternoon, Kai.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Congrats on the great quarter. So, my first question on organic growth. And in the first half you achieved 6%. So, you almost don't have to go to work in the second half to achieve the full year 4.4% achieved last year. I assume you won't do that. So, my question is really, why second half organic growth would not be better than the first half?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","All right, Kai. I think we're in a pretty good spot here through two quarters. And I'm very proud of the team. We really are riding a lot more new business, which means we're taking share primarily from the littler players. We know that 90% of the time when we compete in the marketplace, we're not competing with our bigger competitors, we're competing with the local competitor. And I think our guys and gals in the field are just doing a good job of explaining the value proposition we bring. And I don't think I'd want to get myself out on a limb and say second half is going to be much better than the half that looks as good as this one.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah. Sales can be almost tricky sometimes too, Kai. So, we're pretty happy with where we are thus far year-to-date and we hope we're bringing in better for the second half too.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Is there a tougher comp in the second half compared with the 2017?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","I don't know if there's any tougher comparisons necessarily. Our first half of the year is our stronger half now under the new revenue recognition where so much more is recognized in the first quarter. So, second two quarters will be lesser in total, but I don't recall anything of substance in there that would cause a difficult compare.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. My second question on the margin front. In the press release, you mentioned about head count controls. I just wonder, could you elaborate a little more on that. You also mentioned earlier to say second half because the wage raise in mid-year so the expansion in the second half might not be as strong as the first half. So, just want to see is that still going to be true going forward.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah. I think it's a terrific question. First of all, our production staff, most of them are on a formula. So that doesn't really influence. So, when you look at our non-production, non-formula folks, there's about 17,000 of them around the world and giving annual raises to those folks is something we try to do and for the performers. So, yes, you'll see that coming into that, and generally those happened in the third quarter, we give that away.","When it comes to head count controls, we're up 290 people on 16,000 in the first half of the year and that's on existing businesses. Our head count has grown with our acquisitions. But the team is doing a really great job of controlling our head count. Part of that is building out a service center here in the U.S., we're up to about 150 people there. So, when you just look at the true discipline of not hiring and the team's doing a terrific job with that and that is contributing to our margin expansion.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Last one if I may on the acquisition. Looks like the multiple you're paying a little bit higher in the second quarter than the first quarter. Is there more competition for the deals? And also, will these deals given the magnitude of them, will that create a margin drag on your overall book or are they actually going to be accretive to your margins?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah, good question. At the bottom of page 2 in the CFO commentary, at this quarter, we were at 8.9 times. We say that had we not done one little bit larger acquisition, we would have been in the quarter at 7.5 times and 7 times year-to-date. So, there's one acquisition was slightly larger. Now that was a multiple of EBITDA. The important thing is that the U.S. acquisition and we have the ability to use our tax credits against that company's earnings. So, on a tax adjusted basis, it's even lower than the numbers that we're showing here.","So, we're pretty happy to have that one on board. And it did drive up a little bit in this quarter. Going forward, there's price competition out there, but the folks that are really valuing our capabilities, our resources, they know they can be better together with us. They're still taking fair multiples on it and I think there's a fair arbitrage for what we bring to the deal and what they bring to the deal.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","We also give them a fair chance for an earn-out. And the other thing is, I would say, I'd reiterate kind of what Doug said. There's a lot of competition for deals. If people want to put a book together and just see how many bids they can get, they'll get a lot. So, it's really important that we pick our partners carefully with the understanding that we expect to be living together for a long time, and if it's not exciting to be part of the organization with our capabilities, what we're doing around the world, when we can sit with some of these smaller competitors and tell them join us and you can write any account of any size, anywhere in the world. Well, if it's all just about the next bite on the apple and I'm going to go to private equity and flip it, you're not going to fit here anyway. So, I think we're finding really, really solid partners.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Just follow-up, will these deals create a margin drag on your portfolio as well (00:21:36)?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","I did say in my prepared comments that in the third quarter, there's two of them that have margins that are slightly below 20% that can have a little bit of an impact on our third quarter margins. But by and large that probably would impact margin expansion in the third quarter, but not necessarily annual margin expansion. Also, just as we've become more profitable, a lot of the smaller brokers have become more profitable too. So, by and large, we're not buying organizations at a margin dilutive to us on an annual basis.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you so much. And good luck with second half.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks, Kai.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good evening. My first question on, you guys mentioned that improving rates and exposure growth was benefiting organic by about 60 basis points in the quarter. Would you expect that to continue or pick up from that level as you think about the balance of 2018 and even into 2019 at this point?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah, Elyse. This is Pat. I think we'll see a similar situation as we finish the year. You've heard me say this many, many times. When we're getting a 60-basis-point lift from exposure and rate, I mean, it's better than a 60-basis-point decrease, but, I mean, let's be honest, it's a flat market in my opinion. And when we see it up 1 point, down 1 point, sideways 2, up 1.5, I mean, if you go back in history and look at what hard and soft markets were really like. Go pull our numbers from 2001, 2002 after 09\/11, I mean, rates were jumping 21%.","So, this flattish market up slightly with a little tailwind is nirvana for us, because now we're not going out against the smaller player that all of a sudden out of nowhere comes up with some quote, we can't believe and we can't compete with. The markets essentially flat to up to, let's say, across all lines, that's when our capability is really shine, that's when our team has a just a decided advantage 90% of the time quoting against somebody smaller.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So then a follow up, so you saw about a 90-basis-point acceleration in organic growth sequentially. So, what's been the greater contributor in the second quarter versus the first quarter? Is it just mix in terms of what was winning, is it getting greater price, more new business or are you writing more, are your clients purchasing more coverage, I'm just trying to kind of understand what's been the driver of the pretty strong organic growth if we're kind of in this about flat market?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","The answer to your question is yes.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah. All of those. We've had a little less loss business, a little bit more new business, each ship is rising around the world. I have to say, again, a lot of credit to the field done, the Gallagher Playbook that we have and organic growth is paying dividends around the world. So, kind of all ships are rising right now. And really rate is one thing, but exposure, if the economy continues to heat up, exposure unit growth actually contributes more to organic than rate does, because on rate, they can take up some of the deductibles or bring down the limits a little bit. And so, I think that the economy continues to get better 60 basis points now, I wouldn't expect it to go to a full point, but it might be 80 basis points.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then in terms of your margin commentary, going back for the past three or four quarters or so, you guys started talking about 3% organic, below that you might not expand margins and over 4% you would see even better margin expansion. I know there's been a lot of talk about that, but do you see that as any kind of shift in your business or it's kind of re-emphasizing, I guess, how you always saw your business running in terms of the organic's ability to generate margin expansion.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","I'd say, it's similar commentary. I think that in a perfect world maybe under 3.5%, a little harder to expand margin and over 3.5% you'll get margin expansion. But we've already talked about that 3% level. And over 4% we do have great opportunities. Now remember also, we're making a lot of investments into the business under the (00:26:12) too.","You have to understand that 450 young folks in our internship program this summer, we've got nice IT efforts underway both to distribute better but also to service better. So, there's a lot of investment going on inside of Gallagher, but we still are having the ability to expand margins, especially when you're over 5%.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then one just last numbers question. Doug, I think you mentioned about the ability of your clean energy plans to generate about another 700 million of credits between now and 2021. Did I catch that correctly? Is that what you were kind of implying?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah, that's right. That's what I said. I think that over the next \u2013 for the rest of 2018, for 2019, 2020 and 2021 you could see a number of over 700 million of credits.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's great. Thank you very much.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks. Thanks, Elyse.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks, Elyse.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.","Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research","Hey, good evening, guys. First question on, I guess, on the cat exposed business, it sounded like it was renewing with pretty good rate. Can you see just give us a reminder on, I guess, the seasonality of that like where that's kind of a bigger part of the brokerage mix, is it kind of the biggest contributor to second or is it equally big in the third quarter?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Second and third are the biggest two quarters on property renewal. So, we did get some lift for it, but as a percentage of our book coastal-exposed property, I don't have numbers right off the top of my head, but our $1 billion of revenue this quarter maybe there's $60 million that's coastal exposed property.","Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research","It looked like that 3Q for the costal exposed property too.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Say that again?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","That's still only about $38 million in the third quarter, so it's down quite there.","Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research","Okay. Got you. And then, I guess one question I had was, obviously organic is accelerating, we're seeing margin expansion. Does that, I guess, internally relative to how you were budgeting expenses earlier in the year and all that? This seems a better organic, maybe change your view that hey like maybe there's some places we could invest we weren't thinking about it. Is there a thought process there where you're adjusting your \u2013 where you're thinking about investing because you're seeing better organic?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Well, it may be in a way, but I think a better way to say is, if we saw organic struggling at 1% or 2%, maybe we'd be stopping investing in what we're doing. But it's not just because we've got more organic that we're more willing to fund internal projects. Folks, they still have to sing for their supper on that. And so, it's probably the opposite side of your question is how much could we pull back in investing, if we ever got into a 1% or 2% organic growth environment. There's $20 million to $30 million or $40 million investment happening all around the world that that's what you would (29:32) but we've been doing that all along. We think it's important to invest in the business.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah. Ryan, we got \u2013 it's nice to have a nice quarter, don't get me wrong. It's nice to have a great first half, and I think we've probably strung together six or seven years of pretty good results. But you don't do that without investing in your business and you got to look at the long-term. We don't ratchet in investments quarter-by-quarter, okay, keep going now we're into the third quarter, no. So, we've got to make our plans and follow through.","Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research","Understood. That's helpful. And I guess just for Doug. I guess, I just wanted to maybe give you guys an opportunity to comment on what you think the free cash flow generation potential is here at Gallagher. And I guess, how you think we should think about having free cash flow grow relative to operating earnings over the next few years.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Right. I think that probably the best thing to do is to project EBITDA, reduce our interest expense, take 3% to 5% of our EBITDA in taxes and then about 10% invested in \u2013 maybe not even that; 8% in CapEx and you'll get pretty close.","Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research","Thank you.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Right. Thanks, Ryan.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Doug, I think on the cash flow you also meant to include the dividend expense. But I had two cleanup questions for you. First of all, on tax credits, maybe this is poor note taking but from your management meeting earlier this year, I had $550 million by 2021. So, maybe that excluded 2018 or the number hasn't changed, I guess, is what I want to confirm.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","It might have been bad note taking on whoever's notes you were copying.","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","No, I wasn't copying. It's a bad note taking on my part, so.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","All right. I just didn't want -","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","No.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Also, (31:36) I think that Ryan's question on the \u2013 when we talk about free cash flow, yes, we do pay a dividend, but that comes back to our shareholders. So, free cash flow for acquisition, yes, you would deduct the dividend then but...","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Well, in the past when you've provided free cash flow guidance, you have included the dividend as a takeaway. It's nitpicking. The other cleanup question, then I have a question. The cleanup question around M&A. And I know you're not going to opine on your competitors, but it does seem like Brown & Brown and your company has had a little more success in 2018 through the first half in closing transactions than the year ago comparison. And I'm curious if the private equity component or the other buyers in the marketplace are having less success or if you can have any opinion around that.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah. I think we are having more success because I think that people are understanding that life after the sale can be better with a strategic than a PE. I think there is an awareness that's developing on there that what sounds good when you're signing the document might not necessarily sound so well.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Who's got their phone on?","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's not \u2013 it's not me.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Sorry. I don't know where that must have come through the operator has done, but...","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Well, Doug, just a follow-up...","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Hold on, guys. Just standby. We're just...","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","That's all right. I think we've got two phones in this room and one of them is ringing. So, standby. (33:22) get it shut off. All right. There we go, we hope. Sorry about that.","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's okay. So, we were talking about the M&A environment. And you were saying you're having a little more success compared to the PEs. I'm wondering, I know within the tax law, there was an effect on detectability of interest. Do you think that's come into play a little bit?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","I don't think so, yet. I think there's a lot of good merger partners. Each of them have an appetite, they may fit better with Brown, they may fit better with Gallagher and they may fit better with PE. So, I would say that it might be just there's more opportunities that are out there. And also I think that we're doing a really good job of showing how life after the signing of the documents can be really terrific at Gallagher when you see our capabilities. So, I think that's probably the reason why.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Doug's right on, Greg. This is Pat. I was on a panel not too long ago with one of the main consulting firms in the space. And if you want to cross that stage, there were five very different philosophies. Acrisure has probably done twice as many acquisitions this year as we have. And they just have a completely different philosophy than we do. So that I think the real test or the real trick is making sure like in any sales environment, you get to enough people and you find a fit and you build some excitement.","And also, remember, our closings can be lumpy. We'll have a string like we've had this year which is great, which we already have purchased more revenue this year than we did in the full year last year. And those are people we didn't start talking to a month ago. So, I wouldn't want to make it sound like we're doing better than the competition.","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the clarity on those two cleanup questions. So, I'm sitting here watching on the screen and today it was off a little bit, but the remarkable success of this newly minted \"insurance broker Goosehead.\" And I know at your management meeting you spoke about a growing business that you acquired, Pronto. And I was wondering if you could provide us an update on what's going on there at Pronto and what your outlook is for that business. And that was my principal question.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Right. By the way, thanks for bringing up Pronto. For those that may not know is our business in Texas, Florida and California that serves the non-standard auto market, primarily Spanish language customers and we have an operating model that's very similar than we have at storefronts as a consumer product. We provide service very quickly. We provide at a fairly priced and it is growing very well. Now, we've only had it for a few months now, or for really about 40 days, I think it is, as my memories here, but we think it's a terrific opportunity. Actually I think that Goosehead trading shows the value there is in brokers and in distribution. So, we'd sure like to see a multiple like that on our EBITDA.","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So, just as a cleanup on the Goosehead or the Pronto situation, I think you said at your management meeting, it was about a $100 million of annualized revenue. And as it's growing from the date you bought, you're not accounting for that as organic growth, it's acquired growth until the transaction anniversaries, correct?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Right.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Actually and I believe that our organic growth is consistently understated, because when we buy somebody, if they go out and sell something in that first year that doesn't ever count in our organic. We've talked about that a lot at our Investor Days.","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you for the answers.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks, Greg.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Hughes from SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Good afternoon.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Hi, Mark.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hello, Pat. Your investment income was good in this quarter. Was anything usual there or is that sustainable?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","I think make sure that you back out the book gains on that, Mark. I'd have to look at what you're looking at, but that's where we put. If we sell off a little book of business, I think on an adjusted basis, get that I think is pretty dead flat quarter-over-quarter for last year.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thanks for that. Did the cash that you paid for acquisitions in the quarter, did you say that?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Say again?","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","You have the amount of cash that you paid for the acquisitions in the quarter?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","I don't have that, sorry, in front of me.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And then, you talked about the insurance carrier business growing nicely within risk management. Any observations there? Is there a bigger theme of carriers outsourcing claims or are you just taking share?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","No, I think there's a bigger theme. I think people are realizing that a couple things, we can help carriers enter a market, where they don't have to build a bunch of infrastructure to be able to underwrite. We can help carriers enter a new line same point not having to back it up with infrastructure and boots on the ground. And then also, we believe that we're getting more and more proof of the concept that if you'll outsource to Gallagher Bassett, your claim outcomes will be better. And so that's one of our fastest growing areas and that's on a global basis. So, I think it's an exciting play for us.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And finally, you talked about the claims count is growing a little faster than last year. Any observations about inflation, do you think there's some inflation building up in the system?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","I don't. I think what you've got is, just as people go back to three shifts, you get more claims.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Very good. Thank you.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Glasspiegel from Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Good afternoon, everyone.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Hi, Bob.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Hi, Pat. On the acquisition front, you're seeing a pickup from last year's pace, Brown & Brown did as well from a smaller pace. Is it possible that the levelizing on the tax rate versus PE is starting to make a difference or am I stretching on that?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","You're stretching.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah, I think you're stretching a little bit at this point.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","What do you think, you're just hitting on some or it's just random noise?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah, it's lumpy, Bob. We've seen this for 100 years. We had a real good run in the first half. Every quarter, I tell you, our pipeline is outstanding. I mean, the pipeline is truly outstanding. And I've mentioned the fact that most of these that we're buying are run by baby boomers. You and I aren't getting any younger. And so, capitalizing your life's work and bringing your next generation into a place where they can have a career path, I mean, there's a lot of people thinking this way. I talked to a merger partner today, that was incredibly excited. And the thing he's probably mostly excited about is bringing his son into a firm where he knew he had a great potential career opportunity. He's towards the end of his career and his son was a big driver in the deal. So, I see that, over and over again, doesn't mean that there's anything wrong with the PE approach and they're a very good competition, but it's lumpy.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Pat, you're able to work my age twice into that answer, well played.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thank you, Bob.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","The...","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","I'm always trying to be the nice guy here, you know.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Thanks. So, you're back from London. A lot going on there between Brexit\/euro, tariff battles which may or may not be solved. But what's the overall feel for the economy there? I mean, you gave a pretty optimistic outlook for what's going on in the U.S., but what are the Brits saying about the world?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","It's interesting because there's more consternation now than there was a year ago. A year ago, Brexit is going to happen it's going to be okay, we'll make a trade deal with Europe. My English friends when I have a chance to sit around and talk about what this means they have some real concerns, because their fear is that Europe basically wants to say if you want the free trade then follow our rules.","Well, if they follow their rules and do the Brexit then they don't have any even any representation at the rulemaking table. So, I think there is concern and where are you going to be located and how are you going to trade in Europe? Now, we don't have a huge European trade nor does Lloyd's have a really huge European trade, but we will be making sure that we're set up properly in Europe, Lloyd's is going to do that. The financial services industry I think has got some real concerns. So, it's a different picture than a year ago for sure.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","So, slower growth but no recession is that sort of the expectations in UK?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","I'm not an economist. I would say, still London is booming. So, when you're over there like, I'd do many times, don't get out of the city, you leave the UK thinking, My God, this place is on fire. But, I've been told if you get up out of the city and into England and Wales and Scotland that it is a bit slow.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Thank you.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Hey, good afternoon, gentlemen.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Hi, Mike.","Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse","I guess a follow-up on Bob's last question. There was a management change overseas. Anything we should think into that in regards to the transition or I don't know anything that was unexpected or planned because I believe the leader is still kind of working for a subsidiary that you guys have a partial interest in?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","That's exactly right. So, you recall we had a bit of a departure 3.5 years ago. Grahame Chilton, Chily, stepped into the role of CEO for us. He was the Founder along with his other founders of Capsicum Re. So, he handed the baton on Capsicum Re to the associate and stepped in. That was always meant to be temporary. We have announced that Simon Matson as of this fall will take over the leadership, the CEO role. And I'll tell you what, it's been a very, very smooth transition already. And Chily is not going anywhere, he'll be back basically full-time at Capsicum. And I believe we'll see him as a part of the team in various roles for many, many years ahead.","Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Okay. Great. That's helpful. Next organic growth in risk management clearly has been tremendous. It also seems to come somewhat in waves or maybe streaky as Doug mentioned earlier. Can you remind us the equation in terms of the operating leverage in that segment? I don't think it's the same 3.5% to 4% that you guys speak to overall, but I could be wrong. So, it doesn't seem like there's been as much margin improvement there as maybe I would have expected.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah. It's not as leverage business on that. And we've said in the past, you really go back and we've probably discussed it in a couple of years. But you got to be above 5% to get margin expansion in that business. And maybe that's closer to 6% now with a little bit of wage inflation. So, it's not quite as heavily geared as \u2013 favorably geared as the brokerage segment.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","It's also a segment that has to have an awful lot of tech investment. You're constantly building out your tech offerings, everything wants to go mobile now, everything's got to be on every device. There's always a big spin in that.","Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse","So, the CapEx for this segment would be, I don't know, 2x the rest of the segment or is there kind of a high level way to...?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","No, I wouldn't say that. I would say a proportion to revenues, it might be running more like, let's say, 3%, 4% versus what we're spending as 2% in the brokerage side, something like that.","Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Okay. Got it. And lastly, I've a high level kind of force in the trees question on M&A. I know the pipeline is strong, you guys have done an excellent job integrating and this year has been stronger. I also recall you've said in the past that you've increased the like maybe number of feet on the ground, or people on that team. But there are kind of a lot of shovels in the sandbox per se. And I'm just curious if we think about longer term beyond the next one, two, three years you guys have doubled in size as well over the past five years. So, is there a point in time where the opportunities aren't going to be able to kind of feed the engine as much?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Well, I mean, number one, we're getting bigger all the time. And if you take a look at business insurances article from the broker issue from this July, the number 100th largest broker in the United States did $28 million in total revenue in 2017. Now, one of the most prominent consultants in our business says that he believes there are 39,000 agents and brokers in America, that's America that's not globally and that's not people, that's firms.","He also believes that for everyone that gets consolidated another one starts, so that there is a never-ending supply. And I think that he's probably accurate, which means that there is 38,900 brokers and agents across America that do less than $28 million. So the supply and the fragmentation of the market is absolutely \u2013 it's unquenchable, but for as far forward as you can see, we will not have a lack of supply.","Now, we'll have to figure out a way to continue to ramp up the numbers to continue to move the needle because at $5 billion, $4 billion whatever, it's harder to move the needle on $2 million and $3 million and $4 million deals, but they're out there. Our pipeline is phenomenal. And we are continually adding to that pipeline. So, I just don't see any insight.","Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Okay, great. Plenty of runway. That's right thought. Thanks and nice quarter.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Well, thanks.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Just couple of questions. First on the M&A front. So, can you give us a sense of what kind of maybe margin headwind M&A creates when it's brought on and may be how long it takes to get the margins through to the company standards, specifically for brokerage?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah. Yaron, I said earlier, I don't believe that we're buying businesses at this point that are margin dilutive. They can have quarterly seasonality, but when you look at an annual basis, they run margins that are similar to ours. And one of the reasons why that is, we typically don't buy turnarounds, we don't buy dying books of business, we don't buy retirements, we try to merge with people that earn money for their own family so that when they join our family, they earn money for our family, right. It's just that if they can't make money to pay for their own food, they're not going to do very well at the community dinner table.","And so that's important for us. And so, it doesn't move the needle one way or another except for maybe has some quarterly seasonality. If you go back when we did some of the acquisitions in Australia and New Zealand, there was some significant quarterly seasonality in their earnings. And so, you'll find that from time to time, even in smaller brokerage, but not on an annual basis.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Many times, their margins are accretive.","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So, I guess, maybe going back if I can, to Doug's comment, so does that explain why you're only calling out the third quarter as a potentially margin headwind from the two acquisitions that you mentioned?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah. I think that I've looked at it and I think that there's 20 to 30 basis points margin compression on that from those in the third quarter. And it's not integration. Most of the deals, the mergers that we do, there's very little integration cost to them.","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And that seasonality then would still continue into out years as well, right?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah, sometimes, it will. The other thing too is if we move customers to different renewal dates as they change their mix of business, it tends to level out with time too.","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And the other question I have was just on the cash tax rate, which I think is a little bit lower, the number you offered were a little bit lower than previous estimates you gave. And I was just curious as to what brought that cash rate down?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","State the question again, the cash tax rate on the taxes as if...","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah. So, I think you were talking about 3% to 5% for the next couple years, and then maybe 6% to 9% beyond that. And I think in the past you talked about 5% and 8%.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah. I think that here's the reason why: in the earlier years, we get a refund of AMT credits. So credits that we were not going to receive in cash until, let's say, 2027 or 2028 are going to be refunded to us over the next couple years. So that will drive it down earlier. And then, just as our EBITDA grows in the future, we'll have more taxable income and basically the same amount of credit. So the rate will actually creep up a little bit. But between AMT rate and just the growth in our business, that's what will contribute to getting that. And I see that in that, like I said, in that 6% to 9%, 7% to 9% range for at least five, six, seven years afterwards.","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you very much.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks, Yaron.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman from Balyasny. Please proceed with your question.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Hi. Thanks. I actually had a couple numbers question, but, first if I can just follow up on the question from Yaron about the acquisitions. I guess, Pat, it was surprising a little bit about saying that you buy things that have similar margins to you. You've talked a number of times over recent years about the capabilities you can bring now as you've gotten bigger, essentially letting you in my words, I don't think these are yours, but run circles around these smaller brokers. And I would have thought that those advantages, which I think make a lot of sense, would mean that you have much higher margins in them. So, can you just help me reconcile that? I guess I got a little confused by that.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah. I think you're thinking about it for the opposite sense is that most of the time when we buy a smaller broker, they may have been underinvesting in their resources and capabilities. So, it's kind of the opposite side of the thought process there. And typically when we come in, our benefit plans might be better, our expectation of using more robust technologies and more secure technologies may put costs into the structure to them a little bit. Second thing is, is that we'll expect them to do interns, maybe have producer hirers if they weren't willing to do. So, it moderates a little bit higher. Underinvested margin will be pulled down with some investment into those businesses.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Okay. But then the growth that you can bring them allows them to leverage back up and recapture that spending and maintain the margin basically.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","That's right.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Okay. Got it. Now I'm with you. Okay. So, Doug, I had a couple of numbers ones. Just one, I might be doing something really dumb, but I'm just having hard time. When I look at the brokerage segment adjusted EBITDA, it's greater than the reported EBITDA, right? But when I look at the adjusted EPS on page 1, it is less than the reported EPS for brokerage. What am I missing?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","All right. Let me see if I can track to your question on page 1. Where are you looking at? I'm sorry, just trying to track to it.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Yeah, so the brokerage shows adjusted earnings of $0.67 versus reported of $0.68.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Right? So, it looks like there were negative adjustments. But when you go to the EBITDA page for brokerage, the adjusted EBITDA is a few million higher than the reported, or it just seems like there's something else that's negative that I can't find, so I can't get model to square.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah. You have the non-cash items primarily the change in acquisition earn-outs that we adjust out. Those will not impact EBITDA.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Got it. Okay. So there's adjusted earn-out.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Right, right.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Okay. Okay. I'll go back and look at that again. And the other one on a sort of a similar note is, can you just explain for me one more time because I think I forgot the explanation from last quarter, and I just couldn't quite get it this quarter. Trying to juggle a bunch of releases here is \u2013 the tax reform impact through corporate, what exactly is causing that and why is it going through corporate and not allocated?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","All right. So, this is, first of all, the biggest one that's coming through there is the theoretical repatriation of earnings that causes a guilty tax or an elimination of a foreign tax credit. So, (56:14) all those. So that would be, in theory if we repatriate money, any of the tax related impacts of treasury management or moving moneys around the world we capture in the corporate or corporate segment. And what we do is we fully tax the brokerage and risk management segment at the statutory rates in those countries that produce the income. And also, we don't allocate the credits up into the brokerage and risk management space even though that's really the income that's benefiting. So, if we went out and bought annuity bonds and we weren't paying tax on that, you'd have a lower tax rate in the brokerage and risk management segment. So we kind of penalize ourselves there.","These items $4 million a quarter, something like that, they're peanuts and will offset our tax credits on it. And so, it's just they giveth on the rate and they taketh away a little bit on some of the deductions.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","And as you said, now you said it will continue in the second half, is it just the 2018 thing or is this a permanent thing we should put in our models?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","No, I think you should put $4 million a quarter in for this going forward, and that's a book expense, it won't change our cash taxes paid, but that might be a good estimate about going forward.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Right. Got it. Perfect. Thank you for the help.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","The first two quarters were a little heavier because of some tweaking we did to our initial December 31 balance sheet estimates because of the tax reform, but going forward, if you assume $4 million a quarter you won't be too far off.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Makes sense. Thank you so much.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","The true sum is more like $3 million in the second half of this year.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","All right. Thanks.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks, Ian.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Just a couple of quick ones. I guess, Pat, you talked about workers' compensation rate decreases and an acceleration of growth in claims filings. I'm trying to think of that asset. Is that a problem for the workers' compensation carriers, it's not Gallagher's, (00:58:14) question?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Well, I mean, our claim counts are up. But no I don't think it's a problem for the carriers because with the robust economy, they're getting more exposure units as well. So, as they're collecting more premium, their claim accounts are going to rise as well, but that doesn't necessarily lead to any greater extent of severity. And the results of the workers' comp line have been solid. And so, that always draws in more competition.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Yeah. Absolutely true. Okay. Second and this is more of an (00:58:45) question. Or sorry. When we look forward to wage inflation or operating expense inflation, is that picking up? Should we model slightly higher growth rates for those going forward?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","There is wage inflation out there that's happening, especially in some of the highly skilled service layers and professional layers. In our case, because we have over the last 13 years made such a significant commitment to our offshore centers of excellence. We can control that by continuing to shift to our associates in those centers of excellence. So, we do have a little bit of a safety valve on that. But it is something that we look at, replacement hires can be a little higher than those that exit. And also just the annual raise or if we give raise on 12 months or 14 months or 15 months, that is slightly higher this year than it has been in previous years.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Full employment does have an impact.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","I mean, there's no question that we've talked forever about the war for talent and we're talking about that around this table a lot.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah. We didn't have that if you're doing 5.5% organic growth you probably have higher margin expansion than the 80 basis points.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks, Meyer.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John (sic) [Josh] (01:00:18) Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good evening, everybody. Thanks for fitting me in.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Hey, Josh.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I just want to follow on a couple questions that cap it off a lot, let's talk about acquisitions and fragmentation and you compete with people who are smaller than you and whatnot. One of your competitors announced a very large transaction earlier this morning, they confirmed it. And I think they bought the 33rd or 32nd biggest insurance company and brokerage in the United States. And you talk about always the companies that are smaller than you because they just can't compete. Why do you need to buy the companies that can't compete? Can't you just take the business over time and buy back your shares and take the business? What are the barriers to taking that business? Look, you guys did 7% organic growth this quarter, and then taking business just fine. How should I think about those two things?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Because the brokerage business is a very relationship-driven business. And these guys and gals that we buy have terrific \u2013 the reasons they exist is because they can convince those owners of businesses that they can do the job for them. And this business is fragmented because that works. So, when we buy someone, remember we're getting two things, yes, we are getting revenue stream or getting an earnings stream. But as Doug likes to say all the time in front of our team, we're getting great resources. We're getting people that have thought folks like us and have been able to win.","And so, these firms that come up for sale and don't make any bones about it, we're out there telling them they should be thinking about selling to us all the time. We're creating some of the demand, but they come up once and they're gone. So, you take the likes of a Wortham, the brand recognition, the strength of that franchise, my hat's off to Marsh, it was a great acquisition and we'll do that thing all day.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah. The other thing to, Josh, is, if we're buying it at 7.5 times versus just buying our own shares back at 12 times, I'm not saying our shares are overvalued, don't interpret that, but there is an arbitrage here. And the other thing too is when you get a really great broker that comes in, they'll pick up more customers because of our capabilities then next thing they're trading with our other organizations around the globe. If we just buy in a share of Gallagher stock, that share of stock sits on the shelf and it doesn't produce another piece of business ever, it never grows, the gearing just doesn't, we model both ways. Just buying the shares back does not produce greater shareholder value than buying smaller brokers at an arbitrage and then having them grow. And so, you can model that out yourself, it works.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right. And then, one thing actually it's probably impossible to quantify about try, if you look at the market of opportunity for you in the United States, what percentage of the market out there is being controlled by a broker who is offering something differentiated to their client versus the market that's just there for the taking, they just haven't met the right broker yet?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","60% is not offering a distinguished product.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That was easier than I thought.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah. We do some work around here every once in a while. So, that's our guess.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much. Congratulations on a great quarter.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thank you. John. Any other questions?","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Great. Then, let me make just a few brief wrap up comments here. As we said at the beginning, we had a terrific second quarter and a great first half to 2018. This is a direct result of the hard work and dedication from all of our employees across the globe. 2018 should be another great year for Gallagher as we execute on our strategy to create sustainable shareholder value.","We will grow organically. We will grow through mergers and acquisitions. We will work to improve our productivity and quality, and we will promote our unique culture fulfilling our mission statement guided by the 25 tenants of the Gallagher Way.

Patrick Gallagher, Chairman, President and CEO of Arthur J Gallagher & Co. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thank you, Donna. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. With me this morning is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions. As we do each quarter, today Doug and I going to touch on the four key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value. Those are: number one, organic growth; number two, growing the business through mergers and acquisitions; number three, improving our productivity and quality; and fourth, maintaining our unique Gallagher culture. The team executed on all for this quarter and for the entire year and I believe we are well-positioned to build upon 2016\u2019s success. I am very pleased with how the year turned out.","Let me talk first about brokerage organic growth. Fourth quarter organic growth was 3.6% all in, right in line with our full year result. Domestically we saw about 3.5% organic growth in the fourth quarter with retail property casualty up a little more than 3.5% and wholesale and benefits up a little less. Property casualty rates continue to be a slight headwind offset somewhat by exposure growth. Combined rate and exposure reduced our domestic PC brokerage organic by about a point.","Internationally brokerage organic growth was 3.7%. Australia and New Zealand were up over 4%, Canada up 2% and our UK and Bermuda operations up around 4%, and this is in spite of rates that were softer internationally. This is great work by our domestic and international teams and highlights our outstanding sales and service culture that does make Gallagher so unique. Our global PC brokerage businesses are working well together and our niche focus continues to provide clients with the highest quality advice, insights and solutions. Combine that with our outstanding post-sale service and it\u2019s easy to see the tremendous value we are providing our clients.","Our employee benefits business is perfectly positioned to help our clients navigate perhaps their most difficult challenges: how to attract and retain competitive workforce and also control their total benefit costs. We recently published a survey of over 3,000 companies and we have expertise and resources very well aligned to help them navigate an uncertain and rapidly changing healthcare industry. Okay, to wrap up my organic comments, when I look forward I am seeing an environment much like 2016, so right now 2017 organic feels like it will be similar to 2016.","Next let me move to merger and acquisition growth. We completed nine acquisitions this quarter at fair multiples representing about $40 million of annualized revenue. Merger and acquisition activity during the second half of 2016 was a little slower than normal as several sellers chose to close in early 2017 in hopes of tax reform. This is why we\u2019ve already closed five mergers for about $32 million of revenue here in January. Normally we see a lull in activity during the first quarter but that has not been the case so far in 2017.","In addition, our merger and acquisition pipeline remains robust with about $200 million of revenues associated with about 40 term sheets either agreed-upon, issued or being prepared. Not all these transactions will close, but I feel good about our ability to attract acquisition partners in our typical small tuck-in size at fair prices. Our merger partners see our vast capabilities, believe in our unique culture and realize they can be more successful together.","I would like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. So how do we do for the year in our brokerage segment? 9% total adjusted revenue growth of which 3.6% is organic. Adjusted EBITDAC growth of 11%; adjusted EBITDAC margin was 26.9%, expanding 43 basis points from 2015. So for the past three years we\u2019ve posted over 3.5% annual organic growth and expanded adjusted EBITDAC margins every year. I have to give it to the brokerage team, that\u2019s three years in a row of really awesome performance.","Next I would like to move to our risk management segment which is primarily Gallagher Bassett. Fourth quarter organic growth was 2.9%, a nice improvement from our third quarter and year-to-date results. Adjusted EBITDAC margins expanded 42 basis points to 17.9% as our expense discipline allowed us to beat our margin expectation of 17.2% for the quarter. For the year, we delivered positive organic and were able to expand our adjusted EBITDAC margin by a few basis points. Taken in the context of the headwinds from claim count growth and lower international performance bonus fees, I feel these results were really good results.","Going forward we believe our 2017 organic growth will show improvement over 2016 as net new business wins fully make their way into our results and performance bonus fees rebound. We have an outstanding differentiated value proposition and we believe we can continue to deliver superior claim outcomes and help our clients manage and mitigate their total cost of risk.","Moving to clean energy, nearly $115 million of net after-tax earnings; what an amazing run since 2011 when we posted just $4 million of net earnings. And you\u2019ll hear Doug talk about another step up in 2017.","And finally our culture. This year marks our 90th anniversary and we continue to work very hard to ensure that 90 years of building a rock solid foundation of ethics and culture is not just lip service. We believe it; we embody it; we promote it every day. And for the last five years running we\u2019ve been recognized as one of the world\u2019s most ethical companies by the Ethisphere Institute.","Okay, I think a great quarter, an excellent year, and I will stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?","Doug Howell","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. Like Pat said, what an excellent way to close out a terrific year. Today I\u2019m going to provide my typical commentary on modeling, margins, clean energy, cash capital management and I will close with some comments on tax reform. First to the CFO commentary document which is posted on our Investors website. Let me point out a few items as you model 2017. First, we\u2019ve provided our guess on the impact from foreign currency exchange rates on both revenue and EPS. Based on current FX rates we expect some brokerage segment revenue headwinds in the first half of 2017 but not much in the second half, which translates into a couple pennies a quarter of EPS impact in the first and second quarter, but again not much in the second half.","Also when modeling 2017 brokerage revenues you should first adjust prior-year revenues for the impact of FX and then apply your pick for organic growth. Next you should then add your estimate for rollover M&A revenues that we have completed in 2016 and thus far in 2017. We give you our estimate on Page 5 of the CFO commentary. Finally you should then make a pick for new M&A revenue that might come from future mergers in 2017, but also remember to assume a mid-to-late quarter closing pattern. If you model revenues in this order is to get you pretty close.","Also when doing your quarterly models please don\u2019t forget that we have significant quarterly seasonality in our brokerage segment. The best place to see that is on Page 5 of the supplemental quarterly financial document we also post on our Investor website. You\u2019ll see that we historically earn about 20% of our brokerage segment annual earnings in the first quarter, then about 30% in the second, then about 25% in the third and the fourth quarters. As for the risk management segment, we really don\u2019t have that much seasonality other than performance bonus income.","All right, let me move on to margins. Adjusted brokerage EBITDAC margin expanded 31 basis points in the quarter. That\u2019s great work by the team as we continue to focus on quality and productivity improvements across our global brokerage business. Looking forward we still see areas around the globe of margin improvement opportunities, but please remember: expanding margins organic below 3% is very difficult to do. Also, we are basically finished with integrating our large brokerage mergers from 2014 other than some small projects internationally. So integration costs in 2017 should only be about a $0.01 a quarter, which is in line with our initial thinking from our December investor meeting. I\u2019m extremely proud of the folks for posting solid organic growth even while pulling double duty working through integration.","Moving to the risk management segment, adjusted EBITDAC margin of 17.9s above our expectation of 17.2%. This was really good work by the team and shows excellent discipline in our cost control efforts. Looking towards 2017, we still expect our risk management margins to push towards 17.5% for the full year.","Finally, I hope you enjoyed hearing from our global Chief Customer Service officer at our December Investor Day. We have made truly amazing progress in improving our service quality and our productivity here in the USA and also in London. We know that those learnings can help deliver similar success elsewhere in the UK as well as Canada and Australia. That said, it will take a lot of hard work here in 2017 to be able to start realizing the benefits in 2018.","Moving to clean energy, we had a solid fourth quarter and for the year we delivered on our expectations of about 15% earnings growth. Looking towards 2017, you will see on page 3 of the CFO commentary that the midpoint of our range for 2017 clean energy net earnings would be about another 10% step up over 2016.","And don\u2019t forget we have about $480 million of credits on our balance sheet, which is effectively a receivable from the government that will help us reduce our future cash taxes paid for many years to come. As for cash, we have about $225 million of available cash and we continue to unlock cash from our bank account consolidation efforts.","As I looked towards 2017 two cash headwinds, integration as I discussed earlier and building our new home office building, are practically behind us. You will see in the CFO commentary that we will have some one-time move and lease termination charges in 2017 as we move our headquarters, but other than that it\u2019s all behind us.","As for stock, we used about 100,000 shares in M&A this quarter, but recall we pre-bought those shares midyear. So how did we do for the year? We issue just under 2 million for mergers during 2016 and we bought back 2.3 million shares, so net down about 300,000 shares related to M&A this year. Thus far in 2017, we haven\u2019t used any shares and as I look at our 2017 cash flow projections, we think that we can fund deals with cash and debt.","Finally some comments on possible tax reform in the U.S. While there are countless proposals, and frankly I don\u2019t think anybody really knows what\u2019s going to happen, we took a shot at providing one pro-forma scenario on page 6 of the CFO commentary document. We took 2016 and computed our pro forma earnings assuming the U.S. federal corporate tax rate drops to 20% and related AMT is eliminated. This is just one simple scenario but it does show that our core adjusted brokerage and risk management EPS could increase 18% and be up 10% in total Company adjusted EPS.","Additionally, in this scenario please know that there would be a non-cash write-off of our deferred tax assets of about $25 million, but we like the looks of an 18% and 10% step up in adjusted EPS. We hope that you find this disclosure helpful as you evaluate potential changes, if any, to the U.S. Tax Code.","So Pat, those are my comments. A great quarter, an excellent year and, more importantly, we are really well-positioned coming into 2017. Back to you.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thank you, Doug. Before we go to questions and answers I would like to make just one comment. Marsha Akin of our Investor Relations department retired after 36 years with Gallagher and we will miss Marsha and wish her well in her retirement. I know many of you on this call are familiar with and have worked with Marsha for years.","Donna, would you go ahead and open it up for questions, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The call is now open for question. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Kai Pan","Thank you and good morning.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Good morning, Kai.","Kai Pan","Good morning. We will miss Marsha too. So my first question on the organic growth. Clearly for the full-year 3.6% is above your original sort of guidance between 2.5% and 3.5%. If you look beneath it, you look at your supplement and contingents, it\u2019s actually growing very fast, like 15%, 16% year-over-year. I just wonder what\u2019s behind that and should we expect it going forward?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Well, in terms of the supplementals and contingents, I think that\u2019s indicative of the kind of work were doing for our clients, frankly. I mean, it\u2019s indicative of the fact that we are growing nicely with carriers and that\u2019s profitable growth with very good customers. And we work very hard to make sure that the carriers compensate us for the work that we are doing and I think it shows in those numbers.","Also, remember when we do acquisitions, Kai, we bring in people that don\u2019t necessarily have the same arrangements with carriers that we have and that improves those results once they are part of Gallagher.","Doug Howell","To add onto that \u2013 it\u2019s a good question. I think that we are doing a lot of work on product development, product enhancement, analytics that really develop a better product for the customers and the carriers are recognizing that. And also I think that there is something that\u2019s important I have said before. It\u2019s a little bit of a blurred line at times between a supplemental and a base commission.","If you look at \u2013 if we get an enhanced commission in the field that would be considered base commission. If that comes in over the top directly from the carrier let\u2019s say to the region or to the corporate offices, that would be referred to as supplemental. But it\u2019s basically arriving from the same behavior, delivering a better product to the customer and the carrier is recognizing that that service has additional value.","J. Patrick Gallagher","I think the contingents and supplementals, Kai, will grow as we continue to do acquisitions, not at the pace they have in the last couple years.","Kai Pan","Okay. Then back on that, how much of the 43 basis points of margin improvement in 2016 do you think is coming from the contribution from the contingents?","Doug Howell","I think a big piece of that. If you look at where we are having nice margin expansion \u2013 the U.S., we are getting a lot of margin expansion from our units there. Those have done a lot of work already to improve margins kind of to the upper range. And we are getting margin expansion from our international operations too as we integrate the larger deals.","Kai Pan","Great. My last question is on the deal side. You have a strong start for 2017 and also in the marketplace you have recently saw some pretty decent-sized deals, including some potential deals. I just wonder, given that the large deal you had done in 2014 is fully integrated, does that change your, like, outlook or appetite for acquisitions going forward?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Well, first of all, Kai, what we are seeing in the pricing environment, for larger transactions that would either be considered a platform transaction or the selling out of a rollup, those multiples are at levels we don\u2019t like. And so we would certainly not shy away from a large deal if we thought we could price it and if we thought the culture fit, but we are very happy with the deals in our pipeline now which are very much in line with what you saw in 2016.","Doug Howell","There is nothing in our pipeline right now that I would view as a larger deal.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Correct.","Kai Pan","Great. Thank you so much for all the answers. Good luck.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Kai.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good morning.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Good morning.","Elyse Greenspan","I was hoping to spend a little bit more time \u2013 just some color on the organic. The pickup that you guys saw in Australia and New Zealand this quarter really just about \u2013 you said that was above 4%. Was there anything there, I guess, that would cause you to think that that might not continue when we think about 2017? And then just in your outlook for 2017, I guess, how do you see the organic components domestic versus internationally? Do you think that they will both maintain at about 3.5% growth?","J. Patrick Gallagher","I think, as you saw in my formal comments, we think 2017 all in will look like 2016. So I\u2019m hoping that we can maintain greater than 3% as you roll it all together. Australia and New Zealand just had a terrific year. I think we shared with you that Australia, when we did the large deal in 2014, had a base commission and fee that was actually declining. It was declining a small amount but was in fact in negative territory.","New Zealand has always been in very positive territory. Our team in Australia is done a terrific job over the last two years and we are now in positive territory in Australia and New Zealand continues to kill it. So I think again, when you average that back into what\u2019s happening domestically, I\u2019m pretty comfortable hoping that we stay in the 3.5% area.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, thank you. And then in terms of the margin outlook, I know you guys said today what you historically say about 3% or so organic and you can expand your margins. So you are pointing to about 3.5% organic or so for 2017. And then I know you guys have spoken about your efforts to improve some of your international margins just away from the organic as you integrate some of those larger deals. So as we think about the potential for margin expansion can we think about it coming from, A, just exceeding the 3% organic level and then, B, some of the improvements to the international operations? And how do you just kind of see that all coming together in 2017?","Doug Howell","Right. Good question. I think the margin expansion, it\u2019s going to be both. I think organic over 3% will contribute some. And I think as we do some of our improvement efforts, we\u2019ve talked about improving efforts in Australia. There\u2019s a little bit in Canada and in our UK retail space. If you look at those businesses they are all still in the lower- to mid-20%s when it comes to margins, so we have maybe 3, 4 points on each of those businesses. Australia remember is a $100 million business; Canada is a $100 million business; and our UK retail space is a $350 million business. So you add 3 points on that on maybe $500 million of revenue there might be $15 million more margin lift opportunities there.","And then if you have organic over 3% you might be able to harvest maybe 40% of that, 35% of that of the incremental amount, but that\u2019s really the nature of the margin expansion that we are seeing here. Again, we\u2019ve got some nice continuous improvement efforts that we are doing that might bear some fruit in 2018, but that\u2019s the dimension of margin expansion that we are seeing in this environment right now.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. And then just one last question. You did point to the pickup in deal activity in the first quarter and multiples seem about in line with what you saw in 2016. Are you seeing I guess some sellers potentially either looking for higher multiples, or waiting just given the uncertainty around the U.S. corporate tax reform?","Doug Howell","Yes, there\u2019s two things. There\u2019s an interesting dynamic there. I think that the sellers that really are interested in staying in the business want to do the right thing for their employees, continue to work hard and sell insurance and really recognize our capabilities. They are really looking at \u2013 they are willing to sell for fair multiples. And what I mean by fair is somewhere between 7 times and 9 times. When you\u2019re looking for someone that\u2019s really interested in taking the money and running there\u2019s multiples out there they can get a lot higher than that. So what we are doing is we are looking for folks that have good agencies, good brokerages; they know how to make money already; they\u2019ve got nice margin; they are interested in staying in the business. And they understand \u2013 and Pat uses this all the time \u2013 that 1 plus 1 can equal 3, 4 and 5. And that\u2019s the folks we are looking for. But there is pressure on pushing multiples up out there. But there\u2019s \u2013 we are trying to do 60 deals, nice tuck-in deals a year. There\u2019s 60 folks out there that we are better together than what they are independent. So that\u2019s the folks we are looking for and the pipeline is full of them.","J. Patrick Gallagher","And I think Doug hit on it. The pipeline, it never ceases to amaze me just how incredible this business is. One source estimates there\u2019s 30,000 agents and brokers in America. And if you think about that, in business insurances number 100 last year did $25 million in revenue. So somehow there\u2019s possibly 29,900 firms that are smaller than $25 million. And most of these firms have baby boomers at the helm. So there is no shortage of opportunities for us to find great people. I call every one of these merger partners and, I will tell you, they are all excited to come aboard because I call it the candy store. Once we let them in the candy store they know they\u2019ve got a lot more to sell.","Elyse Greenspan","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Josh Shanker","Yes. Good morning, Doug, Pat, Ray. And I\u2019m really sad that Marsha is not on the call, but...","J. Patrick Gallagher","She\u2019s listening \u2013 I know she\u2019s listening.","Josh Shanker","All right, all right.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Give her a shout out, she\u2019ll love it.","Josh Shanker","We love her. But \u2013 so three questions; they are all kind of interrelated. One, how does strong dollar affect your ability to make acquisitions in the newer regions that you are in? Is that a positive? Do people want dollars or Gallagher shares? Two, I noticed the acquisitions so far done in 2017 appear to have been done for cash, not stock with you going back and buying back the stock later. I\u2019m wondering if the appetites are changing. And three, there\u2019s a lot of news out there about USI coming up for sale. Just wondering how USI\u2019s appetite differs from the type of stuff that you write and whether or not USI in the hands of a different owner is a different threat to the Gallagher model?","Doug Howell","Let me talk about the strong dollar \u2013 well let me hit cash versus stock.","J. Patrick Gallagher","You take one and two; I will take three.","Doug Howell","It\u2019s great. Cash and stock, we didn\u2019t use any net stock in deals in 2016 and we don\u2019t expect to do that in 2017. And that would allow us to do about $750 million of acquisitions in 2017 without using shares. Now if a person wants shares because \u2013 for tax planning or they want shares, we will give them the shares and we will buy them back in the marketplace. And we have and 8 million share authorization buyback that\u2019s on the shelf, so we have plenty of room there. How do we feel about the strong dollar? One of the things to realize is\u2026","Josh Shanker","Well, wait, wait. Can I ask one question on that, Doug? I thought the point was that if you use the stock it\u2019s a like-for-like transaction that doesn\u2019t result in a tax charge. Why would a seller prefer cash to stock if they basically cannot roll over the tax loss I guess \u2013 or the tax gain?","Doug Howell","There are some structures that just \u2013 they just are not positioned in order to take that stock, so they really don\u2019t have that tax planning strategy in that. So you would have to look at the nature of the seller\u2019s tax position to understand that more than our [indiscernible]. We will give anybody stock as long as we can buy it back in the marketplace.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Well. And those people that want stock, that is an indication of a real partner, we are happy to do that. And if we can arrange it with them to be a tax-free transaction, God bless them. But most of these people come to us with advisers that are telling them when you get the stock sell a good chunk of it anyway and so they are happy to take cash.","Doug Howell","Yes, most of the international folks, really they prefer cash just the way they are structured and just also owning \u2013 in some jurisdictions they just don\u2019t want to own a U.S.-listed company. As for the strong dollar, yes, it does mean that we can buy international franchises at a discount so to speak just because of the strong dollar. But that\u2019s not fueling our appetite for deals. We are not going to rush out to go do a bad deal just because the dollar is stronger. The other thing that\u2019s great about our capital management is as we generate cash internationally we don\u2019t have to bring it home; we have reinvestment opportunities internationally. So if we are generating pounds or Aussie dollars we have reinvestment opportunities there. It might be opportunities to repatriate it cheaper in the future with tax reform. But also if we do bring it back to the U.S., we have to pay an elevated tax, we can use some of our $480 million balance sheet of tax credits to shelter that income from taxation in the U.S.","So I think that we\u2019re well-positioned. We have the opportunity to use dollars around the world. That\u2019s easy to move over there. We can use local currency if we want. If the seller wants stock we are happy to give that because we can buy it back in the market. So we have a lot of levers that we can pull in our M&A strategy that allow us to capitalize on the environment right now. As for USI, I will let Pat talk about that.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Yes. So USI is a solid franchise, great history. But as for them becoming a greater threat, remember Josh, we have about 32 areas that we have vertical strength. We call them our niches. And in those stitches, whether it be construction, religious and not-for-profit, higher education, et cetera, et cetera, and I can run down all 30 of them. We believe in every single one of those we are stronger than anybody in the marketplace and we don\u2019t fear anyone.","Josh Shanker","And in terms of are they similar. And remind me, at Brown & Brown we\u2019ve always argued everybody goes after smaller business than you. Is USI in your wheelhouse in the United States?","J. Patrick Gallagher","USI is in our wheelhouse in some cities. They are a little bit more disparate group than we are. I think we are a little bit more focused on our niches and working together across profit centers and across the globe in those niches. But, no, they are good competition.","Doug Howell","Also remember, I think that we know that of the publicly traded brokerages we are probably competing against the bigger ones less than 5% of the time when we are out there proposing. It\u2019s this other 29,000 brokers out there that we are competing with day in and day out. USI in one city might be strong against us but in another city it might be Willis or it might be the XYZ Agency in another city. So this is a local business and I don\u2019t worry about any one particular \u2013 we don\u2019t have a systemic competition against one person anywhere, or one broker anywhere.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Doug is right. We know that over 90% of the time when we compete we are competing with the local, smaller agent.","Josh Shanker","Excellent. Thank you very much. I appreciate all the detail.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Josh.","Doug Howell","Thanks, Josh.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Quentin McMillan of KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Quentin McMillan","Thanks very much guys. If I could just ask a couple of the Trump-related questions. I assume the organic growth outlook for 2017 is not predicated on any of the policies which may affect you probably either positively or negatively. But one of the things he talked about was infrastructure spending and if we talk about the niches that you guys have, construction is a very strong one. Can you give us a sense of what size that business is within your overall brokerage and potentially what effect it could have if some of this infrastructure spending does take place?","J. Patrick Gallagher","First of all, yes. Construction is probably our single-largest niche in the United States. And in 2016 that niche crushed it. I won\u2019t give you the actual organic but it was way better than what you are seeing us with the rest of the Company. Anything the new President does in regards to infrastructure spending will fall into the construction area and will be incredibly beneficial to us.","Anything that the new administration does relative to healthcare and the ACA, clients will really, really need our \u2013 they will need our support and our consulting capabilities. So when I look at what could be coming out of Washington in the next few years, I think it is incredibly positive for us.","Quentin McMillan","Right. But your outlook for 2017 did not include any of that positivity? It is just what you are seeing today, correct?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Correct.","Quentin McMillan","Okay. And then just a follow-up on the Trump stuff is \u2013 there is a thought that the interest income deductibility could go away and a two-part question for that. One, you guys have some leverage on the balance sheet. What could that mean in terms of an EPS hit? And then secondly, in the M&A arena, PE funds obviously use a ton of leverage to do these deals, so it could have a pretty negative impact in terms of their business model. What do you see the impact of that playing out in terms of the multiples in the space and the competition for M&A longer term?","Doug Howell","I think the competition would become less fierce when it comes to using leverage to borrow and buy brokers, so I think that would be helpful for us. What\u2019s the impact of a lost interest deduction to us? Basically you can compute that if you go to page 6 of the CFO commentary \u2013 is we are getting an income tax benefit of $45 million right now. If that one away we would just use more of our tax credits.","So the cash taxes paid wouldn\u2019t change that much for us. So it wouldn\u2019t cause a big negative. It might have a GAAP impact but we would use that warehouse of credits that we have on the balance sheet to pay those taxes.","J. Patrick Gallagher","And Doug hit on the PE model, Quentin, you are absolutely right. That model absolutely needs the interest deduction to work. The PE firms have driven multiples up. I lived through this once before in my career and that was when the banks decided that the brokerage business was flavor of the month. And every time we would compete, a bank would be 3 to 5 multiple points higher than us and so they drove prices up. We basically did fewer deals. And when the banks got their belly ache going and decided it wasn\u2019t flavor of the month anymore, multiples came down and we did great.","Quentin McMillan","Perfect. If I could sneak one more in just about Chem-Mod. The midpoint of the guidance is, Doug or Pat, I forgot who mentioned, it\u2019s about 10% up for next year versus 10% to 15% this year. Just wondering, now that mostly all the plants are online, should we continue to expect sort of a similar type growth rate? Or is the business sort of in steady-state at this point and we are not likely to see earnings growing much past this into 2018 and beyond?","Doug Howell","Good question. We do have a couple plants that we can put in place in 2017 that could start generating in 2018 that could cause a step up. You would also have to look at utilization of coal for 2018 and beyond, would influence that. If the Trump policies to favor coal are successful you could have coal plants actually producing more, so that would cause a step up again in 2018 but it would be modest.","So new plants could cause a step up. It\u2019s a small plant wouldn\u2019t have a big impact, but for a large plant it could have another step up. But wouldn\u2019t expect much more after the step up here in 2017.","Quentin McMillan","Okay. Great. Thank you so much, guys.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Quentin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Adam Klauber of William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Adam Klauber","Good morning guys.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Klauber","A couple different questions. Number one on exposures, are exposures running better say now in the last six months than the first six months of the year? And any thoughts on exposures coming into 2017?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Exposures are up a little bit stronger in the second half than they were in the first half and by that I\u2019m talking basis points; I\u2019m not talking percentage points. And I think that 2017 will see a continuation of that. I had a customer in just last night \u2013 I spent a good bit of time with the customer yesterday afternoon. And he is a midsize manufacturer locally here \u2013 very locally; I can look at the window and see his plant \u2013 and he had 22% growth last year organic. So that\u2019s stronger than our base customer but that was pretty positive.","Adam Klauber","Right. That\u2019s good news. Similar question on the wholesale submissions. How are they running today versus a year ago?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Stronger. I think as we have expanded RPS; as you know RPS, the largest MGA in the country, plus it\u2019s one of the largest open-market brokers and one of the largest program managers. The program side was a little slower but open-market broking and MGA stuff was very strong.","Adam Klauber","Is that in part driven by the construction? Does that the economy doing better? What\u2019s driving that?","J. Patrick Gallagher","I think, I wouldn\u2019t give it \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s in any one specific area. A place where we\u2019ve gotten more activity but had a little bit more difficulty is of course transportation. But it hasn\u2019t been just focused on construction, it\u2019s really been across the board. Probably, Adam, driving as much of that is new business startups.","Adam Klauber","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then on the deal front, there was a company, Aleera, I\u2019m sure you saw it snapped up 25 brokers at once. Does that put a dent in the near-term supply?","J. Patrick Gallagher","No. Not even close.","Adam Klauber","Okay, okay. And then finally on the clean energy, when do the benefits from that actually stop? Is that 2021? And what happens to that business when it does stop?","J. Patrick Gallagher","First defined benefits. The cash flows that are generated today should go well into the mid-2020. The ability to generate credits for our 2009-era plants, they will be done generating credits at the end of 2019, which is about a third of the production. Our 2011 plants would run to the end of 2011. But again we are producing excess credits today that would provide a glide path well into the mid-2020s at current rates and perhaps even longer if we get a tax rate drop to about \u2013 if you drop down to 20% our credits might go a little bit longer than that.","Adam Klauber","Okay. So\u2026","Doug Howell","Let me interrupt just a second, Adam. I think also, this is a law that applies to solar, to wind, to other clean energy-type tax credits. And maybe there\u2019s movement afoot that could extend those to in some way shape or form past 2021. So you might \u2013 you\u2019ll see a step back in GAAP earnings but cash earnings will actually exceed GAAP earnings when you get out to that point.","Adam Klauber","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Adam.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Mark Hughes of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Hughes","Yes, thank you. Good morning.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Hughes","I would also like to give my best to Marsha.","J. Patrick Gallagher","I know she\u2019ll appreciate it.","Mark Hughes","Yes. In the risk management business could you talk about the claims frequency, particularly in the worker\u2019s comp area?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Claims frequency is growing but along around about 1%.","Doug Howell","Yes. Pat, it\u2019s \u2013 a little bit of a difference between the indemnity and medical-only claims, but the indemnity is up about 1.5% with the existing client base, so not new growth but thinking of it as these same-store sales. Indemnity is a little bit higher than that. But when you bring in the medical-only claims it\u2019s right around 1% overall.","Mark Hughes","How does the trend look compared to say three or six months ago?","Doug Howell","Three to six months ago it\u2019s probably about the same. If you remember, Mark, if you go back two years ago it\u2019s probably down a point to a point half.","Mark Hughes","Got you. And then in the wholesale business, why is the program under a little bit of pressure? Is that competition that is slowing that down?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Yes, a soft market. And we lost one program underwriter.","Mark Hughes","Thank you very much.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Mark.","Doug Howell","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Charles Sebaski of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Sebaski","Good morning.","Doug Howell","Good morning.","Charles Sebaski","A follow-up on that program, can you tell us what the size is currently of the program business and whether or not there\u2019s been any change on the underwriter side on appetites for you guys or any expected turnover there?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Go ahead.","Doug Howell","I think the program business is about $75 million in total revenues, but when you break down to the area we are talking about a $40 million business that \u2013 of the piece that we are really talking about here. Truthfully what happened is we got a transportation program that we moved to a different underwriter and that slowed us down a little bit here in 2016. But we\u2019ve got \u2013 the program is back in place. We\u2019ve got it working and we think that we could have some nice uplift in transportation in 2017 if the economy starts humming. You\u2019ve got to move all goods and services with transportation so that could be better than that, but it\u2019s a $40 million business for us.","J. Patrick Gallagher","And in that business, Charles, we are the underwriter, right, so soft markets in very specific programs hurt us","Charles Sebaski","Okay. You mentioned earlier about the performance bonuses internationally and I think you said you thought they were going to pick up in 2017 after some changeover of a state program. What were the level of performance bonuses in 2016? And kind of when you think of pick up what the general guidepost would be for that would be helpful.","Doug Howell","You can go into the risk management segment historical financial information and you can take a look at the performance revenues in the past, but basically they had been running $10 million to $15 million a year. We think there could be a rebound in that. I think this year the total year-to-date number is \u2013 it looks like the performance bonuses were down from $15.6 million in 2015 down to $3.6 million this year, so there is a possibility of a $10 million recovery on that over time. I don\u2019t think we will pick it all up next year but I think over the next couple of years we will do that.","One of the reasons why it\u2019s down I think it\u2019s important to understand is those performance bonuses that we lost this year were predicated on a contract that was written five years ago. And as the client stepped up their expectation of our service over the last five years, we hit it four out of the five years. It\u2019s just the stretch goal for the fifth year was larger. So our quality actually improved and our service actually improved, but we didn\u2019t hit the stretch milestone that was set five years ago. That\u2019s been recalibrated. I think that as we look out we have renewed that program.","We\u2019ve got a three or four year contract with some, probably closer to four-year contract with them. And I think the milestones, as we look out into the fourth year, we believe are much more reasonable. And I think that the client would also agree that they probably held us to a standard that was pretty high. So this shouldn\u2019t be interpreted that we missed something. The fact is the milestones were just a little too high as we guessed five years ago when we negotiated that contract. But I think the next one over the next four years we should be able to hit it all.","Charles Sebaski","And that is essentially all margin, right? I mean, it might only be $10 million or something, but it almost all falls to the bottom line, correct?","Doug Howell","Right. It does. I mean there\u2019s management bonuses associated with it that go in there and the staff bonuses that we pay out as we hit those milestones. But, yes, you are right.","Charles Sebaski","All right. And then I guess just finally, and I am thinking about the deal side. And I know you give guidance on EBITDAC multiples. I\u2019m just curious, if there is tax reform, does tax reform change your view of the multiples you\u2019d be willing to spend given you consider on a pretax basis? But does a lower overall corporate moving to 35% to 20% change your appetite or multiples on transactions going forward?","Doug Howell","Yes, I think the math would say that if you move from 35% to 20% on a tax rate cash flow discounting on that you would probably have to pay a 1.5 times greater multiple on that. But I think you\u2019d also look at the spread to our multiple would still be about the same. We are buying at probably a 3 point spread to our multiple and \u2013 but theoretically our multiple would move up too. But, yes, it\u2019s 1.5 times the multiple \u2013 incremental. So if you are paying 7 you might have to pay 8.5 for the exact same cash, in theory just based on the math.","Charles Sebaski","Excellent. Thanks a lot for the answers, guys. Good quarter, nice.","Doug Howell","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Sarah DeWitt of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Sarah DeWitt","Hi, good morning.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Good morning.","Sarah DeWitt","Just following up on the potential loss for the interest rate deduction. What would the GAAP impact be? Would that be the $45 million? And if that occurred would you use cash for debt reduction over M&A?","Doug Howell","You are looking at it right. On Page 6 of the CFO commentary the $45 million would be a GAAP reduction. Again we would use tax credits, so there would be no difference on cash because we would use our tax credits faster. And would we favor debt reduction over M&As? No. I think that we would still continue to be an active acquirer of nice tuck-in acquisitions which would pay better than repaying the debt.","J. Patrick Gallagher","And remember, when a seller sells, Sarah, they are gone. You can\u2019t get someone that wants to sell their business to decide they are going to wait a year and a half.","Sarah DeWitt","Right. Okay. And then on the brokerage margin, nearly 27% this year I think is near an all-time high. Is there a natural ceiling on the margin over time, or is the way to think about it, as long as you grow more than 3% organically there is really no limit to that?","Doug Howell","Yes, it is an all-time high. I think our margin improvement over the last five years, we are probably up 400 basis points in margins in the last five years. So, yes, it is. Is it \u2013 trees don\u2019t grow to the moon? I think there is a spot where you can have an unhealthy margin. You can\u2019t reinvest into the business. And what I would like to think more about is how does it \u2013 to the extent that we have additional margin expansion, what do we do in order to continue to attract good producers and provide better clients to our customers? So we talked about the opportunities internationally. In the U.S. we need to continue to provide the level of service to our customers, so there is a terminal velocity that you reach on this.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay, great. Thank you.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Sarah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ken Billingsley of Compass Point. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Billingsley","Hi, good morning. I\u2019d also like to offer my well wishes to Marsha and her future endeavors.","J. Patrick Gallagher","All right, all right, for the rest of you on the call, that\u2019s enough.","Doug Howell","She\u2019s in Florida right now listening to this. Let\u2019s not feel too sorry for her.","Ken Billingsley","There you go. My question is going to hop around a little bit here. The first one is on the brokerage segment, the $18.5 million line item for investment gains and gains on sales of books of business, I see that on Page 13 that gain on sales were negative $1.9 million. Could you just explain what the $20 million in investments, or just what to look at that from a modeling perspective going forward?","Doug Howell","All right, there\u2019s two things I think that you are looking at. If you are talking about in the P&L, investment income and gains on realized books of business, there\u2019s two pieces in there. Premium funding income that we get on our premium funding operations around the world is in there, as well as book gain. And probably the best place to get book gains would be in the \u2013 as we adjust EBITDAC \u2013 I\u2019m trying to get to that page here \u2013 the book gains for the year \u2013 stand by. Book gains for the year would be somewhere around, I don\u2019t know, $6 million for the year, something like that. So your question \u2013 so now that I\u2019m anchored on where you are. What was your question? This would be something if we decide a book of business doesn\u2019t fit with us we would sell it off, or a producer \u2013 if we want to exit a producer sometimes we will sell them a piece of the business that they manage.","Ken Billingsley","Okay, so this isn\u2019t related to page 13 where you have gain on booked sales for the quarter of negative $1.9 million \u2013 of the press release?","Doug Howell","All right, page 13, 14 on the press release \u2013 I\u2019m still trying to get to where you are, $1.9 million there. Well, what we are doing \u2013 we had a gain of $1.9 million on a book, so when we get to adjusted we take reported and we are reducing that gain as we get down to adjusted because we just sold off a small piece of business.","Ken Billingsley","Right. So the premium funding would be the remaining about \u2013 just around about $16 million of premium funding for the quarter?","Doug Howell","No, not in investment income. If you look at investment income, the $16.6 million, you\u2019d take out the book gain of $1.9 million and you would be somewhere around $14 million. Maybe I misheard your question?","Ken Billingsley","Yes, I will follow-up after the call.","Doug Howell","Yes, the rest of it would be premium funding income. To the extent that you pull out booked gains, the rest of it would be premium funding, interest income and then you will have an interest expense down in the P&L also.","Ken Billingsley","So moving on to coal. I would imagine \u2013 you made some comments earlier that under Trump it would appear positive for usage and such. But on the tax side, do the plant owners own a piece of the tax benefit, or does someone else own that. And then the question really just relates to what is the incentive and desire if regulations are reduced in general for them to use the clean coal as opposed to not using the plant in their process?","Doug Howell","First, more important, we own the plant or the facility that actually creates the clean coal \u2013 Gallagher plus our partners own that plant. So we take possession of the coal; we treat it and then we sell that coal back to the utility. And so as a result of that the utility can meet their environmental needs that they want to meet. And when \u2013 but the utility does not participate in the tax credit. They get a processed, refined coal that\u2019s clean and that\u2019s their incentive to use the clean coal plant.","Ken Billingsley","But if there is any change in regulations on that side, do you guys have contracts \u2013 future contracts of purchase obligations with you guys?","Doug Howell","If there\u2019s a change in environmental regulation, yes, it could have some impact on their desire to make it clean coal. But most of our utility plants, it doesn\u2019t cost them anything to use this clean coal to a great extent. So I think they continue to use it even if \u2013 we really haven\u2019t had any mercury standards for the last 10 years and so they\u2019ve been using clean coal since then. So I think they would \u2013 for the better good of society I think they continue to use it.","Ken Billingsley","Your answer there \u2013 does it cost them more to use yours, or you said it doesn\u2019t cost anymore to use yours\u2026","Doug Howell","No, it does not cost them more to use it.","Ken Billingsley","Okay. And then the last question was on the \u2013 I just want to talk about healthcare, ACA, your employee benefits segment and more of the discussions you may have had initially with some of your smaller accounts. Don\u2019t know where it is going to go, but if some of the smaller accounts that didn\u2019t have to offer healthcare benefits and there were some changes and they no longer have to. In your initial conversations given where unemployment is, what\u2019s their thoughts about retaining and hiring people? Is it something they are likely going to continue to offer? Maybe just \u2013 I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019ve had any initial conversations\u2026","J. Patrick Gallagher","Yes, initial conversations, Ken \u2013 ACA is not that old. You go back in time, the number- one challenge for most business people is getting the right team together, right. It\u2019s getting the right people on the bus. If you are going to do that for the most part you\u2019ve got to have attractive benefit offers.","Now, there were very small accounts obviously before ACA that were not offering benefits to their people. But by and large the majority of the clients that we talk to would continue on doing exactly what they did before the ACA, which is making sure they had a benefits package that was attractive to their employees. What they want is help understanding where this thing is going.","Ken Billingsley","So if anything, maybe a reduction of what maybe is in the healthcare from the change in ACA, but definitely not going backwards and removing it?","J. Patrick Gallagher","I don\u2019t think there will be a reduction. I\u2019m not going to give you any numbers or percentages, but when there is change in the marketplace it\u2019s good for Gallagher.","Doug Howell","One of the things to also remember that in our practice, our employee benefit consulting and practice is that we don\u2019t do a lot of customers that are under 50 lives. It\u2019s just really not, we\u2019re tend to be \u2013 when they start getting over 100 or towards 500 to 5,000, that\u2019s where we are playing.","So the number of small customers that really are kind of getting whipsawed by all this, that\u2019s really not where we spend most of our time and effort. So it wasn\u2019t a big practice before, it\u2019s not a big practice now. We do it really well for a small customer that wants to use our services, but by and large we don\u2019t play in that space.","Ken Billingsley","Very good. Thank you for taking my questions.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Ken.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mark Hughes of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Hughes","Yes. Just quickly on interest rates. Doug, where do we have to get in terms of rates at the short end before it starts having an impact on your investment income? And then alternatively what\u2019s the risk that higher interest rates tempt carriers to be more aggressive on pricing?","Doug Howell","Let me take the carrier and work backwards on this thing. And I think on the carrier side they are still having portfolios that are rolling off at higher interest rates. And so their net renewals, as their portfolios roll it\u2019s going to be renewing down. New money coming in to the extent they would grow would be slightly higher than last year. We are up 75 basis points.","On the short end of the curve \u2013 probably going to take another 50 basis points in order for it to take any meaningful difference on our results, but it will drop into investment income at that point. You remember the days when we were getting 6% on our short money, that was pretty good. I think that was about $20 million back then. Now it would probably be closer to $100 million.","Mark Hughes","Yes. Very good. Thank you.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Mark.","Doug Howell","Thanks, Mark.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Any other questions, Donna?","Operator","No, sir. I would like to turn it back over to you for any closing comments.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Good. I do have a quick closing comment. First of all, thanks again, everyone, for being with us this morning. We do believe 2016 was an excellent year for Gallagher and our focus remains on executing on each component of our value creation strategy. We will grow organically in 2017. We will grow through acquiring the best brokers. We will improve our quality and productivity. And we are going to continue to invest and celebrate our culture. We think 2017 will be another great year as we build on the success of 2016. Thank you for being with us this morning.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation.

Gallagher & Co.'s Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Some of the comments made during this conference call, including answers given in response to questions, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that will be discussed on this call and which are also described in the company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today.","It is now my pleasure to introduce J. Patrick Gallagher, Chairman, President and CEO of Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thank you, Robert. Good morning, everyone, and thank you very much for joining us this morning for our conference call. We appreciate you being on the line. This morning, I'm joined by Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions.","This morning, as is our custom, I'll add some color to our quarter, discuss our merger activity, discuss each of our operating divisions, and then turn the floor over to Doug for some comments, and then we'll get to questions and answers.","It's really unbelievable, another record quarter for Gallagher. Our combined Brokerage and Risk Management businesses, which we look at as our core businesses, our adjusted revenues were up 38%. All-in, our organic growth was 7.1%. Adjusted EBITDAC is up 43%. Adjusted margins are up 80 basis points. And our adjusted EPS is up 15%. All in all, just a terrific quarter. I could not be any prouder of our team.","Let me discuss, first of all, mergers and acquisitions. As you know, over the last 18 months, we have closed 5 large acquisitions: Bollinger, Giles, Oval, Wesfarmers and Noraxis. These are all onboarding well, with growth opportunities showing themselves almost every single day. But realize our strategy of acquiring our typical entrepreneurial firms continues nicely. In the quarter, we closed 18 tuck-in mergers, bringing on board $63 million of annualized revenue or an average revenue size of $3.5 million per merger. And our pipeline remains incredibly strong.","All of these firms had choices. It is a very competitive merger and acquisition marketplace today. So I want to welcome our new partners and thank them for their vote of confidence. Together, we'll continue building our company.","Let me move to the Brokerage segment results and some commentary about the Brokerage segment. First of all, the results. Adjusted revenues, up 45%. All-in organic, up 5.8%. Adjusted EBITDAC, up 46%. Adjusted margins, up 24 basis points. But remember, and we talked about this last quarter, that we're up 90 basis points excluding the seasonal impact of our larger acquisitions. And adjusted EPS is up 18%.","Within the segment, our retail property\/casualty business in the United States continues to operate in what I would call a flattish environment. Our team is just back from the CIAB meeting in Colorado Springs, that's the Council of Insurance Agents & Brokers. We're in over 20 meetings with markets. We continue to hear CEOs talk about disciplined underwriting. As one CEO said, if the account deserves a reduction, I want my team to give it to them. But if the account needs an increase, we better be getting it. That is exactly what we're seeing on the street. All carriers are keenly aware that with investment yields very low and loss cost inflating, a flat renewal is actually a decrease. This is the fourth year of a market phase that is either slightly up or slightly down depending on the account. We're not in a traditional soft market nor are we in a traditional hard market, but rather a stable market.","My meetings lead me to believe that the carriers will carry this forward, this discipline into 2015 and possibly even longer. And frankly, that's a great market for the brokerage industry and I think it's a great market for our clients.","Our International Brokerage business is doing quite well. In the U.K., just this week, we rebranded all of our retail offices. No longer are we trading as Gallagher Heath, Giles or Oval. All our retail branches will trade as Arthur J. Gallagher, a move that I believe will clearly demonstrate that we are coming together as one strong company to better serve our existing clients and to produce strong new business results.","Our Benefits Brokerage and Consulting business in the United States continues to assist our clients with the myriad compliance issues brought about by the new healthcare law. Our private label exchange, which we call the Gallagher Marketplace, is gaining real traction. I believe we will see significant growth in the exchange in 2015 and beyond. And our merger and acquisition opportunities in the Benefits business, both in the United States and globally, are outstanding.","And finally in this segment, our Wholesale Brokerage business in the U.S., Risk Placement Services, had a great quarter. The rate challenges that we faced in the second quarter were not as pronounced in the third.","Let me turn to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett, which also had an outstanding quarter. Revenue up 12%, all of which is organic. Adjusted EBITDAC is up 19% and adjusted margins up 96 basis points. GB is seeing strong new business wins domestically and internationally. These are comprised of large self-insured accounts and insurance companies outsourcing their claims work. We continue to make investments in systems around the globe, as well as service enhancements with one goal in mind, and that's better claim outcomes for our clients.","So all of our operating divisions contributed to our outstanding quarter. And to top it off, our clean energy investments are on track to top $100 million of earnings this year. All in all, just a fantastic quarter.","All of us get up every day and focus on 4 things: Number 1, organic growth; number 2, mergers and acquisitions; number 3, productivity and enhanced quality for our clients; and number 4, maintaining the unique Gallagher culture. I can say in each of these 4 areas, we truly excelled in the third quarter. Doug?","Douglas K. Howell","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. For my comments today, I'm not going to repeat each number in the earnings release but I will say, it's very nice to have an outstanding quarter on every single measure. Here are some other items for you to consider as you review our results and work on your models.","All right, on Page 1. You heard Pat say the integration is going as planned and going well. We had $0.08 of charges this quarter. Looking forward, we expect $0.08 of costs, integration costs in the fourth quarter, and then about $0.05 in each quarter of 2015.","On Page 2, to that organic revenue table at the bottom. I have 4 comments on that.","First, you'll see that we had an excellent quarter on all 3 components: Base, supplementals and contingents. Please understand that we coach our field that to understand the importance of getting the appropriate compensation for services. And to us, it doesn't matter where it gets classified in the financial statements.","Second, you'll see that we've added a footnote explaining that we had a great quarter in terms of net larger account wins. But note, even without this perfect storm, or maybe what I should say a perfect sunshine, our base organic growth would be about 4%, and overall brokerage organic would be about 5%. Either way, an awesome job by the team this quarter.","Third, the impact of rate was slightly negative, but less than a percentage point this quarter, which is very similar to the last 2 quarters. So like Pat said, we are in a stable, rational rate environment, which is very healthy for our customers, the carriers and the brokers.","And finally, breaking down the 5.8% brokerage organic growth. Domestic was just shy of 5% and international was a bit above 8%.","Now let's look to Page 3 to the brokerage adjusted EBITDAC margin near the bottom of the page. Adjusted margins are up 24 basis points on the face but really, we're up about 90 basis points when adjusting for the margin compression due to the seasonality inherent in our larger mergers that we had forecasted in last quarter's conference call. So being up 90 basis points without the seasonality is really excellent work by the team.","Looking towards the fourth quarter, it flips the other way. The larger merger seasonality bolsters overall margins by about 100 to 150 basis points.","Also, let me give you some noncash estimates for the fourth quarter for the Brokerage segment. In your models, for amortization, assume about $55 million a quarter; for acquisition earnout amortization, assume about $5 million; and for depreciation, assume about $15 million. Then, you also need to adjust your models as we do more M&A. A good rule of thumb is for every dollar we spend, you'll need to increase the amortization expense by about 1% of the purchase price per quarter. And that should get you pretty close.","Before we leave Brokerage, let me hit one other item that is causing some questions. Please turn to Page 9 of the earnings release. This quarter, you'll see $19.1 million in the revenue line called investment income and gains realized on book sales. Let me break that line down for you.","In there, there's$900,000, which is true book gains from sales of books of business. And you can see that we adjust that out on Page 1 like we always do.","Next, there's $5 million in that line from investment income on our premium float. It's up about $2.5 million from third quarter 2013, mainly due to the float we now have in Australia and New Zealand, which have much higher short-term investment yields.","And finally, there's about $13 million from investment -- from interest income and fees related to the Premium Financing business that is part of the Crombie OM's [ph] brokerage operations. What you can't see is about $10 million of costs, classified in compensation and operating expense lines down below, which is what we spend to operate the Premium Financing business. So on a net basis, the Premium Financing business makes about $3 million a quarter.","As you look forward, the book gains are not really recurring and that's why we adjust for those, but interest income on the premium float and the net earnings from the Premium Financing operations is part and parcel to our Brokerage business in Australia and New Zealand.","All right. Let's turn back to Page 4 of the earnings release to the Risk Management segment. Really, an excellent quarter across the board. Breaking down the organic, our domestic operations grew near 10% and internationally, near 20%, so good performance in both areas. Looking at the fourth quarter, we don't see an organic quarter quite as strong as the third quarter, more in the 5% to 8% range, and we intend on making some more client-centric investments so we're targeting a fourth quarter margin of about 16% for the Risk Management segment in the fourth quarter.","Let's shift to Page 5 to the Corporate segment. In aggregate, you'll see us right in line with the midpoint of the range we gave last quarter, with a slightly stronger quarter from our clean energy investments more than covering a touch more M&A costs.","Looking forward, please spend some time on Page 15 of our investment supplement. We've added a couple of footnotes in there for you -- to help you with your models.","First, you'll read in footnote 3 on Page 15 of our investment supplement that we are in the process of making an early payout offer to former employer -- employees that are still in our frozen pension plan. This de-risking exercise will happen in the fourth quarter and payments will come from plan assets, not from our corporate cash. The related fourth quarter noncash P&L charge is not reflected in the estimates for the fourth quarter that we show on Page 14 of the supplement. In mid-December, when we know the amount of the charge, we'll likely file an 8-K with the numbers.","Second, footnote 2 on Page 15 of the supplement, provides our first guess at the corporate segment's first quarter 2015 earnings. We are waiting on longer-term production forecast from the utilities and we might be able to provide -- and when we get those, we might be able to provide a better guess at the remainder of 2015, also when we file the 8-K in December.","Finally, a comment on foreign currency. There wasn't much impact this quarter when we boil it all down. And we estimate at current -- and we estimate, at current exchange rate, that it will cost us about $0.01 per quarter going forward if exchange rates stay where they are today. So those are my comments. And then, as a wrap up, like I said at the start, it's a terrific quarter on all measures.","Back to you, Pat.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thank you, Doug. And Robert, we're ready to go to questions and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I have one question just about integration of these large acquisitions. Can you just sort of talk about, operationally, how that process is going? What are -- do you see opportunities for additional synergies from any or all of these acquisitions? And do you have capacity to continue to think about new candidates should opportunities arise?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks for the question, Mike. This is Pat. First of all, the integration across the board, that's in New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the U.K., is going extremely well. We're seeing exactly what we had hoped for. When it comes to expanding the business, we needed a platform in those locations to continue to do the bolt-on acquisitions that we do so well here in the United States and that we've been doing in the U.K. And we're seeing that activity percolating along very nicely. So the fact that we're now one of the largest brokers in Australia, we are, we believe, the largest in New Zealand, is giving us opportunities there to continue to bolt acquisitions on, and the same is true in Canada and the U.K. So the work streams that are involved in bringing these people aboard, minor things like, just as I mentioned in my comments, the rebranding in the U.K. are going extremely well. And I think that what we're hoping for in the long run is to continue to be able to build those businesses out.","You asked the question as to whether we have capacity to continue to do acquisitions? I think the leadership in each of those locations is excited. They're turned on and they're telling our story to smaller business owners that, I believe, will want to join us. So we have plenty of capacity. Our pipeline is very strong, both domestically and globally. And I think it bodes well for future acquisitions.","Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And are there costs associated with the rebranding effort, for example, or just certain steps during the kind of integration process that you incur? Or are those all contemplated when you think about and then talk about the impact on margins from those acquisitions?","Douglas K. Howell","Mike, it's Doug. There are a couple of comments to amplify on what Pat said. And as a direct answer to your question, is those costs that we incur for this rebranding exercise and to do the system conversions and everything, we classify those in the integration cost line, so we break those out for you there. But our adjusted operating margins would exclude the integration costs associated with those deals.","I think also, just important, it's not really a broad brush approach. Each acquisition has a different integration exercise. For instance, Bollinger, that we bought a little over a year ago, is just a part -- it's been fully integrated to our Northeast region operations. And so that's pretty well done at this point and that was a series of merging in 12 different branch locations, and merging our New York office and our Philadelphia offices and a couple in New Jersey. So that's done. So that's a different exercise and what you see in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Well, there really isn't a lot of integration associated with those because we don't have substantial -- didn't have substantial operations in Canada, New Zealand or Australia, so it's really more of them becoming part of us, so that's different. And then in the U.K., when you've got organizations like Oval and Giles coming together, there are a series of branches that are merging together, there are leadership changes that are going on with that. So each one, it's not a broad brush approach to how we integrate, but each one has their own separate plan on how they become part of Gallagher. So -- and that's all being done as we work. And it takes about a year to 15 months to really make all that happen. But like I said, on Bollinger, we did that merger in August of last year, and here in October, we're pretty well done with that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","The first question on the acquisition, follow up on Mike's question. Basically, what's underlying growth rates? I believe it's not in organic growth at these 5 large acquisitions that you recently acquired.","Douglas K. Howell","Kai, good question. On the Bollinger acquisition, it's pretty tough for us to track that at this point. At this point, they're merged into our operations and so we're not seeing, I don't see a lot of -- a big difference between Bollinger and what our Northeast region offices are performing at this point.","When you look at Australia, New Zealand and Canada, the growth rates there are in the low single digits, similar to our operations. In the U.K., as we put the Oval and Giles acquisition a little bit, I would say their growth rates are more flat.","There's also an exercise that we go through, and we do call out some clients as a result of the suitability, capability, et cetera, and just -- it's sometimes, they're just too costly to operate. So we spend a year culling through the book of business. If we're not making money on an account, we need to go through a repricing exercise on that. If the service load is too heavy, we may need to just sit down and say that we can't afford to service your business, so maybe you need to find another broker.","By and large, we work through those over a year to 18 months on the deal. So there's also a difference in the accounting basis. You do have some -- in some of the acquisitions, they pre-recognize monthly bill. In our situation, we don't, so we have to levelize that out. So there's a whole exercise going through on the organic. But by and large, it's not all that different than what you're seeing across Gallagher globally.","J. Patrick Gallagher","And actually, Kai, this is Pat. It takes 6 to 12 months for our new partners in those parts of the world to kind of really understand the power of the organization and to tap into things like salesforce.com and the niches that we've got. And once that gets some traction, we do quite well. So it's a year of basically getting to know each other.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's great. Then, on the organic growth. It's a very nice rebound from the last 2 quarters. But underlying is 4%, also nice growth there. But I just wonder if you can give a little more on the large account activities? I believe it wasn't -- that wasn't an issue in the past. It's just, why this quarter?","Douglas K. Howell","It's a confluence of events that our teams did some great jobs on a couple of big wins that came through in the quarter. That, it's just a little -- a lot of pattern for us. We don't see that happening quite as much. But our guys, they're good at large accounts and it just kind of get -- came together in this quarter. So 5.8% overall with those in, about 5% without them overall, that's a pretty good quarter.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's great. Lastly, on reinsurance. I believe you don't have a large reinsurance brokerage operations and -- but you just have some investment, minority investment in a new startup. I just wonder, given what's happening in the reinsurance marketplace, what you thought about getting into that business?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Well, we're extremely excited about our partnership with Grahame Chilton and Capsicum Re. And it's kind of an interesting play there. The traditional view of the marketplace in terms of reinsurance is that you have to have incredible amounts of analytics to be able to compete. And one of the things that Chily has kind of brought to the table is that with all of the capacity that's in the reinsurance market, there's a premium now on execution, on actual placement. So it's -- in essence, it's almost kind of a return to the past. And that business is going extremely well for us. Obviously, we're not the majority owner of Capsicum Re, but we're a good partner and we see really great traction there.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets.","Charles Sebaski","I wanted to get a little bit additional color on the organic growth. I guess from -- whether it's outside of the new account, the large accounts, that those are wins, the more traditional business. Are you seeing that from current account base expansion or net new clients to the business? Like where is -- any additional on where that's really stemming from?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Sure, let me break that down for you, Charles. This is Pat. First of all, when the market, over the last 4 years, has either been firming a bit, and again, that CIAB numbers are not out yet, but in the past, we've seen as much as maybe 4%, maybe 5% rate increases. Now, we're seeing kind of flattish to down a bit.","Our people have mitigated those impacts and the marketplace itself has contributed less than 1%, either up or down, to our organic growth. Our organic growth comes from one thing. We sell more than we lose. We get up every morning and we knock on doors and we tell people we ought to handle their insurance. And the data that we're able to accumulate today, which is far better than any we've seen in the past, tells us that we know that 90% of the time, when we go out into the marketplace to compete, we compete with a player that's smaller than we are. Now for people like myself that came aboard in 1976 when nobody even knew who we were in Chicago, that's a whole different position to be in. So our organic growth is coming from market share increase. Period.","Douglas K. Howell","One thing, Chuck, to amplify on that. We just don't lose accounts that much anymore. When it really comes right down to it, on our bread-and-butter accounts, our service quality that we measure every day is better than ever before, and so we just don't have service -- we just don't drop the ball on renewals. In this low rate change environment, our customers get to see the capabilities. They're not just constantly looking at rate increase or rate decrease. So they're actually being able to look through and see the differences you get with Gallagher. Our niche expertise, our service quality that's higher than most of our competitors. So they get to see the differentiation that you get with Gallagher and we think that's leading to good organic growth.","J. Patrick Gallagher","As far as the size of the firm today, I believe we are probably the only firm of our size that pays our people for what they basically write.","Charles Sebaski","No. And I wasn't trying to get to whether the organic had to do with pricing increases. I guess the question, and maybe I'm thinking about it wrong, is on your traditional mid-market business, whether you have accounts where somebody's not buying cyber liability, and this year they are, versus picking up an account that was a client of HUB group.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Both of those.","Charles Sebaski","That's -- I was wondering if there was one that was leading to more of the organic growth than the other?","J. Patrick Gallagher","I'll tell you, you raised a really good point. One of the things that we're focusing on very heavily is exactly your point on lines of business that we're not presently writing. So we are looking at every single account as it comes up for renewal. And if we're writing the property in the auto, but we don't have the general liability in the umbrella, we're going hard at it at adding those lines. At the same time, it's straight up competition on new pieces of business. So it's really a combination of both.","Charles Sebaski","Okay. And then a follow-up on the margin, kind of 2 parts. One, in the release, you talked about some -- you talked on the brokerage about some salary and compensation expense reductions in the quarter. And I'm wondering if that is to continue? Or what really drove that?","And additionally, Doug, you said the brokerage margin should expand 100 to 150 basis points on the seasonality reversal. But if you also have organic growth over 3, there's more margin expansion. So I'm guessing, should adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter be kind of in excess of 24%?","Douglas K. Howell","Well, I'm not going to an absolute number, I'd have to check last quarter, last year, or fourth quarter last year, but let me hit it in reverse. The larger deals will contribute 100 to 150 basis points of margin expansion. Our normal organic growth, our normal acquisition activity will have an impact on margin also. So the back part of your question there is that in a -- if we said in a perfect world that we have 0 margin change at 3% organic growth, then you would see 100 to 150 basis points due to the reversal of the seasonality on the larger deals. Greater than 3%, there could be some more margin expansion. Less than 3%, you might -- it might be tough to hold in there where we are. So that's the first.","And the first part of the question was on the -- we provide some, on Pages 3 of 11 of our press release, some explanation with respect to changes that impact the comparability of our comp and operating expense ratio. It's just lower levels of -- when we say salary decreases and a reduction incentive compensation, there is no current large-scale change in headcount or anything like that, that's just the natural change as we become more productive. We just don't hire quite as many people as maybe terminate. But there's no big risk in there that's causing that adjustment.","Charles Sebaski","Okay. And there's no -- there hasn't been a change that might upend the employee base that, hey, we're doing a comp review and adjusting our comp strategy?","J. Patrick Gallagher","No.","Douglas K. Howell","No. Our people deserve to get paid and they're getting paid.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Arash Soleimani with Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","In terms of the growth you mentioned in 2015 for Gallagher Marketplace, is there anything we should think about in terms of margins on that end? And will that be new client wins, or is that existing clients? I just wanted to get some more color on that please.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Well, I think the marketplace is going to get a lot of traction, both from new clients wins, as well as existing accounts that are presently in a more traditional arrangement, either moving to defined contribution or just liking the ability to give their employees more choice. So I think you'll see a greater movement, especially as we get around to the fall of next year when open enrollment is once again on us.","Right now, I think people are still learning about the exchanges and they're interested in them, but I think because open enrollment is already going on, most people are sort of stuck with renewing the kind of process and program that they have in place. They also are concerned about not losing any grandfathering as we go into more compliance rules in 2015. And so I think it's going to take time through the spring and the summer of next year for the C-Suite to really understand the opportunities the exchange provides, and I think you'll see a nice blip in '16 and '17.","Douglas K. Howell","It's not going to have any impact on our margin one way or another.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Correct.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And I know in terms of the large account sales, I know you've mentioned in the past, perhaps I think maybe at your last Investor Day, that you were trying to, I guess, penetrate a bit more into the large account space. With that said, should we expect more of these sort of organic growth boost from large sales to kind of continue here and there over the next couple of years or so? Or is it truly onetime in nature?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Well, I think Arash, our people get up every day and go out and compete head-to-head with everybody that's in the marketplace. As I said, earlier, 90% of the time when we compete, we're competing with a smaller, probably more localized competitor. But we're very good at large accounts. Large accounts are what created Gallagher Bassett 40 years ago, 50 years ago. And it's -- but they're lumpy. And one of the things we want to do is be as transparent with you as shareholders as we can possibly be.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, no, that's very much appreciated. And lastly, just to confirm, did you mention the risk management margin? I mean, not margin, organic growth, would go to the 5% to 8% range next quarter?","Douglas K. Howell","Yes. We see that as a more reasonable range than nearly 12%.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mark Hughes with SunTrust.","Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","For the strength you did see in 3Q in risk management, you had mentioned more self-insured, more outsourcing by insurance companies. Could you give us some more detail on that? Are you seeing a greater flow of opportunities? Your hit rate is up. What's driving that?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Actually, this year, I would say it's both. We've had a very good year on the large account front. Written business is up substantially from prior year. I think that the product offering that we're getting, the people that we're recruiting are getting some traction in the self-insured market. Large accounts are looking at us as a very viable choice for doing their claims work.","But also very excitingly to me, and I think this is a true shift in the business, is insurance companies that are willing to outsource claims work. It starts oftentimes with them taking a look at locations, maybe where they don't have infrastructure, where they'd like us to do some support work. And then ultimately, over time, oftentimes it leads to true partnerships.","I won't mention names because I don't think that would be appropriate on a call, but I'll give you one example. There's one large insurer that basically outsources the entire construction book of business they have to Gallagher Bassett. I was able to go to the partnership meeting where we're working together on how do we want to adjust those claims and what differences do we want to see? There were over 150 people in the room. That's people working together from the insurer and from Gallagher Bassett, making sure that the product offering they have in the construction world in the United States is differentiated by virtue of the fact that the claims outcomes, they believe, will be superior. That's exciting stuff.","Douglas K. Howell","Yes. It really comes down, Mark, to demonstrating claim outcomes that are better. The audience will listen to that, whether it's a commercial customer, a public entity, a carrier. When we're paying $9 billion a year of claims, maybe we're touching on 800,000 claims a year that we're paying. Our outcomes, we can prove, are better. And when we get in front of any customer on that, they see the advantage that it brings to their business.","J. Patrick Gallagher","And let me go back to Doug's comment. This is Pat. When you think about the fact that we will pay out billions and billions of dollars in claims, most of the insurance companies you follow don't pay as many dollars out in claims as we do.","Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Right. And then, a final question. How would the wholesale business do in the quarter?","J. Patrick Gallagher","It was outstanding. We had a great quarter. If you think about the second quarter, we had an awful lot of catastrophe property renewals in the second quarter, and those were down substantially. And as we commented in our second quarter results, I think that's appropriate for those accounts because they paid dearly for property cover that has really not had many cat losses. But that, we didn't have a big property renewal quarter in the third quarter. Our MGA and MGU business did extremely well, and our open market broking did extremely well. So organic growth was very strong here in the quarter.","Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Better than average?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Yes.","Douglas K. Howell","Yes.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Better than the segment as a whole, Mark.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Adam Klauber with William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just a couple of different questions. In the U.S. retail business, how's net new -- and yes, I guess, I want to look for -- the market is just a little bit more stagnant, not a lot of rate increase, not a lot of rate decreases. How does that translate into the level of opportunities compared to maybe a year ago?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Well, given one year difference, I wouldn't say that there's much change there, Adam. But here's the thing, Doug mentioned in his comments, you give us a flat market, up 2, down 2, sideways 3, whatever. And our expertise and our capabilities are what we're selling against the relationship that exists. So 90% of the time we're competing with somebody that's smaller than we are. And 90% of the time, I believe we can prove that we have expertise that exceeds that local broker's capabilities. Now, I think we should win 100% of the time and, unfortunately, we don't.","When we do win though, when you step back, you're familiar with the fact that we're very niche-focused in what we do in retail P&C in particular. 85% of the business that we write that's new falls in one of those 33 categories that we think we're stronger than anybody. So expertise is truly selling in the marketplace. It's not just size. We don't win accounts because we're big. We win accounts because we're really good at their business, and that means market share is coming our way.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. As far as RPS again. Good to see it popped up this quarter. Fourth quarter, is it another larger catastrophe warranted renewal season?","Douglas K. Howell","No, not really, Adam.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. It's mainly the second quarter's?","Douglas K. Howell","Yes.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So the second quarter, the largest then?","Douglas K. Howell","Yes, it is.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, okay, that's helpful. Doug, as far as, obviously, pretty strong in supplementals and contingents, part of that is fair amount of acquisitions. Can you give us an idea what's the impact on the brokerage margin for that, for increasing supplementals and contingents?","Douglas K. Howell","Supplementals is pretty close to our -- the impact on margins. Supplementals are pretty close to base commissions and fees, so that impact is more in line with the base fees. The contingents, 75% of that hits the bottom line typically on a contingent.","The important takeaway on this is it's getting harder and harder. And while we believe that transparency into those 3 components is important for you as analysts and shareholders alike to understand, the lines are getting a little blurred on that. It used to be that contingents went directly to the house 100%. There are situations where contingents, we do share with the field to a certain extent. Supplementals, some get shared with the field, some don't. So -- but when provided all three there, but like I said in my opening remarks, we think it's important to get it. However, if the carrier believes it's best that they would like to make a payment to us in recognition for our services, we'll take it any way we can get it. But the margin on the contingents is better than the other 2.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Right. And any visibility into 2015 that -- I know there's a lot of factors that can go into both of those categories. Will the strong growth continue? Or do you think this just represents a pretty good year?","Douglas K. Howell","Yes. Adam, we usually typically have better insight in that in our January call than we do here in October. We're still getting to the point. But if the carriers are healthy and they recognize the value of our distribution, we think that supplementals and contingents will remain an important component of our story next year, too. But January is a better time to ask us when we get through a lot of the conversations with the carriers over the next coming months.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Right. And then, looking at the Corporate segment. Not surprisingly, interests and banking costs you do a good job at disclosing. Interests and bank costs and acquisition costs are up a fair amount this year compared to last year. Is that mainly related to the brokerage acquisitions?","Douglas K. Howell","Yes. The new debt that we put on from the last 2 private placements that we've done compared to last year at this time, but it is the debt funding that we're using to the brokerage deals.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Right, right. And the acquisitions costs terminally [ph] the brokerage deals right?","Douglas K. Howell","Yes, right. And just so everybody understands what we do with acquisition costs. These are the pre-deal costs where we don't have internal resources to do the deals or it requires onetime nonrecurring expertise. In the past, those were all capitalized as far as the deal price, but under GAAP, you need to expense them. So we track them in separate bucket and we report them here.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And clearly, you did some very large deals this year, so it makes sense that you're going to incur a materially bigger acquisition cost. Is it -- that can be sort of the rule of thumb if you do some bigger deals next year? You can see those more similar to what we saw this year. But if you don't do bigger deals, we could see those come down? Just looking -- what's the way to think about it?","Douglas K. Howell","I think that, that number kind of on a recurring basis. The disadvantage on some of these costs, is internationally, you don't get to deduct them for tax purposes, [indiscernible]. You'll see the reason why there's very little tax benefit associated with those items in the financial statements.","Our run rate of maybe $3 million a quarter after tax might be a typical run rate by us still doing nice tuck-in deals in the U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, that's where it will come from. But I wouldn't say if we -- if there's a large deal that happened some time in 2015, that would probably spike that number up a little bit.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then finally, when we look at the brokerage margin. Clearly, on EBITDAC basis, that's come up nicely. If we look year-to-date on a pretax basis, it's more even. And then fair and out, I mean, again, some of those costs we're talking about, and I know that's how you've always reported it, but those are more related to the Brokerage segment. So it almost seems like the margin, on a year-to-date basis pretax, has really come down, not gone up. Why? Am I off-base? And maybe I am off-base, if that's happened before. And two, I guess, how should we think about that?","Douglas K. Howell","Well, I think that because of the large amortization that goes along with our acquisitions, that can influence the pretax margins dramatically, so -- and the brokerage rents are typically -- I hate to say it, we spend very little time on the pretax number because of the amortization. Out of fairness, if you were going to do that, you probably should then put in the after-tax benefits that we're getting from clean energy against that also because those are funding deals, et cetera.","So we typically focus on EBITDA. If you really look at it on an EBITDA per share basis this year, there's been -- there was nice 15% growth in the quarter. If you wanted to assign the interest expense to that, we're still well into the double digits of growth. If you took all the interest and you assigned it 100% to the Brokerage segment, we're still above, I think, it's 12% or 13%, maybe 14% growth in that number. So typically, EBITDA per share is the way we look at it, and that pretax is pretty much still a function of how much you allocate to amortizable intangibles, the acquisitions. I think it's a tough metric to track, especially comparatively.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Right, that makes sense. And then as far as going to EBITDA, what was operating cash flow for year-to-date compared to year-to-date last year, if you have that? And if whichever [ph] for the quarter?","Douglas K. Howell","Well, as you know, using the GAAP cash flow statement that's provided is very difficult to use because of the changes in the premium accounts that -- the premium levels that we hold for our customers, so that's a tough. But generally, our cash flow tracks very close to EBITDA, and that is about 75%, and that gets you pretty close. I'd have to go through it and look at it. But that's kind of a nice metric to look at. But then, that's assuming you're paying tax on those items. Now, obviously, then you would add in the tax. If you want to put clean energy up in that, that changes the number then you basically can just take EBITDA, not too far off.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. So when we see the cash flow statements again, that some of those balances can move back and forth, right?","Douglas K. Howell","Yes. The underwrite method on a GAAP basis for a broker is a very difficult thing to use.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Yes, yes, okay. And then as we think about cash usage for next year. Again, cash flow is -- it looks like it should be growing a fair amount. Do you think, as we look at acquisitions in '15, will you have a -- use a higher component of cash compared to '14?","Douglas K. Howell","Absolutely. I think that next year, we have a capacity to do $500 million to $700 million worth of deals and not use any extra debt or stock.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Sean Dargan with Macquarie.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","Your brokerage margins were still pretty healthy despite these 70 basis points of headwinds identified in the press release. I'm just wondering what the difference between the 70 basis points and the 50 basis points you're talking about earlier or attributable to, and if they'll be recurring in future third quarters?","Douglas K. Howell","I think your question was, as last quarter, we have provided guidance with respect to or some thoughts on what the seasonality of the larger deals might produce in the fourth -- or in the third quarter. And we got 40 or 50 basis points of compression. They ended up being about 70 basis points, the seasonality ended up being about 70 basis points. Is that the crux of your question?","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","Yes.","Douglas K. Howell","The difference is this, is my guess was wrong probably by about 10 to 15 basis points. And on $175 million, I just probably undershot a little bit. The other piece of it is the accounting revenue recognition, when we pulled the historical basis statements, there are some accounts -- or on a historical basis, before we bought them, where they recognize monthly bill in advance, we recognize monthly bill on a monthly basis, so that caused a little bit, about another 10 basis points difference in my guess, but there's nothing substantially different.","There's also a mathematical anomaly in the 70 basis points versus 50, but we won't give it on the call here. But it's basically the same number, but I probably undershot a little bit last year.","That said, we still grew over the top of it and we even improved 90 basis points. So I probably under-guessed last quarter.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","Great, thanks. And I'm wondering if you've thought about what impact, if any, an Ebola pandemic would have on your business and to the P&C industry as a whole?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Well, I'll comment on that. This is Pat. I think that those -- that our underwriters have some concerns. They're spending some time again at the CIAB just a couple of weeks ago. When you think about just for, one example, workers compensation for hospitals. It's an issue. The good news is that we're brokers. We don't take that risk.","Douglas K. Howell","The other thing too is what's really interesting is that this is where our niche expertise, if you go back to the bird flu a number of years ago, we actually sponsored a lot of forms in our higher-end practice to discuss how the university risk managers came together. We organized that. We discussed what the universities would do in a situation of this. So underlying this in our niche businesses, our niche practice leaders are thinking about this everyday. They're talking to our client. And this is exactly what Pat was saying earlier about when people recognize the capabilities of Gallagher that you get with this. You're not going to have a smaller broker that's convening, that has the risk management departments from 60 different universities around the country having this kind of dialogue about how they protect their students and their faculty. So your question actually is exactly the difference between using our capabilities versus a smaller guy.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So in looking at the U.S. market, I follow the U.S. stocks, I tend to understand it pretty well. In thinking about the U.K. SME market. Where is Gallagher positioned now? Where is Gallagher positioned in 5 years? Is this is a market that's a de-fragmenting market the same way the U.S. market is? And what's the scalability and outlook for Gallagher's U.K. business overall?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Well, I couldn't be more excited about it. And to your point, yes. The lion's share of the business that we have across the U.K., we have 70 offices across the U.K. now, is SME business. And it gives us tremendous opportunities. By the way, we're very good at that business and we really like that business, and we know how to make a lot of money at it, whether it's by breaking it down into affinity plays or whether it's just simply handling it in a very efficient manner. We're very good at that business.","So what we're going to see, I think is assimilation of the 2, actually 3 firms, Heath, Oval and Giles, which will take us the better part of another year or so to get everybody grounded in the same spot. We'll then be able to look at that SME business and see how a firm that's got that much of it should handle it. And as I said, we're very good at it right now, so we know how to improve the handling and structure of that business. And then, we're going to focus very heavily on growing it. And we're going to grow it about 2 different ways. One is we're going to be out in the street marketing every single day, telling people whether they're large or small, that we ought to be handle their brokerage. And secondly, we're going to buy firms that have good, solid SME business and fold them into our platform. So we're good at that in the United States. We're very good at that in Australia, New Zealand, the U.K. and Canada. And we see great opportunities to grow small and personal lines business globally.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So how does the market share stack up, the level of fragmentation, compared to the U.S. marketplace in that line of business?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Well, I'll give you an example. So in Australia now, I think we're probably the fourth largest player in Australia. We don't have a 10% market share. We think our market share is something like 5% to 7%.","In the U.K., we're probably the third largest player in that market, and we probably don't have a 25% market share. So the ability to do that business better than your smaller competitors who are handling it in a more traditional manner, gives you great opportunities to expand market share and to build efficiencies in the system.","Douglas K. Howell","With that volume to it, it also allows us to build a better product, so that will differentiate us at the [indiscernible] also.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Yes, Josh, let's put this in perspective. I'll be giving a presentation at SNL's, the conference next week in New York. If you go to the Insurance Information Institute, Robert Hartwig's operation, the estimation is that there's something like $4 trillion of premium. That's all life, health, property\/casualty, personalized, commercial, globally. We don't touch $50 billion of premium as an organization. We're third or fourth largest in the world and we don't touch, literally, 10%, not 2% market share. So what's our opportunity to expand? It's limitless.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So then taking that together, do you think that the growth rate of Gallagher's business organically or even inorganically in the U.K. is better, equal to, or less than what it is in the United States?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Well, I think it will be about the same, frankly. I mean, we're very active. United States has a leg up in the fact that since 1986, we've probably done 400 acquisitions and those people, for the most part, are still with us. And so our acquisition pipeline and our acquisition opportunities in the United States, where we believe there's something on the order of 30,000 brokers, most of them run by baby boomers, is probably a little greater than what we've got in terms of experience, spread and headcount in the U.K. So I would say probably, we've got better opportunities to grow in the U.S. through the acquisition process. But if you look at the flipside of that, is we're not as big in the U.K. So as a percentage basis, we should be able to continue to keep it going.","I just look at this whole thing and say, go back to the United States comment. If there are 30,000 agents and brokers in the U.S., and there are people that estimate there's 18,000, some estimate 30,000, I don't know what the right number is. To be number 100 on Business Insurance's list this past summer, you did $22 million in total revenue. So there's something like 17,900 agents and brokers in America that are smaller than $22 million? I think we got lots of room to expand.","Douglas K. Howell","Yes, and look how we've done 42 acquisitions year-to-date. We've done -- in the quarter, we did 18 smaller tuck-ins for $60 million of revenue, $3.5 million. Those are terrific shops. They've got great, great sales leadership in those operations. And by joining us, they get our capabilities, get access to our niches, get access to our technology, get access to our industry and functional experts in it. It's a great combination. if you're a guy that's running a $4 million shop in Peoria, Illinois, and you can get all the global resources that Gallagher has, that's a nice merger and that's a win-win for us both.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Josh, you raised a good point, because I think this is important. We don't talk about it much. Every time we get on these calls, everybody wants to focus on one number, that's organic, organic, organic. We're up 45% this quarter because we did a lot of great acquisitions with people who are staying with us. That's not easy. You can get 10 to 15 proposals to sell a $10 million business. We're fighting everyday, that's real growth, that's real growth. And when Doug says we did 18 tuck-in acquisitions in the quarter, we didn't have one closing that went awry, we didn't have one time a check didn't show up, we didn't have one group of people that didn't get set up on Oracle, we didn't have anybody whose results we weren't able to consolidate in the quarter. The backroom capabilities that we bring to this should not be underestimated. This isn't an easy thing for people to do. I'm incredibly proud of our acquisition engine that we've built here at Gallagher.","Operator","Our last question is coming from the line of Dan Farrell with Sterne Agee.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","You've mentioned your increasing efforts to try and get better compensation for what you do and not really -- and being indifferent if it's in standard commissions or contingents, et cetera. I was wondering if you could expand on that a little bit more and talk about what you're doing today that's different. And then also, are things like your global scale now and global platform and also systems and technology helping you do things that you maybe couldn't have done before in that area?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Great question, Dan. And the answer to that is yes, there's all kinds of capabilities that are coming from 2 things. One is size and scale. We're recognized now clearly by our larger trading partners as very large global players. And so it's kind of funny, I mentioned the CIAB conference. I've been going for 28 years. 28 years ago, if we asked for meetings with the larger trading partners, we didn't get them. They didn't have the time for us. Today, with over 21 meetings scheduled, we had to turn away probably 20 opportunities to have additional meetings. We just didn't have room on our dance card.","Secondly, the information and our capability of using SharePoint and data warehouses are just making us stronger and stronger in terms of knowing our book of business and looking at that book of business in different ways, and doing things that are beneficial to our clients. So for instance, based on the information that we've got, we've been able to create a better umbrella program for middle market clients. And we've basically said to a small handful of companies, if you'll write a stronger form for our clients, we think what we can do is then point you in the direction of the place in our network were those clients are, and you'll have a better opportunity to write them because you give a better coverage product to our clients.","Those are things we couldn't have done even 5 years ago. So scale, information, those are all playing to our benefit. And the fact that we are where we are globally is creating a lot of excitement by our insurance company partners.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","That's great. And then just a question on the small M&A activity in the quarter. What was the average multiple paid for those 18 deals? And then also, how would the average margin for all of those compare with your overall brokerage margins?","Douglas K. Howell","2 answers to that. And I'll give it to you for the 9 months and the 42 deals is that the simple average of the multiple is 5.81%. The weighted average multiple is 6.81%. We're not seeing a substantial number that -- the multiple difference isn't substantially different. The margin on it for the deals that we did is 30.4% on the ones that we did this quarter.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Robert, any other questions?","Operator","There are no other questions, Mr. Gallagher. I'll turn it back to you.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Okay. I'll just make a very brief closing comment. What can I say about a quarter that has adjusted revenues up 38%, all-in organic growth of 7.1%, adjusted EBITDAC up 43%, adjusted margins up 80 basis points and EPS up 15%. A terrific quarter, our team knocked the ball out of the park. And I just want to thank all of you for being with us this morning. Thank you for your questions. Our team is turned on, we're helping clients, we're bringing in new accounts everyday. And quite frankly, it's fun to be us right now. Thanks, Robert.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Some of the comments made during the conference call including answers given in response to questions may constitute forward-looking statements within the meanings of the Securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that will be discussed on this call and which are also described in the Company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Patrick Gallagher, Chairman, President and CEO of Arthur J Gallagher & Co. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.","Patrick Gallagher","I appreciate you joining us on our third quarter 2016 earnings call. Before I get down to some serious business, I have to start the call by saying, Go Cubs. With me this morning is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions. As I do every quarter, today we're going to touch on four key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value. Those four are; one, organic growth, two, growing our business through mergers and acquisition, three, improving our quality and productivity and four, maintaining a very unique Gallagher culture. The team executed on all four of these pillars this past quarter and on a year-to-date basis.","First, let me start with organic growth. In our brokerage segment, we closed at all in organic of 3.4%, up nicely over second quarter and right in line with our year-to-date organic of 3.6%. I recently returned from The Council of Insurance Agents & Brokers annual meeting where I met with more than 20 insurance carriers. Based on my conversations with carriers and consistent with our own experience in data, I continue to see the domestic pricing environment as stable. In fact, rate and exposure only had a little over one point of negative impact that our domestic property\/casualty renewals results in the third quarter.","I also spent time with our leadership teams in U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand over the past few weeks and pricing outside the U.S. remains broadly soft. So I see an environment for us that could lead to organic growth in the fourth quarter, similar to what we saw to the first nine months of this year. Clearly that depends on our new business in the fourth quarter and you may recall we did have a very large new business month in December 2015.","Let me breakdown our organic around the world. I\u2019m extremely pleased that every single division around the world posted organic growth in the quarter. Our sales culture is truly alive and well. Domestically we saw about 4% organic growth, within our retail P&C operation up 3%, wholesale was up 1% and benefits up nicely over 5%. We did experience some incremental pressure within our whole sale unit, driven by continued weak property pricing in the quarter. The domestic casualty lines pricing remained similar to last year. Exposure units are showing some offsetting some of the rate pressure.","Property\/casualty insurance market remains in level where our products teams can grow organically and outperform. Our employee benefit consulting operation continues to see great new business opportunities. This business could typically grow as more in the second half of the year and it did nicely here in the third quarter, an organic growth that\u2019s promising for the fourth quarter too. In August, we released the results of our annual Benefits Strategy & Benchmarking Survey, one of the largest of its kind, with over 3,000 U.S. employees participating. This type of thought leadership and research is of great value to our clients and invaluable when we\u2019re showing we\u2019re showing new prospects or vast capabilities and insights.","Let me move to our international brokerage operation. As I discussed in our July earnings call, in our September 23, Investor Day, all of our operation closely are working together, with integrated sales plans and are living and breathing our unique Gallagher culture. This quarter we saw 2% organic from our U.K. and Canadian teams and similar organic growth from our teams in New Zealand and Australia. This is simply excellent work as these international teams continue to grow through a rate and exposure headwind that is stiffer than we\u2019re seeing here domestically.","Next, let me move to merger and acquisition growth. The average size for the seven acquisitions this quarter was $4 million of revenue and at an average of 7.6 times EBITDAC, putting our year-to-date multiple at 7 times. Third quarter acquisition activity was a little slower than normal, but our pipeline remains very robust. We were approximately $90 million of revenue associated with agreed upon [ph] term sheets and another $140 million of revenues with term sheets issued being prepared. On that all of these transactions will close, I do think we\u2019ll catch up to a more normal phase of transactions during the fourth quarter.","Our pipeline is as strong as ever and is full of small independent entrepreneurs, with strong sales skill, excellent client relationships. Looking forward towards 2017, we\u2019ll continue to focus on smaller tuck in mergers where we believe we can create value by giving these professionals full access to our capabilities, expertise and resources. I want to stop and thank all of our new partners for joining us and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals.","So how did we do through the first three quarters in our brokerage segment? Over 9% total adjusted revenue growth of which 3.6 is organic, adjusted EBITDAC growth of 11%, adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 47 basis points and we continue to have an excellent merger and acquisition pipeline at fair multiples. I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with our nine months result in the brokerage segment.","Next, I\u2019d like to move to our risk management segment which is primarily Gallagher Bassett services. Risk management had a nice rebound from the second quarter, with organic back in positive territory. The turnaround from the second quarter is due to a smaller impact from performance bonus income and more normal pattern in the business. Client retention rate remains strong and client satisfaction both in the U.S. and internationally continues to enhance GBs reputation and standing with new sales results surpassing prior year.","Going forward for the risk management segment, we believe we can deliver positive organic in the fourth quarter and even better organic in 2017 as recent new business wins in Australia and the U.K. come on line. Our value proposition of delivering superior claim outcomes for clients will continue to be a differentiator of this business versus our competitors. Further, Gallagher Bassett is an excellent complement to our brokerage operations as it is another business that helps our clients manage and mitigate the total cost of risk.","Moving now to clean energy, once again we had an excellent quarter and we\u2019re three quarters into delivering nearly 15% growth in annual after tax earnings. Lastly, let me speak a bit on culture. I hope you had a chance to attend or to listen to our September Investor Day. Tom Tropp, our Chief FX and Sustainability Officer, discussed how our unique Gallagher culture drives shareholder value.","I truly hope you can take away from Tom\u2019s discussion; our culture directly contributes to our organic growth or distinguishes us from others in a highly competitive merger environment and hold as the basis for people coming together as a team to service clients consistently focused on doing the right thing. After the meeting we were asked, why culture wasn\u2019t in Tom\u2019s title. There\u2019s a simple answer that a Gallagher culture is every single person\u2019s responsibility and our culture continues to flourish.","Okay, another great quarter and an excellent first nine months. Over to you, Doug.","Doug Howell","All right thanks, Pat. Good morning, everyone. Like Pat said, we had another excellent quarter by the team. Today I have five items. We\u2019ll do a refresh on modeling revenues, some comments on margins, we\u2019ll do an update on winding down our integration efforts, then I\u2019ll move to clean energy results and I\u2019ll end with some comments on cash and capital management.","Okay, let\u2019s go to modeling revenues. I think just using the CFO commentary document that we posted on our IR website as follows, starting on Page 2 of the CFO commentary, adjusted fourth quarter 2015 revenues for the impact of foreign currency exchange that we currently estimate at about $29 million. Remember, start by adjusting fourth quarter \u201815, not \u201816, then apply your organic pick to that number.","Next, layering well over M&A revenues for mergers that we completed in the first nine month of this year; Page 5 of the CFO commentary shows that we estimate about $28 million rolling in, in the fourth quarter.","And then finally make your own pick for a new M&A revenue that might come from mergers we close here in the fourth quarter, but please remember to assume a mid-quarter closing date. Following these steps should help you from overall undershooting [ph] on revenues and avoid the related the EPS impact.","Okay, moving to margins, adjusted brokerage EBITDAC margin expanded 20 basis points in the quarter. We continue to get some margin uplift from our international operations, but overall margin expansion was a bit muted because we had some adverse domestic medical plan experience in the quarter, cost us about 20 basis points. It\u2019s unfortunate, but does happen from time to time.","Looking towards the fourth quarter, if we had 3% organic and I\u2019m not saying we will or we won\u2019t, we could hold margins flat with last year\u2019s fourth quarter or even squeak out a little expansion.","As for the risk management segment, margin of 16.8% was right in line with our expectation that we shared with you at our investor meeting in September. This is really great work by the team. With the return to low single digit organic in the fourth quarter, we see margins in the lower 17% range.","Now, let\u2019s move down to integration, we\u2019re nearly finished. We\u2019re about done combining the four large acquisitions we did in the U.K. You can see it in the numbers, third quarter integration costs were $0.04 this year versus $0.10 last year and in the CFO commentary document you\u2019ll see our fourth quarter estimates for integration are at about $0.03, also down from $0.10 in the fourth quarter of 2015.","I\u2019ll be back in London in a couple of weeks and I look forward to congratulating the team for a really, really terrific effort over this last year. And also I should - deserves mentioning here. Our Canadian merger is also substantially complete with their integration efforts, so it\u2019s a really nice work to those folks up in Canada too.","Moving next to clean energy, you heard Pat say that we had another excellent third quarter and we remain on track to deliver about 15% earnings growth over the last year. Warmer weather helped us beat our forecast in the third quarter, but production might be a little lower in the fourth quarter because we haven\u2019t seen much cold weather yet.","For example, you\u2019ll see that there\u2019s still a lot of green in the highway or rig way [ph] tonight. And don\u2019t forget that our production has not only reduced our current year taxes, but we have also generated $430 million of credit that are sitting in our balance sheet. Approximately, that\u2019s $430 million receivable from the government that will help us reduce our past taxes paid for many, many years. We believe this has meaningful value for the shareholders","We also have about $230 million of available cash on our balance sheet and as I commented on before, we\u2019re making really good progress on our bank account consolidation efforts that help us unlock available cash.","So looking forward, you heard Pat say that our M&A pipeline is strong. We got nice cash and nice cash flows developed. So I think that will fund our M&A activity for the remainder of this year with cash and debt.","As for 2017, I see even stronger cash flows, given integration will be behind us and we won\u2019t have real estate moves that we have this year either. So we should be well positioned in 2017 to continue funding M&A with free cash and debt.","So those were my comments and another great quarter and an excellent first nine months of the year. Thank you, Pat.","Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Doug. Donna, would you open the line for questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, the call is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Mark Hughes of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Hughes","Yeah, thank you very much. Good morning.","Patrick Gallagher","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Hughes","In the risk management business, could you talk about claims volume? Was there also an issue maybe headwinds on underlying claims?","Patrick Gallagher","Yeah, we\u2019re seeing some claim volume growth, but it\u2019s not as strong as it was a year ago. We\u2019ve seen about 1% growth in claims volume or claims activity down from probably 2, 2.5 this time last year.","Mark Hughes","And is that workers comp or is that overall?","Patrick Gallagher","Primarily workers comp and I think it - I believe the claim volume is an indicator of economic activity.","Mark Hughes","The benefit segment, sounds like you had good growth, I think you said 5%, any update on some of the exchange, additional help that client need, just some more detail would be good?","Patrick Gallagher","Yeah, sure and I\u2019ve said this many times. Personally, I was not in favor for our country to - I was not a proponent of a volume care, but for companies putting the greatest thing in a room. So it\u2019s helped our merger and acquisition activity and it\u2019s a very, very complicated act and what that does is created an awful lot of consulting opportunities for us, our clients need a lot of help. The exchange is one of the things that we help our clients take a look at as they decide how they\u2019re going to treat their employee base. We look really at what we\u2019re doing from a consulting standpoint as a view of the total rewards that a client is going to use to maintain the employment of their best people. Really when you come down to it, every business is all about people and so you\u2019ve to look at the entire list of benefits that you\u2019re going to provide and then figure out how you\u2019re going to actually work the health insurance into that. So exchange is popular, we\u2019ve got probably about 15% of our clients out there taking a serious look at our exchange and the rest treat their insurance in a more traditional manner.","Mark Hughes","And one thing that the Northeast of Ohio native go tribes [ph].","Patrick Gallagher","Good for you Mark.","Operator","Thank you, our next question is coming from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good morning. First, in terms of the organic, I appreciate all the opening commentary, so it seems like you\u2019re pointing to appropriate growth about in line with the year-to-date level which would be about I guess 3.6%, so little bit of an uptick eventually. Within that how do you see I guess, going into the Q4 as well as into \u201817, the components domestic and internationally you think - both should continue to pick up a little bit.","Patrick Gallagher","Well, domestically we\u2019re seeing a pretty stable market which has been a stable market now for about five years, which is pretty unusual in my carrier and I think it's a very good thing for our clients. The past is hard and soft market cycle that we lived through for the last literally four years that doesn't benefit quiets at all. So today we've got a stable market domestically, a softer market internationally, so what I see is continued international 1% to 2% organic and hopefully closer to 4% to 5% domestically.","Doug Howell","Yeah, I think on that year-to-date, excuse me the fourth quarter 3.6 number that you threw out there. Remember we did have a big December new business quarter.","Patrick Gallagher","Last year.","Doug Howell","Last year, so I think that 3.6 might be on the upper end of that.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay great. And then the 1% to 2% and the 4% to 5% that you're referencing domestic and internationally that would apply to 2017 as well?","Patrick Gallagher","I think so.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay great. And then in terms of the acquisition pipeline, you did mention a bunch of deals with term sheet. How do you see the multiples on those deals, I mean I didn't notice that multiples that you guys are paying did kick up a little bit in the quarter, you attribute that to potentially a slowdown in the activity or is just taking longer I guess to get these deals fully signed.","And then combined to that I guess if the deal flow does if these deals do not materialize would you guys consider repurchasing shares sooner rather I know in the past maybe end of 2017. Could that be pushed forward if these deals not materialized?","Patrick Gallagher","Yes, let me be clear about this. First of all, we see three uses of our cash. And we've said this literally for the - more than last decade. The first is we're going to buy brokers. Secondly we're paying dividends. And the third they were introduced to our stock back. So if in fact for whatever reason the acquisition activity slows down and we're going to maintain our pricing discipline around our acquisition activity.","Been here before 20 years ago the banks pushed prices always through the roof and we had a bit of a slowdown on acquisition activity while they were doing that. They got their ability [ph] full private equity will eventually as well, but if we have excess cash we will buy our stock back.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay great.","Doug Howell","Sounds for the multiple if you look at your year-to-date, we're still about seven times, is a little higher seven, six, I don't see there is are multiple pressure out there or pricing pressure out there, but I think there's a lot of sellers out there that see as that bring substantial capabilities to them that are willing to sell at a fair price. So those are the ones that we're going to be going out. Nice entrepreneurial tuck-in folks that are willing to take a fair price and understand that together we can be better.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay great. And then one other question I noticed on the revenue head from currency did go up in the fourth quarter although the EPS impact did not change, how do you think about I guess the head between revenue and expenses and what kind of currency hit we might be on earnings as we start given where exchange rates are to say as we start to think about 2017?","Doug Howell","Yes, the uptick from our September 23 guidance and because of the further strengthening of the dollar versus the pound. We do have a little bit of a natural hedge in the U.K. because we had dollar denominated revenues and pound denominated expenses at service those revenues, so that's why we ended up with the minimis amount of impact on our EPS. And I would see right now, I don't know if the pounds going lower or not, but I would say that that trend would continue then that you could have an impact on revenues, but not that much impact on EPS.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay that\u2019s great. Thank you very much.","Patrick Gallagher","Thanks Elyse.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Chai Goyal","Hi this is Chai Goel [ph] for Kai. First question contingents and supplements. You have grown and 10% to 20% year-to-date. So could you talk a little bit of what\u2019s driving there?","Doug Howell","Yes, I think there's a couple things on it, I think it's a great question. If you listen to our September 23 IR Day I got on my eye horse a little bit about supplementals and contingents versus base contingent - base commissions and fees. I think that you should evaluate us using them all inorganic release combined a basin supplemental, because contingents can be a little volatile.","Like I said in September, it's important for everybody to understand in one year we may place a piece of - place a policy what a carrier that has a strong base commissions and doesn't pay much in supplementals, the next year that policy might be better for the customer to be placed with another carrier that pays higher supplementals and a lower base or maybe that carrier would pay a contingents to that.","We are completely indifferent and how that gets classified in our financial statements as long as we're being compensated appropriately and with full transparency to our clients. We\u2019ve got to do the right thing for our clients first, and we can't worry about where that gets posted in our financial statements. So we have had strong growth in supplementals and contingent. And I think that's basically the carrier\u2019s preference on that rather than paying based commissions at this point.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, so I guess one of your peers did comment that the contingents could decline as popped [ph] up your declines. So how do you see that in 2017?","Doug Howell","Well, I don't see much of a difference in our contingents be getting paid in the first part of 2017 based on our 2016 performance.","Unidentified Analyst","And have I think contingents have a higher margin, so can you quantify how much they could have held year-to-date?","Doug Howell","The contingents and supplemental are higher margin for us. How much have they affected us year-to-date, they might have help margins I get a pop in number here and look at it, but may 15 basis points something like that of our 47 basis points margin expansion year-to-date maybe a third of that came from contingents.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thank you.","Doug Howell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you our next question is coming from Bob Glasspiegel of Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed with your question.","Patrick Gallagher","Good morning Bob.","Bob Glasspiegel","Good morning, Arthur Gallagher team.","Patrick Gallagher","Good morning Bob.","Bob Glasspiegel","Just curious about - Pat, we've had four months post Brexit vote, now we\u2019ve got ability of seen how the world is changing. Curious what you think this does to your U.K. operation Lloyds as a center of gravity in that\u2019s going to be a movement to Ireland a little bit on the margin for you in the world?","Patrick Gallagher","No, I don't think so. I think from an insurance perspective, I think it's going to be pretty much of a nonevent. Now that's early days and obviously we're monitoring all that, and I think that the people in the city of London are very concerned with what this means to the financial world, but from an insurance perspective the expertise is in London people have traded in that with that expertise for 300 years and I don't see it moving.","Bob Glasspiegel","And any impact to sort of U.K. business flow that you've seen to date.","Patrick Gallagher","No actually not. The only real impact has been the impact of the Sterling decline.","Bob Glasspiegel","Right. Yeah that's consistent with my perspective that I mean U.K. to leave U.K. becomes a little bit more painful with currency where it is, that you're definitely moving to a high expire expense.","Patrick Gallagher","I don't - I don't see, I really don't see any reason for anyone to decide that they have to move. That's going to differ by people in different industries, but when it comes to insurance the Lloyds and London insurance community was been incredibly strong before the E.U. and that will be strong afterwards.","Bob Glasspiegel","Thank you, wishing you a productive and fruitful and fun weekend.","Patrick Gallagher","It is going to be fun. Let's hope we win. Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Josh Shanker","Yes, thank you very much. So I don't have to remind you little more, little less than a year ago you guys might have touch some comments that got people concerned about 2016. It's been a great 2016 for Gallagher.","Patrick Gallagher","Thank you.","Josh Shanker","Let\u2019s talk about 2017 now. Compared to how you felt about the year ahead last year. How are you feeling right now, managed with guidance, but your gut was very concerned I think a year ago. Turned out to be probably over concerned, do you have any thoughts on the year-over-year change?","Patrick Gallagher","Yeah I'm very bullish on 2017, and you're exactly right Josh, you read my sentence well, finishing up last year I was a little bit concerned and then we ended up and we haven't had an incredible new business quarter in the fourth quarter last year, a really proud of the team.","And I see the pipeline we use salesforce.com I can look into that pipeline virtually all our niches are strong, the business, the new business opportunities are strong. Now we're going to close them, we\u2019re going to close it out, but I think 2017 will be another record year.","Josh Shanker","Very good and a couple months ago I asked you about health care exchanges and you said that you were broadening your offering or you may be on discussion with a couple health care exchange that currently you don't use. Can you talk about how what that broadening is like and maybe give us some details on what your plans might be yet?","Patrick Gallagher","Yes, in fact Josh, I appreciate the question very much. I'm really proud of our benefits team for how we position ourselves. I think we took a lot of heat two to three years ago about not investing heavily in the technology to create our own exchange. And what we said to the investment community and to our clients at that time is that we're consultants. We're going to use exchanges where they're appropriate for our clients and we're going to have one to two to maybe even more exchanges than that as appropriate for opportunities for clients to deal with their exposures.","And we're going to remain consultants we're not going to be a product sales firm, and I think that's really worked out well force, as it were viewed in the market as helping clients sort through all their opportunities. We have a very nice partnership with [indiscernible] and we also have other exchanges that we're working with. And whatever is the most appropriate method of handling the client's exposures in health insurance we're going to bring that to the table, and I think that's the right position for a consultant.","Josh Shanker","What are the other vendors you're working with do for you that [indiscernible] doesn\u2019t do for you?","Patrick Gallagher","Different geographies, different people on the platform, different - just a different approach.","Josh Shanker","And are they competitive module or is it an obvious thing that if client A needs an exchange we\u2019re going to go through this provider versus client B who has these issues of obvious that they're [indiscernible] on customer.","Patrick Gallagher","Yep, that's exactly right.","Josh Shanker","Okay, thank you.","Patrick Gallagher","Thanks Josh.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming Quentin McMillan of KWB. Please proceed with your question.","Quentin McMillan","Hi, just have a numbers related question, Doug the M&A schedule that you've given in CFO commentary is great, but could you just talk for the deals that you've closed now, what would that number look like for 2017, not necessarily on a quarterly basis, but just for the revenue that's going to flow through into the next year?","Doug Howell","Let me see if I can dig that out, if you go to like I said page five of that commentary sheets sorry that here, the role over impact into next year, right now we've closed deals totaling about $97 million, so I think just what we've got in the pipeline $50 million of it should show up next year plus whatever we close in the fourth quarter will show up also.","Quentin McMillan","And as you said in the fourth quarter looks -","Doug Howell","That would be 10 months of that whatever we close this fourth quarter so.","Quentin McMillan","Okay great. And then if I could just shift to the follow-up on the contingents and supplemental commission question. Just on a bigger picture thought because I get what you're trying to get at that you don't really care how a client may be compensating you guys, but can you just talk is the commission percentage we use sort of the back of the envelope 10% if that sounds about right here. But this is the overall commission percentage when you add in the contingents and supplementals about the same more less than you're seeing?","Doug Howell","I guess I don't understand the question, Quentin do that again. Is that commission more or less if we have a supplemental?","Quentin McMillan","What I'm saying is, you're saying that the client is paying you a commission plus a supplemental on top of it would that overall number equate to the 10% whether you had the supplemental or you didn't have the supplemental it's more about we're going to get sort of a percentage of the overall premium and that percentage is held fairly constant.","Doug Howell","No I think if you have a supplement or contingent you probably get an extra two points.","Quentin McMillan","Okay great.","Doug Howell","And that's was very important. That's completely transparent with the client and they agree that we can accept that.","Quentin McMillan","All right. That's all I have thanks very much guys.","Doug Howell","Thanks, Quentin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Adam Klauber of William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Adam Klauber","Hi thanks, good morning everyone.","Patrick Gallagher","Morning.","Adam Klauber","Wholesale business in general is holding up pretty well, could you tell us what's driving that despite the market getting more competitive, and are the standard carriers beginning to inch in more in the last couple months and they were earlier in the year?","Patrick Gallagher","I'll take those backwards. The answer to your to the second question on the standard carriers inch in and the answer is yes. That puts pressure on us as wholesaler. Retailers are given to want to place their own business if they don't need to wholesaler, so that that's a headwind. You also have the headwind of the property rights, and I don't think Matthew is going to make any difference those rates whatsoever. So we're going to continue to face softness there. And the reason it's growing is because we're just really good at what we do and we're getting a lot more business both from our own retailers as well as people in the field.","Adam Klauber","Okay thanks. As far as the overall U.S. P&C market, commercial market seems like the competitive level is relatively rational we're hearing rates down flat to maybe 2% to 3% not too bad. Are you seeing any change in the last environment or are they still relatively robust still relatively stable?","Patrick Gallagher","Yeah I think so. We see toward inflation that continues. I don't see frequency going much, automobile is a struggle, every one of our carriers as we meet with them is really shaking their heads at what's going on in the auto world. And it's interesting because what they're finding is they research their data is distracted drivers. We get everybody on their devices out there crashing into each other.","Adam Klauber","Right, right. And you mentioned toward inflation could you just maybe give us a bit more color and that what you're hearing?","Patrick Gallagher","Well, what we're seeing is, it's the classic litigation environment. I mean, I don't have a percentage to put on it Adam, but the litigation continues to grow and the cost of that litigations are more expensive.","Adam Klauber","Okay, thanks a lot.","Patrick Gallagher","Thank you, Adam.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Charles Sebaski of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Sebaski","Thank you. Good morning.","Patrick Gallagher","Good morning.","Charles Sebaski","May I have missed this somebody asked about it before, but I'm just trying to get through I know you guys have repurchased some shares to offset some issuance, but the M&A activity to date would seem below your capacity and so it would seem like there's unless there's particularly heavy fourth quarter that there's capacity for share reduction, and I am just curious if I'm adding that up properly and in terms of your cash flow generation and what you're doing?","Patrick Gallagher","Yes. Good question. I think that there is two headwinds against our cash flow this year, the integration costs were still there that we recall we did some substantial moves in the U.K as we consolidate operations there and we're doing some big moves here in the U.S. as we have moved into a different Chicago base building. So those costs have forced against cash flow this year, they won't be there next year. So next year we should have substantially more capacity than what you're seeing on the surface this year.","I think M&A opportunities there's tons of them there, and we are - again we just want to make sure we're picking the right partners to join us. But like that said there's $250 million worth of deals sitting on the plate right now for the fourth quarter that we can see how and some really nice success with those coming into the first part of the year.","Traditionally our first quarter is the smallest. So we could see a little there, but also it depends on how the election goes, you could have a sentiment that moves against capital gain treatment on sale of the businesses, so that\u2019s the case you could get a little bit of a rush to the door by the end of this year are certainly before the legislature gets working next - you can being in January.","So I think there's a good opportunities, there's still fair pricing out there, that immense market people are seeing our capabilities, so if we have a little while right now, I wouldn't worry about it long term.","Charles Sebaski","Okay, but if I thought about you guys hear this year kind of $90 million of acquired revenue year-to-date outside of kind of the Brexit and the headquarter relocation would have thought like at that level we probably would have seen a bit more in share repurchase activity is that?","Patrick Gallagher","No I think, I think if you look at my commentary if you go back maybe at the beginning of the year we had $100 million of cash in our balance sheet. We now got $230 million something like that.","Doug Howell","Some of that over and some of that overseas, so I don't want do is repatriate that money to got a lot of acquisition activities overseas so that might be what's causing your - perhaps [indiscernible] inyour model.","Charles Sebaski","Okay. And then more on operational side, I know it's not huge numbers in, but it seems like the compensation expense kicking up a little bit, just curious on a more overall basis I suppose, the quarter are you seeing pressure on compensation both from like external in terms of the competitive dynamic people interested in your people other things, is there expectation that there might be compensation pressure going into 2017?","Doug Howell","Yeah, that\u2019s a great question. If you recall back in our September 23 IR meeting day, I said that the race is typically get there are given in the latter half of the year, so some of that\u2019s hitting us right now here in the third and the fourth quarter and then we also had benefit expense that we had a little adverse development on our benefit program in really July and August, we didn\u2019t see that in September again, so that\u2019s pressure. Is there overall pressure in the market place? Yes, I think skill positions are expensive, we\u2019re going up in some of the IT\u2019s, security areas and there\u2019s always competition for really good brokerage talents skill. There\u2019s a little wage inflation, we have an opportunity to continue push forward kind of our centers of excellence primarily in India and the Philippines and so we have an opportunity to maybe reduce the impact of the domestic wage inflation by continuing to move offshore to our folks over there. So we have an opportunity to control, but there is a little bit of inflation out there in the market place.","Charles Sebaski","And then finally, I recall a quarter or couple of quarters back that you mentioned that on the some of the international acquisitions that there was a pressure [ph] of bank accounts and trapped capital that you and your team were having to work through to aggregate and free up if you will. I\u2019m just wondering where that process is and is there still left to go on?","Doug Howell","Yeah, good progress is being made on that. We\u2019re down over 30% in our accounts and we\u2019ve got a list of about another 60 accounts for another maybe 10% that are going to be wound out by the end of the year and then I think most of that by the mid part of next year should done. Part of that is freeing up that excess cash internationally that\u2019s coming from that exercise, so we\u2019re making towards that progress. I was in Glasgow, what we do a lot of that work in September and the team\u2019s got a really good eye to get that done by the mid part of \u201817.","Charles Sebaski","Thank you very much.","Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Charles. Danna, any other questions.","Operator","We\u2019re showing no additional questions at this time. Do you have any additional or closing comments today?","Patrick Gallagher","Yes, I do. I\u2019ll just make a quick comment. Thank you again for being with us this morning. As we\u2019ve done all year and in the past, our focus remains on executing on each component of our value creation strategy. We\u2019re going to grow organically, we\u2019re going to grow through acquiring best of the best brokers, we will improve our quality and our productivity and we\u2019re going to continue to invest in our culture. I\u2019m pleased with the first three quarter of 2016 and I\u2019m excited about wrapping up 2016 and delivering a fantastic year next year 2017. Thank you everyone for being with us this morning.

Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Some of the comments made during this conference call, include answers given in response to questions, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties discussed on this call or described in the company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Patrick Gallagher, Chairman, President and CEO of Arthur J. Gallagher & Company. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thank you very much. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the Heads of our operating divisions.","As I do each quarter, I'm going to touch on the four key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value. These are, number one, organic growth, we are an aggressive sales team; number two, growing through mergers and acquisitions; number three, improving our productivity and quality; and fourth, maintaining our unique culture.","We had an excellent start to 2018. During the first quarter, we delivered strong total revenue growth, excellent organic revenue growth, steady growth from our tuck-in merger and acquisition strategy and continued margin expansion. This puts us in a great position for another outstanding year.","Let me start with some comments about our Brokerage segment. First quarter organic was 4.9% all in reflecting strong growth across all of our divisions globally. Let me give you some more detail. In the U.S., our Brokerage business generated 4.5% organic in the first quarter, with retail up 4% and wholesale up 7%. U.S. property casualty pricing was a modest positive across many lines during the first quarter. Property and commercial auto are seeing the largest price increases up 3% to 5%, casualty and specialty lines are flat up 2% while workers' comp is flat to down about a point.","Insured exposures are trending higher which is consistent with recent data points of U.S. economic activity. So far in April, pricing is similar to the first quarter with some upward movement in property and commercial auto. Internationally, property casualty organic growth was about 6% in the quarter. Australia, New Zealand were up around 6%, Canada was about flat and our UK businesses generated organic of about 8%. Property casualty insurance pricing in Australia, New Zealand is in the mid-single digit range with strength across all classes. Our UK and Canadian operations are seeing a flattish pricing environment while rates in our London specialty operations seem to be nearing a bottom.","Our employee benefits business also had a strong quarter, generating organic revenue growth of around 5%. So when I sum it all up around the world, it looks like rate and exposure together are giving our organic growth a slight positive tailwind, call it a bit below 1%. This is a change from a year ago when rate and exposure were flattish or a modest headwind. This bodes well for 2018, which means we should be able to post similar or slightly better organic than we did in 2017.","Second, mergers and acquisitions. In the quarter, we completed six brokerage acquisitions, which should add about $27 million of annualized revenue. These new partners see our vast capabilities, they embody our culture and they see themselves being more successful together with Gallagher. I would like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals.","Looking forward, our merger and acquisition pipeline is full of many attractive tuck-in opportunities, totaling about $400 million of revenue, associated with almost 60 term sheets either agreed upon or being prepared. Now, we don't expect all of these acquisitions to close. However, we believe, we will get our fair share.","Third, productivity and quality. Adjusted EBITDAC margin was up 49 basis points in the quarter, a really nice result on organic of about 5%. The Brokerage team is working hard to find efficiencies across the organization and further leverage our scale. We discussed a number of opportunities at our March Investor Day, including optimizing our approach to small business, harmonizing our management systems and further improving through standardization and automation. All these will help us become better, faster and deliver higher-quality service to our clients.","So for the first quarter of our Brokerage segment, we delivered 8% total adjusted revenue growth of which 4.9% is organic, adjusted EBITDAC growth of 9%, and adjusted EBITDAC margin of 34.8%, up 49 basis points over the prior year. Another really, really solid performance by the Brokerage team.","Next, I would like to move to our Risk Management segment, which is primarily Gallagher Bassett. First quarter organic growth was 7.7%, domestic organic was 5%, while international posted over 20% fueled by an excellent new business quarter.","The Gallagher Bassett team recently returned from the annual RIMS conference where we hosted more than 100 prospect and client meetings over the course of three days. The team showcased advancements in LUMINOS, our leading risk management information system and launched several new products at RIMS. For example, we rolled out GB Care, our best-in-class workers compensation medical management platform and GB Litigation Defense, our comprehensive defense counsel performance score card just to name a couple.","Overall, RIMS was a very successful event and further demonstrated our analytical outcome focused approach to claims management. So with organic over 7% in the quarter, an exciting array of new product offerings, some nice specialty mergers in the pipeline and a sense of excitement and momentum after RIMS, we see our Risk Management segment posting mid-single digit organic and margins in the mid 17% range.","And finally, I'll touch on our true differentiator. Number four, our culture. Just a few weeks ago, Gallagher was recognized by the Ethisphere Institute as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies for the seventh year in a row. We are the sole insurance broker recognized and we are honored to be one of only 135 companies globally to receive the award. Seven years in a row of receiving this prestigious award is a testament to our professionals who dedicate themselves to delivering the highest level of expert advice and quality service, all grounded in the Gallagher way, a list of 25 key tenets and values that articulate our unique culture, a culture that is grounded in teamwork, ethics and outstanding client service across our 27,000 sales and service professionals around the world.","Okay, a really strong quarter, a terrific start to the year. I'll stop now and turn it to Doug. Doug?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks, Pat and good afternoon everyone. As Pat said, what a terrific start to 2018. So today I'll spend most of my time reviewing the CFO commentary document that we post on our website. Also, as an overarching reminder, all the numbers in our earnings release, our investor supplement and the CFO commentary documents have been restated to reflect the implementation of the new accounting standards for revenue recognition. We hope the materials we provided in connection with our April 11 special investor call were helpful as you updated your models.","Today before I plunge in, in the room today as we have been for the last 15 years and each and every one of these quarterly calls is Jack Lazzaro. Today marks Jack's 40th anniversary with Gallagher. Jack is our global treasurer and CFO of our clean energy efforts. Jack has held about every finance role at Gallagher over the last four decades. He was instrumental in our IPO, he let our implementation of Sarbanes-Oxley and he was one of our handful of folks that helped launch our clean energy efforts. A sincere thanks Jack for all of your hard work and dedication.","Okay, let's move to page two of the CFO commentary, some takeaways from page two. First, it's still looking like we'll get a small tailwind from FX this year based on current exchange rate. Second, you'll see that we did have some additional lease termination cost as we optimize our footprints around the world. We might have some later in the year also, but we don't have an estimate at this time. And third for the first time in a number of years, we have absolutely no integration costs. This is really nice work by the team to get those efforts squarely behind us.","Let's get to page 3 to the Corporate segment. We are now providing our quarterly estimates for the remainder of 2018. That's the far right pink columns. Recall that we only provided full-year estimates during our March 14th Investor Day as we had not yet released our restated new GAAP numbers. Those March 14th numbers are shown in the grey columns. Here are the takeaways on page three. First, compare the March 14th full estimates on the grey box to the full year pink box at the bottom of the page. You'll see that our full year estimates have not changed dramatically for three of the five lines. There's no real change on the clean energy, M&A or corporate lines. As for the interest expense line, you'll read in footnote 2 that we plan to close the debt offering in late June. Accordingly, we have updated our estimate for interest expense for the third and the fourth quarter.","And finally, you'll see a line called impact of U.S. tax reform. As we digest the new tax legislation, technical corrections interpretations and lawmakers consider amendments. We could be refining our December 31st, 2017 estimates as well as more fully understanding future effects. Accordingly, we will have some tweaks over the course of 2018, as we did here in the first quarter. The important takeaway is that these items regardless of their book expense or a book benefit, they most likely will not impact cash taxes we pay. This is because we have our clean energy and AMT tax credit carry-forward, about $730 million at March 31st in fact. So we will not be paying much of any U.S. federal income tax for many years to come.","So this quarter, it's a small book expense, but not really a use of cash. While we're talking about cash at the end of March, we had around $350 million of available cash on our balance sheet. We'll get another net $400 million from our debt offering in June, and also our cash flows for the rest of the year are traditionally stronger than in the first quarter. So we should have plenty of cash for M&A this year.","Few other comments as you build your models going forward. First, the Brokerage segment adjusted margins were up 50 basis points in the first quarter and 4.9% organic growth. As I already said in the past probably won't have margin expansion if organic is below 3%. You should see some margin expansion if organic is over 4% and probably flattish margins in between; second, Risk Management adjusted margins. You'll see in the footnotes in the earnings release that we would have posted about 17.2%, but we have a small make-whole settlement on a claim that costs us about $1.5 million.","We really hate these things. They don't happen very often, but are nearly $10 billion of claims that we pay annually from time to time, we don't get it exactly perfect. Looking forward, we're still targeting margins in the mid-17% range for the rest of the year.","So those are my comments, it's clearly a great start to the year. Looking ahead at it together 5.3% combined organic growth in our Brokerage and Risk Management segment was solid margin expansion, an extremely active merger pipeline with 300 tuck-in opportunities on our deal list, a strong cash position and we have an unstoppable culture. Clearly, you can hear that I'm excited about the rest of 2018 and beyond. Back to you, Pat.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks, Doug. Omer, let's open it up for questions now and hopefully some answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good evening. My first question, so pretty strong organic growth quarter about 5% in Brokerage. Doug, I remember in March you had said that the Q1 might seasonally be a weaker quarter. I'm not sure it maybe that change when you adopted revenue recognition, but it seems like you're meeting your guidance kind of in line with the full year level, which is about 4.4%, so what could change or is it just you know embedding a level of conservatism, and will the Q1 still seasonally be a weaker quarter post rev rec?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Three things on that. As I think that with a such a heavy weighted new GAAP first quarter, we probably won't see that kind of lower seasonality in the first quarter that we had in the past. But it will take us a year or two years probably to figure that out. In terms of our guidance going forward, I think, what the rate tailwinds that we're seeing, exposure growth growing, you know, a little tailwind for that I think, that we'll see a full year 2018, a lot like 2017, but a little bit better. So if we're in the mid 4s, maybe we're in upper 4s, this will be added to interpret that at this point.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then in terms of margin, so about 50 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter, nothing that you would call that's one-off there, so meaning if you know organic kind of was in line with the first quarter level, would you expect the same level of margin improvement for the rest of the year or just somehow the shifting of more employee benefits to the Q1 impact the margin improvement in the first quarter compared to other quarters?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Okay, a couple questions there. Yes, maybe may be a little bit fueled by the strong employee benefit first quarter, but you know, maybe 10 basis points, something like that. Looking forward, we typically see most of our margin expansion that happens in the first half of the year. And then in the second half of the year, if we get into mid-year raises or whatever, we don't see quite as much margin expansion in the last half of the year. But I think that for above 4%, there's some opportunities that continue to expand margins there.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then one last question, so you pointed to the strong cash position and you guys are adding some debt this year. So yeah I mean I know this is a question that's been asked in the past. If deals don't materialize that would use the available cash that you will have, which will include proceeds in the recent offering. I guess when do you think you get to the point where share repurchase I think maybe becomes something that moves higher up on the list or is the pipeline that strong that you could just see it using all of your cash on hand during the remainder of this year?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","The pipeline is that strong. In the event that we do have excess cash for the end of the year, we would repurchase stock, but our pipeline is pretty strong right now.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thank you, Elyse.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks, Elyse.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Hughes, SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah, thank you. On the pipeline question, I think you said $400 million. Am I my right, remembering it was about $300 million last quarter, is there usually a seasonal uptick in that or is that just underlying strength and if so, what's going on?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","It wobbles all over the place, Mark. We're constantly out talking to people. Some take 10 years to close, others you can get done in six, seven months, so it just \u2013 it rises and falls with the people that are coming on and off the list. There's no real magic to it.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","It is the...","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Closings tend to be a little slower in the first quarter because there's usually a push to get something done by year-end. So historically we've closed more deals in the last three quarters of the year than in the first.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And is the debt raise, is that a reflection of your increased optimism? Would you have done it regardless if you weren't seeing the strength in the pipeline?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","I think it's our confidence in the pipeline.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And then, the contingents were \u2013 you had a nice lift last quarter and then were down a little bit this quarter. How should we think about those on a go-forward basis?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah. I think that listen, we would have \u2013 I think if you add supplementals and contingents together, we're at somewhere around about $85 million compared to $83 million last year, up about 2.3%. If we would have had another $1 million, $1.5 million, we would have been about 4%. I wouldn't read too terribly much into that at this point. But, they're growing 2.5%. Maybe next quarter they'll grow a little more or right in that same range. So I wouldn't overthink it too much.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Peters at Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good afternoon. Thanks for the call.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Good afternoon.","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","A couple questions. First of all, Doug, back to your opening comments. I don't want to parse words here. You talked about the 50-basis point improvement in margins and the fact that 3% organic and you can't expand margins 3% or less in organic growth. It seemed like the language changed a little bit though because now all of a sudden, you threw out this 4% bogey that you can expect margins to expand beyond 4%, but not really below 4%. So maybe I just misheard it or you can clarify that.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","No. I think, you've heard \u2013 I don't \u2013 I have said it a couple times before, but we're in that range right now where as we look the way our margins are positioned, we have opportunities to reinvest in the business in certain areas that we think will fuel growth. And so at 3% pretty tough to do, at 4%, it kind of just happens in between, one quarter it might be up a little bit, one quarter might be flat. But I \u2013 so the words change probably compared to where we were three or four years ago, but in the last couple times we've had a chat about, that's kind of where we feel right now.","Obviously, if we had sustained 3.3% organic growth for the next five years, you'll probably see some natural growth in margins, but you also have to look at wage inflation, cost inflation, so that's why I was saying probably in that 3% to 4% range, flattish, up a little bit or flat is probably where we are. Over 4% I think it just naturally happens.","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Perfect. Thanks for the clarification. And then I wanted to go back to just the pipeline. It really seems to be like you're laying out a pretty positive outlook there. And so every time, we turn around and talk to others in the marketplace, we hear about just such intense competition for M&A, and we hear about private equity involvement. And so I'm trying to bridge the gap between intense competition around price for M&A. And then you're growing pipeline, and I'm wondering maybe if it ties in with the interest deductibility in tax reform or what variables there are helping to drive your more positive outlook on M&A for 2018?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Greg. This is Pat. Primarily a couple things. First of all, the capabilities that we've developed are second to none. And so if you're going to look at a private equity roll-up or something like that, the cash numbers are what they are. If that's the direction you want to go in, great. But if you really are excited about expanding your business, if it's something that you love this business, you love to sell, you've been in a town, you've had a small firm and you can't walk into the university and start talking about their insurance. You're not going to get past the first door. We do a ton of those types of accounts. There's not an account on the planet right now anywhere in the world of any size that we can't do and that turns people on. The analogy I use all the time is when you come for a visit, I am going to show you the candy store and there's people who buy into that.","And then, secondly these folks, many of them are hypersensitive to culture. They want to land their people in a place that feels like them and you can't do that in a private equity world. So we don't win them all and I'm not sitting here today with this pipeline saying, we're going to close them all, but we're competing on a different story and when that story resonates with people, by the way we're not asking them to give up a boatload of money, we will help them sell and grow and they'll make their earn out. So it's not like we're not competitive. But, the fact is the people who buy into those two things tend to join us.","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for that color. And one final question for you. Doug, in your CFO commentary when we get back to the grey or \u2013 I forgot grey boxes or pink boxes as it relates to the Corporate segment. And I look at the bottom numbers there for the full year. It looks like you've lowered the range from a loss of $21 to a gain of $1 to a loss of $42.4 to a loss of $19.4. Am I missing something there? Is that all of the interest expense or is there something else there?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah. If you look at the five lines, clean energy hasn't moved hardly at all. Corporate hasn't moved at all. M&A hasn't moved at all. It's the additional interest expense that we will get on the new debt and then we have the $6 million impact of tax reform. Those are the two lines out of those five that have shifted.","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Perfect. Thanks for the color.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Sure.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you and good afternoon. So my \u2013 I just want to follow-up on both revenue growth, organic growth as well as the margin. On the organic front, Pat, you mentioned like this year probably about 1 point of tailwind and last year about 1 point of headwind. So the delta is about 2 points, so why 2018 would be 2 points or are much higher than 2017?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Well, Kai, first of all, I think you know where I come from on this. When I'm just short of a point up and I'm just short of a right at a point down, to me that's flat. It's helpful, it's not hurtful. And really what it does is it lets us go out in the marketplace and sell these capabilities. When you're in a historically old stock market and prices are dropping 10%, 15%, someone that has no real capabilities can lob a quote under the table that kills you.","So this is a perfect market for our organic growth, for our people to be outselling, the things that we do so darn well and not have get whacked on the side of a head by a quote you never saw coming. But one point up, one point down, frankly that \u2013 to me, that's flat.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","I think that technically a year ago, we were probably flat. We probably didn't have much lift or pressure from that. That's really what our comments were, and then we're up \u2013 we're seeing about up 80 basis points right now. So it's really not 2%, it's 1% down the year.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Great. And then, specifically in the UK, you're up 8%. We saw some of your peers actually have some challenging in the UK. I just wonder what were you doing differently there, or that you just compete in the different markets?","I think we're probably in different markets in some of those. Our specialty operation in London has done just an outstanding job of growing through a soft market. It's been quite remarkable, actually especially operation, including our brand, Alesco, have just really, really delivered. So it's that they've been very strong. Our retail operations across the UK are sort of flattish, but together they had a great quarter.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Then on the margin front, so just want to trail down a little bit more. And so you said like you wanted to like grow 4% or more in order to have a margin expansion. If you think of wage inflation in typically, say, 2% to 3% range, I just wonder do you see more wage pressure as well how much do you think you will need additional investment to grow the business?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","All right. It's couple of questions there. Wage pressure is there and then we also \u2013 we have an outlet for that though with our Offshore Centers of Excellence. We have the ability to move more work into lower cost labor location. So that helps us control the wage inflation that you see in the UK, the U.S., Australia and New Zealand, a little bit in Canada. In terms of other cost pressures, yeah, just consumable they are not a big portion of what we do. We have some debts in chairs and office equipment and communication. There's still efficiencies that we can be gained there. So the real place comes in, the wage inflation and for us our challenges become more productive, use technology more to our benefit and we think that will help control the cost side of the equation.","In terms of opportunities to invest in growth, we're seeing that all over in our organization, people are using data more. They're using creative advertising and direct marketing techniques. So there's opportunities for us to use to channel some of that, well I would call services expense and channel it back into organic growth, fueling type exercises. So that's what we're seeing inside the organization.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's great. Last one if I may on the acquisition, you mentioned there competitions for acquisitions, but if you look at first quarter, the multiple you paid are actually lower than your guidance range. I just wonder, what's behind that. And also I just wonder, if you can comment on, there's recent broker IPO, and it seems like in pretty fast growing personal line area, I just wonder if that's a market that you will be interested?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah, I think, I think we are below seven times on our acquisitions this quarter. I think that those were smaller mergers, and I think the price we paid is fair in light of our operations, but I don't know for whole below 7% going forward, I think it will be up probably average closer to 7.5 or 8 times in the next quarter. In terms of the \u2013 the recent personal lines IPO, I read the red herring, I look that the price come out on it, that personal lines, we do a lot of personal lines.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","And we want to do more personal lines.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah. And so that's \u2013 that, those businesses if they fit with us, we'd would be interested in.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Well thank you so much, and good luck.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks, Kai.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks, Kai.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Shanker, Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. I can't remember, whether it was three months or six months ago but on this call, you had said that you set your teammates down and you said look we have to have a conversation with our clients. They should expect rate increases coming through and we're now six months past the hurricanes. To what extent is that materializing as planned? Two, to what extent are those rate increases hurricane related and after we get through the reactionary price increases associated with the hurricanes we re-enter a stable market?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","So I think first of all, yes it is mostly hurricane-related property, non-cat exposed is up, cat exposed where there were losses are up probably 10% to even a little bit more than 10%. And those that are not cat exposed that didn't burn the market, you're still looking at 3% to 5%. And I think that when you think about where the rates were pre-hurricanes, they were as low as they've been in over a decade. So I do think that the rate increases are justified, they are selling in the market now. Some of the quotes that originally came out at more like 20%, 25% increases are that those aren't going to hold. But I don't see a return to a vast soft market anytime quickly. Once the balance sheets have had a chance to heal a little bit and the wind doesn't blow, then you'll see the rates come down again.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And do you expect to see year-over-year rate increases come 4Q?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","I do. And I see that also in particular. It's really interesting. When I started, hard and soft markets were across the entire spectrum. This is a bunch of markets inside the \u2013 by line. So comp is down a little bit. Well it deserves to go down. And then you have transportation is up somewhat. Well guess what, in particular, distracted driving is crushing the market. So these markets are moving as they should, based on the results by line.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Smart. Thanks for the color.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks, Josh.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Newsome, Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Just a couple of quick follow-ups on the pricing environment. There's lots of conversation, and I don't know if it's real or not, about historically the small market being sort of the least competitive and that changing of late. And I was wondering if you're seeing any of that yourself. And then, somewhat similarly also pricing commentary, and I don't know if it's true or not is that month-by-month, it's getting little bit better every month and I don't know if that's true either and whether that's your experience as well.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","No, here's the thing. It varies. As I travel the network globally, it varies. So in Australia, for instance, you're seeing kind of mid-single digit range kind of almost everything's up. You get to the London specialty market and we think we're getting close to bottom, but there's still a tad bit of softness there. Then you travel around the United States, it's tougher in Florida and in Texas than it is in Illinois for sure.","But I think it's really \u2013 well, when you step back from it, I continue to come back at this with you guys on these calls. Rate is really not impacting our results much. When you spread it across all that we're doing, some is up, some is down, but it's in this range of okay, cat property's up, that's nice, and that's necessary. But it's really a flattish market, and it has been for about eight years. Now, I'd also tell you down 3% up 3% I'd tell you is flat. I'm not going to lose an account, frankly, for 3%, but I'll lose an account for 23% and I think that when I'm at 3% up, 3% down which is now 1% up, 1% down, I can sit there with a client and talk about the fact that we've provided unbelievable service beyond the price of insurance.","The things that we do to help their business and help them grow their business on the property casualty side or become a destination employer on the benefit side, that's really meaningful to them. It's not just about the price. So to me it's kind of the perfect environment.","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","I have one other question that's completely unrelated. On the Risk Management business, is there anything that would affect that market, especially the relationships you're trying to build with the carriers that's related to the M&A that we're seeing in the market and a little bit of a changing landscape amongst the carriers, does that have any impact in your Risk Management business?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","No. I think in fact it could be helpful. For 100 years, I've been asked why Gallagher Bassett? Why do you stick with the claims business? Marsh got out of the TPA business, Anne really didn't like the business. Why are you hanging in there, especially on the property casualty side TPA. Well, here's the reason. You have billions and billions and billions of dollars of premium and every year about $0.60 on the dollar turns into a claim. So if you're going to be helpful and you're going to really do a job for someone and you neglect the claim side of it, I think you miss an opportunity for our shareholders and you miss an opportunity to be really distinct in the market.","The fact that markets are consolidating, the fact that they're getting better and better at their own data, and the fact that we're driving the belief that our outcomes are superior and we're willing to put up our numbers. This is a \u2013 if you want to do as of dates off our system, et cetera, et cetera types of claims, parts of body, geography, what country, we can do that. And I believe that the next generation of CEO is not going to feel that their claim department is the be-all and end-all. They're not going to say I can't outsource any of this because they will do a bad job. And I think that when it gets to a point where they're really looking at their returns and their ROE, they're going to have to say maybe there's a better way to do it. And so no, I don't see the \u2013 the consolidation is not going to take claim work away. It's just going to put it into one bigger house.","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Congrats on the quarter. Appreciate the call.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arash Soleimani from KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. I guess just the first question to what extent would you say there are opportunities on the free cash flow side to drive improvement there through working capital management for example?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Good question. We've been working on that a lot. We said we consolidate our bank accounts, we've improved our international cash flow, in particular, free cash in particular because when we did the four or five larger international acquisitions, we went through a consolidation effort and that's really paid off and generated a lot of cash. Where are we in the U.S., that's pretty mature at this point. So I don't see further working capital generation in the U.S. We've got a little ways to go yet internationally on that, but I think the big push on that that we start talking about 2 1\/2 years ago was pretty well behind us.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. And the $6 million adjustment you mentioned for tax reform it shows up in Corporate. It didn't look like that got backed out of adjusted this quarter. I just wanted to make sure I understood why.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah. Good question. (00:37:27). But there's some component in there that's an adjustment for our estimates at 12\/31. There's a smaller component in there that might be a continued run rate if we don't get some technical corrections done. But I probably \u2013 we'd probably could put as an adjustment but we just thought that since it was commingled be it just put it where it is, and call it out.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Right. Perfect, thanks for the answers.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks, Arash.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Zaremski, Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Hey, gentlemen. Couple of quick follow-ups on Gallagher Bassett. It's a Paul's question, where growth continues to be very strong. I guess then can you remind me how to think about how you guys think about your market share because I'm assuming you don't think every insurer thinks as, Pat, you think the next generation will think and some of them think that claims handling is a competitive advantage. And I guess it's along separately, can you remind us if there's something structural there regarding margin so that there's less operating leverage in that segment for certain reasons.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","I'll let Doug handle the margin side of it because the answer to that is yes, it's very labor intensive, but I'll talk to you about the \u2013 what I see the business opportunities to be. First of all if you take a look at Gallagher Bassett paying $10 billion of claims out in a year, that market share is nil, it's zero and it's unbelievable. You've got about $5 billion according to Insurance Information Institute. There's about $5 trillion of premium in the globe and that's including life, health and everything else.","Property casualty, you'd know the number better than I. But when you take 60% of that number, let's just call it a trillion, we are we are so far from having any market share which is a beautiful thing. So, you're right. Not every CEO is going to start thinking the best thing in the world to do is outsource. But it's a fast growing part of Gallagher Bassett's business. It's become very, very meaningful. We've organized around it as a separate segment for Gallagher Bassett, and I think there is huge opportunity there.","When I have some of my partner market meetings at places like the Broadmoor RIMS and talk to some of our markets and I'll say to them what you don't realize is that Gallagher Bassett pays more claims than you do. And some of these are household names and they'll go, no. I'll go, yeah, no, we actually do. And we have more money to invest in our systems, new products, the things that I mentioned in my commentary today than you do and it's kind of a shocking silence. So, I think that's just over the next 20 years, 25 years, gets stronger and stronger. And I do think the business outsourcing model, it won't dominate, but I do think in the long run, it will prove to be a better model and those CEOs are not going to be able to overlook the return.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","And remember also, we're not trying to pick up their entire claim handling organization. What we're doing is we're going into deep verticals where we can prove, we can customize the claim delivery, we can deliver it in the way that they want with our expertise behind it, we provide great career paths inside of this for the adjusters and the specialists. And so as a result, in a deep vertical, we can provide superior claim outcomes. It is a \u2013 it's not as geared leverage wise. If you think about the Brokerage business, 50% to 70% of the growth can possibly hit the bottom line organically. In the Risk Management business, you're probably looking at 30% of it, you can hit the bottom line. It's because it's still a labor-intensive business. But our automation, our scale are coming on and it's allowing us to continue. I mean, if you go back four or five years ago, I think our margin in that business was 13% or 14%. So there has been margin improvement in it.","Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse","And so, then if we think about longer term as, is this segment where Vishal Jain and his team, there's more to be done in terms of more margin improvement versus the Brokerage segment?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Well, I wouldn't say versus the Brokerage segment just by the sheer size differential but there is opportunity there. There's still lots of opportunities for us and I'm glad that you remember listening to our Chief Service Officer talk in March to the group. There's opportunities still on our Brokerage side too.","Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you very much.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Hughes of SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","You see in the Risk Management business, any sign of inflation within the workers' comp business?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Inflation in what, Mark?","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Just loss cost?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Oh yeah. I mean, a huge part of workers' compensation is medical. So you're going to constantly fight that battle and an awful large part of the cap business is medical only. So there's \u2013 that's why the managed care techniques are so important. That's why the purchase of pharmaceuticals and how you do that and manage that is so important. It's why getting people back to work is so important because there's huge inflation in that and add wage inflation to it, there's natural inflation there as well.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","And you realize though that that's not technically Gallagher Bassett's cost, that's the self-insured or carriers that we provide to claim service to. But that's why they come to Gallagher Bassett because they realize, you've got this undying inflation that's going on in medical costs. So what are the ways to leverage our scale, our knowledge, our capabilities to try to bend that curve a little bit.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Any sign of inflection or any sort of acceleration lately?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","No.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","No, I don't think so, it's pretty steady.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","All right.","J.

Omer, anymore?","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I would like to turn the call back to Pat Gallagher for closing remarks.","J.

Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today.","It is now my pleasure to introduce J. Patrick Gallagher, Chairman, President and CEO of Arthur J. Gallagher & Company. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thank you, Melissa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. This morning, I'm joined by Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions.","As we said in our press release few weeks ago, we wanted to announce this morning and have our conference call, because many of us will be at RIMS next week. So, again thank you for being with us early this morning.","I am very pleased with our quarter. Brokerage and Risk Management are both off to an excellent start to the year as we carry the momentum we created in 2014 into 2015. As I have said often, we are focused on four strategic efforts. We worked on number one organic growth, secondly, mergers and acquisitions, thirdly, quality, margin improvement and productivity, and fourth, we work hard to maintain a very unique and different culture.","Adjusted revenues in our Brokerage segment advanced 36%, 4.5% of that was organic. I am pleased with our continuing new business growth. Sales, is what we are all about. Everyday we get up and service our clients and work very hard to add new clients to our list. The first quarter was a great start to our year. In addition, we expanded margins by 210 basis points, which is just outstanding work by the team.","In our Risk Management segment revenues are up 11%, all of which is organic. Our margin expanded, finishing the quarter at 16.8%, a bit ahead of our 16.5% full year target. So, together, our Brokerage and Risk Management operations are up 30% revenues, up 46% in EBITDAC, margins are up 2 full points and we are up 18% in earnings per share.","Let me move to mergers and acquisitions. Our large acquisitions in 2014 are integrating extremely well. We are seeing good opportunities to do smaller bolt-on acquisitions in the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and of course, United States.","We are off to a good start in 2015, having closed 11 acquisitions for about $34 million and added revenue. Our partners see the benefit of our unique culture and the capabilities we are investing in and they want to be part of what we are building.","As I do every quarter, I want to welcome and thank our new partners. The merger and acquisition world is really, really competitive, with lots of choices and I am proud that these fine firms chose to join us. A warm welcome to all of you and our pipeline continues to be very strong, so I see 2015 to be a very good acquisition year.","Let me give briefly some color to the individual operations. Our U.S. property\/casualty retail business continues to operate what I like to call a rational market. Rates all in across -- all lines across all geographies were essentially flat for us in the quarter. This is good news for both our clients and for Gallagher. Give us a stable rate environment and with our aggressive sales culture we will drive organic growth.","We are seeing our customer businesses improved with some growth in revenues and payrolls. Both our international retail and our domestic wholesale businesses also had a strong quarter.","Our employee benefits team is very busy, helping our customers manage their benefits and HR needs as a result of increased complexity and higher benefits and wages. In United States employers continued to deal with the impact of the ACA. Our consulting team has tools and resources necessary to assist our clients to comply with this legislation.","We continue to see solid interest in the Gallagher marketplace, which is our private label insurance exchange, as more employers understand the advantages in offering this to their employees.","The team continues to invest in tools and resources our clients need to manage their employee benefits and human resource needs, and this has helped with strong new business sales and continues to drive increased merger opportunities in the U.S. and globally.","Our Risk Management business, Gallagher Bassett is off to an outstanding start, with strong topline organic growth, margin expansion and we are still investing in systems and people on our marched to be recognized globally as the TPA who consistently delivers the best claim outcomes. Our Gallagher Bassett International business continues to expand and contributed nicely in the quarter.","Our culture is striving. We received two significant awards in the quarter. For the fourth year in a row Gallagher was named as one of the world's most ethical companies by the Ethisphere Institute. In addition, we are recognized as one of America's Best Employer by Forbes Magazine. We work hard to promote and to protect our unique culture and we are very proud of this recognition.","So we are off to a great start. We believe we have a solid momentum and hope to deliver a solid 2015.","With that, I will turn it over to Doug.","Doug Howell","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter was a terrific start to our year. Before I start two housekeeping items, first, we have a small unit get reclassified from the Brokerage segment to the Risk Management segment. All historical numbers have been reclassified. There was only about $4 million of revenue this quarter and it really doesn't have that much impact on your segments earnings or ratios this quarter.","Second, last year we formed a start up Brokerage venture that we control so we consolidated, but we own less than 50% of it. So since we don't own the majority we've adjusted organic to reflect only our portion and we have also footnoted the impact on EBITDAC. Frankly, is not all that bit and that's also seasonally the strongest in the first quarter, so you can probably just ignore it in the next three quarters when you build your models.","Okay, on to the results on the first page, $0.36 for Brokerage, $0.09 for Risk Management and $0.18 loss for the Corporate segment, show as an adjusted EPS of $0.27.","The Brokerage segment adjusted EPS of $0.36 is nicely up 24% in the quarter. You will then see the typical integration costs, changes in earn outs and some severance, and you can also see that foreign currency didn't have much year-over-year impact in the quarter.","Looking forward, some modeling help on revenues. First, rollover revenues, we have added on page 16 of the Investor Supplement, a table showing our range for rollover total revenues for the next three quarters for mergers done in 2014 and in the first quarter of 2015. We will update that table each quarter. But be careful do not double count premium funding revenues. We're giving you total revenues on page 16, not just commissions and fees.","Next when you model new M&A revenues, please ensure that your models weight the closing dates more towards the last month of the quarter.","And finally, foreign currency, we believe that before you apply your pick for organic growth, you should first adjust prior year revenues for the stronger dollar. For the first quarter, you'll see that FX caused a reduction of revenues of about $11 million for the Brokerage segment and $4 million for the Risk Management segment.","Looking forward and assuming current exchange rates, we estimate the decrease in revenues due to the stronger dollar to be about $30 million, both in the second and third quarter and then about $15 million in the fourth quarter. That was for Brokerage. As per Risk Management, assume about $5 million reduction in both the second and third quarter, and $3 million in the fourth.","In the end, step back to make sure your models consider that the impact of FX will caused us about $0.03 in the second, $0.02 to $0.03 in the third quarter and about a penny in the fourth quarter. Making these tweaks for currency, M&A timing and a premium funding should help refine your models on revenues.","Next integration, your heard Pat say that our integration is moving along as planned. So looking out over 2015, we are still seeing integration costs of about $0.07 to $0.09 a quarter -- in the second quarter then about $0.06 to $0.07 in the third quarter and an about $0.05 to $0.06 in fourth quarter.","Staying with Brokerage by turning the page two to the organic revenue table. First, let me give you some flavor behind the 4.5% organic growth in base commissions. Domestically we are about 3%, which we call can be our seasonally smallest quarter. So we feel really good about that number.","Also rate and exposure together had about 1 point of drag on our domestic results this quarter, but then again since 2011 the rate and exposure impact has been about zero, a little plus, a little minus. So like Pat said, it\u2019s seems we are in a really healthy environment for brokers. Internationally we posted about 10% organic growth. So we are seeing some nice solid numbers around the globe.","Next, as for supplements and contingents together up about 5% and we did see a couple carriers moved from supplemental to contingent, contingent was caused some geography shifts. But by and large we did renew most of our contracts as is and we expect to see some moderate growth in these lines yet this year.","Now flip to page three. To the appropriate segment, adjusted EBITDA margin table near the bottom of the page, adjusted margins are up over 2.4 points excluding the non-owned share. About half came from our organic growth and expense controls and the other half from the roll-in impact of the larger deals.","That\u2019s really excellent work by the team. As for the remaining quarters of 2015, we don\u2019t expect much more margin expansion from the rolling of our larger deals as most of them were already in our numbers by the end of the second quarter 2014. We\u2019ll get a little, but not much more.","Finally, on the Brokerage segment, let me give you some non-cash estimates for the remaining quarters for the Brokerage segment. For depreciation, I assume about $15 million of expense, for amortization of our $55 million and for acquisition earn-out amortization assumed by $5 million. Then as we do more M&A for every dollar we spend, you\u2019ll need to increase amortization by about 1% of the purchase price per quarter and that will get you close.","Now turning to the Risk Management segment, really a terrific quarter across the board for Risk Management also. Our domestic operations grew organically over 12% and internationally about 5% and we\u2019ve continued to improve margins and slightly surpassed our 16.5% target for the year. We expect organic to be in the upper single digits for the rest of 2015.","Let\u2019s shift to page five to the Corporate segment, a really nice quarter for our clean-energy investments and right in line with the estimates we forecasted last quarter. We haven\u2019t changed our outlook for the rest of 2015 very much that we provide on page 15 of our investor supplement. So right in line both this quarter and looking forward.","And finally some comments on our M&A program, we did 11 mergers this quarter at a weighted average multiple of just over seven times. Also remember that we tend to do fewer mergers proportionately in the first quarter. I guess, we could call it lower seasonality with our M&A program and has been that way for five years or more. We feel very good about our opportunities to do a lot of nice tuck-in mergers this year.","Next looking at over the remainder of 2015 in terms of M&A funding, we used about 1 million shares this quarter and we think we\u2019ll use about 3 million to 4 million shares in the second quarter, then for the balance of the year will be mostly using cash.","So those are my comments and like I said at the start, it was a really terrific quarter on all measures. Back to you, Pat.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thank you, Doug. And Melissa, we\u2019re ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi","Thanks. Hey Pat, I was just wondering you mentioned 10% organic growth internationally. Can you talk a little bit about kind of what\u2019s underneath there and can we talk maybe specifically about the recent integration or the recent acquisitions in the one that are being currently integrated. What sort of organic did we see out of those guys? Thanks.","Doug Howell","Mike, this is Doug. I made the comment about 10% growth internationally.","Michael Nannizzi","Okay.","Doug Howell","We\u2019re seeing good results out of our London Specialty business. Retail business is there that have been in our books for at least a year performing nicely. So those are the two segments internationally. Our small previous operation down in Australia had a terrific quarter but again it\u2019s so small, it didn\u2019t move the number. But those are the three places we\u2019re seeing strong spot.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Also, like Canada contributed nicely.","Michael Nannizzi","Okay.","Doug Howell","That\u2019s for our organic. But they had some -- Canada actually had almost 6% organic growth but that\u2019s not in our organic growth numbers yet. If you look across the globe, it\u2019s a little difficult in the first year or so until we get the accounting squared away on all the operations consistent last year but consistent this year just the way the billing practices were. But our best guess right now says that if you add up all our other international operations that are not included in our organic, they\u2019re probably flat to where they were prior year as we measure about the same and our organic would've been close to 4% total if we would have thrown them in and started counting them as organic in this quarter.","So we\u2019re pleased with the results. There is some softening in Australia and New Zealand. So you are seeing some market pressures there. Canada is holding up nicely and the U.K. is holding up nicely.","Michael Nannizzi","Got it. And then just could you update us on sort of leadership in the U.K. and I mean, there is, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s continuing to be some turnover and change as you guys kind of continue to purchase three companies together, any update on kind of what\u2019s happening on that front?","Doug Howell","Yeah. Mike, I think we\u2019ve got a very stable situation now. Grahame Chilton has taken over as our CEO for the overall international operations. Retail U.K. is very stable right now. Specialty is very stable. So really what we had in U.K. is we\u2019ve got about 5000 people there and we had five people depart and we\u2019ve got a really solid leadership team that we\u2019re excited about.","Michael Nannizzi","Okay. And then just lastly, just on Risk Management, what sort of operating leverage should we think about in that business? I mean, 10% organic and you have mentioned there is sort of about 16-ish percent margin. Is there a level of growth where you can sort of pick up some additional operating leverage if you're able to continue to sort of grow at this level and where we could see that margin kind of lift up a little bit further?","And then on that topic, just what -- maybe talk a little more about what's driving the current organic growth and what\u2019s giving you confidence that you could see still upper single digits for the rest of the year? Thanks.","Doug Howell","Hi. So a lot of questions in there but first that the -- if you recall, we have stepped up our margin target in the past. We were at 16 point and our margin target is now at 16.5 for this year. So we are moving the margin target up. It is the business that the operating leverage on that. We\u2019ve done in the past. You need about 5% to 7% organic growth in order to show much margin expansion in that business unlike the Brokerage segment that you can start to see some margin expansion at between 3% and 4%, around 3% you start to get it. The operating leverage on it probably the incremental is 25% to 30%, whatever you grow in excess of that 5% to 7% range. It should be able to hit the bottomline.","Michael Nannizzi","Okay.","Doug Howell","Claim outcomes is really what we\u2019re selling in that business. That is when we show our customers that settling claims do it using Gallagher Bassett produce a better claim outcome. Our analytics drive that. It supports it. Domestically, our customers are seeing the value that the Gallagher Bassett brings. And I wish it were more sophisticated than that. It\u2019s just our customer see better claim outcomes.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Also like Gallagher Bassett, it\u2019s a bit of a proxy for the U.S. economy. We\u2019re seeing work comp claims on existing clients, up in claim count by about 4.8% and liability claims up about 2% on existing clients. So that basically is because of increased sales and hiring.","Michael Nannizzi","Got it. Great. Thank you so much.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Kai Pan","Good morning and congratulations on a good start for the year.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thank you, Kai.","Kai Pan","So first question is a number of questions. You guided for the first quarter, acquired revenue around $175 million but looks like the reported number is meaningfully below that. Just wondering what would have driven that?","Doug Howell","Yeah. Kai, I think that you are asking it right. We did for the -- we came in at about $162 million with respect to total rollover revenues in the quarter. How was that different than $175 million that we guided. I probably rounded up $5 million and so rounding down $5 million in FX on that number probably cost us another $5 million.","So $162 million on bottom of page two of 11 compares $175 million guidance. One of the things I did note is there seem to be a lot of the folks that were putting the entire $175 million in commissions and fees. But that also includes the premium funding revenue that was down on the investment income line. So I think there was double counting in lot of the models on the premium funding revenue. That might be causing you some noise in your model.","Kai Pan","Okay. That\u2019s great. And then second question is really on your margin. I believe you guided like about 80 to 100 basis point accretion from the acquisitions but not expecting much from the organically. But it looks like organic also contributed about half the margin expansion in this quarter. You mentioned -- is that because of better organic growth than you expected or like you have expense control measures in place and how should we think about that going forward?","Doug Howell","First, my guidance last quarter was about -- we see about a point of margin expansion from the roll-in of the larger deals and we hit that number, so we achieved that. The rest of the margin expansion did come because we posted 4.5% organic growth, which we\u2019ve said always that you can get some margin expansion above 3% in this environment. We did have some good expense controls in the quarter, headcount controls.","As we look forward, again, we are back into this environment now. We will get a little bit more margin expansion next quarter from the roll-in of the larger deals and that\u2019s maybe a quarter to 50 basis points, something like that. The rest of it will come, if our organic is in excess of 3%, we\u2019d hope to some margin expansion on that. So that\u2019s how you should look at it going forward.","Kai Pan","Okay. That\u2019s great. Last question, more of a bigger picture. If you look at the -- on the acquisition front, one of your comments on that, they see the pricing for deal is becoming competitive, especially committed for the private equity funds. So do you see that and do you see that as challenge to your acquisition strategy, as well as on the industry consolidation front? Do you foresee some large scale consolidation also having the broker space among the public traded, the bank owned entities backed like brokers?","Doug Howell","I will give you the numbers. I will let Pat give some of his response on how he sees the consolidation of the industry going. The numbers last year of our 57 smaller deals, the weighted average multiple that we paid was about 6.7 times. When I look at this first quarter, we are just slightly over 7 times. There was one in that mix that may have moved it a little bit. How do I see the rest of the year? I see that there is still competitive pricing in that 6 to 7 times range.","And I think that the reason why is that people and they look at joining Gallagher versus perhaps a PE firm or something as they really see our capabilities that can drive them to be more successful also. So when we look at it, we think that our multiples are competitive. We think that people are choosing us because of the capabilities we bring and the expertise. As for the consolidation of the industry, I will let Pat talk about.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Yeah. I will talk about the environment a little bit, Kai. It\u2019s very, very competitive on business that\u2019s a little bit larger in scale. So if you take a look at business insurance last July, to be number 100 in terms of the U.S. size you did $24 million in revenue.","I was at the conference this past week and the estimate that this consulting firm had in terms of the number of brokers in the United States was 37,000. I have used anything from 18,000 to 30,000 in many of my speeches. So there's a very, very fragmented industry and there are just aren't an awful lot of those that are over $25 million revenue.","And we are very good at attracting those people that have entrepreneurial firms, $3 million to $5 million in revenue, make us have a solid margin on those, have no expectation of 9 to 10 times. And frankly as Doug said, it's not just all about the money. Yes, we have to be competitive 6 to 7 times. EBITDA is probably right in the wheelhouse. But really it\u2019s about the capabilities and the culture.","Our people are choosing to join us. They have lots of choices and in the end, they are choosing to join Gallagher because of what we are building and we are excited about that. We are very happy to have people with $3 million to $5 million in revenue join the company.","Kai Pan","And on the largest skill side, do you see sort of a more consolidation happening in this space?","J. Patrick Gallagher","I think you are going to see consolidation happening just like it has for the last decade.","Kai Pan","All right. Thank you. Thank you very much.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Josh Shanker","Yeah. And follow-up to each of Kai\u2019s and Mike\u2019s questions. On Kai\u2019s question about the margin expansions, Doug, you said that you don\u2019t expect anymore margin expansion from the roll-ins and if there is no more margin for the rest of the year, I just want to be clear that\u2019s just related to the roll-in. Do you still probably expect margin expansion as long as your growth remains consistent on the organic side?","Doug Howell","Yeah. What I said was is the roll-in acquisitions in the second quarter might contribute a quarter to a half of point of margin expansion. By that time, most of all will be in our books, so won't have much impact for the rolling going through the rest of the year. Then if we grow over 3%, we might see margin expansion at that level too in this environment of wage inflation. So you're hearing it right that the roll-in of the deals, maybe another quarter to a half in the second quarter. After that not much more because they are already in our books and then organic growth should drive margin expansion if it\u2019s above 3%.","Josh Shanker","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then regarding Mike\u2019s question, I wondering if you can give me a Theory of Everything on management and producers and whatnot? To what extent, do you lose something when you lose managers and important businesses and to what extent have you have gained someone, you pickup someone like a Chily to run the business. What is the potential weight of producers? What is the potential gain of producers? What\u2019s the net sum on all of these changes?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Okay. So, Josh, the Theory of Everything is this. We will do extremely well when people join us and we will take a hit when people leave us. And the size of that will depend on whether or not the folks that are with the company are excited to be here and stay or whether they leave. And to tell you the truth, the nice thing about Gallagher is I think if you take a look at our turnover, if you make a $100,000 at Gallagher you don\u2019t leave. Our turnover is literally no.","And we do a very good job of bringing people aboard both by the merger and acquisition efforts, as well as just organic recruiting. And so frankly, I look at where we are today and I know you're referring to our London departures. And we haven\u2019t lost $1 of revenue, not $1. And I think with Chily in the seat, the line of people that are looking to be hired by Gallagher has actually expanded substantially and we feel really good about that. So, I think net-net in the end, we are going to be up nicely in revenue.","Josh Shanker","Have you net gained or net lost? There is really no need to worry.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Not one, not one. Not one producer.","Josh Shanker","Have you gained some?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Yes. Yes. We are still looking at new hires as a great opportunity, not just in London, globally. And yeah, we are net up and we are thrilled about it.","Josh Shanker","And regarding cash to come, is there any risks of having Chily being dual-added or are there any significant benefits to Gallagher in that?","J. Patrick Gallagher","The benefit to Gallagher is outstanding. I mean, I\u2019ve just got to tell. This guy is the real deal, just intended our Board Meeting this week. Board is incredibly comfortable with Chily. I have known Chily for a long, long time. And to be on the same team is really exciting.","He is a solid, solid Senior Executive who has great experience in running public companies. He is a brokers\u2019 broker, which I like because we are a Brokerage run by brokers and we speak the same language. He is a very solid executive with a great reputation and we\u2019ve got a - as I said, we\u2019ve got a very long line of people who want to join us. So it\u2019s kind of exciting.","Josh Shanker","Yeah. I\u2019m sorry. I guess I misspoke. Do you have any advantages being -- is there an alignment in Capsicum in anyway? Anything that you can gain from that relationship?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Well, we own 25% of it and we have about 35% economic interest and ultimately that\u2019s going to be -- Capsicum will be one of the stories that will vow you guys in the future.","Josh Shanker","Okay. Great. Thank you very much and good luck with everything.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Josh.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel with Janney Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Bob Glasspiegel","Good morning, Gallagher.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Good morning, Glasspiegel.","Bob Glasspiegel","I\u2019m glad you ran the last name basis, that\u2019s great. Given your presence in U.K., I\u2019m going to use you guys as my [quasi] [ph] economists. We\u2019ve had the euro and the pound go down in these currency wars but in theory it\u2019s going to cause little bit more economic growth in the region because currency wars are zero-sum game. But the outlook for European growth has expanded the markets. Stock markets are up in those regions. So, yeah, you\u2019ve got the currency hit there but the offset is you may get a little bit faster economic growth in the region. What your economists had on and tell me what you're seeing in Europe and U.K. economically?","J. Patrick Gallagher","I think you heard it right, Bob. Our organic growth was strongest in the quarter outside the United States. I think those economies have been sluggish for sure for the last number of years. I think the dollar -- pound, dollar, euro change will spur some growth in those economies and we will be the beneficiary of that, especially with the moves we made last year on the retail side.","Bob Glasspiegel","So it seems to me, I mean, devil\u2019s advocating the Doug\u2019s currency headwind needs to be offset by little bit better growth underneath, so we really shouldn\u2019t take $0.03 out of Q2 completely.","Doug Howell","Well, I don\u2019t think it moves that fast, Bob.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Bob, if I were you, I would use Doug\u2019s guidance.","Bob Glasspiegel","Right. I know those will come out on the currency and we will see levelized currency from the revenues coming out the year ago for sure. But my point is that there is an offset if in fact you are getting more growth outside the U.S.?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Yes. I hope so, Bob. I really do. From your lips to God\u2019s ears.","Bob Glasspiegel","Okay. The other thing is CIAB numbers, I guess down 2, you would quarrel that sort of with your flattish commentary, or is minus 2 sort of consistent with flattish?","J. Patrick Gallagher","No, I think minus 2 -- here is what I have been saying for the last number of quarters. You and I have witnessed real cyclicality go back to 70s, the 80s, early 2000s, that\u2019s real cyclicality. Everybody is worried about the rate of increase decreasing. And I am saying guys if it\u2019s 1% to 2% up or 1% to 3% down in my history, in my experience that\u2019s not a cycle, that\u2019s flat.","In our book of business for the quarter, rates and exposures essentially produce no increase nor any decrease. But I don\u2019t quibble with the CIB. I think they are accurate and remember that\u2019s anecdotal as well. But I think that basically we are in a flat rational environment. There is still as no investment return for these guys.","I have said this many times. The first time in my career when I meet with CEOs of major insurance companies and they tell me what\u2019s going on in the field and they are right. There is much better information and I think they are just more disciplined. So rational market, which is fantastic.","Bob Glasspiegel","Pat, that\u2019s my market, that\u2019s my crystal ball as well. I hope we are both, right.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Me too.","Bob Glasspiegel","Thank you.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Newsome","Good morning. And congratulations on the quarter.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thank you, Paul.","Paul Newsome","I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the competitive environment within the Brokerage business itself. It looks like you are gaining a little bit of market share relative to your peers. Maybe you could talk about where you think that market share is coming from in general?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Yes. I would be glad to talk about that. In fact, we know for a fact, Paul, we are getting better and better at knowing our data and being able to study what\u2019s going on in our book of business. And we know that over 90% of the time when we go in the competition, we are competing with somebody that\u2019s smaller than we are.","So when you look at share, I don\u2019t want you to thinking Marsh, Aon, Willis, Brown, and we are battling it out on every account. That\u2019s just not the way it is. The real marketplace is that fragmented place, which is relationship driven and is middle market drive. We do a very good job on Risk Management accounts. We love to pursue large accounts. But by and large, our people day in and day out are competing in the middle market. When they do that, they are competing with the local broker.","One of the reasons our acquisition pipeline is so robust and one of the reasons we are closing as many deals as we are, is because people really like to see the capabilities. When I started in 1974, we fought above our weight class every single day. Today we can go out to any account of any size, anywhere on the globe and tell them we could be helpful.","Our brand is getting stronger. People are beginning to know more about Gallagher and frankly, we put a lot of boots on the ground and we are an aggressive cold calling company. So we are out there everyday pounding the street trying to get new business. Ad when we don\u2019t write an account, it is frankly because we can\u2019t break the relationship. And I look forward to the future time when those relationships, you could hold onto your best friend from high school for a while, but ultimately my capabilities are going to push you.","Paul Newsome","I am not sure my best friends even talks to me anymore. Thank you. Appreciate it.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Paul.","Doug Howell","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Hughes with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Hughes","Thank you. Good morning. Could you give us general thoughts on contingents and supplementals, how you think those will be shaping up as we get through 2015? If pricing is a little bit more flat to down, underwriting results flat to down, how do you think that will show up on your revenue line?","Doug Howell","Well, for the rest of the year, we see that being that you take the two numbers, add them together, last year we see them being up organically this year. So I think that the carriers and Pat can talk about his conversations with the carrier, but the carriers recognized the value we bring in the distribution.","And I think they see themselves seeing the supplemental and contingens help align our interest with our customers\u2019 interest and with the carriers interest. And so they tend to like it. We are starting to see -- we are having professional conversations about which pieces help move both of our interest forward as we grow together. So they like it. I think our relationship with the carrier is pretty damn good frankly.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Yes, Mark, I would say that having gone through the Eliot Spitzer era and all the controversy around contingents and supplementals and what you have and going through the rounds of negotiations, it\u2019s very stable right now. I think the carriers here at a point where they have got programs that they believe are driving good results for them and it\u2019s a very stable thing.","We are not having a lot of conversations about should it change next year, how much should it change up or down, they are those carriers that solidly believe that they just want to stick with contingents and that\u2019s fine with us. And there is others that understand that supplementals drive the bus as well. So I would agree with Doug. I think you will see. I think supplementals and contingents will follow our organic growth.","Mark Hughes","If we see underwriting results under a little more pressure, we wouldn't necessarily assume that will have an impact on your contingents or supplementals?","J. Patrick Gallagher","No, I think that the underwriting results do deteriorate, then you will see in the contingent line. So if you look at the table on page 2 I think it is, then the contingent line will come under pressure.","Doug Howell","There is no pricing power out there, Mark. We believe that the carrier still have the ability to price for rational -- there is room, they are starting to have lines that are suffering and there is room to price those lines up to get their profits back into the right spot.","Mark Hughes","In the Risk Management business, do you have a view on workers comp claims, whether frequency is up, down, sideways? I know you are taking share and your clients are adding payroll, so that may be influencing your frequency, but aside from that?","J. Patrick Gallagher","You hit right on it. The Gallagher Basset is up 4.8% and workers compensation claims this year from existing clients, that\u2019s a definite proxy for the economy. That\u2019s because there is more employees in place.","Mark Hughes","Thank you very much.","Doug Howell","The world is getting to be a safer place. That\u2019s what Gallagher Basset helps our clients do. But just the growth in the economy also fuels more claims. So as the economy grows, it should offset our customers getting safer.","Mark Hughes","Right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber with William Blair & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Adam Klauber","Good morning, guys. Couple of different questions.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Klauber","How is RPS doing? Was organic RPS in line with the Brokerage, better, or worse?","J. Patrick Gallagher","It was little better.","Adam Klauber","Okay. And how would say submissions are now compared to year ago RPS?","J. Patrick Gallagher","They are up -- just up slightly single digits.","Adam Klauber","Single digit. Okay. Thanks. And then as far as the benefits business, again the same, is that doing, would you say, better or worse than average on the organic side?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Better than its PC relative. The benefits space is, it\u2019s a great space for us right now, Adam. You\u2019ve got the Affordable Care Act and compliance issues, employers now are seeing growth in there business, so payrolls and HR is huge issues and we are not just doing health and welfare anymore.","We are helping our clients with everything from what position they are going to take in terms of their HR, whether it would be compensation, whether it would be wellness, whether it would be health and welfare, how do you communicate that, all that works together. And frankly, the small broker in the house space is dead, they just haven\u2019t laid down yet.","Adam Klauber","Right. And as far as exchange, do you think you will have more business this year than last year?","J. Patrick Gallagher","By a factor of a lot.","Adam Klauber","Okay. Those are all my questions. Thank you.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Adam.","Doug Howell","Thanks, Adam.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian DiRubbio with Tipp Hill Capital Management. Please proceed with your question.","Brian DiRubbio","Good morning, gentlemen.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Good morning, Brian.","Brian DiRubbio","Just a conceptual question, probably more for you Doug. As you guys thinking about more, a few more international acquisitions, does it make more sense to use your cash that\u2019s located overseas or to start issuing debt overseas, especially with the European bond markets are doing right now in terms of yield?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Well, I think first is use the cash that\u2019s created by the indigenous operations there, so it\u2019s better to keep it there reinvestment and that\u2019s actually works great. And remember, if we do bring it back, we are in a fortunate position that even if we brought it back to higher tax jurisdictions, our tax credits will shelter that. So we do have the flexibility of moving currency around the globe and not have a damning effect on our taxes. So that\u2019s worth a thing.","Looking at international, yes, I think those are some opportunities there. There are some issues about doing that. There needs to enough of a sizeable offering there to attract attention, but it\u2019s certainly something that on our radar screen to see as we look forward, maybe that\u2019s a spot to do the debt. So you\u2019re thinking about it the right way.","Brian DiRubbio","Got you. And then just, Pat, for you. At what point do rates have to start coming down before your clients start pushing you to change carriers? I mean, is it -- down 1%, I guess most people won't change because of the convenience factors, but I mean do rates have to start coming down 5%-plus for that to start occurring in the market?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Yes. I think what\u2019s interesting, of course you have to be competing on price. I mean, people say, whether you compete on and prices are big part of it. And if there was a carrier that wanted to break for market share and was willing to be 7 to 10 off I think but not 5 but 7 to 10 off that could cause some consternation in the market and could cause some movement. They would in fact pickup share doing that.","And that\u2019s why it\u2019s interesting to me to see this rational behavior in terms of the competitive landscape. I\u2019ve never really live with this before, so it\u2019s been one way or the other, either you\u2019ve got rates coming down substantially and you sharpen everything or rates are going up and you\u2019re scrambling to get the coverage you want. So I think there is a C change here.","It\u2019s been probably four years now of relatively rational behavior by underwriters and I think it\u2019s very similar to what we saw with the benefits business in the 70s, going into the 80s. The cycle came out because people began to understand that the inflation behind what was going on with medical care would not allow you just to compete on price. And I think people see that.","We do have claim inflation in the marketplace. There is tort inflation. There is not a lot of good rates of return in the buyer market and they got to make their money underwriting and they\u2019re very, very -- they much better equipped at this time in my career with information that I\u2019ve ever seen. So when I talk to CEOs of insurance companies, they know by line, by geography, where they\u2019re making money, where they\u2019re not making money, and they\u2019re holding those offices and those underwriters accountable for underwriting profit. And I think that\u2019s a great place to be.","Brian DiRubbio","Got you. Great, guys. Thanks for the comment.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Meyer Shields","Thanks so much. Good morning.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Good morning, Meyer.","Meyer Shields","So one question. We haven\u2019t talked about this in a while. Heath Lambert had some sort of Western Europe aspiration. Can you talk about what you\u2019re doing outside of the U.K. and Europe?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Yes. We have -- in fact, I will be meeting with them next week. We have what we refer to, Doug refer to, our branded network is called the Gallagher Global Alliance and that\u2019s how we\u2019re trading in Europe through affiliates that are independently owned agencies that are vetted by us and contracted by us to help our clients and we mutually share the work on clients that they have in locations where they don\u2019t have operations in the same and we do the same. And right now in Western Europe, we have nothing in the pipeline to move in that direction.","Meyer Shields","Okay. Thank you. And then a question for Doug, I was just trying to get the straight. You talked about getting -- I don\u2019t know about half of the margin expansion from headcount control internally. Does that change the bogie from 3% organic growth to translate into margin expansion or is that sort of assumed in there?","Doug Howell","That\u2019s assumed in there. The fact as we get better at what we do, we have the opportunity to become more efficient, more productive and still raise our quality, but there is just a natural -- people deserve --w here those stay reserves raises though that we don\u2019t re-hire. Consolidate jobs, but that\u2019s baked in there. Headcount controls or something that\u2019s baked into my assumption that you still got to have headcount controls even you have 4% organic growth too.","Meyer Shields","Okay. And then finally given the London market presence, is there any impact on margins from foreign exchange changes?","Doug Howell","Yeah. I mean, just the math would show that could cause some margin contraction. So just by the way you do the math, we actually have a nice book of dollar denominated revenues, because of our specialty business in London, so that kind of helps a little bit with the pounds. So it\u2019s not so big. We don\u2019t have that kind of dollar denominated revenues in Canada, Australia and New Zealand there. So it does have a little impact on margin but it -- but not that much just by the pure math.","Meyer Shields","Okay. But the little impact is, its sounds like you\u2019re saying it is adverse on that base?","Doug Howell","Correct.","Meyer Shields","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Great. Thanks, Meyer.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Peters","Good morning, Pat and Doug. Congratulations on the quarter.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Greg.","Greg Peters","Hey. From a big picture perspective, it seems like technology and analytics are playing an increasingly important role in revenue production. And so I was wondering, how you measure the adequacy of your continuing investment in this area in the context of the margin improvement you laid out for the balance of the year?","Doug Howell","Well, we\u2019re getting good technology improvement lift. As you know we\u2019re still investing in Gallagher Bassett, our analytics workbench there is probably the best in the business right now, but beyond a doubt its bringing great value to our customers and so we\u2019re getting value from math. Some of the technology investments we are making, they are table stakes.","So we\u2019re doing that and then when you look over in the Brokerage segment, our ability to capture all the premium that we place around that globe, so we can sit down and have valuable productive conversations with our carriers is delivering value too.","So in terms of measuring our technology investments, some of it just stay competitive in the business and some would generate revenue and we think that what we\u2019re doing both in the Gallagher Bassett, analytic workbench and then in the -- on the Brokerage side, of our smart market, our advantage products, which are data products, we think we\u2019re doing a good job on that. And it\u2019s leading to some nice revenue opportunities for us.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Yeah. I would agree, I think, when you look at this, Greg, the payback that we\u2019ve gotten on technology investments, it\u2019s pretty high to put your finger right on it, but putting salesforce.com in place.","Having the technology -- the technical capabilities now to have all of our U.S. operations on the PC side, on one agency system we\u2019ve been in -- basically one agency system in the benefit side for years, giving us tremendous abilities to use a data warehouse. We now know more about our book-of-business every single day than we did years ago and it\u2019s incredibly helpful in terms of being able to compete.","When I go see the contracting risk and I can tell them exactly, how many dollars of premium we have in the contracting space, you can tell them, how many accounts, where they are, what size they are and why they should trade with us. And I can translate that to what that means to the insurance carriers that we are placing that business with, it gives our producers a real leg up.","Greg Peters","From a budgeting perspective, do you measure your investment as a percentage of revenue and is it done by segment? And would you say that that increase stable or decrease thing trend wise?","J. Patrick Gallagher","It\u2019s about stable with our -- as a percentage of revenues, I don\u2019t have that committed to memory, but it's about stable. We are not seen it increasing. Our revenue growth -- one of the advantages of getting scale, allows us to continue to reinvest in the technology space with more scale.","And so our efforts are to remove the duplicity that comes with putting together a lot of agencies together, take that spend that's they were spending individually aggregate and reinvested in tools, technology tools, that help us sell more and help our clients do better with managing their risk.","So that is the advantage of scale. There is no question about that that our offshore centers of excellence in India benefit from the scale, as we bring new smaller tuck-in agencies onto our platform, we get that -- we harvest that spend in reinvestment. So there are advantages of the scale, Greg, there\u2019s no question about that.","Greg Peters","On the offshore centers of excellence, have we pretty much harvested all that can be done out there or ...","J. Patrick Gallagher","No.","Greg Peters","Do you see further opportunities?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Oh! I see huge opportunities. I believe 20% to 25% of our employees ultimately will be in those centers, whether they are in India, whether they are in the Philippines or they are here in the U.S. or wherever we put them.","I think the service centers that we are creating will continue to be tremendously additive to two things, both -- first, our margin, but most importantly to our quality. We\u2019ll issue over a million certificates of insurance out of India this year. We know for a fact. We can go in and look at this. We do that that 99% accuracy.","Now when I was addressing a group of independent agents and brokers just last week, I asked them how many of them had any clue what their level of quality was on the certificates they put out. There\u2019s not one of them that even knows how to measure it.","And that I believe is sellable in the marketplace. When I can go into a client and say look, here is the facts, your certificates are going to out at 99% accuracy, do you care about that, well, yeah, you do care about that. Because that's what you're relating to your vendors and your clients, what your coverage is, it better be accurate. So there's tons of opportunities.","Greg Peters","Right. Thank you very much for your answers.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks Greg.","A - Doug Howell","Thanks Greg.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Sebaski","Good morning.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Good morning, Charles.","Charles Sebaski","So, first question, Pat, you are talking about before the rating and the sort of the dynamic of what's going on in the rational pricing. I guess, I am curious on your take on how much of that is the information that carriers have versus the low interest rate? And I guess my -- what I am trying to get to is do you think this rationalization -- when rates -- win rates normalize that the need is -- the information will still be there, but the need on underwriting return will be less?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Well, now that's a great question. Charles and I have to be honest with you. I don't know we are going to find that out, aren\u2019t we? I mean, I think that certainly interest rates have played a large part in the rationale approach. But will also -- I think there\u2019s three other factors that have added to this. Number one, I think you\u2019ve got senior management, the senior leaders that clearly have better information and a much stronger understanding of their role is to generate returns year in and year out. And they can get their hands around what's going out on the field like they never could before.","The other thing is I do believe that Sarbanes-Oxley is having an impact. I\u2019ll use this as a generalization. In my past years, if an underwriting carrier -- if a carrier was -- could post 93 combined and I won\u2019t ever mentioned any names they\u2019d post 99. And they put the rest away as kind of nuts for the winner. And you can\u2019t do that anymore. Boards are all over reserves. You guys are very good in the analytical world of looking at reserve redundancies or reserve shortfalls. And I think that people have to play it as it actually comes out of the box.","So if you got it 89 combine, you are going to have to tell the world you had an 89. So yes I think you are right, if interest rates go up it will create, I believe, some enticement for underwriters to understand that they can do better on the investment side that may soften the market. But at the same time, I just see a higher level of professionalism in the CEO suite and much better information.","Doug Howell","Yeah, I think Charles, you also have the dynamic of frequency reverts more to the historical norm. Some of the pricing advantages that carriers have been having or result of advantage has been from lower frequency on the actuarial picks than expected. So even if you got any tick up in interest rates a little bit than frequency reverts more to where it was during the more active period in our economy, those could have a mid offsetting effect to one another.","So you can\u2019t look just at interest rates. The great thing about is with the data that the carriers have with the sophistication they will be able to adjust that as it comes along. And so when frequency goes up they\u2019ll bake that into pricing. When interest rates go up, they\u2019ll bake that into the pricing. When severity changes, they can bake it. And I just don\u2019t see them subsidizing. They are not going to have a lot of lines that they would consider to be loss leaders. I just don\u2019t see that working well. They are either going to make money in that line or they are not going to write it. So that is a different environment to you.","J. Patrick Gallagher","I think Doug hit at it. What we are seeing now is really cycles within the cycle right. So we know that large property accounts were soft last year 2014. We expect continued softening in 2015. So our RPS unit as it comes around to July 1st is going to see serious competition for catastrophe property globally. Not seeing that in worker's compensation you are not going to see that on a regular property accounts through Oklahoma. So it\u2019s -- I think Doug\u2019s point is a good one -- line by line geography by geography, they are underwriting, they are really truly underwriting.","Charles Sebaski","Can I ask about your guys plan more internationally, where does -- what does Gallagher look like in two or three years. I guess it seems like the international expansion has kind of picked up last year. I'm wondering if there's going to be a larger press for South America, Latin America other emerging market type companies and what your presence might be like two, three years down the road?","J. Patrick Gallagher","We that's a good question. First of all, we\u2019ve always covered at the world. So we've been very opportunistic. We\u2019ve been in Australia for 15 plus years with Gallagher Bassett and with some smaller acquisition on the Brokerage side. The moves that we made last year, I think were seminal moves for the company. I compare that to strategically going public in 1984. And you are going to see us do it tremendous number of bolt-ons. We are going to able to do what we\u2019ve done in the United States now, in Australia, some degree in New Zealand, clearly in the UK and very clearly in Canada. We\u2019ve got those pipelines building and we've actually done some of those deals.","So you\u2019re going to see us bolting on in those places where we\u2019ve created a platform. We are active in Latin America, we like emerging markets. We took a 21% stake in our Mexican partners three fours years ago. We\u2019ve invested in smaller firms in Chile and Peru. We have -- Singapore has been active for us now for almost 15 years. We did a small partnership with one of the largest brokers in China. And so I think you\u2019ll see us continue to take toeholds in locations where we\u2019re not, and bolt-on in locations where we have a platform.","Charles Sebaski","And finally to Doug, I guess, I have a question about the margin expansion and the roll-in. You said that in the next couple of quarters there might be 25 or 50 bps of margin expansion from the new business roll-in. And I guess my question, is that just due to those new businesses being higher margin and whether there is any margin to be had from those new business from synergy costs, cost containment outside of just the natural higher margin of those businesses were doing and how that would work for the next four quarters, five quarters give or take?","Doug Howell","Right. So just for semantic purpose, let\u2019s not refer to our M&A as new business because that might confuse somebody as that\u2019s new organic business. So just for our M&A rollover, you heard me right that there was a probably a quarter to 50 basis points in the second quarter. I don\u2019t know if there is much more in the third and fourth quarter from the roll-in of those slightly higher margin businesses that we bought. So that\u2019s the large deal roll-in affect of that.","Going forward, there are opportunities for synergies that can result from those -- as we fully integrate those operations. So that could produce some margin -- further margin expansion as you get to 2016. But let\u2019s get integration done first and then I will -- to make that that we are delivering a unified brand, a unified IT system, a unified telephone system, marketing together and then we\u2019ll go to that next step to see whether that synergy will naturally falloff for that.","Charles Sebaski","I appreciate all the answers.","Doug Howell","All right.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Charles.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Adam Klauber with William Blair & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Adam Klauber","Thanks. The clean energy -- Doug, I think you said, it\u2019s more around how you thought. Could you add some color for us to get visibility and do you still think that business could be up materially this year compared to last year?","Doug Howell","I\u2019ve never said that it\u2019s going to be up materially this year. I said that this year is a platform year for a step-up in \u201816.","Adam Klauber","Okay.","Doug Howell","And perhaps, this is a flat year but I do believe there is upside in next year. We are having tremendous appetite for our remaining plans. Remember, our desire is to own a portfolio of plans, so you are going to have always have some that start-ups, some that shutdown for production reason, for appetite for clean call. We see that the appetite for further planned installation has been very strong at this time. So this is a platform year relative to 2014, but in \u201816 we see another step-up in that.","Adam Klauber","Okay. And then as far as interest and banking costs, should we think about the rest of the year similar to what we saw for this quarter?","Doug Howell","Yes. We provided the guidance back on page 15, I think of the supplement. We feel comfortable with the ranges that we provided on that supplement there. So if you use that you will get pretty close to your interest and banking cost, as well as the other Corporate line.","Adam Klauber","Okay. And then finally, as far as share count, non-acquisitions, what should that do?","Doug Howell","Typically, what we have is about a 1.5 million shares between basic and fully diluted related to our option, in our restricted stocks, et, cetera that go out, would be the employee compensation that is on slide. I see that somewhere in the 6 million to 7 million ranges, just constantly at that level.","Adam Klauber","So is that for quarter, for the year?","Doug Howell","That\u2019s just for the year.","Adam Klauber","Just for the year. Okay.","Doug Howell","The thing is our basic plus -- if you just take basic and add about a 6 million to each you get to the fully diluted.","Adam Klauber","Great. Okay. Thanks a lot.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thank you.","Doug Howell","Thanks, Adam.","Operator","Thank you. Gentlemen, our last question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Kai Pan","Thank you for taking the follow-up. Doug, you mentioned you issued 1 million shares first quarter, expecting 3 to 4 million in second quarter. Just curious, is that because you see some large deal in the pipeline, would need some larger allocation of the stock component?","Doug Howell","Kai, we\u2019ve got a couple of tax-free exchanges that are lined up during that quarter. Remember, we use stock in a tax-free exchange and frankly, there is a lot of our partners right now that want the stock. We have future partner that want the stocks, which we like. So that\u2019s the real reason there.","Kai Pan","Okay. So it's not specifically allocated for some potential large deals?","Doug Howell","That\u2019s right.","Kai Pan","Okay. Thank you very much.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Kai. I think that\u2019s all our questions. Lisa, is that correct?","Operator","Yes, it is sir.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Okay. Just one quick comment. Thank you again everyone for being with us this morning. We really appreciate it. As I said at the beginning, I\u2019m incredibly pleased with our start to 2015 and look forward to continuing to execute. I think we\u2019ve got good momentum and hope to have a solid 2015. Thank you for being with us this morning.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Gallagher &. Company's Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Some of the comments made during this conference call, including answers given in response to questions, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that will be discussed on this call and which are also described in the company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today.","It is now my pleasure to introduce J. Patrick Gallagher, Chairman, President and CEO of Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thank you, Brenda, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and year end conference call. We appreciate you being with us this morning.","Today, I'm joined by Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer; and the heads of our operating divisions.","Simply said, I could not be any prouder of our team and our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2013. We're working towards a strong finish as we entered the fourth quarter and the team surpassed even my high expectations. I simply could not have asked for better performance from our team. Literally, every division across the globe contributed to our record results.","Combined Brokerage and Risk Management had adjusted revenue of 18%, 6.2% of that was organic, 22% growth in adjusted EBITDAC. These are outstanding results. Brokerage and Risk Management segments combined grew our adjusted revenue in the year $369 million. This is a real testament to our sales culture. Everyone of us in the company understands everywhere in the world that we get up every day and we understand that our number one job is to keep the clients we have and to attract new clients. We all understand that nothing happens until somebody rings the cash register.","We continue to get stronger and stronger every quarter every year. Today we've proven that any account of any size anywhere in the world we can serve. That is exciting.","On the mergers and acquisitions front, 2013 was a banner year. We completed 31 transactions, 2 of which were really sizable. Bollinger in the Northeast and Giles in the U.K., added significantly to our revenue base in both locations. Including the other 29 completed acquisitions, we approached $400 million of acquired revenue and $130 million of annualized EBITDAC. We paid a blended multiple of about 7.6x, which we believe is a fair and reasonable multiple and we only had to use about 1\/4 of the aggregate purchase price in our stock.","All our partners had choices. I'm proud they chose to join Gallagher and I want to welcome them to our growing family. And our pipeline going into 2014 is very robust. So expect 2014 to be another strong merger and acquisition year.","In 2013, our workforce expanded by about 2,600 people, almost all of whom joined us through the merger and acquisition process. We like to say that we added 2,600 more brains, who are working in our culture and our niches in our specialties add incredible firepower. These new colleague add tremendously to our capabilities and our opportunity to continue to grow.","Let me add some color now by business line. I'll start with property\/casualty retail in the United States. We had a strong new business year, a great acquisition year and solid retention of accounts in the year. We saw our rate increases throughout the year and we saw the economy show signs of getting healthier. Yet, think about this, only about 1%, in fact less than 1% of our organic growth, came from rate in the economy this quarter. So for 2014, as we look at the rates, we expect the property\/casualty market to remain stable with increases on most lines being somewhere in the order of 2% to 3%. The one exception to that would be larger property schedules in areas that have not experienced severe losses. And frankly, those customers deserve a decrease after a number of years of benign weather. But my continued surveys of our people show underwriters continue to account underwrite and they understand that there's loss cost inflation. Managements have shown discipline for 3 years and carrier managements continue to tell us to expect the same in the future. They must maintain their discipline because if they don't, they won't have a return. Adequate returns can only be driven by underwriting profits.","So if discipline remains and rates are flat to up 2% to 3%, we should see solid organic growth from our new business efforts.","On our wholesale business, we had strong organic growth in 2013 and we see business startups, primary market discipline continuing to present our wholesaler RPS, Risk Placement Services, with great opportunities. RPS is the largest MGA operation in the United States, according to Business Insurance magazine. Our program business is seeing good growth opportunities and our open market Brokerage is receiving good submission activity.","On our benefits business, 2013 we were lifted by our clients and prospects need for help with the new healthcare act. Sorting through new regulations, consulting around exchanges and helping clients decide how all of this fits into their HR strategy will continue to be a boom for us in 2014.","Our international property\/casualty business has been our fastest-growing business. Not only did we do one of our largest acquisitions in 2013, that was Giles, but our organic growth in the international PC World was the highest of the group. We were strong in the U.K., Australia, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean. Our opportunities to expand outside the United States are growing because we now have platforms around the world that allow us to pursue bolt-on and folded acquisitions, and we will see more activity in that regard in 2014.","Our Risk Management business had 9.3% organic growth in 2013, and we successfully completed a number of customer-based investments in systems, people and capabilities. This is leading us to our best new business start in 2014 in 7 years. Plus, we had a carrier outsourcing arrangement that we started at January 1 that will be over $12 million in revenue. We continue to see great opportunities to be an outsourced partner to the underwriting community.","Our investments in Gallagher Bassett are paying off in customer wins in what is a very competitive environment, and GB was named the best U.S. TPA by the voting readers of Business Insurance magazine.","And finally, our shareholders had a great win in 2013. Shareholders received a 40% return including dividends for the full year in 2013. In our last board meeting, we increased our dividend again.","Okay. 2013 is over and we're off and running in 2014. The moves we make, acquisitions, organic higher systems investments in 2013 should put us in a very good position for continued growth in 2014. We are bullish. Most importantly, this is really critical.","As I travel throughout our global network, I can tell you that our unique Gallagher culture is thriving. Teamwork is everywhere, clients are being served exceptionally well, our people are turned on, excited by our growing capabilities and will believe we're just getting started.","Doug?","Douglas K. Howell","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. It's nice to have a great quarter and I'm encouraged about our prospects in 2014. We'll start on Page 2 with the Brokerage segment.","Like Pat said, a terrific quarter and a terrific year. In the quarter, you'll see the integration costs related to Bollinger and Giles, which were right in line with what we discussed in our last conference call. You will also see severance primarily related to management redundancies, as we consolidate a number of our similar international operations under common leadership. That process is going very well and looking towards 2014, expect to see $0.03 per quarter in total for integration and severance, as we continue to bring our various operations together.","Statement of Brokerage, we're turning to Page 3, to the revenue table at the top. Some flavor behind the organic 5.8%. First, you should know that we did have a few nonrecurring wins that fueled organic by about 20 to 30 basis points in the fourth quarter. Those are great wins to have, but not likely recurring revenues next year in the fourth quarter.","Second, when I look at the organic across our various Brokerage units, all performed very close to the mid-5% -- mid-5% range in the U.S. That's our retail units, our wholesale units and our benefits units. They're all right near the average. International, as Pat said, was in the upper-single digits.","Third, you heard it from Pat, but it deserves a special mention. I went back and I looked at the last 12 quarters of organic growth. During that time, there's not been one single quarter or more than 1% of our organic growth came from rate and exposure. We just sell more than we lose, we're not overly sensitive to slightly up or slightly down rates and we grew even during a time of a sputtering economy. It simply shows that we should have continued organic growth, especially as the economy gathers steam, even should rates become a little bit flattish.","Moving to the Brokerage operating tables on Page 3, and then to the overall adjusted EBITDAC margin on Page 4. Comp is down, operating is flat, which resulted in EBITDAC being up 100 basis points. That is right in line to what we thought in the last call, but some comments behind the margin.","First as we discussed last quarter, Bollinger and now Giles too are seasonally a bit smaller in the fourth quarter. So to the extent they were a little drag on margins that was offset by a little bit of margin lift coming from the nonrecurring wins I mentioned just before. Either way, they just offset each other.","Second, recall that a year ago, we took the proactive step to reduce our workforce to offset most of the underlying inflation in salaries, benefits and health and welfare. As we come into 2014, while we do have some operational improvement initiatives and I do feel like we can continue to shift more work to lower-cost labor locations, there is some underlying workforce inflation. So we're now back to our message track of about 18 months ago. If we don't have greater than 3% organic growth, don't model much of any margin expansion, other than about 80 basis points because of Bollinger and Giles, which were on higher margins.","Third, it's time for my annual reminder. Recall that our Brokerage segment is extremely seasonal with our first quarter, by far the smallest. So please make sure we factored that seasonality into your quarterly spreads. When you get down, step back and make sure you don't see much of any year-over-year margin expansion in the first quarter.","Moving to the Brokerage segment, non-EBITDAC line items for 2014. For amortization, assume about $39 million of expense per quarter; for acquisition earn out amortization expense, assume about $4 million per quarter; and for depreciation, assume about $11 million of expense per quarter. Then as we do more M&A, for every dollar we spend, you need to increase amortization by about 1% of the purchase price per quarter and that will get you close.","Okay. Let's shift to the Risk Management back on page -- Risk Management segment back on Page 2. As we discussed on our last call, you'll see the ramp up costs associated with our new insurance carrier relationship. You'll also see severance as that segment also consolidated some leadership roles. As we convert IT systems for the carrier runoff of[ph], expect to see about $1 million to $1.5 million at quarter in integration costs running through the third quarter of 2014.","Turning to Page 4, to the Risk Management organic table. It was a strong quarter and a strong year. And as Pat mentioned, with the new -- the good new business pipeline and with our new carrier relationship, we should have revenue growth in the upper-single digits in 2014.","Let's move to the bottom of Page 4 to the compensation table. You saw it in Pat's comments and you also see in the comp ratio -- that our comp ratio spiked up in the fourth quarter. We got hit with a few more really severe medical claims right at the end of the year, which cost us nearly $2 million. It looks like it's just a blip and it's unfortunate that it hit us late in the year.","Looking to Page 5, you'll see that we had nice improvement in our operating expense ratio in the Risk Management segment. This is even, while we invested some of that on client services enhancements. So nice work by the team on that line.","Moving on to the adjusted EBITDAC margin for Risk Management, we hit that 15.8%, which was very -- for the year, which is very close to our target of 16 points. Looking forward to 2014, we are again targeting 16 points of adjusted margin, which at that level, still provides us the opportunity to make further investments into the business.","And finally on Risk Management, as for the noncash items, assume about $6 million a quarter of depreciation and about $1 million a quarter amortization expense in 2014 and you'll be close.","Okay. Let's shift to Page 5 to the corporate segment. In total, the fourth quarter was right in line with our forecast. A little better earnings from clean energy was offset little -- by a little more acquisition costs related to Giles, but right in line. For the year, our clean energy investment team nearly doubled their earnings from 2012 and they're already hard at work optimizing existing plants and rolling out the remaining plants. We should better 2013's earnings and we are still seeing those investments as a nice funding source for our M&A program.","When modeling the corporate segment, we encourage you to model the segment using the shortcut table format that we provide on Page 14 of our investors supplement. We've now provided our first range of estimates for 2014 for all 4 components of the corporate segment. Interest, M&A and Corporate are relatively straightforward, but and you've heard me say this before, when it comes to the clean energy line item, earnings for the year can be difficult to predict, so we provided a wide range. Please make sure your models in note highlight that possibility.","Also please take a look at the note on Page 15 of the supplement. That explains it because we're so seasonally small in the first quarter, we are likely to warehouse between $0.15 to $0.19 of credits in the first quarter, which then get recognized over the following 3 quarters. It all washes out by the end of the year, but it does produce some volatility in our quarterly results.","Finally, some comments on capital management. Since our last call, we announced that we've closed on a $600 million round of private placements that we will draw down in late February, and we also filed a $200 million aftermarket or dribble out equity offering. Between our free cash flow in 2014, to dribble out our line of credit and the ability to use stock in acquisitions, we are well-positioned to continue our M&A program.","And as for shares outstanding, it's looking like the fully diluted weighted shares outstanding for the first quarter will be about 138 million shares. As for the remaining quarters, that will mostly depend on our M&A levels.","So when I step back and I boil it all down, in 2013 our combined core operations were up double digits on all measures and we doubled our earnings on clean energy, clearly an outstanding year. And as we move into 2014, we are in a near of rational rate setting, it seems the economy is getting better by most all measures and we have an M&A pipeline that's pages long, with fine agencies and brokers that want to join us. We have a team that's highly experienced and embedded in a rock solid culture that we think will excel in 2014. So I like what we did this year and I think next year holds good things, too.","Back to you, Pat.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thank you, Doug. Brenda, we're ready for questions, hopefully some answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Sean Dargan with Macquarie.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","Just -- was wondering about the tax rate in Brokerage. Was there anything unusual there?","Douglas K. Howell","No, and we did drop down a percentage but that's basically because of our -- the weight of our international operations. They're in lower tax locations. So it's -- we hope to see continued downward movement in that, but we dropped a point this year just because of that.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","Okay, great. Just a forward-looking question, is there any appetite to increase your leverage to fund future acquisitions? Are you still thinking of kind of 2x EBITDA?","Douglas K. Howell","Yes, I think so. I think that when we do 2x EBITDA as probably right where we want to be, there'll be sometimes it will round up to 2x to 2x, 3x. And then as the earnings move into the financial statements, it will drop back down around 2x. But that still gives us plenty of cushion related to our covenants, it still keeps us in the investment grade level. So I think that somewhere in that 2x range is right where we want to be.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","And what is that cushion at now?","Douglas K. Howell","Well, they -- I -- we think that investment grade trips at about 2.75x EBITDA. And then -- but our covenants are at 3.25x.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Locraft with Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So I feel -- I thought that in the commentary, you were quite bullish on the top line outlook for '14 and beyond. So given where pricing is, I feel very good on top line. Can you talk a bit about margins? Because the corporation is kind of perched at levels that we've never seen before on the margin front, really got to go back to '04. So what I'm wondering is, if you can compare and contrast Gallagher today versus maybe '04, when margins last peaked and how can you kind of run through the previous peaks and keep going higher from here to grow margin specifically because again, we feel really good on the top line outlook as it seems you do as well.","Douglas K. Howell","Yes Greg, thanks for the comment and just that overarching comment on margin. That's when you go back to 2004, with the changes in stock-based compensation and when you look at just the differences in accounting, our margins are actually better than ever before in the Brokerage space. So we feel very good about that and our Risk Management is always been kind of in this 15% to 17% range when it comes. That's just the nature of the business.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Which is a leading margin in that industry, by the way?","Douglas K. Howell","So we feel good about that margins at that level. Do we see opportunity for margin expansion going forward? I've said that if we're not above 3% organic, we probably won't see much else than the impact of acquisitions to increase or decrease depending on the franchises that we buy. But by and large, we're in an interesting era right now. If you look at our operating expenses, we have driven that down into the 16%, 17% range. We just don't spend money on things that aren't people. We think that we have opportunities to continue to leverage our offshore centers of excellence that do tremendous workforce. And we think there's some technology opportunities as we've rolled in. Behind the scenes here, the retail business has converted all of its different agency systems onto one platform here. I think only a couple of acquisition locations haven't been converted on yet. So we're making some improvements in technology. But there is underlying inflation. So where do we see margins going long-term? Give us 5% organic growth for the next 3 years, sure you'd see some organic expansion. At 3%, it's going to be tough to have much more. But again, we think that we're well-positioned. We've never really cut our 401(k), we've never cut back on benefits that we provide to our employees. We've done a good job of keeping our workforce well paid throughout the entire recession and till today. So our future when it comes to workforce, we think of a 60% comp ratio and about a 16% or 17% operating expense ratio is a good spot for Brokerage like us to be.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then any commentary on the other segment, on the Risk Management?","Douglas K. Howell","Yes. You heard in my comments that we got hit with some medical claims right at the end of the year. But we think there's a line of sight in that business to keep 16 points of margin. If they can grow in the upper-single digits, we think that's tremendous. No margin compression in organic growth that might be approaching double digit. I don't think it will hit double digit. We think that's good for that franchise. This is a labor-intensive business. Some of the things -- there's some really exciting things that were going on inside of Gallagher Basset right now that really provides a nice value to our client. So we think if we can run that for 16 points at upper-single digits organic growth, that's a good spot for us to be.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then shifting gears, Reinsurance Brokerage. Do you guys do anything there? And I thought in the quarter, you made a move into that space. I'm just trying to size the move in your appetite for growing reinsurance Brokerage.","J. Patrick Gallagher","We have a reinsurance business and we've done reinsurance forever. You'll recall, Greg, that we sold our Gallagher REIT on about 6 years ago. That was an effort that we had a foot to try to go after some of the larger treaties that were being placed around the world, very exciting. In the fourth quarter, we're joined in a partnership by Grahame Chilton, who comes out of Benfield in the startup of a firm called Capscium, which is an effort to start a new reinsurance venture that is primarily based on his past relationships. And so that is a -- we have also done a small acquisition in that space in 2013, 2012 actually. And so we do see opportunities to grow. What you're not going to see us do is throw huge expense dollars at that. We think we've got an opportunity to build something out with Grahame, we're excited about that. He's obviously a well-known person in that industry, he's been very, very successful. We're pleased to have him as a teammate and we think we'll do great things there. But it's not going to be something where we spend millions and millions of dollars to find out if we can do it.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, okay. If I may, and I don't know if it's appropriate, but did you take a look at the Towers business when it came up?","J. Patrick Gallagher","We did and we did not bid.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I want to talk about a history of selling appetite for smaller potential acquisitions and contrast that with interest rates. Thinking about 4 years ago versus 2 years ago versus today, what are sellers interested in receiving for their businesses? And does that have a component and how much are you willing to pay based on the cost of cash basically?","Douglas K. Howell","Good question. I think, as Pat said in his comments, if you just look at all 31 of our acquisitions this year, we ended up paying in a blended multiple on EBITDAC of about 7.6x between 7.5x and 7.6x EBITDAC. So that multiple, frankly, has probably moved up one turn in the last 4 or 5 years. Is that interest rate correlated or is it growth correlated? We see it probably as more growth correlated, most of the operations that we're looking at now, do have line of sight to some growth that's consistent with our levels. Do I see it necessarily correlate to whether interest rates are at 4% or 5%? We're just not seeing at that. It doesn't translate quite to that level quite yet.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And so if we're thinking about the 10-year rising, that doesn't put a ceiling on multiples in so far as that money is more expensive, you don't view it that way or they don't view it that way. How should I think about the relationship?","Douglas K. Howell","I don't think there's been. And I don't think there's been a view right now that 10-year, that 1% movement in the 10-year, influences that pricing. Clearly, if the 10 year goes up 5%, 7%, 10%, then multiples would come down. But we just -- it's just not that tightly correlated.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Bob Glasspiegel with Janney Montgomery Scott.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","A question on -- with the Sedgwick tinkers to have to chance sale in the TPA market, just wondering if you could just chat a little bit about how that, if it -- if at all changes, the competitive landscape of evaluation seem to be on the rich side from a pretty savvy buyer, does that change the game and where prices may be for acquisitions? But what are the implications of this as you see it?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Well, Bob, first of all, this is Pat. I think, we all know that K.K. Harris very, very smart money and they've made a very big bet in a business that we believed in without hesitation for 30-plus years. And there have been times over that 30-plus years, actually 40-plus years, that we've been questioned as to whether or not we're going in the right direction. And I think it proves the point that this is a very, very dynamic business and a great business. We believe that the claims business is an area that we can excel. It is a competitive landscape. It doesn't change one with what our competition is or what our strategy is with regard to that business. It's just, I think, proves up the fact that it's a very valuable business.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","If the price got 13, 14, 15 EBITDA, is there any price that you become a seller versus or a buyer? Or is this just a business you love regardless of where the private market valuations go?","J. Patrick Gallagher","This is the business I love regardless of valuations and let me tell you why. If you figured that Bob, Robert Hartwig is right at the insurance information institute and that there's something on the order of $1.5 trillion of premium paid in the property\/casualty world globally, and you realize that some 60% to 65% of that premium turns into a claim every single year, then where's the money in the insurance business? It's in the claims. And where is the opportunity to help our clients save money? It's in the outcomes as to how well you do those claims. And we think we can prove that our outcomes are superior. When you see major insurance companies outsourcing their business to Gallagher Bassett, essentially saying that they're capital will be better served by our handling their claims, the world is coming our way, Bob. We aren't getting out.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Fair answer. Less significant question on the supplemental contingents continue sort of outperform your sort of guidance going forward. The business has been profitable, perhaps there wasn't a lot of cats underwriters are paying more for good business. So as we look into 2014, is there anything we should be thinking about north, south in the trends there and the acquisitions change the sort of run rate materially?","Douglas K. Howell","Yes, good question. First, in the fourth quarter, if you recall, in our third quarter call, we had a couple of million dollars that was up timing shifted from third to the fourth. So when you look at the fourth quarter, that fueled that a little bit, but we talked about that in the third quarter. Looking towards 2014, there are a couple of things that are going on. As we add scale, especially internationally, we should -- we see opportunities there to increase our contingents in our supplementals. We see domestically there, we're holding in there on contingents and supplementals domestically and a flat year would be a good year we think. Now if loss ratios continue to improve, maybe there is some upside there. We are seeing a little bit of a dynamic and remember, we're doing this right as we speak and we're still in the middle of negotiating some of our relationships. We're seeing a little bit of a dynamic of some carriers pushing to move from a supplemental back into a contingent. If that would happen, you'd have a little bit of timing, where instead of recognizing supplementals in 2014, '14 you get it as a contingent in 2015. But overall, we think that the carriers are seeing the value of what we're providing. We see that, we think that the volume and the loss ratio outcomes that are coming with it. I think that were in a stable position to slightly better position in 2014.","J. Patrick Gallagher","And the carriers are having great years, Bob. So that helps us.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Yes, it just seems like where at the point in the cycle historically, given the profitability is higher and its tougher to grow, they're usually in a position where they're willing to pay a little bit more to get this profitable business. So I think for giving the combined ratio, contingents to supplementals might be rising for the brokers, would you argue with that or is that a fair point?","Douglas K. Howell","I think it's a fair point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sarah DeWitt with Barclays.","Sarah DeWitt - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Given your comments that less than 1% of Brokerage organic growth came from pricing and exposure, is there any reason why you shouldn't exceed that 3% hurdle organic growth rate even if P&C prices flat and return slightly negative?","J. Patrick Gallagher","No.","Douglas K. Howell","No. I think the question wise is we actually sell about 5% more than we lose. Whether we see margin expansion below 3%, I'm sorry, there's 2 questions in there. We've said that we wouldn't see margin expansion below 3%. But can we see organic growth above 3% with flat rate? The answer is yes.","Sarah DeWitt - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, I was just focusing on the organic. Okay, great. And what's more important, the economy or P&C pricing for your organic growth?","J. Patrick Gallagher","The economy.","Douglas K. Howell","Yes actually, if you go back and look at it in some of our investor presentations, we plot out what rate increases are versus our organic. And even intangible we we're dropping, that rates were dropping, 10%, 15% we were showing organic growth, plus or minus, breakeven. So you can see there that the economy does have the ability, if you go back from let's say, 2003, 2004 through 2007, even with rate -- deep substantial rate decreases going on in the insurance pricing, we had a robust economy and we are still growing gangbusters back then.","Sarah DeWitt - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then finally, could you elaborate a little more on this carrier outsourcing deal that you want Gallagher Bassett? And what sort of opportunity do you see that as longer term?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Well, it's a great arrangement wherein we've essentially taken over a claims organization for an insurance company. Those people willed in to our employment. And we going forward, will be their outsourced claim provider and they'll be the capital provider and the underwriter. I see huge opportunity in this regard. If you take all the startup capital that's moved itself to Bermuda then wants to come onshore, one of the last things these carriers want to do is build infrastructure. Right? So they want to come on board and here's the analogy I use, if you want to get in the trucking business and you're an offshore capital provider, you can do that by coming onshore, getting the licensing you need, et cetera, making sure that you got all the licenses and the rates and what have you, and you can hire an underwriting team and you're in the business. You don't want to have a bunch of adjustors sitting across 40 states waiting for accidents to happen. So what we can do is say, look, when you have the accident, dial this 800 number. Our people are on site as fast as can be, we got a very professional adjudication team, we're all over this thing. We can manage -- we can manage every component of the claim, from the early onset through the litigation. And you don't have to have infrastructure. And by the way, we'll do it better than you do it, if you hired your own claim people. And we'll show you that and prove that with our outcomes. What's the opportunity there? Limitless.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Arash Soleimani with KBW.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I just had a couple of quick follow-ups. I know you'd mentioned before the joint venture within reinsurance brokers. I was just curious what drove this vision to get in at this particular point in time?","J. Patrick Gallagher","It's very simple, the individual became available.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Yes, that is very simple. Fair enough. And the other question, just in terms of the margins, I know we said there was kind of a one-off within the Risk Management. So just kind of looking forward to the fourth quarter of 2014, is it fair to kind of assume that roughly that 15\/8 guidance that was originally in place for the fourth quarter of '13 should materialize then?","Douglas K. Howell","We actually are targeting 16 points for the year. There might be a little tick up, a little tick below that on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But we think we have good line of sight that our Risk Management segment can pose 16 points of adjusted EBITDAC margin for all of 2014. And there might be a slight little variances on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But I hope we don't have another handful of claims like we had next year.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Definitely. And then finally, in terms of the -- you've mentioned in the past that most of the competitors within Brokerage tend to be smaller, smaller players. I guess going forward, you've mentioned in the comments today, again, that Gallagher can service clients of any size. Is there any shift in strategy looking forward the next couple of years to sort of compete more in the larger client space or?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Well I should -- let me answer that. We compete across the full spectrum. If you look at the insurance industry as a pyramid and at the top of the pyramid is the Fortune 1000, we're represented in that Fortune 1000. We do a very good job on a number of large accounts that would be brand names that I won't mention on the conference call, that we're very proud to have as customers. As you go down that pyramid to the very bottom with your small personal lines accounts, we play very well in the affinity space, which is very small accounts that are done electronically or by call center what have you. So the full spectrum we compete. There is no shift in strategy, we want to get stronger in every sector we play in. If you look at the acquisition activity, to be a Business Insurance United States Top 100 broker, #100 last year did like $22 million in total revenue. So we believe there is about 18,000 agencies in America. Some say there's as many as 30,000, but we believe there's about 18,000. That means there's 17,900 smaller than $20 million in revenue. We know this because we measure it. 85% of the time when we go out in the competition in the field, we're competing with somebody who's smaller than we are. So we compete 15% of the time with our larger competitors. No change in strategy. We continue to focus on each layer of that pyramid and we want to get bigger and stronger in every category. And the important thing about that is it matters out in the marketplace. The bigger we get, as I said in my prepared remarks, we add brainpower to the organization, that improves our niche capability, it improves our specialties, it helps us in the Risk Management world and it helps us in the small account world. And when again, you go to a business that's as vast as the insurance businesses, our growth opportunities in virtually every category are almost limitless. So yes, we will continue to compete hard in that upper middle market. And into the larger accounts, but we see great opportunities to expand through the whole spectrum.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I've just a couple of questions, I think you touched on the benefits business in the past. I mean could you give us a little bit more color on kind of what's happening there, maybe break out a bit more if you could on the organic growth, the competitive environment, M&A and kind of how you're kind of building out your strategy in that area?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Sure. I'd love to tackle that and if you've got any further questions I'm happy to have Jim Durkin chime in. The benefits business, I think we've been fortunate that a number of years ago, we organized ourselves into separating the benefits from the property\/casualty arena. So we've been building a benefits business as a separate organization called Gallagher Benefit Services for the last 20-plus years. We believe 20 years ago that, that was a separate expertise and I think we've been proved right in that regard. So today, what we find ourselves as is more of a consultant than a broker in that business. The insurance companies have consolidated down to very few players and it's not really about going out and getting a cheap price for our client on their benefits business. It really is about stepping back and looking at what their HR strategy is, what their total pay strategy is and seeing if we can help them both design that strategy, as well as implement how benefits fit in that business. Now that's become extremely complicated. 15 years ago, we didn't have a compliance person on staff. Today, we have 25 compliance people, 17 of them are lawyers. We're not running a law firm, these are helping our clients with the compliance obligations they have under the law. And that goes all the way back to ERISA and comes through to PPACA. So it's a very complicated business once you get 200 lives or more in your group and we're very, very good at that. Now what that's fueling is heavy acquisition opportunity because if you're a smaller broker with a bunch of 200 to 300 to 1,000 to 5,000 life cases, you can't deal with the new law, just that simple. You think you can, you start down that road, but you can't. And so what's happening is that the smarter entrepreneurs that have got great client relationships, are joining Gallagher Benefit Services so they could go out to their clients which is exactly what they should be doing and saying, \"We really do have the capability to handle all this complicated stuff that you're facing as it relates to benefits.\" The organic growth there is about in line to a little bit better than our PC growth. But I think that, that will increase as the mandates and as the complications of the new law become more apparent to our clients. I think we have a position now in our -- in a competitive state where many of our smaller competitors are telling their clients \"not to worry, we're on top of it.\" But when they begin to find out how really complicated this act is, we think that there could be thousands of pages of regs coming out. I think our organic growth will continue to surpass what we're seeing in other lines. It's a very exciting time for us. Our people are working incredibly hard. Every small account is trying to figure out what to do, every client is trying to figure out whether they want to use an exchange, do they want to go to define contribution, Are they going to stay with define benefits, are there going to be self-insured, are they going to be fully insured are they -- what are they going to do? They can't sort that out themselves. They need help and that's a real boom for us.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And would you at some point consider breaking that out? So we can see that because if you see it's obviously a very different business from your -- if it's more of consultative capacity, it's certainly a very different business than the Brokerage business.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Well, it certainly not. Its -- I say that we're more consultative in that. But in all fairness, our property\/casualty businesses is very consultative as well. You get down into the affinity and it's a straight price play. But when you look at what we're doing as a property casualty Brokerage, it's the same. So we really do think of them as very similar businesses and spend an awful lot of time trying to make sure we cross-sell those businesses.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I see. And then have you spoken about kind of what the margin like, how big that business is, as a percentage of the total and what the sort of margin profile of that business is, have you given that information?","Douglas K. Howell","Yes, we have. We're between $500 million and $600 million of revenue on it. And the margins in that earn the mid to upper 20s margin, too. So it performs in line with the broader Brokerage business we've been on [indiscernible] so we have a good shot.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then one question that I have on the supplementals and contingents, what is the margin on those relative to your traditional commissions?","Douglas K. Howell","Well, it depends. I mean, we don't actually have a [indiscernible] but generally, the supplementals and contingents fund a lot of our management, our field management bonus pools and everything that's where, we don't -- supplementals and contingents are not subject -- in most cases, subject to formulas for the field production SaaS. Although it's a higher margin, clearly, but it most -- and we've always said, 70% or 75% that hit the bottom line something like that.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, okay. And then let's, just -- you mentioned talking about a prior comment, was it partnering with alternative capital in reinsurance? Or was it partnering with new startups on the insurance side? I wasn't totally clear.","J. Patrick Gallagher","No. I started a partnership with Graham Shelton in the U.K. in a Caps-- we're calling the business Capsicum Re. And it's a reinsurance brokerage operation.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I see. And you view that as a prototype for potentially doing similar transactions in the U.S. or with Bermudans or potentially?","J. Patrick Gallagher","No, we don't really see that as something we probably be doing in the United States. But we've done partnership arrangements around the globe before. We started in Perth, Australia, with a equity investment that then went to 100% majority. We started -- we have a good partnership in the Caribbean with what we think is the strongest broker down there, which we own 80%. And you might recall that 1 year ago, we took a position in our Mexican partner. So we like that approach around the globe.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Hughes of SunTrust.","Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I think you mentioned that this is the best new business start in 7 years. Could you expand on that? Are you talking about the business in its entirety? And are you taking into account the growth through acquisitions?","J. Patrick Gallagher","No, I was talking about Gallagher Bassett in particular, Mark. We just had a really good start to the year. We haven't put any numbers out there, not publishing any numbers. But that's a business that can be lumpy because they're often times dealing with large accounts. And we just -- you typically win less than 50% of what you're working on. And for January 1, we won a lot more than 50%. It was a very good start.","Douglas K. Howell","Yes we're seeing, Mark, we're seeing some really nice receptivity by prospects for some of the enhancements that we're making in our systems and our capabilities. And I think that there's a good message that's going out that we're outcome-based on what they should be -- the outcomes that we produce are better than what they were doing before whether they were the carrier of different TPA. And there we're been able to demonstrate that better. So that's translated in some nice new sales for us.","Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","How about the underlying claims frequency in the Risk Management business, any change in trend there?","J. Patrick Gallagher","It\u2019s up about 1.5% to 2%, Mark.","Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","About the same?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Yes, about the same. That is an interesting proxy for the economy, by the way.","Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Right. And then in the wholesale business, I think you said, you'd mentioned startups accelerating. And are you seeing any distinction? Are you seeing small businesses perhaps?","J. Patrick Gallagher","What I'm talking about, when I make those comments, I'm speaking all about small businesses. Our MGAs, in particular, do well when strip malls are filling up, taverns are starting, stuff that the regular market is not going to participate in. And we need that economic activity to fuel those MGAs, and we're seeing good activity there.","Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Is getting better, is it accelerating?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Yes, I would say it is accelerating.","Operator","Our next question comes the line of Dan Farrell with Stern Agee.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just a question on Brokerage margin again. If -- once you get past the 3% sort of inflationary pressure on expense that you talk about, can you remind us how you think about the mix of fixed and variable cost? I'm just trying to think about in excess of 3%, how much could potentially fall to the bottom line?","Douglas K. Howell","Well, it's a complicated question -- an answer. But here we go. First and foremost, if you assume, the same wage workforce inflation that we've had for the last 5 years, which is basically been not that much, if you assume that when you get over 3% organic growth, 60% of that growth should contribute to margin because we pay the producer about 30% of it and we have field management. And then you get into the volume issues, is that a growth coming because we're just changing the 0s on a policy? Clearly, that's more margin accretive than it is if were having to go out and compete for new business where we're providing substantial quotes, lots of proposals. And if it's a heavy service load new client where there's lots of certificates of insurance, lot of our auto ID cards, and that's not as margin accretive. So it depends on the nature of this, if it's just 0s on the policy, assume 60% of that should contribute to the bottom line. If it's just having -- giving more bit bonds, giving more if our construction practice goes on, their proposing on 1,000 projects and we're having to provide the insurance quotes on each of those and only one of those closes, that's not as profitable as it is, if we got a contractor that just continues to grow as an existing customer. So a complicated answer. But by and large, when you get over 3%, there's a little bit that can hit the bottom line in total and in this wage environment, in this workforce environment at this point.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And then on the clean energy, your guidance says -- like have ranged of $63 million to $80 million. If I was to compare that to your ultimate targets, which combined with the royalty income, looks like it would be more like $110 million annually. How much potential is there going forward to close that gap further? What needs to be done? And then also can you just update us on any update with regard to maybe monetizing your ownership within Chem-Mod?","Douglas K. Howell","First, as you know, we said let's work backwards. On monetizing Chem-Mod, we're going through a strategic alternative process with that, we put that on hold a little bit towards the end of 2013, but we'll pick that up again here in '14. In terms of the opportunity to further expand more production out of existing plants, and we see that we're constantly trying to optimize the use of existing plants. We still have 6 plants that haven't been moved to the final resting places yet. That activity, there's a good pipeline for that. We're proposing on a lot of locations. Where would I like to be by the end of 2014? I would like to have all plans at least permanent installation construction by that time. I think that's a realistic goal. So do we have a line of sight of getting to improving off of 2014 range? Yes, we do, we think there is still further opportunities there. Remember our objective however, is to get these all in, then monetize down so that we own between 20% and 40% of the plants. So we have a portfolio of 34 plants, so that vagaries in any one plant, whether its running today or not running, whether is down for service or not, it kind of washes out in the diversification across the portfolio of plans. We do have good line of sight to that, there's good positive momentum on construction, chemistry, tax accounting. All of these things, we see there's good momentum in this space. So 2014 should be another year of ramping up to better position us for '15.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from the line of John Campbell with Stephens.","John Campbell - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Pat, you mentioned in last year's 4Q[ph] call that you guys are just seeing some positive momentum in just building through, I guess, just increasingly positive audits. If you can just talk a little bit about how you're seeing that this year versus last year?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Sure. I mean, I think the natural yin and yang in the business is that as you're approaching your renewal, carriers want to make sure the exposure units are quoted appropriately. And clients want to make sure that they low-ball it. And so between the lowball and the end audit, you get back to what's the right number. So we have seen -- we are in positive audit territory. We have been for a number of years. I think, we're probably approaching what is more like parity though, where the actual exposure units that are being placed on the policy at renewal are kind of closer to what they actually should be. So we are in positive territory. This is not 20%, 30%. These are small incremental audits that do give us line of sight into what we've been saying for a number of quarters, is an improving economy. It's not an economy that we see going robust, we are not seeing, for instance, on the benefit's side, a whole -- any kind of real addition of headcount to our client's employment. People doing everything they can to hold back on that, which does translate, however, into a very successful growth with our temporary health firms. But we are in positive territory, it's not huge. But clients businesses are doing better.","Douglas K. Howell","Yes, let me just put it in perspective financially for you. We're talking in all of 2012, I think our net positive audits were $1 million. And in '13, it was a similar number. So and then in the depths of the recession, we might have had just net negative audits of $0.5 million to $1 million something like that. So it just doesn't swing that much for us as a broker.","John Campbell - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then, Doug, just from a new debt, all in interest expense, around $17 million or so a quarter, is that pretty fair?","J. Patrick Gallagher","The blended rate on that $600 million was 4.7% on $600 million. So 4.7x $600 million is about $14 million a quarter.","J. Patrick Gallagher","On the new debt.","Douglas K. Howell","On the new debt, right.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of. . .","Douglas K. Howell","I misspoke it, it's $7 million a quarter. Sorry guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Alex Lopez with Portales Partners.","Alex lopez - Portales Partners, LLC","I guess just following up on the notion of cross-selling, what kind of top line opportunities do you see moving forward i.e. like how much can this add to your top line?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Well, cross-selling is one of those things it\u2019s the Holy Grail right? I mean we're -- we've studied our books of business across our divisions, where we've been exceptionally good is making sure that our wholesaling operation garners the opportunities that our property\/casualty division has in the E&S market. We now captured about 50% of our E&S placements into our own wholesale Risk Placement Services. We're probably captured 85% to 90% of the placements that the organization makes in London -- into our London specialty group. Where we have great opportunity and we have not had the depth of penetration that I'd like to see is between our property\/casualty operation and our employee benefits operation, we think there's great, great opportunity there. All in cross-selling though, I would say for 2013 between benefits and PC, probably contributed about $9 million of total revenue to the company.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Chris Leikhim with William Blair.","Chris Leikhim","Just a quick one on acquisition activity. It seems like it's picking up a little bit in the U.K. and Europe. Are you guys seeing anything attractive going on there in the underlying environment or more just opportunistic buying for the pipeline?","Douglas K. Howell","I think it's 2 things. First, on the economy, the U.K. economy is actually doing pretty well right now. There's been some nice recovery there on the fundamentals and so we're seeing that as a nice opportunity. I also think though, it's more that the aspect that when we bought Heath Lambert a couple of years ago, it really made a statement that we had a serious interest in the retail presence across the U.K. Before we've been primarily wholesale in the London market broker. So the -- I think it\u2019s just we're getting presented with more opportunities. We think that there's a view now with the Giles acquisition that we have a focus on the retail space. The brokers over there are very keenly aware of what we do here in the United States. They like our niches, they like our resources. And I think they see that there's an opportunity for them moving from a small independent to teaming up with Gallagher is a great opportunity from the grow[ph]. I think we're just getting presented with more opportunities also.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Also I'd say, Chris, the U.K. market in the Brokerage space got very overheated a number of years ago. There were a number of these opportunities that we looked at. And the multiples were off the Richter scale and you now have private equity firms that are having to bite the bullet and realize that they've got to exit. And expectations in pricing has come much more in to line with what we're comfortable paying. And so it's been a great opportunity as one of the people that kept their powder dry to be able to move into that market and actually get reasonable multiples to bring these teams aboard, as Doug said, who are excited to be part of what we're building as a team.","Chris Leikhim","Great. Are the multiples similar over there to what you sort of quoted for the full year?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Yes.","Chris Leikhim","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on the benefits conversation. Any thoughts from you guys end on the Liazon acquisition by Towers Watson? And are you rethinking your strategic approach to exchanges? And sort of how are you looking at the selling season going into 2014?","J. Patrick Gallagher","The Liazon acquisition by Towers, we've been very pleased with how Towers has reacted and their commitments to us. Towers spent a very significant amount of money for that acquisition. They're not going to buy that business to wreck it. In fact, we've got very good discussions with them on the fact that they want Gallagher Benefit Services to continue to be clearly one of their strongest partners. We had good success with that platform. We have about 32,000 employees that are presently signed up to be on that platform. We see line of sight to probably over 100,000 employees going on to the platform sometime during 2014. And we think it will be a good partnership. But we've also been very clear, Chris, that this is not our only exchange. We view the exchanges as platforms and markets. And our job is to consult with clients as to where the best place for them to place their employees will be. And if that's a state exchange for 1 client and Liazon for another, that's how we're going to play it. We're a pure consultant.","Operator","And since we have no further questions at this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over for closing comments.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Great. Thank you, Brenda. Again, everyone, thank you for being with us this morning. We are really pleased with our 2013 results, I know you could probably tell by the tenor in the room here, we're pretty darn excited about 2014 opportunities. I think we're building an exceptional franchise that has phenomenal prospects for continued growth. Consider this one little factoid, we did our first $400 million of total revenue in 1995, and we grew the enterprise by that much in 2013. And as I said earlier, we really believe we're just getting started.","So thanks for being with us this morning. We appreciate it and we look forward to talking with you at the end of the first quarter.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference.

Gallagher and Companies First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Some of the comments made during this conference call, including answers given in response to questions, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the security laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that will be discussed on this call and which are also described in the Company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. It is now my pleasure to introduce J. Patrick Gallagher, Chairman, President and CEO of Arthur J. Gallagher and Company. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin","Patrick Gallagher","Thank you, Donna. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2016 earnings call. With me this morning is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions. There are four key components to creating long-term value for Gallagher shareholders. Number one, we need to grow organically. Number two, we need to grow through mergers and acquisitions. Three, we improve our quality and our productivity every quarter. Number four, we have to work hard to maintain a very unique culture. We excelled on each and every one of those this quarter. All in, we grew 4.8% organically in our combined brokerage and risk management operations. We had another 6% of growth through net acquisitions, for a total adjusted revenue growth of 11%.","Our quality was recently recognized by J.D. Power and Associates as ranking the highest in customer satisfaction among brokers in the large commercial insurance space. We became more productive, with adjusted EBITDAC growth of 15% and we expanded our adjusted margins by nearly a full percentage point. Our culture was recognized by the Ethosphere Institute as one of the world's most ethical companies for the fifth straight year. Simply put, an outstanding quarter on each component of our strategy. Let me spend a little more time on growth, both organic and acquisitions and what we're seeing in terms of insurance pricing. Doug will then go into greater detail on margins, clean energy and capital management. First, in our brokerage segment, let me talk about organic revenue growth. All in organic was 4.8%.","Excluding contingents which are seasonally strongest in the first quarter organic was 4.2%. This is similar to the first quarter of 2015 and up about 1 point relative to the fourth quarter of 2015. About half of this improvement is attributable to stronger new business and about half was due to less drag from rate and exposure. Focusing now on our domestic brokerage operations which include our retail PC brokerage, retail employee benefits consulting and our wholesale brokerage operations, these units account for about 2\/3 of our brokerage segment revenue. Domestically organic revenue growth was about 4.5%. Of that, retail PC was over 5%, benefits at 4% and wholesale at a little over 2%. Wholesale is feeling some impact from weaker property rates.","Commercial PC rates are still down, but they are a manageable head wind and our exposure units are growing a bit. In our employee benefit consulting business, a tight, multi-generational labor market, combined with rising cost of health care, especially pharmacy costs, along with increased regulations for employers such as the ACA, are creating more new business opportunities. In the first quarter, the renewal impact from rate and exposure units had about 0.5% negative impact on our organic growth domestically, so no real change from the past few quarters. I just came back from the RIMS conference in San Diego and the tone from carriers seemed to be similar to what we have been hearing for the past three quarters -- some continued weakness in property, but otherwise pretty consistent conditions. ","Moving to our international brokerage operations, that's principally our PC operations in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK which combined represent about 1\/3 of our brokerage segment revenues. Organic revenue growth was about 5% within our international operations. UK retail posted about 3% organic in a relatively flat rate and exposure environment. London and Bermuda specialty posted about 5% organic in a difficult rate and exposure environment. Australia\/New Zealand had a little negative timing, otherwise organic was flat, also in a difficult rate and exposure environment, but we're starting to see pricing bottom out in Australia\/New Zealand. Canada posted 6% organic in flat rate and moderately down economic environment.","When you look at our larger international mergers that we did in 2014, they're all doing very well. Integration is done in Australia\/New Zealand, nearly done in Canada and should be mostly done in the UK by the end of the year. Let me turn to merger and acquisition growth. Over the past 20 months, we've returned to our almost exclusive focus on smaller tuck-in mergers. Today's competitive environment for mergers is similar to the last two to three years and a lot like most of the early 2000s for that matter. But we're maintaining our pricing discipline, with weighted average valuations at about 7 times EBITDAC for the eight mergers we did here in the first quarter. We can pay these valuations because the merger partners that choose us see the long-term value in joining Gallagher. They see our vast capabilities, they see our proven track record, they embody our culture and they see themselves being more successful as part of us.","As I do every quarter, I would like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm welcome to our growing family. To wrap up our brokerage segment, we posted first quarter results of 4.8% total organic growth. Total adjusted revenue growth was 12%. Adjusted EBITDAC was up 16% and our adjusted margins expanded by 79 basis points, a really strong quarter for our brokerage segment. Let me move to our risk management segment which is primarily Gallagher Bassett Services. Risk management started the year with a good first quarter. Adjusted organic revenue growth was 4.7%. Adjusted EBITDAC grew 9% and adjusted margins improved by 103 basis points to 17.6%. Gallagher Bassett continues to deliver consistent, attractive top- and bottom-line results for shareholders. GB's domestic claims management business delivered 6% organic growth in the first quarter, while international operations were closer to flat, excluding last year's run-off fees.","At 17.6% EBITDAC margin, we out-paced our margin target of 17%, while continuing to make investments that will drive future growth. I spent some time at the Gallagher Bassett booth at RIMS and I was able to see first-hand how we're positioning ourselves in the market place. We have an amazing offering to provide clients. GB, in my opinion, is simply the best. Some of their recent innovations include Waypoint, our suite of decision-support tools based on cutting-edge machine learning technology; Luminos, our acclaimed risk management information system; and our new GB Go, a mobile application to enhance communication and engagement with injured workers.","All these innovations will continue to improve claim outcomes for clients and bring additional revenue to Gallagher Bassett. I don't want to forget to mention our clean energy efforts. Another solid quarter, still on track to post 15% growth in annual after-tax earnings relative to 2015. Is was a great start to the year. Glad to have the first quarter in the books and we really are hitting on all cylinders. Over to you, Doug.","Doug Howell","Thanks Pat and good morning, everyone. Like you said, it's nice to put first quarter under our belt. I'll make some comments on margins, corporate and clean energy, cash and capital management and the highlight a couple things in our investor supplement and CFO commentary documents that we post on our IR website. Okay, first to margins. Brokerage was up 79 basis points and risk management was up 103 basis points, really excellent work by the team. Within the brokerage segment, adjusted margin expansion was about equal between our domestic and international operations.","Domestic was up 75 basis points, international was up 90 basis points. Recall, our domestic units are running annualized margins in the high 20%s, so to expand here in the first quarter shows excellent discipline. Internationally, our Canadian, New Zealand and London and Bermuda specialty units are also posting margins nicely in the 20%s, yet we do have some opportunity to further improve margins in our Australia and UK retail units over the next 18 to 24 months. In terms of integration, the UK team is doing excellent work and we remain on track to be nearly finished with integration by the end of this year. Integration costs for the first quarter were right on our forecast and we still expect 2016 integration charges to be about half the 2015 level. As for risk management segment, we exceeded our 17% margin target during the quarter and we still think 17% is a good margin to expect for the next three quarters. ","Moving to the corporate segment, we landed a bit above the high end of the range we provided during our last earnings release, mostly due to clean energy. Most of that was timing. When you look at page 4 of the CFO commentary document, you'll see the timing between the quarters, yet our full year is effectively unchanged from what we previously provided. For the year, we're still estimating between $109 million and $124 million of net earnings from our clean energy investments. Okay, to cash -- let's move to cash and capital management. Our first quarter is seasonally our smallest cash-generation quarter. Yet at the end of the first quarter, we had about $250 million of free cash on our balance sheet. We're working on freeing up about half of it as part of our integration efforts in the UK and the other half is in Australia, New Zealand and Canada that we'll use were M&A, merger and acquisition opportunities, in those geographies. ","We also announced a few weeks ago that we renewed and up-sized our line of credit facility to $800 million and we anticipate closing a $275 million debt private placement in early June. Our debt-to-EBITDAC ratio on March 31 was about 2.6 times on a covenant basis and we're targeting a similar level at the end of 2016. We believe free cash -- we believe between free cash and debt, we can fund our M&A program in 2016, similar to the levels we completed in 2015, with no net shares used. To clarify, when I say no net shares used, there will be tax-free re-org mergers that require us to use stock, but we intend to offset that through buy-backs, just like we did in the first quarter. All right, a couple items on housekeeping. First, please don't forget that our first quarter is seasonally our smallest in the brokerage segment. Please use the document on our web IR website called Supplemental Quarterly Financial Information. We give you five years of both reported and adjusted results on a quarterly basis. From that historical information, you can easily see our seasonality.","Second, we also provide a CFO commentary document on our website that has a lot of forward-looking information that should help you build your models. You'll see that items for the first quarter are in line with the forecast we gave you during our last earnings call. Some sound bites looking forward that you'll see on that document, FX headwinds are mostly behind us, integration is tapering off and this is also now where we're providing all the guidance related to our clean energy investments that used to be in our earnings release. A terrific quarter on all measures and in the end we're really well positioned for the remainder of the year. Back to you, Pat.","Patrick Gallagher","Thank you, Doug. If you look at our first quarter performance, it really was excellent. I believe we continue to execute on our global strategy. We believe that a key component to our execution is maintaining our culture and we work hard to protect and promote it. Very proud to be recognized as one of the world's most ethical companies by the Ethosphere Institute for the fifth straight year. This is a testament to who we're as an organization and to the caliber of colleagues we have at this great Company. As we continue to grow and become more global, we're dedicated to keeping our Gallagher culture thriving and strong.","Donna, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming Ryan Tunis of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Crystal Lu [ph] in for Ryan Tunis. My first question was around the strong base commissions and fees growth this quarter in brokerage. You mentioned in the remarks that the strong new business and better than expected rates in exposures drove that you have visibility on the sustainability of those two items going forward?","Patrick Gallagher","Well I will tell you Crystal we get up every morning and we work really hard on getting the word out that we're the best we believe in taking care of clients insurance needs and our pipeline we use salesforce.com so I have a look into our pipeline and we're very aggressive new business company and all of us every one of around this table is involved every day in helping people put new business on the books. We\u2019re focused on niche areas that we\u2019re very good at and I think that our new business will continue be very strong I think we have an awful lot to offer our customers and we had got a lot of people out on the street telling people they should be doing business with us.","Unidentified Analyst","And for the contingents and supplementals which are really strong this year, I know that you said the contingents had a really strong quarter just because of seasonality but could you kind of on your expectations for those two for the rest of the year as well","Doug Howell","Yes I think the best thing to do on that as we call contingents are significantly skewed towards the first quarter and encourage you to use the supplement that we have on the website that shows you the trends and supplemental contingents in the next three quarters and when you building your models I do some site takes off of that but you can extrapolate just off the first quarter you have to look at the seasonality that comes with those. But overall the carriers are recognizing the value that we provide in the process and so I think that we've got an upward trend in those that might outpace the trend in our base commissions in fees.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Elyse Greenspan","Just wanted to follow up on you guys had laid out on organic growth outlook for the brokerage business about 2.52% to 3.5% for this year. Obviously Q1 came in a little bit stronger, are you now thinking about the potentially see organic growth come in above that range?","Patrick Gallagher","Above the 2.5?","Elyse Greenspan","2.5 to 3.5","Patrick Gallagher","Yes.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay and then you mentioned Australia coming in at about flat in the first quarter, just directionally what type of comp are we coming off what type of organic growth do we see in the fourth quarter can you just remind us and then just based on your expectations thinking forward for the year. You anticipate starting to see positive contributions from the Australia and New Zealand business?","Doug Howell","Yes always the question this is about just down there some of the couple weeks down Austria folks in if you recall we picked up that organization from the Wesfarmers folks which is an industrial conglomerate this has been really terrific opportunity for us there was they are starting the is the Gallagher playbook are starting to focus on sales the way we do in our sales meetings and I see them as really turn the quarter that they were fighting three things first lack of a sales culture that were really changing","Australia right in terms of the economic conditions down there obviously Australia suffered a little bit from lack of exports in China and then also there was a rate toward the right kind going on there so the kind of had three headwinds I believe all three of those are turning I believe there's stability in the marketplace on the rating side I think economic this growth is starting to come back and Australia I think the sales force is alive and well we launched a couple of new products down there, that are really good in the small business space so the trend in that we're seeing negative organic growth last year each quarter and this quarter we're pushing more towards the positive territory so a really good work by the team down there.","Patrick Gallagher","And New Zealand is killing it.","Elyse Greenspan","And then as we think about the margins for the brokerage business for the balance of the year you guys all about 80 basis points of improvement in the first order was any kind of one-off items in that or is that kind of some type of run rate to assume if we kind of see a consistent level of organic growth.","Doug Howell","I don\u2019t know if I can say it's a run rate or not, on obviously if you don\u2019t have 3% organic growth we\u2019ve said it's pretty hard to expand margins. One of the things about it in the first quarter is that contingents have a large impact on that. But in our margin expansion in the first quarter again relative to last quarter last year same quarter if you look at the margin expansion without contingents you get about half of that expansion that feels more logical to me than a full 80 basis points.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay and then in terms of the deal for the acquisition front the Q1 you had mentioned seasonally a weaker quarter in terms of transactions, last year the Q2 was your strongest quarter would you expect that to be the case again the second quarter just had as a pipeline of coming deals. Thank you","Patrick Gallagher","We have closed four additional deal since the quarter ended so we've got 12 done for the year and the pipeline is robust. Whether or not they actually close in the second quarter third or fourth every single deal has its own life, it has it's lifespan but we've got a very solid pipeline.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Sean Dargan of Macquarie. Please proceed with your question. ","Sean Dargan","If I can follow up on Elyse's question about Australia and tie that to a comment in the press release about cycle bottoming in select geographies outside the U.S. I know that you were experiencing negative organic growth in Australia I believe that was the only geography in the world you were doing so, is that item in the press release specifically talking about Australia?","Doug Howell","Yes Australia and New Zealand in particular.","Sean Dargan","And then in the shareholders letter with the March annual report, they mentioned trying to export the MMA market to the UK and it appears to me that's essentially what you've already been doing kind of creating a roll up business there, do you expect any competitive threat from that, I'm just curious what your thoughts are on that","Patrick Gallagher","We're really happy with our position in the UK. If you remember just three years ago we can really have the retail presence in UK at all, today we\u2019re one of the five largest players in that market, that group has come together very well the rebranding has been done, it's all Gallagher now, you recall it was all Oval, Giles and Heath [ph] and so we're Arthur Gallagher across about 70 outlets through the UK and yes, it's a competitive marketplace just like the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand but we think we compete pretty.","Doug Howell","Yes I think it's nice affirmation of what we saw too that there is good opportunity in the retail space in the UK and I think there is lots of opportunity there, there is still some private equity owned firms there, they are going have to do something as time comes up and I think people will realizing better to be with a strategic with an independent or private equity owned so we're seeing terrific opportunities there","Operator","Our next question is coming from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. ","Unidentified Analyst","This is [indiscernible] for Kai Pan. First I just want to go back to the organic growth, so Pat, what has changed since December now that you are expecting even higher than to 2.5% to 3.5% organic growth so what has changed from the December?","Patrick Gallagher","The marketplace I think it's probably a little bit more stable and I thought it was going to be coming into the end of the year. October November last year we saw probably a little bit softer market than we're seeing today. Property is soft no question about especially on the cat side but probably a little bit more stable market and I think our closing ratios is up just a bit. We've had very solid pipeline of new business opportunities and our team is doing very well new business.","Doug Howell","I think also to add to that, the second quarter is our highest property quarter for us. As you look at your models I don't know if I would necessarily assume that it will be the same over the next three quarters you might want to caution yourself a little bit on the second quarter because the property rates but also I think just since the November and December this is a stable environment and I think our clients are having the opportunity to build -- see the value that we bring. In a stable environment we outshine a lot of our other small competitors in particular so that when Pat is talking about our hit ratio being better that's what we're seeing there.","Unidentified Analyst","And I terms of risk management segment, the organic growth slowed from 4Q, was there anything specific and on top of it the margin expansion was still strong over 100 basis points, so even with the mid-single-digit organic growth in that segment you can post a strong margin for the rest of the year?","Doug Howell","Yes to answer your question backward, yes, when mid-single digits we believe there's an opportunity to still that our 17% margin target in each of the next three quarters in terms of which is expansion over last year. In terms of what's happening on the organic side if you go back to look at our supplemented over time there have been some periods where Gallagher Bassett has growth has been in the higher 5% or 6% range and jumps up to the 10% or 12% and the reason why is that as we look at some larger accounts they typical will incept on January 1 or on July 1 and there are sometimes where they -- we get them in the pipeline in 2015 hoping that the incept on January 1 but switching over to us can take some time. So we see more new business incepting in July 1 this year than let's say maybe in the past where it incepted on January 1. So it's a step a little bit of a step function type business some of these are pretty large accounts we're seeing we had 6% growth in the U.S. Australia is largely flat at this point but again there's a big programs that are coming up for proposal over the next couple of years down there.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay and then last question on headcount, I think I saw headcount number go down and that\u2019s probably first time in a long time, was there something specific there or is this to maintain margins, expenses?","Doug Howell","I think what you're looking at is a headcount on the brokerage side dropped about 45 heads between since the end since the last period yet we still had acquisitions that might have added a 100 or 150 so we're probably net backwards 200, its largely as a result of our integration efforts, our productivity initiatives, most of that we didn't have big layouts most of that is just through natural exits that happen in the business but it just shows that we're getting more productive every day.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jeff Schmidt of William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Schmidt","Quick question on the wholesale business and apologize if I missed this but how is that doing from an organic growth perspective given property prices I guess is that about 20% of the brokerage segment?","Patrick Gallagher","It's a little less than 20% wholesale is up about 2% for the quarter and yes they had headwinds on property side and you need to know that in the second quarter is their biggest property quarter.","Jeff Schmidt","Right. Right. Okay. And then in the clean energy segment are you seeing volume or guess consumption rather from coal plants is being affected of all I know there's distress in the industry there's bankruptcies what's the outlook there?","Doug Howell","Yes let me tell you there are three answers in that question first when it comes to the bankruptcies most of those when the coal mines go bankrupt it's usually a holding company bankruptcy but the mines are still operating because they have contracts with have to continue to deliver coal on and a lot of these utilities have had required to take contracts, so the call is still moving even though the holding company might be bankrupt, I think there has been five of them in the last year or so, as they restructure and make themselves more efficient.","Second of all the power plants as you recall when we put our clean energy plants and the power plant we put them earlier in the dispatch curve so when we do our plants these are plants that are more likely to run unless they are less efficient plants that only get dispatch during the high peak loads. We're at the mercy of the weather, we did have a little bit of a warmer winter that did impact us a little bit but we still see that we're on track. This program runs through 2021 so long-term displacement of coal to other fuels it takes a long time to displace implants and this program goes justly for another five years. And truthfully the amount of displacement that\u2019s happened over the last eight years probably is not likely to repeat because they just placed to natural gas and the plants that they couldn't and they really can't move these plans to natural gas that we're offering them efficiently and effectively the next five years.","So in summary I was going to say I think we're still well-positioned I still see us having 50% growth in their net earnings this year we still have other plants that we're working on putting in place that should continue to expand our earnings as you look into the future, so overall I would say it's a steady state business.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Bob Glasspiegel of Janney Capital","Bob Glasspiegel","Was curious on Gallagher Bassett were you saying your budget a little bit on your 17% margin expectations given the first quarter","Patrick Gallagher","No","Bob Glasspiegel","I think the guidance was 17% margins for the year and you came in above that so I was just wondering whether you're still managing the 70% margin for the year?","Patrick Gallagher","Yes the way that their compensation raising, increases happen, it doesn't happen in the first quarter so you'll see that be more like 17% going forward so 17.6 on a couple of hundred million dollars of revenue might have been $1 million less than of expense than we expected initially but I feel 17% in the next three quarters is achievable","Bob Glasspiegel","Okay so you will beat 17 for the year if you do 17 for the next three quarters just for modeling purposes, just want to make sure or you'll get to 17 for the year just","Patrick Gallagher","That's right Bob","Bob Glasspiegel","I just a macro question Pat your good sort of talking about the environment and what implications big companies mean , [indiscernible] retrenching indicating the volume is not an objective and underwriting is they are going to write less today and with Chubb and ACE going through big merger we got three of the very big players in some state of transition, does that have any positive implication to the environment maybe, a reason why you\u2019re a little bit more optimistic about organic for the year or is it all just execution versus macro?","Patrick Gallagher","I think Bob, for us it's more execution than it is macro. Those are big trading partners for us. In each instance we've got deep, very meaningful relationships with each of them. Each have their own issues that they are dealing with but our trading relationship is very strong and continues to grow at all three of them. So it's really not those the driving the market I think really, we know that 90% of the time when we compete, we compete with the player who's smaller than we're, in our 32 in the United States are 32 areas of focus, our verticals are very strong. We know those businesses and we think we're probably cover than anybody in any of those and new business is very strong.","Bob Glasspiegel","Just pushing out it's a little bit tighter so you're saying you're not seeing zero ID changing their underwriting behavior and willingness to cut prices to hold onto a new account? Sort of underwriting is normal for them.","Patrick Gallagher","Yes I think what I've been impressed with over the last five years is we've had ups and downs in various lines of coverage that have gone soft or hard keeping know what those lines of coverage need. But over the last five years we\u2019ve see more discipline on the underwriting side than I\u2019ve in my 40 year career and I think that remains I mean, I think it has to property clients deserve a decrease. The wind hasn't blown so there should be no shock to anybody that kept properties off. When you take a look at workers compensation depending on the geography, the state what have you, when it needs to go that goes up a bit, when it needs to come down it comes down a bit, DNO [ph] same sort of thing. So what we're seeing is many cycles within the lines of coverage based on what really needs to happen to those lines and I think that's a level of discipline that the industry has enjoyed for five years that I've never seen before. So I think it's more the same of that Bob, yes those three companies have issues that they are dealing with but by and large, they are trading on the street they're doing very well.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Mark Hughes of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Hughes","You describe a stable environment in the P&C sector does that mean pricing is relatively stable or just kind of stable down a few points?","Patrick Gallagher","I would say pricing is relatively stable, I mean look any account you can go into any of our offices and go to a sales meeting and you're going to hear a story of somebody getting a 25% decrease and someone is going to be shocked by it and what have you. But when you look at our book of business across the entire platform and you see that really rate and environment and rate exposures cost us a half a point well that's no soft market, I mean you can have an account that gets knocked down big time but by and large when you look across the entire platform it's pretty stable situation with the exception of the property business and to some degree transportation.","Mark Hughes","And then what was your with your comment about wholesale outside of property understand that is the how about otherwise?","Patrick Gallagher","It a strong, we're good. I mean casually lines and with the exception of energy and natural resources our wholesale business is very strong as is our MGA business.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question is coming from Quentin McMillan of KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Quentin McMillan","Doug just to talk about [indiscernible] quick it was stronger in the quarter in terms of tax utilization, I assuming that's just because of the stronger earnings that you had in what is a sort of the seasonally weaker earnings quarter for you, first is that the correct way to think about it and then secondly and I apologize for asking such a long dated question but you guys have sort of a plan for post-the ChemMod tax credits in 2021, 2023 timeframe of what you may want to do to recover that tax strategy?","Patrick Gallagher","First question yes it was because we had a stronger first quarter that caused us to recognize a little bit more when you have more organic growth you have more earnings and therefore you recognize a little tax credits, so that\u2019s a first one. Longer term, even though when we talk about at the end of this program to generate credits being expired in 2021 our plan is to hit the end of 2021 with a long glide path of having a balance sheet with a substantial amount of credits in it that can continue to reduce our tax rates well into the 2020s so even though the generation phase maybe over in 2021 the actual utilization of credit should go up I think right now we have about 375 million that's in our balance sheet right now, we're using about $100 million a year I'd like to have 5, or 6, 7 year balance sheet by the time we hit that point.","So I think now what we have is opportunities after-the-fact? Listen we thought at the end of section 29 which was the precursor to section 45 credits that we were done and there is something else the government does in order to foster tax credits, the government really understands that better energy is a good policy and therefore they want to incense commercial enterprises to go out and develop new technologies to better the environment. So I think there could be another program at the 2021 but we got five years to work on that but in terms of the cash generation look at this as well into the 20s.","Quentin McMillan","Okay great long-term and you guys will replace it with something when the time comes is sort of the short answer of it?","Patrick Gallagher","We've done it only for the last 20 years so I think there's something else out there","Quentin McMillan","And then one other question just on competition, there was an article or two on liberty mutual talking about unbundling their insurance and claims services to potentially lower claims cost for their clients, would that create kind of a more competition for Gallagher Bassett, a headwind on either the margins or the growth or how do you guys view that?","Patrick Gallagher","It's exactly the opposite of that Quentin, this is a great opportunity for Gallagher Bassett the marketplace has been an unbundled marketplace for large accounts for the last 20 years and liberty has unbundled at times as well. This is just more opportunity for GB to showcase their wares in terms of being able to convince clients that using Gallagher Bassett will lower their claim cost and we\u2019re pleased that liberty is coming that direction","Doug Howell","We have a lot of carriers that are recognizing their claim outcomes are better with Gallagher Bassett because Gallagher Bassett and customize the claim delivery to the customer not necessarily to the way that carrier wants to end to be able to customize the delivery of the service that we provide will deliver better claim outcomes the carriers recognize that we do it for a lot of carriers and we\u2019re really good, when we\u2019re paying about $10 billion a year of claims primarily in the workers comp or general liability space we\u2019re experts in that business and our outcomes are better so this is another acknowledgment by a carrier that there are some things that we might feel be able to do better than them and so I think this is a terrific opportunity for us as these carriers recognize that we can do things for them.","Quentin McMillan","In addition to beneficial outcomes you think that your pricing might be more competitive even more beneficial for the clients who might want to use the Bassett services","Patrick Gallagher","Yes.","Doug Howell","90% of the claim goes on the claim cost, only 10% goes out in the adjusting cost so if you can reduce the 90% by a little bit you can sure have to pay for a lot of the 10%.","Operator","We are showing an additional question in queue from Charles Sebaski of BMO. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Sebaski","I was curious about the UK business and what's going on particularly the announcement of compass potentially looking at and MBO just overall what's going on? What affect that might have? Any color would be appreciated","Patrick Gallagher","Yes we did that on this before Charles but I'll be glad to do it again we're very pleased with the progress we've made in the UK especially on our retail side. our specialty business is second to none there and our London broking business is really top of the game, retail you will recall is acquisition of three players that we put together over the last couple of years, it's going extremely well we had about 3% organic growth in the quarter on our retail business it's all rebranded from Giles and Oval and Heath to Gallagher, organic growth is on the uptick and we see really good things happening there.","Doug Howell","Yes in terms of the comp, the revenues on that was a less than $5 million so it's not a big deal now that was the network of relationships that were provided to the UK retail space that came from either Giles or Oval I can't remember exactly which one but truthfully our guys don't need a network now because they are part of Gallagher and they can trade within Gallagher, they can get the resources and the capabilities that they need and so compass really is an opportunity for smaller retail brokers and it doesn't really work inside of Gallagher so our selling that off is a no never mind to be honest.","Charles Sebaski","Okay so 5 million bucks decrease going forward and that's about it for that?","Doug Howell","Revenue","Charles Sebaski","Revenue?","Doug Howell","Right","Operator","We do have another question coming from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Josh Shanker","Two questions, one is the headcount reduction I assume this mostly integration can we talk whether those further headcount reductions for integration going forward till the end of year that we will notice and to our market any thoughts for our RPS now that Willis and Miller have hooked up together what might be for the competitive market there","Patrick Gallagher","Going backwards when it comes to the Willis and Miller dealer is the fact that RPS trades primarily with other than the large broker so it doesn't really have much of an impact to RPS I would say there's nothing there when it comes to the headcount I think because we're seasonally smallest in our acquisitions in the first quarter you see the decrease in headcount more so I think that when you look at going forward the price increases in headcount is our acquisitions are coming on but underlying yes we're controlling our headcount through attrition through becoming more productive and so if we didn't have the rolling of acquisitions you probably see decrease in headcount just from natural attrition and this is we're actually getting better every day.","Josh Shanker","Okay I appreciate the answers as always room buyback inasmuch as let me know","Patrick Gallagher","What's on in the quarter offset the shares that we used in tax-free reorg so it's out there.","Operator","We're showing no further questions in queue. Mr. Gallagher do you have any additional or closing comments at","Patrick Gallagher","Thank you very much everyone for joining us this morning. We really appreciate it. We\u2019re excited about the results for the quarter and look forward to a strong 2016. Have a great day","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation.

(NYSE:AJG) Q4 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call January 30, 2020  5:15 PM ET","Company Participants","J.

Gallagher & Company's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Participants have placed on a listen-only mode. Your line will be open for questions following the presentation. Today's call is being recorded. And if you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Some of the comments made during this conference call, including answers given in response to questions, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties discussed on this call or described in the company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Patrick Gallagher, Chairman, President and CEO of Arthur J. Gallagher & Company. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call. With me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer as well as the heads of our operating divisions.","We finished 2019 on a high note. The brokerage and risk management teams delivered outstanding results on all measures. In the quarter we combine to post 17% growth in revenue, 5.8% all in organic growth, expanded margins of 134 basis points and we completed 11 mergers during the quarter representing about $117 million of annualized revenue.","This caps off an excellent full-year where our combined brokerage and risk management teams posted 14% growth in revenue, 5.6% all inorganic growth, expanded margins 76 basis points and we completed 49 mergers representing about $468 million of annualized revenue, an outstanding quarter, an excellent full year and I'm more confident today that this momentum will continue in 2021.","I want to thank every Gallagher professional for their relentless focus on delivering the very best insurance brokerage, consulting and risk management services to our customers around the world. ","Let me peel back our fourth quarter results a bit more by segment and give some thoughts on why I have reason to believe that 2020 will be as good, if not better the 2019. Our comments today will focus on the four key drivers of our long-term value creation strategy.","Those four are, number one, organic growth including what we're seeing around the world in terms of rate exposures. Number two, merger and acquisition growth in our current merger pipeline. Number three, improving our productivity and quality. And four, what makes us -- what makes all this happen which is our bedrock culture.","Now let's moved to our brokerage segment performance starting with organic. Fourth quarter organic growth was 6.1% all in, base commission and fee growth was a little over then that due to the repricing of a wholesale program, which we discussed at our December IR day.","But contingents performed a bit better than we expected not an exact offset, but close. Let me breakdown our organic growth by geography. First, our domestic retail P&C operations were very strong above 6% and retail benefits were up around 4%. Our domestic wholesale operations, that's our open brokerage program manager and underwriting business were up about 7%.","Outside the U.S. our UK operations posted 6% organic. Canada was up more than 10% and Australia and New Zealand grew around 6%. PC rates and exposures continue to be a tailwind to our organic growth, with renewal premium change now comfortably above 5%.","Let me give you a few noteworthy sound bites for the quarter. Starting in the U.S. our retail PC and wholesale business, up about 5.5%, property lines are up about 9%, while casualty lines are up about six, workers compensation is down a couple points. Renewal change in our open brokerage wholesale business is the strongest domestically up about 7%.","Moving to the UK. Retails up about 3.5% with continued upward pressure on professional liability, which is up close to 7%. London specialty is up around 5% to 10% in many classes. In Canada, up about 5% across most lines of business with property up [Indiscernible] New Zealand is up around 4%, but its been drifting lower from 2018 levels. And finally Australia is of about 7%.","So after trending higher geographies for the past two years, I would characterize the PC market is having moved from stable to firm, not hard like we saw the mid-80s in the nearly 2000s, but certainly firm.","Our recent survey of our PC producers suggest that the 2019 rate momentum has continued in the 2020, further unemployment remains at historically low levels nearly everywhere in our clients businesses are expanding in a favorable economic environment. Taken together these market conditions should continue to provide us with a nice organic growth tailwind.","That said, we're still in an environment where professionals can develop creative solutions that help our clients mitigate or partially mitigate rate increases. In addition, clients will ask us to deliver a risk management program within their budget that might be flat or up only a percent or two.","That means they might opt out of certain coverages, increased deductibles, reduce limits et cetera. In other words, not all the rate tailwinds show up in our organic growth. So as I sit here today, I see 2020 brokerage organic growth again in the upper 5% range and might very well take over 6% especially if we don't have a deterioration in economic confidence.","Now let me talk about brokerage fourth quarter merger and acquisition growth. We had another active quarter completing 11 brokerage acquisitions with average revenues of about $10 million. Our merger and acquisition momentum continues. Already this year we've announced four tuck-in mergers and also moved to 100% ownership of Capsicum Re.","We are excited to be fully together now the Capsicum team. And I would like to thank all of our new partners for joining us. And I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals.","Looking forward our internal M&A pipeline report shows around $250 million of revenues associated with about 50 term sheets either agreed-upon or being prepared. This is down a little bit for the last few quarters as first quarter deal activity can be a little slower than later quarters.","But I'd still believe that 2020 should be another strong year for our tuck-in merger and acquisition strategy as we continue to attract entrepreneurial partners that believe in our unique culture and realize that we could be more successful together.","Moving to productivity and quality. Brokerage adjusted EBITDAC margins expanded 151 basis points this quarter, helps by higher contingent commissions and acquisitions. This marks the 33rd consecutive quarter of margin expansion and is a reflection of all the hard work that brokerage team is done to find efficiencies and increase quality.","So to wrap up the brokerage segment, for the full year we delivered 15% growth in revenue, 5.8% all in organic growth, adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 75 basis points and we completed 46 mergers representing about $452 million of annualized revenues. What an outstanding year for our brokerage team.","Next, I would like to move to our risk management segment. Fourth quarter organic growth was a solid 4.7% in line with the mid-single digit organic guidance we provided at our December IR Day.","Underlying the organic results we saw workers compensation and general liability claim counts growing in the 1% range for the full year. Pricing increases are modest. But new business wins highlight that are highly effective in customized claims, handling capabilities are being recognized as driving better outcomes.","We continue to see carriers outsourcing a portion of their claims operations as a great long-term opportunity for Gallagher Bassett. As we look forward to next year, we estimate 2020 risk management organic will be in the 5% to 7% range.","So wrap up my risk management comments, for the full year we posted 5% growth in total revenue, 4.4% all in organic growth, adjusted EBITDAC margin of 74%, and we completed three mergers representing about $16 million of annualized revenue, another really solid year for the Gallagher Bassett team.","And finally, I'll touch on our unique Gallagher culture. You can see from the results that we've shared today, the Gallagher Way continues to drive our consistent growth. Our shared values help maintain our culture and encourage employees worldwide to push for excellence in everything we do.","Our cultures has earned us recognition in 2019 as the world's most ethical company, eighth consecutive years running. Just last week, we also received a top score 100% on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index. This is the second consecutive year we receive this honor.","As proud as I am of the outstanding performance we had this last quarter, this last year and this last decade. I'm more proud of the way our culture has stay true throughout all of that. We've always been guided by the Gallagher Way and for 92 plus years we've been building this unique culture. I'm looking forward to seeing our culture thrive in this new decade.","Okay. A great quarter and a fantastic year across the board. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?","Doug Howell","Thanks Pat, and good afternoon everyone. Before I dive into our result, I too would like to thank all of our professionals around the world for such a strong finish to a great year. It is especially exciting to report back-to-back years as a more than 5% organic growth and the environment is right to make that to repeat here in 2020.","If I step back and look at our adjusted results for the quarter, our brokerage segment posted $0.67, our risk management segment $0.09, and our corporate segment a loss of $0.18. So total adjusted EPS of $.58.","Risk management and the corporate segment were in line with our December Investor Day expectations and our brokerage segment came in even better. When you look at the brokerage organic table on page five and the EBITDAC margin table on page six, you'll see that strength in our brokerage segment came from strong organic growth of over 6% and adjusted margin expansion of 151 basis points.","Of that 151 basis points about a third was related to higher contingents, about another third due to seasonality of a couple recent acquisitions and the remaining third is margin expansion we would expect in a mid 5% base commission and fee organic environment.","Having now been through our 2020 budgeting process, it is clear that we're seeing the benefits of our constant focus on improving our productivity, lowering our cost all the while ensuring that we raise our quality also.","It is an environment where rates are increasing -- excuse me, in an environment where rates are increasing, it takes more work by our teams to develop creative solutions, shop the market and guide our clients, that increases our cost somewhat.","In addition, we're making substantial investments in hardening our IT environment, building our data and analytics capabilities, investing in marketing and brand awareness, growing our producer ranks and other investments that help us sell more hire more and acquire.","However, we can offset these rising costs and still expand margins. Our businesses are proving that scale and our efforts over the last 15 years to standardize and shift work into our offshore centers of excellence can lead to steady improvements that offset wage increases and inflation and yet still allow us to make very important investment.","So, when I look at 2020, I see another year like 2019. If we have organic in the upper 5% range, margin should expand 50 to 70 basis points. One other small net, when you get back to page 12, you'll see that the impact of minority interest on our brokerage segment EPS is better than our December IR day estimates.","On the surface that gives the appearance of a couple million dollars or a penny or s better. But that's not really the case. You can't see if there's a like-for-like unfavorable amount in our base numbers, so that washes out to nothing. So no impact on EPS.","Moving to the risk management segment on pages six and seven, you heard Pat talk about the solid organic growth and we posted margins above 17% despite lesser performance revenues and I think that's really good work by the team this quarter.","Looking towards 2020 we're a bit more optimistic about organic and we're also targeting margins in the upper 17% range. Our risk management team is also seen scale advantages which is allowing us to provide deeper and more specialized services that deliver better claim outcomes for our customers.","As for the non-GAAP adjustments this quarter, most are very close to what we forecasted during our December IR day. But there was one new item for the fourth quarter. Our full year 2019 effective tax rate dropped during the fourth quarter when we filed our state tax returns.","These filings triggered a benefit primarily due to reinforcement and some changes we made our legal entity structure. It's a real drop for the full year and going forward. But we did adjust out the favorable catch up amounts from earlier quarters.","Moving now to the corporate segment on page eight of the earnings release. Nothing significant here from our December IR day. Interest is in line. Clean energy a little better. M&A costs were little higher yet corporate costs a little lower.","So now, let's move to the CFO commentary document we post on our website. On page two, you'll see that we have now provided our first look at 2020 for items related to brokerage and risk management segment.","As an overall, we have the capacity to do another $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion of mergers again this year with cash and debt. But you should know that we don't include any future mergers in any of the estimates we're providing in the CFO commentary document. Our estimates only include mergers that we've closed by today and debt that we have borrowed as of today.","So this mean you should start with our estimates for amortization expense, estimated earnout accretion expense and interest expense, but you must then make an estimate for additional amount for each of those line items that arise from future M&A.","So for example, if we do $1.6 billion of M&A this year and let's assume that all happens equally each quarter, call it $400 million a quarter, you'll see in footnote one that it says amortization should increase about 1% per dollar spent on M&A. So call that an additional $4 million [ph] in the second quarter, $8 million in the third and $12 million in the fourth.","As for earnout accretion that should grow about $1 million to $2 million a quarter on that example. And then asked for interest expense. We just closed a $575 million round. So our numbers already include interest for that. But if you assume we borrow another say $300 million on June 30 that would mean your interest expense estimate should go up by $3 million in third and $3 million in the fourth.","Again, these are just examples for illustration. My point is simply to make sure the assumptions for M&A factor in the non-cash amortization accretion and also the interest expense.","Two other items on page two of the CFO commentary. Noncontrolling interest, much lower going forward especially in the first quarter, because we now owned 100% Capsicum. And you'll see that we lowered our expected tax rate reflect the tax -- the state tax benefit I mentioned earlier.","Moving into page three of the CFO commentary, we've now added the light reddish columns which provides our first look at 2020 quarterly estimates and also updates our full year estimates that we provided during our December IR day.","Two matters to note. First, when you update your brokerage and risk management segment for our lower tax rate you'll need to also update for a lower state tax benefit in the corporate segment. We've done that for you in the reddish column.","The total company is actually a $0.02 to $0.03 benefit, but there is some geography between segments. Second, our 2020 quarterly comparatives to 2019 will change. Recall that in early 2019, we sold a non-core brokerage operation, that triggered a large gain, which then causes to recognize the large amount of credits in the first quarter of 2019.","We don't have any meaningful sales and profits, though we are not anticipating recognizing as many tax credits in the first quarter 2020. That will also caused all of 2020 quarters to be proportionally different than 2019.","Okay. I'll wrap up. It was an outstanding quarter to close out a really terrific year, setting us up for even a better year here in 2020. Back to you, Pat.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks Doug. Great quarter, fantastic year. Let's go to some questions and answers. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The call is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please state your question.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi. Thanks. Good evening.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Hi, Elyse.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi. My question is on -- I guess starting off with contingents within brokerage. Pretty strong this quarter. And it seems like that was really what drove the upside on the organic relative to your December expectations. Is that trendable? Or I guess, could maybe you could expand on what you're expecting from contingents in 2020 embedded within your upper 5% organic revenue guide?","Doug Howell","Yes. I think just at the level set, we had 5.5% on base, we had 6.1% or 6% or so on supplemental and then contingents were higher than that. It did drive a little bit of the upside. I think in December we're talking about being in the high 5% range. So it did add a little bit. Recall that we did reprice one program that we gave you a heads up about, that detracted from that.","As we're going forward, we think our position on contingents is still strong. The issue will be as the program start to have or contract start to have loss ratio problems you could see some softness in that in 2020 compared to how strong it was here in 2019. On the other hands if that's the case, you'd see that kind of the offset and stronger base commissions also.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then, the compensation of expense ratio that trended down nicely on this quarter and probably I think for most of quarters of 2019. Can you just talk about how we should think about savings going forward. I know in the press release you guys mentioned some headcounts and employee benefit savings as we think about modeling the potential margin improvement in 2020?","Doug Howell","Yes. I think -- we have some pretty good success. We had another wave of harvesting some of the gains from our offshore centers of excellence, so we have some headcount reductions. We watched attrition pretty closely this year. I wouldn't see the same amount of improvement purely in the compensation line, rather I think that if we're in the upper 5% you're going to see margin expansion in that 50 to 70 basis point range.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then, did the -- the aviation business, did all the earnings come on in the fourth quarter? Just trying to understand if that was a big impact on the margins you saw?","Doug Howell","Yes. I said in my comment, about a third of that came -- third of 150 basis points did come from the acquisition activity that rolled in the fourth quarter, a big piece of that is the aviation business. When you look at supplementals and when you -- you'll see a pretty good number there from acquisitions. That really is coming from a couple of the recent acquisitions that we did mid-year that came in the fourth quarter. But so, 50 basis points of our margin expansion is result of the rolling of acquisitions.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then one last question. The M&A multiple, you guys took up the range I think a little bit, but didn't change the high-end. And it did seem like some of your deals have been kind of above that of late. Is that just the larger deal? So -- are still like the smaller sized transactions, has the multiple just not moved that much on those deals?","Doug Howell","That's right. I think if you look at it for the -- I think there were seven large deals that we did this year. I'm going from memory and I think that those might have been about 9.5, but for the rest of the deals that we did it really were somewhere around between 8.5 and 9 or maybe like 8.8, if I remember right exactly. So if you bifurcate that -- and our M&A pipeline right now doesn't have any large deals that might push that multiple higher.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thanks. I appreciate the color.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks Elyse.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Please state your question.","Mike Zaremski","Hey. Good evening.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Hi, Mike.","Mike Zaremski","Follow-up a follow up to Elyse's question. So, Doug, in terms of the very healthy margin expansion in the brokerage segment, the seasonality from acquisitions, that's permanent, right, so we're not -- that's going to persist in 4Q 2020 and beyond. So I just want to be -- make sure?","Doug Howell","Yes. That would be right. So I might have some softness on margins a little bit in the first and the second quarter, but it would be there again for the first year -- for the full year.","Mike Zaremski","So yes. So then -- so if those acquisitions you're saying are lighter on margin. So, should we be expecting in some -- you're saying some a little bit basis points wise of pressure on the go forward 1Q, 2Q, 3Q?","Doug Howell","It might. I think if we're looking at a full-year of 50 to 70 basis points, let's split the difference, call it 60 basis point. You might not see a full 60 basis points in the first quarter and you catch up more towards the end of the year. But overall for the full-year will be in that 50 to 70 basis points in this environment at this point.","Mike Zaremski","Okay. Got it. And just to clarify the tax rate guidance you said that at this point permanent on a go forward basis?","Doug Howell","Yes. That's right.","Mike Zaremski","Okay. Got it. And well, thank you for all the color on how to do that M&A math in terms of accretion and whatnot. But -- so just want to kind of like at a high level, if multiples don't move higher as you -- given your guidance, the amount of EPS accretion you're getting as a percentage of earnings for 2020 versus 2019 should be similar?","Doug Howell","Yes. That's right.","Mike Zaremski","Okay. All right. Great.","Doug Howell","I think if you look at -- I think our whole program from last year probably added about $0.80 of EBITDA per share. So if you look at our program last year, and then you lose a little bit about on EPS, not losing, but it detracts that because the amortization of the intangibles. And so maybe that was somewhere around $0.20 to $0.30. So our whole M&A program if we took it as a one big bucket last year probably added $0.80 to $0.90 on a EBITDA per share basis and somewhere around $0.30 on a EPS basis.","Mike Zaremski","Okay. Got it. Thank you very much.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks Mike.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Mark Hughes with SunTrust. Please state your question.","Mark Hughes","Thank you. Good afternoon.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Good afternoon, Mark.","Mark Hughes","The risk management business you have historically wanted to kind of restrain the guidance or kept the number at about 17%. It sounds like its -- you're seeing it come in a little higher. Is that a change in mix, change in philosophy? What is driving that?","Doug Howell","I think it's just the fact that they are getting scale advantages. They've done a really great job of restructuring the field adjusting staff and resolution managers into a more specialized focus. So it's purely the fact to be able to put specialization, standardization right at the point of contact with a customer, and its delivering amazing outcomes in terms of the claim outcomes. People are getting back to work faster, cost to get them back to work are lower. It's really pretty remarkable the investments that the group has made over the last seven or eight years. So we think that those scale advantages will come through starting this year.","Mark Hughes","And then, I certainly hear your optimism about the 2020. Pat, I'm curious if you could maybe lay out a little, why you feel so optimistic? Kind of what is it in this market that you think gives it durability?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Well, in terms of durability, Mark, I think we said in the prepared comments. This is no mid 80s to early 2000s. But I do think that there's a recognition by the underwriting community that in particular in specific lines they've got to get this right. Again, this better than I do. You sitting there with really not much of a return on a huge investment portfolio that the industry has historically used to make sure that they've got a little wiggle room when it comes to combined ratios. And we also -- are saddled with the social inflation, current inflation.","So I think there's a really good knowledge of that in the marketplace. And frankly these underwriting companies are being very firm with our people in terms of what they need. They're not willing to put out the same kind of limits at really cheap premium amounts that they were just two, three years ago, is that they recognized that rates in particular in some of the property areas and cat exposed areas still need -- that it needs bolstering and I don't see that as something that's going to go away in the short term.","So while I'm not sitting there saying, wow, this is like 85. I do think that you get some discipline. We've talked about that in the past a bit. And I think if that continues along with our capabilities that continue to grow every quarter, we just get stronger and stronger in the marketplace. Remember, every time we go out to compete, I shouldn't say every time, 90% of the time plus we're competing with somebody smaller than we are. And the amount of data analytics that we're doing today. The amount of strength in our verticals just continues to grow literally every month, every quarter. Our acquisitions don't just add earnings to the picture, they had terrific talent. These people have built great, strong entrepreneurial cultures. They join us. Those cultures meld nicely and we've got a lot to sell. And I think as customers in particular in the upper middle market start to face down, increase in prices, maybe some reduction in coverages, they're more receptive to listening to our professional capabilities and that adds up to better hit ratios. So when I look at that across the whole board, are there pockets of softness, sure, worker's comp is going to continue to be a place where it's not firming, but at the same time I just think our capabilities shine in these types of markets.","Mark Hughes","I appreciate that. And then could you just refresh me quickly on the how much of your revenue comes from commissions, might be more sensitive to pricing and exposures as opposed to relatively fixed fees?","Doug Howell","Yes. I would point out. We did in the -- for the year we did $3.3 billion of commissions out of and fees were $1 billion. So out of the $5 billion a brokerage total revenues $3.3 of it are commissions. Call it [Indiscernible].","Mark Hughes","Thank you.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks Mark.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Meyer Shields from KBW. Please state your question.","Meyer Shields","Great. Thanks. Pat, I wonder if you could give us sort of an introductory overview as to Capsicum's current focus in terms of lines of business or region?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Yes. I mean, I think that they -- well, it's been -- let me just back up a second. I've been really pleased as you know that was a partnership that we were partial owner of before we went to the 100% perspective. Its probably the best de novo startup I've seen in my 45-year career. These guys have really done an unbelievable job. And it has been something that's been done literally focus by focus. So not to get into all the specifics of each individual operation. What was kind of amazing to me in the startup of this, and Grahame Chilton and I become close friends. We made a real effort at building out Calgary just 10, 15 years ago and it was a complete failure.","And one of the reasons was we were behind the eight ball when it came to huge amounts of analytics. And I think what Graham and Rupert and their team have found is that at the same time analytics are important, the whole capability to execute as a broker was something that was kind of diminishing in the marketplace. And they felt that they could take advantage of that by bringing a board, people who really were solid brokers supported by analytics as opposed to analytics people trying to broke. And I think that's proved out. So very, very strong in auto, very. very strong and property, very, very strong in FAC and very, very strong in international, very strong in cyber. And you see that again as we just continue to build verticals and that doesn't put us up against our major competitors in terms of their core day in and day out business. And there's just lots and lots of room to grow in that business. So I think it's going to be a great acquisition for us.","Meyer Shields","Okay. Fantastic. That was helpful. Second small ball question. Is -- does the renegotiated wholesale contract have any impact in future quarters? Or is that a onetime hit?","Doug Howell","There'll be a little drag in first and second quarter, but we think we've got the pricing right now. So I think we're in pretty good shape.","Meyer Shields","Okay. Fantastic. Thank you so much.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks Meyer.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Please state your question.","Greg Peters","Good afternoon. I just thought I'd follow up by -- I've been listening to these conference calls and you guys certainly reaffirmed it. We're in a strong pricing environment in many lines except maybe worker's comp. I'm curious what you're hearing from your customers? How are they reacting to it? Is it requiring more work from your brokers to place the business. Do you see these customers more willing to switch carriers? Do you see any change in retention ratios as they have to deal with these higher prices?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Well, let me make sure I hit all the questions, because I try to get them in order, but number one, our clients are not happy. As an industry we trained for well over a decade clients to expect reductions. So it's a pretty easy job to renew an account when you walk in and say, the good news is that this year prices are less than last year. And we've been doing that now since 2005. So you've got 14 years of flat to kind of down rates. And when you turn around and say, well, here it is that it's not going to be that way anymore. They're not happy.","Now one of the things you've got to do about that to your question about renewal retention and that type of thing is, we're coaching our team by and large the majority of our team have never really operate it in a firming market or a firm market to get out real early, and explain to clients that it's going to be different. So retentions at this point are very solid and similar to what we've seen along the way. But make no bones about it. This is the type of market that causes people to think twice the next time the phone rings and someone says I like to talk to you about your insurance. We've got to be really diligent on that and be once again selling to a client, why being with Gallagher provides them with a great difference in their own business.","It's not about our business. They don't care about our business. They care about what it's doing to them and their competitors. And I think that's where our analytic capabilities come in really handy explaining that look, I'm not saying it's easy and I'm not saying you can even pass it on immediately, but your competitors are facing the same type of thing. So I think retentions will be solid if we handle our clients well. Make no bones about it, they're not happy. This is not a disaster. The good news is we can get it done. If you say, look I need 100 million of cover. That's what my contracts require or that's what I feel comfortable having. We'll get it. The price is just going to be a little different than it was before. And so, we've got to pull out that playbook.","Greg Peters","And Pat, this is follow up to that. So, we're hearing from some of the carriers that their retention ratios are dropping, which means that your customers are in some instances more willing to consider switching than ever before. Does that -- is just -- is there -- on a very granular basis, does that mean that particular customer is less profitable because you have more work to do? Or how does that boil up? I mean, you're -- obviously you're guiding to margin expansion and wonderful organic revenue growth for 2020. But how do I -- how should I think about that in terms of its effect on your organization?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Let me try again to take both questions in order. But number one, let's be real clear about this and there's no question about it, while we value our relations with our carriers and we view them as partners in helping our clients we represent our client period and the statement. We don't represent an insurance company. We represent our client. And that means where we sit down and they're saying, what do I do about this. That's one of the benefits about being with Gallagher is we can bring in the expert. We could show you how to navigate this and if it means higher retention and if it means change in carriers we'll recommend that. And that's what -- how the client benefits from being able to do business with us.","Yes. There's more work. Does that mean it drives costs through the roof. Not necessarily, because you got to be out real early. So you're going to see the more work in different ways. People are already bitching about the fact that it used to be easy to roll out a bed and place $25 million of umbrella without having to make more than two phone calls. That's not happening right now. They've got to get out of bed earlier. They've got to get their track shoes on and they've got to be better. That doesn't naturally drive costs up.","Doug Howell","And Greg, one of things as you know over the last 15 years as we've invested in our centers of excellence. The volume of additional quotes. The volume of some more proposals, we have the ability to do all that work in lower cost labor locations. So that helps knock the top off the cost escalation that might be there with some additional travel maybe needing a few more hands domestically working on the accounts. So we have a pretty good safety valve for that and that's why we can continue to make investments in the business. And I gave a laundry list of all the things we're doing, yet still show margin expansion.","When you look at this quarter, we still add 50, 60 base -- 50, 60, 70 basis points of margin expanded just on our core 5.5% base commission and fee, revenue growth. So without supplementals, without contingents we're still seeing that kind of margin expansion in the face of rising costs, rising wages, there is inflation out there and it's because we have the ability to have the use of lower cost labor locations that really are a machine that can pump out good high quality work for our customers without the escalation in cost.","Greg Peters","Thank you for those answers. I want to stay on the pricing commentary, but I want to pivot to your smart market operation. I think at your Management Day you said you had approximately 20 or 20 carriers on your smart market service. And I'm certain that many of the lines of business that are running through your smart market are the same lines of business that are seeing these changes in price. And I'm curious if the market, the firming of the market changes, the appetite for carriers to be on something like your smart market platform. And maybe you could just use that as an opportunity to just update us on the status of the smart market is the outlook for 2020 going to be -- is it going to be a growing business for you? Or is it going to be stable as consistent with it was last year? Some additional color there. Thank you.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks. Smart market I think is one of those examples of both scale and digital and IT capabilities really playing to the strength of an organization that has some size and breadth. For the audience basically what this does is it allows carriers that have, that are members of the smart market group to be able to look into a renewal book of business, not by name of account, but by SIC code and by anniversary date and by size, and to say this is a type of business that we're looking for to be able to tag that account, say, if in fact you are planning on marketing it, we'd like to see it. Those companies that have participated, smart market had superior growth rates to all the other companies that we've traded with on just a general trading basis. And that's not going to change because it's great intelligence.","For all of my career if you wanted to penetrate Gallagher, number one, it was difficult, because we traded geographically from business units. So if your XYX the insurance company and you want to grow Gallagher, you better get in the car and get out to our office and see our people. And it's catch as catch can. Some of our folks are in the office, some are marked. Yes, you can make appointments, but it's a hard slog. Well, it's a different thing if you've said I'm coming. I want to see this producer on this account and here's why you should listen to me. When producers are running hard and account managers are running hard and they don't really want to hear XYZ's general approach to the marketplace blah blah blah. They all sound the same.","Now, what you've got is a targeted approach. Just come and see somebody would say, I can help you on this and the reverse of that is true in our offices where we might be sitting there pulling our hair a little bit. They can, AIG has just announced they're getting our a surety. I know, the surety markets, but I'm not exactly sure where this one fits in. I've got Chubb coming in today. Let me ask him about it. So it really is. It's a program that works very well on both sides and that's not going away. That's just going to get stronger because what happens in this market is people start just over shopping and in particular those folks that have never seen any kind of a firm market before because their renewal is a phone call.","Well now guess what. They're going to sit across from Mr. Tough buyer who ain't happy and he's going to want to know why did you pick this company. How many other quotes did you get? Why did they turn me down? How come he didn't get more quotes? Our folks can sit there and say, we represent these carriers. We are able to talk to them about what their appetite is. And we went to those that truly have an appetite for your type of risk. It might be a little bit more money, but the renewing incumbent was up X plus 50. This we've matched you with someone who really wants you. It's not quite as onerous. It's a way more professional conversation. In the old days, you've said, why do I know I have a good deal. I'd say because I went to three markets. Here's the best deal. Buy it. That doesn't wash today.","So really if you think about it, this puts Gallagher in such a strong position against our smaller competitors. They've got no analytics. They've got no market intelligence. The market's appetites are changing. You get to learn that from conversations in the hallway and maybe the principal that has an account that he or she has handled this all these years. You're doing, you're flying by the seat of your pants. 90% of the time when we go out to compete that's who we're competing against. I think we're going to do pretty well.","Greg Peters","Thank you for your answers.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks Greg.","Operator","Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please state your question.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi. Thanks. One follow-up question. I think we were at your Investor Day in December. Doug, you had mentioned that there was the potential for some of the bills to the extent that you guys could generate credits, the clean energy credit beyond the expiration. And I know I think you were keeping some employees on hand at the start this year in case there was an extension. Do you have any kind of update there as we think about not just the 2009 plans, but also the 2011 one?","Doug Howell","Yes. I think great question. I think first of all the level set. We were very successful in the fourth quarter of preserving many of our 2009 locations by shifting into those locations, a 2011 era plan that has an extra two years of production life on it. It was a machine. So we moved the machine. There was a low generating machine from one location into a higher producing location. That preserved a good chunk of the 2009 era production. We do have a handful of facilities that are kind of in shutdown mode right now waiting for a potential law extension. If we got the extension, it might add another $5 million to $10 million of earnings. But it's not a substantial amount of earnings to turn those plants back on.","That said, where does it stand in the legislative process right now? I don't think we'll see movement on that much before the summer. And really our objective on that is really to see if we can get an extension primarily related to the 2011 era plant. So we really do have the summer of 2020. We've got the fall session. We've got a lame-duck session regardless of which way the election goes. And then you also have into 2021 where you can get an extension on those for another couple of years. So, no progress in Washington on any front right now. But maybe we'll have some this summer as well.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you very much.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks Elyse.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question and answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Jay Patrick Gallagher for closing remarks.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon. As you can tell, I'm extremely pleased with our 2019 financial performance and we're excited about our future. Before we wrap up though, I'd like to thank our clients for their continued trust, our 33,000 plus colleagues for their passion, hard work and dedication. And finally our carrier partners who do play such an integral role in meeting our clients insurance and risk management needs. We look forward to speak with you again at our March 17th IR day in Rolling Meadows. Have a great evening and thanks for being with us.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call.

Some of the comments made during the conference call including answers given in response to questions may constitute forward-looking statements within the meanings of the Securities laws.

It is now my pleasure to introduce Patrick Gallagher, Chairman, President and CEO of Arthur J Gallagher & Co. Mr Gallagher, you may begin.","Patrick Gallagher","Thank you, Donna. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2016 earnings call. With me this morning is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions. Today, we're going to touch on four key components of our strategy to drive shareholder growth, organic growth, merger growth, improving our quality and productivity which Doug will spend most of his time on, and fourth, maintaining our unique culture. We have excelled on all four, year-to-date. First, let me talk about organic growth. In our brokerage segment, after a terrific first quarter of 4.8% organic growth, we posted 2.2%. But that was marked by the loss of a large account that we discussed at our June investor meeting. Excluding the large account, we would have been closer to 2.5%.","So for the first half, brokerage organic was 3.6% which in retrospect is darn good based on how I felt coming into the year, especially in this environment. Looking towards the second half of the year, I see our organic somewhere between our second quarter and year-to-date numbers. So I see an improvement going forward. Let me break down our organic around the world. I'm extremely pleased, every single division posted positive organic growth in the quarter. Our sales culture is alive and well. Domestically, in the United States, we saw about 3% organic growth. Rate and exposure had little over 1 point of negative impact on our domestic PC renewal result in the second quarter. Most of that was property which for us is proportionally higher in our second quarter.","Domestic casualty line's pricing remained similar to last year, where we're seeing a slight downward pressure. We're seeing a modest growth in exposure units overall. This remains an environment where our production teams can grow and outperform. Our domestic employed benefit consulting business also posted about 3% organic and is seeing a tremendous amount of new business opportunities. Our teams are showing new prospects in our vast array of services, tools and insight that they need to navigate a tight multi-generational labor market, rising healthcare costs and increasing regulatory complexities related to the ACA.","Our smaller competitors are falling behind each and every day. This business typically grows more in the second half of the year and it seems to me that will be the case again this year. Let me move to our international brokerage operations. Since our last call, I've spent a significant amount of time in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK. These teams are doing great. In fact, they're on a roll. After just 24 months of being part of the Gallagher family, I'm really pleased with how well we're working together, how our sales plans are becoming integrated and how our culture is thriving. All together, ex the one large account, our international operations posted about 2% organic growth in the second quarter, even with rates and exposures that are softer internationally that we see here domestically.","I'm pleased that our teams are growing through those headwinds and the results are solid. As a side note, it was really interesting been in the UK and Europe during Brexit. Remember, we don't have much business at all for mainland Europe. Insurance has been flowing in and out of London for over 300 years, long before the EU was formed. So other than a possible recession hitting the UK and the other EU countries and your guess about that is about as good as mine, I don't see it as a worrisome event for us in the near term. Longer term, I think we, in the industry, will successfully navigate any potential changes to the European insurance landscape.","Next, let me move to merger and acquisition growth. Over the past two years, we've returned to our focus on smaller tuck-in mergers. The average size for the 13 acquisitions this quarter was $3 million of revenue and an average of 7 times EBITDAC. So we're still finding really good opportunities at fair prices in the competitive merger environment, year-to-date 21 acquisitions which should add about $70 million of annualized revenue. We see a stronger second half of the year for acquisitions.","Our pipeline is outstanding. There are a lot of really talented, independent, family-owned sales and consulting professionals out there. They have excellent relationships with their clients. They have strong sales skills. They have a very strong entrepreneurial bent. They create value by joining Gallagher, where they have full access to our capabilities, expertise and resources. I've said for 30 years, pick your partners that have a culture similar to Gallagher and look out. One plus one together does make three, four and five. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us. I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals.","So to wrap up my comments on the brokerage segment, halfway through the year, we've posted 10% total revenue growth, of which 3.6% is organic. Adjusted EBITDAC growth of 13%. Adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 60 basis points. Integration costs are starting to wind down. We have an excellent M&A pipeline and fair multiples, truly excellent results through the first half.","Next, I'd like to move to our risk management segment which is primarily Gallagher Bassett. Risk management had a more challenging organic quarter. But I'm really pleased that we proactively managed expenses and exceeded our 17% margin target. Second quarter organic was challenged for three reasons. First, as we discussed at our Investor Day, we're seeing a bit of a lull in new business inception dates. Second, we experienced fewer new claims in the final two months of the quarter within the U.S.","Third, we recently learned that we're not likely to earn a large performance bonus award from our participation in an Australian work cover program, where we're one of five providers. For the fiscal year ended June 30, the program paid performance fees using 20 different criteria and several of the metrics had a big stretch. Unfortunately, we fell short. You'll see in the organic table on page 6 of the earnings release that we earned nothing here in the second quarter in 2016. We believe the other providers fell short too, but let me be clear, I'm disappointed. Going forward, we will return to positive organic growth in the third and fourth quarter.","Our client value proposition of delivering superior claim outcomes is stronger than ever. In fact, we've recently renewed a big program in Australia and had two nice new business wins, one in Australia, one in the UK. Our domestic new business pipeline is solid. Let me move to clean energy. Once again, we had a great quarter. The corporate segment earnings came in above the midpoint of the guidance range we previously provided. We're well on our way to delivering nearly 15% growth in annual after-tax earnings.","Lastly, on our culture, over the past three months, as I said, I have visited the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. I could tell you that our unique Gallagher culture is thriving and strong across our entire global footprint. This includes the over 300 promising college students globally learning about the greatest business on earth in our internship program. We're just wrapping up the 51st year of the Gallagher summer intern program. We believe the two-month program is an important investment in our future, as we like growing our own. So we've delivered an excellent first half of the year. The fundamentals of our business remain strong. We think the second half will even be a bit stronger.","Over to you, Doug.","Doug Howell","All right. Thanks, Pat. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll do some earnings release housekeeping, spend some time on our quality productivity and margins. I'll hit on integration, highlight some clean energy items and then wrap up with some comments on cash and capital management. Okay, to the housekeeping. You'll see that we made changes to our earnings release. We did so, because in May, the SEC published new guidance on the presentation of non-GAAP measures and we believe we've now gone the additional mile in the spirit of new guidance. It makes the tables a little busy, but the punchline here is that we have not removed any of our previous disclosures as we strive to remain as transparent as possible.","Also please recall that many of my forward-looking comments today, can be found on the document called, CFO commentary that we posted on our Investor Relations website. All right. Let me turn to margins which are a nice indicator, in my opinion, of our quality and productivity. Brokerage adjusted EBITDAC margins are up 57 basis points. Then risk management margin came in above our 17% adjusted margin target. Year-to-date, our margins have expanded in both brokerage by 60 basis points and risk management by 33 basis points. That's really terrific work by the team out there. ","Within the brokerage segment, margin expansion came mostly from our international operations. Recall that we believe there is an opportunity to expand margins in our Australia and UK retail businesses over the next couple years. We've made good progress on that this last quarter, as our margin improvement initiatives have kicked in. Let me give you a couple examples. First, we've moved all of our transactional accounting out of London into Glasgow. Once we clean it up in Glasgow, we then ship the work into our offshore centers of excellence which is really following the blueprint that we built here in the U.S.A over the last 10 years which allows us, when we bring new entities on, to move faster than ever before.","Second, as another example, in the UK, our retail team standardized core service related processes, such as endorsements, quoting and renewals across our 50 plus branches. In Australia, we've started consolidating our SME business from 25 plus branches into a few specialized centers that will focus on just small customers. All of this work has driven down our back and middle office costs. As we apropos, we can capitalize on our scale. To me, what's even more exciting is, we've dramatically improved the quality of our services and our customer experience. Every day our folks that work in the middle and back office, get up to be better, faster and wiser on how we spend money. Let me comment specifically also on integration. Recall that we did five large deals in late 2013 and early 2014. ","We're nearly finished with integration. I was in the UK a few weeks ago and the efforts to wrap this up are impressive. I was in Canada in May, by the end of this year, we will have migrated nearly all of the six or seven business units onto the same agency management system we use here in the U.S.A. Second quarter integration costs were right on our forecast of $0.05 a share, about half of last year's amount. You'll see in the CFO commentary sheet that we're anticipating about $0.06 to $0.07 total in the last half of 2016 in integration cost which is down dramatically from the $0.21, we spent in the last half of 2015. So our efforts are well on track to be done by early 2017. Let me turn to the risk management segment, Gallagher Bassett.","Over the last several years, we've been improving our service offering to deliver better claim outcomes. Much of the back-office improvement is very similar to what we have done in the brokerage segment. But in addition, we have improved the tools our adjustors use, such as automating manual and high-volume processes that are really necessary to do a great job, but frankly, can bog our folks down. We've also shifted nearly 1,000 associates into work from home locations. We've developed some specialized centers to focus on complex, specialized case management.","These efforts have allowed us to improve our margins in the risk management segment over the last couple years and should allow us to post margins for the year in the neighborhood of 17.5% which is up from our previous target of 17%. Shifting to the corporate segment, we landed $0.01 or so above the midpoint of our guidance that we provided during our investor meeting in June. Most of this was due to better clean energy earnings, because our plants ran ahead of plan in June, due to the hot weather that hit various parts of the country. We're still forecasting between $110 million and $120 million of net earnings for the year.","The first half was a little stronger, but the full year should be about where we estimated six months ago. It's also important to note that by the end of the year, we will have over $400 million of credits on our balance sheet. Effectively, that's a $400 million receivable from the government that will help us reduce our cash taxes paid for many years. As for cash, we've got about $150 million of available cash on our balance sheet. We're making really good progress in our UK bank account consolidation efforts to unlock available cash that we've talked about before. I think that we're down about 30% in the number of open bank accounts since the beginning of the year.","As for stock, we used no net shares for M&A this quarter. We actually bought some shares back during the Brexit market sell-off. We'll use those shares on some future tax rate exchange mergers coming up this year. So when you look back, we haven't used any net shares to do M&A in over a year. I think we can fund deals with cash and debt through year end. So, those are my comments. I think it was an excellent first half of the year. Back to you, Pat.","Patrick Gallagher","Thank you, Doug. Donna, we'll take some questions-and-answers now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Elyse Greenspan","I was hoping to spend a little bit -- get a little bit more color on your organic growth outlook that you provided for the second half of the year, in the range I guess of 2.5% to 3.5% or so given the Q2 and half-year one levels. How do you see that kind of shaking out, domestic and internationally? Then if the organic growth stays at that -- comes in at that level, do think that we could see the same degree of margin improvement in the brokerage business, that we saw in the first half of the year in the second half?","Patrick Gallagher","Well, first of all, when we post the organic growth that we posted, overcoming a large lost account which is -- the good thing about large accounts is they're great when you write them. They can make your results lumpy especially when you lose them.","So that's not a positive note. So I think going forward, we don't have any of those that I know are under attack right now. So I think a return to a more normal 2.5% to 3.5% organic is in sight. As it relates to margin improvement, where we see that opportunity is again, as Doug mentioned in his comments, Australia and the UK. The little caution I have there is that those markets are a bit softer than what we're seeing domestically.","Doug Howell","In terms of margin, where do we see that? I think in that range. We've always said, it's tough to expand margins if organic isn't above 3%. If we're above 3%, we might get a little bit of margin expansion. If we're below, I think we'd be able to hold margin in.","Elyse Greenspan","In Australia and New Zealand, you said is still bit softer. But you saw in the second quarter, would you say that represented sequential improvement from the first quarter?","Patrick Gallagher","Yes. And very nice improvement from 2015, so those teams have really jelled incredibly nicely and developing strong sales cultures. We've always had a very, very strong sales culture in New Zealand. Australia is coming on great and the UK and Canada as well.","Elyse Greenspan","What was the wholesale organic growth in the second quarter?","Doug Howell","In the mid 2%s, domestically, remember, property is a headwind for our wholesale business in the second quarter.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then in terms of -- I appreciate the disclosure you guys provide on the share count. As you start to think about deal flow and expectations for 2017, how do you think about managing the share count once we get beyond the end of 2016?","Patrick Gallagher","First and foremost, we have got a terrific deal pipeline, let's not forget that. Doing deals at less than 7x year-to-date, it really shows that we can still get some great merger partners at a fair price. Looking next year, I think, our cash is better by far next year compared to this year. Integration will be basically done. So we won't have big drags on that. We spent a lot of money on CapEx this year that I don't see us spending next year. So I see next year as a much better cash year than even this year. So would we need to shares in M&A in 2017? Not at current paces, I don't see that as happening.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Chai Gohil","This is Chai Gohil in for Kai Pan. I just wanted to go back to margins again. So brokerage margins expanded. You mentioned, it was savings in BI and real estate was also part of it. Doug, just wanted to get some color, if you expect margins to improve in the international operations? Lower integration cost, can it still expand in a sub 3% environment?","Doug Howell","I think there was two different things. I think overall, if you just look across the whole group, 3% organic growth is kind of the tipping point of margin expansion. But when you look at what we're doing to get better in the UK retail space and down in Australia in the retail space, there were some opportunities there. It's going to take us another year to 18 months to harvest some of those. But every day, those folks are doing a great job. What I really am pleased about is not only are they expanding their individual margins -- remember, these are businesses that are still the 20% margin range.","So we're not talking about businesses that aren't making money. They're making terrific money. They're doing this at the same time that they're training their folks. They're adopting the Gallagher play book, when it comes to our sales culture. So they're working through just getting better in the back and mid office. At the same time, they're spending money in order to get better at selling. So there's margin opportunity there. But remember, these are still business that are in the plus 20% margin range.","Chai Gohil","The second question I have is, in CFO commentary, you mentioned higher FX headwinds in the second half. Is that coming from Brexit? Anything else that could potentially impact from Brexit? I know you guys mentioned less revenue impact, but any comments?","Doug Howell","Listen on FX, good point. On the CFO commentary, what we say is we've adjusted -- we see a little bit more headwind on the revenue lines from the decreased pound that sold-off during the Brexit. But we really haven't changed our guidance on the impact of EPS. If you recall, Gallagher like many other global brokers have a lot of dollar-denominated revenues in the UK that is serviced with pound denominated expenses. So there is a little bit of a natural operating hedge there that mitigates some of the impact of the decreasing pound.","So it's more of a revenue headline story than it is an EPS story. Fortunately for us too is that we have so many M&A opportunities around the world that we don't need to repatriate our cash into the U.S. to have good uses for it. So even if there is a sell-off on the pound, there's some good opportunities for nice tuck-in mergers in the UK that we'll use our cash for.","Chai Gohil","That drives well into my final question. In terms of the second-half pipeline for M&A, now that the international acquisitions have integrated well, what do you see in terms of potential for international tuck-in acquisitions in terms of your overall second-half pipeline? Is it a greater share? What are the valuation multiples you are seeing there?","Patrick Gallagher","Well, first of all, the platforms are performing exactly as we had hoped. So the pipeline is built nicely in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the UK for tuck-in acquisitions. By tuck-in acquisitions, I mean acquisitions under $10 million in revenue, people that fit our culture and at multiples that we think are fair. So while there is competition and continuing growth in competition in the M&A space, especially from private equity, we're finding that the culture sells well, the pipeline is deep and the opportunities to expand continue to grow every single quarter.","Chai Gohil","Aren't the multiples different in international market than in U.S.?","Doug Howell","Yes, they're a little higher in Canada, probably the same in the UK. Maybe slightly lower in New Zealand and Australia.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Josh Shanker","It seems like a little bit -- you've might have gotten on my favorite hobby horse. It's almost like you're doing a share repurchase program. You intend maybe to issue some shares in the future, but you think your stock is cheap. Can we talk about -- is that a new mentality for you to be preemptively buying back stock?","Patrick Gallagher","No. We've said all along, for the last -- over a decade, that we've got three uses for stock -- or for our cash. The first is, we're going to buy brokers. That's what we're going to do. The second is, we're paying a very nice dividend to our shareholders. Thirdly, if there's extra cash, we use that to buy stock back. That's not a change in philosophy over more than a decade.","Doug Howell","In this case though, Josh, remember what we're trying to do. If we put out shares for tax-free exchanges so that there's a way for merger partners to exchange their stock for our stock, it creates a tax advantage for them. We'll use shares in acquisition -- shares when we do the acquisition. Then we'll turn around and buy a like amount in the market to keep the number of shares outstanding flat. In the second quarter, we had some opportunities to maybe pre-buy some of that stock when we saw the sell-off after Brexit. So we picked up those shares. We'll probably use those shares as we start closing some tax-free exchanges in the third and the fourth quarter.","Josh Shanker","Do you have a mental philosophy around what would be the trigger for you to do some pre-buying? I mean, look, your stocks -- you're storing up a lot of tax credits for the future with clean coal, even though you can't use them today, you know you'll use them in the future. If you were to buy back stock right now because you see the stock is cheap, you know you're making acquisitions in the future. So what's the trigger that you would pre-buy stock?","Doug Howell","Yes. I think you have to look at the debt ratio on that. As I think that we want to have a nice comfortable, say, debt ratio. So, for us to buy back the stock would mean we've have to lever up on debt. Then use that to buy shares and waiting for the tax credits to monetize into our financial statements from the balance sheet into our debt. That's something -- we can look at that. But it's not something that's on our plan right now.","Josh Shanker","Okay. And then I listened to your commentary about why the negative growth in Gallagher Bassett for the quarter. Going forward, is this an anomaly? Should we expect low -- the negative growth is not a common thing and we should probably resume a low single-digit growth for the foreseeable future?","Patrick Gallagher","I don't think we've had a negative quarter at Gallagher Bassett in my memory.","Josh Shanker","Me too, I'm with you.","Patrick Gallagher","Yes. So from my chair, Josh, yes, you'll see us return to organic this quarter.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Adam Klauber of William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Adam Klauber","Sorry, I missed some of the earlier comments, so sorry if these are repeats. But how's the wholesale business doing now compared to, say, six, nine months ago?","Patrick Gallagher","Our wholesale business is awesome. It is just awesome. To me, it's a corporate gem.","Doug Howell","I would say, Adam, remember again, we said on the front, property can be a little weak in the second quarter with the property market right now. But wholesale still was nicely in the upper 2%s when it comes to organic growth this quarter. So it's performing well, even in the kind of seasonal property quarter that they have.","Patrick Gallagher","All the way back at my earlier comments, Adam, first of all, we started this thing from scratch about 15 years ago, from dead scratch de novo startup. Today, we're the largest MGA in the United States. We're one of the strongest open market brokerage operations. When we started it, we had hoped that our own domestic PC branches would utilized RPS, but we also started it as a true wholesaler, open to our competitors throughout the United States. They've captured 50% of our go-forward wholesale business out of our retail branch network in the United States. That's because they perform.","Adam Klauber","And then on the benefit brokerage side, how are commission levels this year versus last year?","Patrick Gallagher","The commission levels on the small accounts are a struggle. I think that we see that with the mandated loss ratios in the smaller area, that they're squeezed. But remember, our benefits business is a consulting business. Yes, we get commissions, but it's negotiated as a fee. So if we're not receiving commissions on an account and we need a fee to do the work, we charge it as a fee. We're very, very successful at getting the remuneration we deserve in that business.","Adam Klauber","So is the benefit brokerage business, has that grown more or less than the average retail business?","Doug Howell","Honestly, it grew the same this quarter. In the front-end of the comments, we said it grew about 3% this quarter which is the same as our domestic retail. We also said in the commentary, it tends to grow a little better in the second half of year which is natural, as customers look at further year-end benefit planning.","Patrick Gallagher","Also, I'd point out that an awful lot of activity on the M&A side there, Adam. We've got really, really good M&A pipeline in the benefits business. For all the reasons you would imagine. The ACA is extremely complicated. The brokers that have really nice accounts, 500 lives to 1,000 lives, right in our sweet spot, are lining up to join our enterprise for all kinds of reasons, a lot of which is just the ACA is too difficult to deal with.","Adam Klauber","Right, okay. And then, sorry if you mentioned this also, how is growth in Canada going?","Patrick Gallagher","Really good, very pleased. Organic -- it's a little softer market up there, so organic around 2%. But we had seven separate brands when we bought Noraxis. Those brands are all Gallagher now. I was up there in May for a better part of a week, had a chance to interact with a whole bunch of the team. I will tell you that the interaction between those brands together and then their relations with their brethren in the United States and the UK is outstanding.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Mark Hughes of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Hughes","You had referred I think to a slowdown in claims activity within the risk management business. Did I read that correctly? Was that in worker's comp? Was that somewhere else?","Patrick Gallagher","Primarily, workers compensation in the United States which by the way is a good -- you can't sit and complain about slower claim growth, right? For our customers, that's a good thing. It can be an indicator that the economy is slowing a bit, because typically when you're putting on more shifts there is more claim activity. But this is not unusual -- from time to time, Gallagher Bassett will see loss control works better, clients are working very hard to cut the number of claims, we're helping them do that.","Doug Howell","It's interesting, because June was kind of the month that looked like a little bit of out of pattern number of new horizons. Went back and take a look and there are some times, we're just -- once every 22 months or something, you get a slow month. So I wouldn't consider it a trend necessarily, but it is something will keep an eye out in. As July comes in and August comes in, we'll get together again and we do an investor event in September. We'll update you on it. But we've had these patterns before, where just some months, the claims just don't show up.","Mark Hughes","And then, Pat, I wonder if you could prognosticate the casualty pricing, flat to down. How much longer do you think it remains flat here?","Patrick Gallagher","I've got to tell you, I give a lot of credit to the management teams of our major insurance companies. It's softer, as I said earlier, in New Zealand and Australia, Canada and the UK, especially in our specialty business in London. Those markets are soft. But here in the United States, we're coming up five, six years of what I would call, flat. When rates are down 1%, 2% or up 1%, 2%, in my experience, that's a flat market. In a typical hard market, rates are jumping 15%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%.","In a typical soft market, they're dropping 12%, 15%, could be 16%, 17%. We're five or six years now, where that band is 1.5% to 2% up, to 1.5% to 2% down. I know that's driven by the lack of investment returns in the investment market, but it's pretty darn good discipline by the underwriting community. We saw that again in the quarter, soft on the property side. I've said this in past quarters, I think our clients deserve that softness. They will pay a price when the wind blows. It hasn't for a number of years. So the property market is soft, but casualty, rate and exposures contributed less than 1% negative to our results this quarter, domestically. That's pretty good.","Doug Howell","By the way, that's a great environment.","Patrick Gallagher","That's a great environment for our clients. It's also a great environment for our producers. When rates are dropping 15% to 20%, anybody can throw a quote out there and catch it off guard, with a number that so low that lose your client. Today, it's all around how creative can you be? How helpful can you be to your client in helping them deal with their risk management costs.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Charles Sebaski of BMO. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Sebaski","I was hoping you could give a little more clarity on the work comp on the industry? I know you have -- it seems like frequency is down. Any thoughts for what you guys are seeing internally on severity of comp claims? Is severity down as well? Not just for this quarter but in general this year?","Patrick Gallagher","No. I think what's happening in comp which is interesting is that medical costs are escalating a level faster than the indemnity side. So what you've got is kind of a shift. Severity is remaining about the same. Return to work is really, really critical. But it's all about the medical costs including pharma that is something that everybody's concerned about.","Charles Sebaski","Okay. And then you've made some comments about the discipline from the underwriter side. Just curious, you're take as well. There's been a lot of supposedly disruption with some of the larger carriers, really undergoing some underwriting review in the states. Just curious if this is -- if you would call this disruption at all? If there has been any noticeable shift over this quarter or this year from some of these larger carriers? Or is that more press and us, on my side, talking about than you've actually seen on the ground?","Patrick Gallagher","No, we've seen it on the ground. We've seen it -- I'm not going to mention any specific carriers by name at all. But no, we're seeing disruption. The good news is, there's plenty of market. So where there's disruption we're able to move business. But there are major companies that are undergoing underwriting reviews. They're making the moves that they believe -- again, I give them credit. I think we're looking at domestic U.S. pretty darned disciplined senior management.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question is coming from Quentin McMillan of KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Quentin McMillan","I have a couple of quick numbers related questions. So the $16 million of FX that you have in the back half, just to ask the dumb question I guess, fully offset on the expense side, right? So we should just anticipate that?","Doug Howell","Yes. If you look at the CFO commentary, it says almost no impact on EPS as a result of that.","Quentin McMillan","And then two quick questions on the free cash flow. Doug, thanks. You said the integrations are basically done. Can you quantify that at all in terms of what the benefit will be? Then also, secondly, on the CapEx, obviously you are building the new office space. Can you give us a little bit of an update on maybe what the 2016 CapEx might be? Then what 2017 could be to kind of be better than that?","Doug Howell","Yes, listen, let me just say it this way, I think that first of all, in integration -- for our integration teams out there that are listening, I know you have got a lot of hard work clout, but financially we're -- it's not going to cost us that much between now and the end of the year. So I'd like to say, it's all done. But maybe towards -- maybe on our January call, we'll declare that.","When it comes to CapEx, the spending that we've done on the home office build -- recall that we have an opportunity for a lot of tax credits that come through on that, that will improve future cash flow on it. That's about $125 million to $150 million this year, that we won't have next year. Integration, we spent well over $100 million in 2015. We're running somewhere in that $50 million range right now, half, maybe less than that. So you're going to free up $200 million next year just in those two numbers alone.","So I don't see a lot of big real estate moves. We moved a big piece of our real estate in the UK this year. We won't have those costs. That's probably in that $150 million of building costs, there was $125 million in the U.S. and $25 million in the UK. So I just don't see a lot of those big cash needs coming in 2017. So that's a nice pot of money to have.","Quentin McMillan","You would obviously had on the Investor Day, talking about the $750 million you had for free cash flow for acquisitions to fund everything. Can that $200 million sort of be added onto that pot and that's what we can think about you have available in the coffers?","Doug Howell","I think, you need to think about $750 million again next year, because we just wouldn't borrow quite as much money next year at this point. So that $200 million -- if we have an extra $250 million, $200 million, we'll still be in the $750 million ability to buy companies next year -- funds available to buy companies.","Quentin McMillan","Okay. If I could say just one -- I apologize if this was answered earlier, I missed the beginning of the call. But just on the negative 3% organic growth, you guys said it's going to bounce back to positive. Obviously that's been a very high growth business to you. Is there any quantification in terms of maybe the size of the contract that slipped that potentially could be in the back half? Or is it going to be low single-digit or sort of low to mid, anything that we can get a little more clarity on?","Doug Howell","Actually, what's interesting is the account that we didn't pick up the performance bonus income has actually rehired us for the next five years. Actually, we've picked up a large piece of business that flows through that program. So we didn't lose any account on the risk management, rather we just didn't hit a couple metrics that have clip metrics in it. We didn't get the performance bonus. But we'll be back after it in -- in this next fiscal year that ends in 2017.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing comments.","Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Donna. Yes, I've got a bit of a wrap up. Thank you again for being with us this morning. We appreciate it. Our teams are focused and energized. We will continue to execute on the four components of our value creation, we will grow organically, we will grow through acquiring the best brokers, we will continue to improve our quality and productivity, and we will invest in our culture. I'm very pleased with the first half results of 2016. I remain excited about the remainder of the year and beyond. So thank you all for being with us. We appreciate it.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Gallagher & Company's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. Your lines will be open for questions following the presentation. Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Some of the comments made during this conference call, including answers given in response to questions, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that will be discussed on this call, which are also described in the company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today.","It is now my pleasure to introduce J. Patrick Gallagher, Chairman, President and CEO of Arthur J. Gallagher & Company. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.","Patrick Gallagher","Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning. We appreciate you being on the line. This morning, I am joined by Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions. I couldn't be more pleased with the quarter. It was just a great quarter. Brokerage results were strong again. Adjusted revenue was up 24%, 4% of that organic. Adjusted EBITDAC is up 28% and our margins expanded by 89 basis points. In the risk management segment, we had an outstanding quarter. Revenue is up 13%. Virtually all of that is organic. Adjusted EBITDAC is up 21% and our margins improved by 110 basis points.","So when I combine the operations, the way I like to look at the company, adjusted revenue is up 22%. Adjusted EBITDAC up 27%. All in organic growth, 5.8% and total Company adjusted EPS up 18%. Really, really good work by the team; a great quarter and first half of the year. This, I think, is a testament to our strong sales culture. We work very hard to serve our clients and to aggressively pursue new ones. We've invested heavily in our sales efforts. We brought in sales training for all our people.","We use salesforce.com, we invested in our niche, in product line capabilities. We are very, very good at team selling. I am pleased that our team has adopted our tools and feel we should continue to drive organic results. Mergers and acquisitions continue to be a key strategy. In the quarter, we completed 13 mergers, 11 in the brokerage segment, two in risk management, for approximately $90 million in new revenues. The two risk management acquisitions were international, in New Zealand and the UK.","Our total in the first six months is 24 acquisitions and $120 million in new revenues, and our pipeline remains very robust. Our 2014 larger acquisitions are integrating extremely well. As I do every quarter, I'd like to stop and thank all of our new partners for joining us and to extend a very warm welcome to our growing family.","Let me move to the property casualty rate environment. We did a midyear survey of our PC renewals. We polled our brokers on the rate environment in the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand on our most prominent property and casualty lines. So let me provide you some of that color. On the domestic side, in property, 75% of our property accounts renewed down. But most of those were slightly at single digits. A quarter were flattish to up just a little tiny bit. Frankly, I don't think this is - I don't think it's unreasonable at all, given the fact that we have not had major catastrophes in the last few years.","A little better story in international property, as we are seeing slightly more balanced results with half renewing about flattish to up a little and half down slightly, more flattish overall. Underneath this, Australia\/New Zealand are down the most. UK is in line and Canada is flattish to up the most.","Turning to casualty lines, interestingly, a similar feel across our domestic and international operations. Half up slightly single digits, half down single digits, mostly kind of flattish with some accounts getting greater than 10% discounts. Domestically, commercial auto was more on the upside. Workers comp and professional lines were flattish and general liability and umbrellas were slightly down. Internationally, Australia and New Zealand are seeing by far the most downward pressure, especially in auto, and as I said earlier, UK similar to US. Canada is flat to up a bit. Our employee benefits team is very busy assisting our clients' businesses as they try to manage their benefits and HR needs as a result of increased complexity, higher costs and the war for talent.","Domestically, our customers continue to navigate the impact of the Affordable Care Act. These market dynamics continue to present us with growth opportunities as we work to meet the needs of our clients. In addition, our private-label insurance exchange, the Gallagher Marketplace, is seeing very high interest and a good number of clients have committed to moving to the exchange. As I said earlier, the risk management business, Gallagher Bassett, had a great quarter with topline growth of 13%. Our stated goal at Gallagher Bassett is simply to provide our clients globally with the best claims outcomes. So, a great quarter; we are thrilled to have it in the books, a very good start of the year.","Doug Howell","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. Like Pat said, the second quarter was another terrific quarter for Gallagher. Starting with the first page with the brokerage segment, adjusted EPS of $0.71 is up nicely over prior year. As for foreign currency, you'll see about $0.03 this quarter. Looking forward, we are forecasting $0.02 to $0.03 in the third quarter and about $0.01 or so in the fourth quarter as a result of the strengthening dollar. As for integration, you heard Pat say our integration is moving along as planned.","Looking forward, we are seeing about $0.07 to $0.08 in the third quarter and about the same in the fourth quarter. As for 2016, our integration costs should drop dramatically and I will have better numbers for you when we do our October conference call.","Same with brokerage, but turning to page 3, to the organic revenue table. Let me give you some flavor behind the 4% organic growth. Domestic retail was slightly better. Domestic wholesale was actually a couple points better and international about a point lower. Within that, we saw about 0.25 points net drag from rate and exposure. The only larger deal that was not fully in our organic numbers this quarter was our Canadian businesses which we acquired on July 1, 2014. And their organic looked slightly better than what we posted overall, but wouldn't have moved the average 4%.","As for modeling revenues, currently foreign currency seems to be the biggest modeling challenge. To control for this, and assuming that current exchange rates, first reduce prior year revenues by about $25 million to $30 million in the third quarter and then about $15 million in the fourth quarter. After you do so, apply your PIC for organic growth, and if you do that, if you don't do that, if you don't reduce prior year revenues first, you can't help but overshoot on current year and current quarter revenues.","And finally, when you're making your brokerage segment organic PIC for the third quarter, please remember that last year's third quarter, we disclosed and then discussed in our conference call that we had an unusually large number of larger account wins in the third quarter of 2014. So you might want to moderate a bit your PIC for this coming third quarter to control for that comparable headwind. As for acquired revenues, we have again provided a table on page 16 of the investor supplement, showing our range for rollover revenues for the next two quarters for mergers done in 2014 and in the first half of 2015. You will need to add to that your PIC for newly acquired revenues in the third and fourth quarter, but please remember to weight those in the closing days of those new deals more towards the last month of the quarter.","Moving to page 4, to the brokerage segment adjusted EBITDAC margin table near the bottom of page. You will see that we expanded margins by about 90 basis points. 20 basis points were from the roll in of the larger deals, just in the range that we estimated in our last call, and then 70 basis points came from our organic growth and expense control.","Now looking forward, last year our brokerage segment posted 26.8 points of adjusted margin in the third quarter of 2014. We don't see more than that for the third quarter of 2015 for several reasons. First, we won't get any meaningful further lift from roll in of larger deals because all of them were in our numbers last year in the third quarter. Second, I just mentioned that we had unusual success in net larger account wins last year and those few of margins last year, we are renewing those but it does make it harder to grow over. And third, we believe our compensation costs in the UK will run a bit hotter in the near term as a result of having some senior management turnover that we discussed earlier in the year.","Finally, on the brokerage segment, let me also give you some non-cash estimates for the third and the fourth quarter from the brokerage segment. For depreciation, assume about $15 million of expense per quarter; for amortization about $58 million; and for acquisition earn-out amortization, assume about $5 million. Then, as we do more M&A for every dollar we spend, you will need to increase amortization by about 1% of the purchase price per quarter, and that will get you close.","Let's turn now to the risk management segment on page 5, really a terrific quarter across the board. Of the 13.4% organic growth, domestic was over 10% and international approached 20%. Looking forward, recall that we have that large Australian account that goes into runoff this quarter. So as you model the third and the fourth quarter, the impact of that runoff account will be more pronounced, meaning that you will see organic growth more in this mid-single digits and not in double digits. You should also adjust prior year revenues downward for FX before you apply your organic PIC. Assume FX of about $5 million in the third quarter and $3 million in the fourth, and that will get you close.","As for margins, in the risk management segment, you will see that we blew past our 16.5% margin target. But you will read in footnote 1 to those tables that we had a one time for some additional performance bonus income of about $1.8 million related to that account going into runoff. So if you remove that, that one timer, we would be about 20 basis points above our 16.5% margin target, which is more in line with our expectations. As for risk management non-cash items, model about $6 million of depreciation in the third and the fourth quarter and you will get close.","All right, let's shift to page 6 to the corporate segment. Just a small comment. Really a nice quarter and right in line with the estimates we forecasted last quarter. When you get to page 15 of the investor supplement, you will see that our outlook for the rest of 2015 is very close to what we gave you last quarter.","Finally, some comments on our M&A program. First, we closed 13 mergers this quarter at a weighted average multiple of just over 7 times. So we feel very good about continuing to do a lot of nice tuck-in mergers yet this year. Second, looking out over the remainder of 2015 in terms of M&A funding, based on our current pipeline in mergers, we are seeing cash and debt funding much of it, plus using about 2 million to 3 million shares. This means our forecasted fully diluted weighted shares outstanding for the third quarter will be about approximately 177 million shares.","All right, those are my comments. And like I said to start, another terrific quarter. Back to you, Pat.","Patrick Gallagher","Thank you, Doug. Rob, we are ready for some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Sean Dargan with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.","Sean Dargan","Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Given the Willis Towers Watson tie up, Pat, I was wondering if I could get your thoughts on the future of your use of the liaison platform and the exchanges in general.","Patrick Gallagher","Sure. We have a good - a solid contract with Liaison. The brokerage community is going to be very important them. As you know, Tower spent a good bit of money on that asset. And in order for it to play out, they are going to have to be creating with others outside of the Willis and the Towers Group. We've been assured that that contract is solid. But at the same time, Sean, I would be honest with you, we've got our eye on others as well.","Sean Dargan","Okay, great, thanks. And I'm not sure if I caught this, but in terms of being able to finance further acquisitions, is the at-the-market program over? And is it going to be removed or does it have to be renewed?","There is about $15 million left on the program and at this time we have no plans to renew it.","Sean Dargan","Okay, great, thanks. That's all I had.","Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Sean.","Doug Howell","Thanks, Sean.","Operator","Our next question is from Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets.","Patrick Gallagher","Rob, you got to speak-up, I can't hear you.","Operator","Our next question is from Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets.","Patrick Gallagher","Thank you.","Operator","Please proceed with your question.","Charles Sebaski","Just a couple of follow-ups, on that shares you mentioned for the M&A going forward 177 million, is that 2 million to 3 million shares a quarter for 3Q and 4Q?","Doug Howell","No. Just in the third quarter.","Charles Sebaski","Okay. And then on that, on the overall M&A basis and pipeline, you guys obviously continue to have success in finding companies that want to join Arthur J. Gallagher and seven times multiple seems reasonable. But if I listen to your competitors and people out there talking, it seems that there is a lack of opportunity out there and there is crazy prices being paid in the market. And I would appreciate your thoughts on how you guys are able to continue being successful at seemingly very reasonable multiples, where competition might say pricing is getting too high or irrational or appease murking everything up and just how you see that.","Doug Howell","Well, look, private equity has come strongly into our business. I think it probably now consumes about half the acquisition activity that occurs, which is smart money coming into a great business. I really can't complain about that. And when you do get to sizable platform acquisitions, pricing is up. But if you noticed, that we've done 24 acquisitions for about 120 million of total revenue, and so tuck-in acquisitions are very prevalent. They are not as pricey and we continue to see great success in that regard. I don't see our pipeline diminishing one bit.","Now, we are not also facing - so far this year we haven't had any opportunities like we had last year to do something that was of - substantial in nature, but we have announced that we are going to do the William Gallagher Agency in Boston. We are very excited about that. That is a platform agency. So I think the comments from others are accurate. Private equity and some of the deals drives prices up. You have to decide whether you want to play in that market or walk away.","I think we are very disciplined when it comes to that, and at the same time, I think we offer a terrific platform for people to come aboard, build their business, which in turn builds their income and have a great time building out their company.","Charles Sebaski","Now, about the U.K., you talked about obviously there is management change going on. You talked about it coming into comp expense. Have you seen any bleed-through to the rest of the organization with any other defections of senior brokers or relationship managers or has the head count and the people there in the U.K. stayed as expected?","Patrick Gallagher","Our U.K. team has stayed put. We are very pleased with Graham Shelton, who is our CEO. I think he has done a great job of explaining to the people why they are in a great place. And to answer your question about other senior management and senior leaders around the world, we've had absolutely no further defections.","Charles Sebaski","Excellent. And just finally, one numbers question. In the risk management division, it seemed that the comp expense ratio was particularly low this quarter. I'm wondering if there is something in that or is that kind of where we can expect it. I mean, I have kind of 57.5% versus 59.5% last year and 60% last quarter. Just wondering if I'm looking at that right and how you view that.","Doug Howell","Well, I think the best thing to do is our margin target is 16.5% for the year for it.","Charles Sebaski","Okay.","Doug Howell","The geography between those two lines, we were lower this quarter but I think that might be as much a denominator issue, because I read through here we did have a small true-up of a prior year bonus, might have given us a little bit of earnings. On the other hand, we had some higher professional fees in the operating expenses. So nothing sticks out in that.","Charles Sebaski","Okay.","Doug Howell","That business is trending a little bit lower on the comp side.","Charles Sebaski","Excellent, really appreciate the answers.","Doug Howell","Thanks, Charles.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Hughes with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Hughes","Yeah, thank you. On the talent front, you talked about the war for talent in the context, I think, of the exchanges. But in your own business are you seeing compensation expense? Is there any upward pressure on that? And alternatively, do you see any opportunity to step up recruiting with some of the merger activity that is going on?","Patrick Gallagher","Well, Mark, you know us very well. We are always recruiting, always, always, always looking for new talent to bring into the company. And we bring that talent in, in a whole number of different ways. As I said in my comments, we had 250 kids in our internship this summer, very excited about that. If I could recruit half of them I would be thrilled. If I could do more than half, I would be thrilled.","We are constantly looking at seasoned players in the field that are competitors of ours, trying to get them to consider joining us. And, of course, our acquisition activity brings new blood into the company every month, every quarter.","In terms of seeing upward pressure, not particularly. I think remember, when it comes to our sales-force, we are one of the few larger players that still is very comfortable paying on a formula. So you go out and sell some business, you are going to get a raise. It's not really a big question mark.","Doug Howell","Yeah, I think on the service side of it, Mark, as you know there is competition for talent when it comes to some of the back office skills positions in IT, finance, HR, legal. So there is some - we have been - we were in a recession for eight years, so I think that kept some people staying put before they would look to other jobs. So there was a little upward pressure there.","On the other hand, we do still have our offshore centers of excellence that allows us to mitigate some of those service costs. We are not seeing wage inflation in India in particular. We still have operating improvement opportunities to maybe offset some of that wage inflation. So by and large, that is right about the producer level. They work on a formula, so that takes care of itself. In terms of the service layer, there is a little wage inflation pressure there, but we think that we've got opportunities to mitigate that.","Mark Hughes","And, Pat, I am sorry if you touched on this earlier. But are you going to be at any sort of competitive disadvantage by not having a big consulting operation?","Patrick Gallagher","No. Mark, when we compete in the marketplace, 90% plus of the time - we know this because we've got the systems to measure it now - 90% of the time we compete against smaller competitors. Now, we are very, very good at larger risk management accounts, don't get me wrong.","But when you look at our book of business and peel back the onion, 90% of our revenue comes from the commercial middle market and that is where we are really strong, and we fight the smaller local agent most of the time.","So I don't feel at any kind of disadvantage at all. Besides, I would say our consulting division - our benefits consulting division now is down to less than 35% being health and welfare. The other business is all consulting.","Mark Hughes","Thank you.","Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Glasspiegel with Janney and Janney. Please proceed with your question.","Bob Glasspiegel","Good morning, Gallagher.","Patrick Gallagher","Good morning, Glasspiegel.","Bob Glasspiegel","We will keep this going on the last name basis. This is 20,000 foot question for you, Pat, as a very esteemed observer of the industry. There seems to be an acceleration in consolidation as an important theme in the carriers that you deal with at a pace that you and I haven't seen before. And I think almost every company is questioning, whether they've got the right scale, technology, spend, tax structure to compete in a new world. I'm just curious whether you think this is a blip or a trend that's going to accelerate. Do you prefer to deal or do you see that you're dealing with the bigger companies to a greater extent than the regionals? And to what extent is technology and efficiency really important in you deciding what carriers that you deal with and is that trend going to continue or wheel off?","Patrick Gallagher","Bob, I'm going to break all 52 questions down to a few that I can answer. First and foremost, I do think this is a trend that we are going to see. I think the pressure for cost containment, IT spend, you hit right on those deals. Tax structure is going to foster continued acquisition activity. I also think investment returns are going to push that. So I do see bigger players getting bigger. We trade very well with the larger players. But I would also say that, in many of our branches, those local regional carriers play very, very important roles, very important roles to for instance in Cincinnati, Ohio - very important relationship with Cincinnati.","But, those that are consolidating, I will just take ACE and Chubb, two great companies, two great relationships with Gallagher and we wish them well, and hope that we can help them in terms of building up their company to help our clients. In the end, what our job is, is to pick the right carrier to recommend to our clients and that is influenced by things like efficiency and ability to communicate. But in the end, it's making sure that the cover is right, the price is right and we are replacing this with a carrier we trust will meet their obligations. And that is why, we are trusted advisors.","Bob Glasspiegel","Your top five to ten relationships, has that grown as a percentage of your total book over the last 10 years or not? And do you see that number increasing or staying about the same prospectively?","Patrick Gallagher","It's grown substantially and we see that continuing.","Bob Glasspiegel","Thank you.","Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Bob","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Dan Farrell with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Dan Farrell","Thanks and good morning. Just a question around margin, and Doug, you mentioned the comments on the third quarter and some of the comparison difficulties there. I'm trying to think a little more longer-term. If we look at the operating leverage of 70 bps that you got this quarter off of 3.9% organic, if organic trended at that level, is there any reason to think that you wouldn't be able to get that same kind of operating leverage? Or was there something sort of, unusual in second quarter?","Doug Howell","I think that my standard RAC [ph] comment that we've talked about for about the last 20 quarters is it's very hard to grow margin in our brokerage business when we don't have organic growth above 3%. If we had consistent organic growth in the 4% to 5% range, we would still show some what I would consider to be organic margin expansion. So if we get into that fourth quarter, if we get into the next year and we're posting 4%, 4.5%, something like that, you would see some margin expansion on that.","I will say, however, though, that if you look back over the last four years, and I just went back and I looked at the second quarter of 2011, we're up 4 margin points in the last four years. And we're actually getting to the point in our margin level that margins don't grow on moon - trees don't grow to the moon. So we feel that our margins are good where they are now. There could be some margin expansion.","We have a lot of terrific investment opportunities that we'd like to do to hire more producers, to bring on more talent, to open up more product lines and opportunities. So we feel that - and I'm sensing that we're already well-positioned in terms of the margins compared to the other publicly traded brokers, but our margins are in really, really good shape.","So we like the idea of investing for growth. And - so, I say, yes, it can happen if you're above 3%. But I think that we've got lots of investment opportunities going forward that we intend to make. And so, just a little bit like in our Gallagher Bassett unit, we're up in that 16.5% range and we feel comfortable with that, so...","Dan Farrell","Okay. Thank you very much.","Doug Howell","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Our next question is from Adam Klauber with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Adam Klauber","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Patrick Gallagher","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Klauber","William Gallagher is a great franchise and a good strategic fit, really helps your New England presence.","Patrick Gallagher","Yeah, you're right.","Adam Klauber","What did you guys pay for the deal?","Doug Howell","The price on that is somewhere around $140 million to $150 million.","Adam Klauber","Okay. Thanks. And then, will that decide - will that close in the third quarter?","Doug Howell","Yeah. And actually we're kind of hoping that maybe we'd get the regulatory approval a little sooner than we - but we're still closing out - but we hope to close it in the next week or two.","Adam Klauber","Okay, okay. Thanks. And then, as far as the acquisition charges, so for the first half you said around $0.09 per share and you're right on that $0.18. But then there's also workforce lease termination and acquisition related adjustments that are roughly another $0.11 for the first half. I guess, are those weighed to acquisitions? I guess how are they different than the integration charges?","Doug Howell","Most of those have to do with just as we rationalize our workforce in other places. Most of that relates to that, and a lot of it has to do with leases more than workforce termination.","Adam Klauber","Okay. That makes sense. So then, for the second half, I think you're saying around $0.20 of acquisition integration charges. Will there be also workforce and lease termination or acquisition-related adjustments?","Doug Howell","There could be some, but right now the way our real estate portfolio, we've got 63 leases under renewal process right now that we're working on. I don't see any of them in large platform places like L.A., San Francisco, et cetera. So, I don't see right now big work or lease charges as we move into new locations. So I don't see that number in the next three quarters being nearly as big as it was in the first two.","Adam Klauber","Okay. And then just to reconfirm what you said, so for 2016 we should look for all those charges to be materially lower than they were in 2015, is that correct?","Patrick Gallagher","That's correct.","Adam Klauber","Okay, okay.","Patrick Gallagher","Look, we are a year into our larger deals. I think that if you go around the world, we are in really great shape. The complexity is in the U.K. on really pushing Giles Oval, the old Heath Lambert, the old Arthur Gallagher businesses together over there. And it just takes a long time. I think at one point there was over 200 legal entities there, 40 different systems. That's the place where integration is taking its time, and not just - it's highly regulated. There's a lot of processes you have to go through in order to get them integrated. But they are on plan.","We are not trying to re-create a product or anything. We know the systems, we know the migrates - it's more of a migration plan that it is trying to figure out a solution on it. So we feel like we are on good pace for that and the team is doing a terrific job under the circumstances over there. And but by and large, Australia\/New Zealand, we pulled ourselves out of West Farmers down there. That's pretty well done. We hit our milestones in June. Bollinger was a textbook integration in the Northeast, so we feel that thing is fully into our books and done.","Canada is doing a terrific job. We have six different really kind of interlocked but independent agencies out there and brokers around Canada. But they are coming onto a common Canadian system, so that - the team up there is doing a great job. So all of this is moving along and we really haven't had any hiccups along the way. So I don't have any issues. But 2016 should be pretty much a lined up year for that.","Adam Klauber","Okay, that's helpful. And then as far as clean energy, if I was right, it looks like you bumped up your numbers moderately for the fourth quarter, is that right?","Patrick Gallagher","Yes, a little bit there. I think if you look on page 15 or 16 of the investor supplement, we provide a schedule in there that shows what generated in our outlook of expectation for the next - and as we get closer to the end of the year, we are moving up the bottom end of the range a little bit on that. And that's natural just because remember it's hard to improve the top end of that range because if they are running that optimal capacity at the top end of the range, the lower end of the range is where the sensitivity is, because if you take a plant down you get zero. But you can't double a plant's capacity because that's just not the way it works. So we are very pleased that the bottom end of that range is moving up.","Adam Klauber","Right, right, and that's fair in that it looks like, overall, that clean energy net earnings will be up roughly 10% or even a little bit more for the year, which is a nice improvement. How should we think about 2016? Is there a potential for further improvement in earnings or are we closer to being tapped out within clean energy?","Patrick Gallagher","Yes, I think if you look on that in the press release, we say that there is about eight plants that we are looking for homes on still, and permanent homes. So we are getting good momentum on that. The team that works on that has had some really nice uptick. I would guess that we will see some more momentum on that in September. You kind of get into the summer holiday season here, so I would expect to have some good news on that by the time we get to the third quarter.","Adam Klauber","Okay, great. And size wise, are those plants around the average size of your other plants, larger, smaller?","Patrick Gallagher","I think they're larger.","Adam Klauber","Okay, okay great, thanks a lot.","Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Adam.","Operator","Our next question is from Meyer Shields with KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Meyer Shields","Thanks. Good morning. I came on a little late, I apologize if you covered this. Did FX changes year-over-year have any impact on your margins?","Patrick Gallagher","We controlled for that in our margin computations, but let me flip to that page. I don't think it had a significant impact in the margins, very little, as a matter of fact.","Meyer Shields","And then conceptually when you've got all this consolidation going on, I don't know whether either of these makes sense. You could either have carriers look to squeeze the brokers as an expense management strategy or maybe pay a little bit more to ensure that there isn't a lot of spilled over revenue are either of those relevant factors?","Patrick Gallagher","Not at this point.","Meyer Shields","Okay.","Patrick Gallagher","We haven't seen in the past where a carrier goes through consolidation is interested in disrupting its distribution system.","Doug Howell","Right. I mean, I think we've got terrific - in particular the ACE-Chubb acquisition, which is I think what you are referring to, we've got terrific relationships with both of those incredibly fine companies. And on the combined basis, we will be a very, very large player with the ongoing Chubb. And as I said, the relationship is very strong. Doug is right. You don't do something like that and then piss off your clients.","Meyer Shields","No, I'm wondering actually in part in the other direction, whether there is an unusual benefit likely...","Doug Howell","No, I don't think so.","Meyer Shields","Okay, fair enough. And then lastly, in general, when we model contingents in supplementals, should that sort of correspond to the percentage revenue growth from acquired from acquisitions?","Patrick Gallagher","That just depends, especially once we start doing some of these nice tuck-in acquisitions, their compensation programs can be all over the board. So I don't think you can have a meaningful modeling assumption on that. Overall, you can see over the last 12 or 13 quarters that, by and large, our organic growth in those kind of stays pace with our base commissions and fees. They will get some geography between the two lines for everything, but I would model those as a growth number that is not all that different than our base commissions and fees.","Meyer Shields","Okay, perfect. Thanks so much.","Patrick Gallagher","Thanks Meyer.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Billingsley with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Billingsley","Good morning. I wanted to ask about - this is page 3 of the press release - specifically the organic change in contingent commission being down 10% and specifically what's driving that. I know this may be more of a [indiscernible] the carrier\u2019s sales, but is this loss performance changes here may be where the decline is coming?","Patrick Gallagher","No, listen, I think the geography between contingents and supplementals is something. If you look at the two together, you will see a number there that grows about what the base organic. We did have a contract flip that we thought was going to be a contingent that moved up into a supplemental, just by the nature of it. And again, the lines on those two continue to become blurred. They were much more pronounced on what a supplemental was and what a contingent was when you go back into the 2008, 2009, 2010 era.","But by and large, we are indifferent to whether it is a supplemental or a contingent. And what works what best for the carrier and what works best for us we are happy to do it. There are some black and white lines that we draw in where we classify it, but there is nothing there that I would consider to be noteworthy. It's more semantics then it is anything else.","Ken Billingsley","Okay. So obviously we can't use the numbers may be to infer what's going on, so let me just ask kind of penetrating a little bit of the veil then. Can you talk about maybe performance contingents or are those - how are the carriers doing? And are you getting the full amount on profit contingent? Or are those coming in a little bit lower than expected market conditions?","Patrick Gallagher","It's a bit of a mixed bag, Ken. If you take a look at Cincinnati's numbers this week, they hit the ball out of the park. And so they are a very prominent carrier with us, so they are very - those that are doing well seem to be doing very well in this environment and we are benefiting from that with our contingents. But it is something that you are right to be looking at that line, because they are indeed contingent. And if, in fact, this market softens to any great extent, and those results begin to fall, we will feel pressure on the contingent line.","Ken Billingsley","Great. The other question I had is on M&A and the opportunities. You discussed about the competitive market domestically in North America just in general. But the U.K., Europe and Australia\/New Zealand geographies are you seeing the same competition? Or is that a nice Greenfield for you to still look for growth?","Patrick Gallagher","There is good competition, but it's not as fierce as it is in the United States and it is Greenfield for us. We've got a building pipeline in Australia. New Zealand is a smaller market, but there is a building pipeline there. We've got a very nice pipeline building in Canada and we've got a very nice pipeline that has been built and is continuing to build in the U.K.. So those are a little bit of a Greenfield opportunity for us for sure. But you have to look at our business and really, it's almost hard to get your head around it. According to one consulting firm that we work with, Reagan Consultants, they believe there is 30,000 agents and brokers in America and that is firms, that's not people.","Now Business Insurance put out their Top 100 just a couple weeks ago and to be number 100 in the United States, you did $26 million in total revenue. I mean there are thousands and thousands of these agents that do $2 million, $3 million, $4 million that we offer a terrific home to. These are typically run by the entrepreneurs that built those businesses. If we do our job and we pick the right ones, these are people that want to stay in the business. They love the business, they like to take care of clients and they love to go out and sell.","And with our platform capabilities and ability to team with people, we give them a great place to land. And so I see terrific opportunities going forward. Is there competition? Sure there is. I believe we compete very favorably with the private equity model especially for those that want to fold in, take advantage of the capabilities and aren't necessarily looking for the next flip. It's one thing to join us and go after accounts that you could have never talked to before, even some of those being your good friends, but at the same time knowing that you had a stable platform, you had a stable place.","You can make the sale of the private equities great because they're going to pay you this keep a little equity in, flip it, get a second bite and then flip it again and maybe a second bite there and then flip it again and before you know you don't know where the hell you are.","Ken Billingsley","Very good. Well, thank you for taking my questions.","Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Ken.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Hughes with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Hughes","Yeah, thank you. Doug. I wonder whether you might sharpen up your outlook in the corporate segment, the potential out there you think you mentioned the eight plans assuming you have some reasonable success, what does that mean in terms of EPS in corporate kind of notion as we think about 2016.","Doug Howell","I don't know if I will be able to do the math in my head right here. But I think that we said, if you go back to what our commentary and I am going by memory here, we thought there might be a flattish to a small step up in 2015 and it looks like we might step up may be 10% in clean energy this year overall. Next year, we might have another step up of 15% to 20% based on, I think - based on what we are seeing right now. So, that's - when I look at next year 15% to 20% step up that we have plans in, now all of them will come in at the beginning of the year, that would be something that will come over the year. And so 15% to 20% is probably the right number.","Mark Hughes","And when we think about the EPS impact of that, is that 15% to 20% on the EPS number?","Doug Howell","Well, listen, I think that if you look at clean energy that's on the pace and we got into our guidance and our supplement here clean energy is on pace this year to do somewhere around 100 million to 105 million, something like that. So if you take another 20% on that at the top end of the range, you might pick up another 20 million out of the 170 million shares outstanding, may be you pick up another dime that's how the math works.","Mark Hughes","Yeah, thank you for that. And then secondly, on the - in the risk management, Pat, some commentary on workers' comp claims, frequency and I know you are picking up business and so you have some additional growth, but sort of on an underlying basis, what's your - what you hear lately about worker's comp claims frequency? And then, is there any loss inflation, has that picked up at all?","Patrick Gallagher","First of all, on the claims frequency side worker's comp is the bulk of what we do in the United States. Those claims counts were about 3%, which is good. That is a proxy for the economy. When shifts come back online, claim counts tend to go up. In terms of cost inflation, we see some of that on the liability side, not so much on the workers comp side.","People are taking up our managed care offerings to great degree and that is helping us get people back to work quickly. And that's the key to a comp claim. Key to a comp claim is a getting it reported quickly, interacting with the client, with the claimant very quickly, getting them to the right physicians and the right people and the right nurse, case managers and getting them back to work. That's how you drive the outcome.","Mark Hughes","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Kai Pan","Hi, Pat and Doug. Thanks.","Patrick Gallagher","Hi, Kai.","Kai Pan","Just wanted to follow up one more question with M&A. In terms of organic, just specifically in Canada and New Zealand, Australia, taking U.K. out of there, just on the international side. Is that acting as a little bit of a headwind rate at the moment or kind of where you're at and what do you wanted it be looking like going forward out of those two regions?","Patrick Gallagher","Yeah, good question. I think if you go around the world, Canada is terrific, I mean, just realized that Canada is going to perform at the levels that you're going to see the overall average at, at least that's our indication right now. Australia and New Zealand, it\u2019s tough, kind of, double whammy down there that you've got rates falling off, I would call that a true soft market, not a moderating market down there. And I think that as you know, Australia, New Zealand is a terrific franchises doing well. And Australia is starting to get its legs on it after our acquisition. But there is pressure in both of those economies not only for rate but also from economic activity.","So if I just look at those two together, for the full quarter remember we didn't own them for the full quarter we own them - only own them for the two weeks of the quarter and the measurement systems on organic could be a little different between near home systems and our new system.","So but if you look at that it\u2019s about flap between Australia and New Zealand and in terms of organic growth most of that has to do with rate and exposure not necessarily new business loss winds, if I break them apart you are seeing New Zealand subsidize Australia by maybe three to four points something like that, so that's it. If you look at those two numbers there but Canada is doing terrific.","Doug Howell","Great, great organic growth in Canada and we do specially in the retail side, have organic growth in the U.K.","Kai Pan","Thanks, guys. That's perfect. No further question.","Doug Howell","Thanks, Kai.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. Would you like to make any closing?","Patrick Gallagher","Yeah, Rob please. Thank you. Just one quick wrap-up comments and let everybody get going. You might recall the outset of our call I mentioned that I was pleased with our organic growth all in 5.8% as a very strong result. And let me tell you this is no accident over the past decade, we've invested heavily in our new business and retention strategies.","We brought in sales training, sale management systems as I mentioned this summer we have 250 interns learning about this great business. Our cross selling efforts between our wholesale, property casualty and benefit teams are all time highs. Our international and U.S. teams are working seamlessly on all types of new business. It's safe to say that our aggressive sales culture is alive and well. So thank you all for being with us this morning. We'll talk to you in a quarter."],"2831":["Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Some of the comments made during this conference call, including answers given in response to questions may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that will be discussed on this call and which are also described in the company\u2019s reports filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today.","It is now my pleasure to introduce J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr., Chairman, President, and CEO of Arthur J. Gallagher & Company. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Thank you, Christine. Good morning everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter and year-end earnings conference call. Today, I am joined by the division head\u2019s that run our businesses as well as Doug Howell, Chief Financial Officer.","Before I get into my prepared remarks, I want to thank the sell-side that are listening in today; I think many of you probably seen the December \u201912 and January \u201913 issue of Institutional Investors and in that magazine the sell-side voted Doug Howell The Best CFO in the insurance business and I think that's well deserved.","Today, we are going to talk about the quarter and the year-end. Another record quarter and a record year and I will tell you it feels really, really great. Our team hit on all cylinders throughout all 2012. Our growth came from all operations across all geographies. I couldn\u2019t be proud of the team and our results. We are growing the company for our shareholders, year in and year out, quarter after quarter. We are getting stronger in our capabilities to deliver services to our clients and to attract new business.","In the fourth quarter, we did 21 acquisitions bringing in $76 million of projected revenue. Our legal teams, our HR teams, all the support groups\u2019 seamless efforts to put these people on the books, incredible, incredible work. The fourth quarter was also a testament to our sales culture and the strategy we\u2019re focused on for years.","Everyday, we focus on four things, I\u2019ve mentioned on this call many times. The first is organic growth. Everyone in this company knows that nothing happens until somebody rings the cash register. The second thing we are after is mergers and acquisitions and attracting the best entrepreneurial talent in the marketplace to our growing family. Third is productivity and quality. We are always looking to do a better job for our clients and to improve our margins along the way. And fourth, we work hard everyday at maintaining our unique team oriented Gallagher culture.","Thinking about these four things everyday has served us well and those are the four things we are going to stay focused on as we go into 2013 and beyond. When you look at our Brokerage segment and Risk Management segments together, adjusted revenue was up 14% in the quarter, 15% for all 2012; adjusted EBITDAC was up 17% for the quarter and 20% for the full year and margins expanded in the quarter and for the full year.","All-in-all an excellent quarter, another record year for Gallagher; our production force is winning; we\u2019ve turned on and really providing great results. The fourth quarter is our eight quarter in a row that we have posted positive organic growth. So many of the things that succeeded for us in 2012, we believe will carry over into 2013 and continue to prove successful for us again.","In 2012, we completed 60 acquisitions bringing in annualized projected new revenues of $232 million. We project that $130 million of that will hit our books in 2013. This is again across all divisions, across all geographies and our pipelines still remains strong. These firms added greatly to the niche expertise we talk often about and to our geographic footprint. They brought us a couple of hundred new producers, who now are armed with our capabilities and who we expect will produce significant new business in 2013. Think about it.","We give the production force greater opportunities to grow their book of business and to make more money. Our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett for 2012 had revenue growth of 7%, adjusted EBITDAC was up 11%, organic growth and base domestic and international fees for the quarter was 2.9%, but importantly, the way we handle our clients is recognized. Gallagher Bassett was recognized by business insurance readers as the top TPA for both small and medium sized companies and this is the fifth consecutive year we've been recognized by the readers of business insurance.","Again, the sales culture is strong. New business was excellent throughout 2012, and was especially strong in the fourth quarter. In addition, we continue to have strong business retention. Our account retention across both segments is nicely in the mid-90s. Our sales teams are doing a fantastic job of explaining the value proposition that Gallagher has to offer through the entire insurance spectrum.","Let me move to a number of individual operations and I will start with the Brokerage segment. In property casualty retail, we continue to see rates increasing; it feels as we start 2013 very similar to what we felt in 2012. Most lines are experiencing mid single-digit increases, catastrophe exposed property especially in the Northeast looks like it\u2019s going to be up a little more than that and workers compensation could be a bit higher across the country as well. We are not experiencing a traditional hard market, but rates are moving up consistently across all lines and as I mentioned, workers comp is aligned in many states that\u2019s in distress and we are seeing increases excess of 10% most of the time in that line.","Again, this is not a balance sheet driven correction; these are income statement driven connections, carriers realize they are getting no investment income and loss cost are continuing to rise. With costs inflating, a flat renewal is actually a step backwards for the carrier. The senior managers at the insurance companies we trade most with remain resolute that their team has got to get them increases. We have not seen the discipline abate during the quarter. So by and large, rates are continuing in positive territory.","I want to emphasize that I believe steady increases handled overtime are much better for our clients than a dramatic change; adjusting the low single-digit increases after virtually eight years of rate decreases is much more manageable for clients; nobody wins when rates jump 50% to 100% and insurance is difficult to buy. And also, remember, you have to recognize that rates are now still at levels we saw in 1999 which was before the last really hard market.","As it relates to the economy, I believe that fiscal cliff and lack of clarity around taxes negatively impacted our clients businesses especially in the second half of 2012, but as we come into 2013 and there is more clarity around what\u2019s going to happen in that regard, we believe our clients businesses are showing a little bit of improvement because we are seeing this in some positive audits. If we can see a continuation of positive rates and a little improvement in the economy, we believe we\u2019ve got really good momentum going into 2013.","Let me touch on our International Brokerage; we had a very strong quarter and a very strong 2012. The acquisition year ago of Heath Lambert has given us a great platform to bring a whole new opportunity to our merger and acquisition efforts. Our pipeline continues to be strong. We completed seven acquisitions internationally, four in the UK, one in Australia, one in the Caribbean and we purchased 21.3% of Grupo CP in Mexico which cements what was already an excellent relationship going back well over a decade, with the Casanueva family in Mexico City and it opens up great new opportunities for us in Central and Latin America.","Our Wholesale and MGA business had a strong finish to the year; new business was strong, our hit ratios improved; on submissions, our submission growth was solid. We saw a continued organic growth in the business which we feel really good about. Our business is moving back to the excess and surplus markets and we have a team of professionals that know these markets inside and out. On the MGA side, according to business insurance, we\u2019re the largest firm. We saw an improvement in new business startups which also helped this growth organically.","Let me move to our benefits business and now I want to spend a little time here. The benefits business is in a really, really good position. I think we are positioned to do extremely well on behalf of our clients in what is a real changing environment. Our benefits operation did 33 acquisitions in 2012, and I think this is another example of our efforts to be prepared for the new healthcare law; those efforts really paying off. These new firms will bring in projected annualized revenue of $82 million.","Now, what this is showing me again, and I have mentioned this to many of you, I believe that independent benefits brokers need much stronger consulting expertise in order to deal with the changing environment. I expect pressure to continue to build in that regard because as we get closer to 2014 many of the laws provisions go into effect. ","So during 2012 we also announced the formation of a private exchange in partnership with liaison. We can now help our clients whether they prefer to continue with a defined benefit approach or defined contribution approach. Still too many clients are sitting on the sideline thinking that they are just going to maintain what they've got and deal with the law down the road sometime. ","I had a long conversation with a sizeable client just last evening and I couldn\u2019t get them off the dime as it relates to being prepared for 2014. I think that's going to create a tremendous opportunity for us. In the near-term and long-term we have built the expertise to be able to deal with this changing environment. ","So I'll go back to our total M&A efforts this past year. 60 acquisitions, $232 million of new projected annualized revenue, our pipeline is strong and clearly a key part of our growth strategy is to see to attract strong entrepreneurs in our firm and to give them additional capabilities to grow. ","As I do every quarter, I want to stop and just thank those who joined us. I know you had choices and we are very, very glad you chose us. Welcome to our expanding family and I know you will contribute substantially in 2013 and beyond. ","Let me move now to our risk management segment. Another solid quarter, another great year, we've now completed our wind down of the New Zealand earthquake activity and we've ramped up our operation in South Australia. ","Think about this, in two to three months we hired a 185 people. We got them situated, trained and ready to pay claims in two to three months, unbelievable work by the team. Our international operations contributed greatly in 2012 and they will even do a greater amount of contribution in 2013 especially with the addition of South Australia. ","We've invested over the past year a new IT tools that we refer to as the analytical work bench. It is continue to be well received by our clients and we are continuing to invest in client based products and services which should keep us in a really strong position both for renewals and for developing new business. ","And even with ongoing investments in our service offering, we maintained our target margins of 16%. I continue to be very excited about the power the company is building to help our clients in this really risky world. ","Our culture as I mentioned before is strong and I can't emphasize this enough. We are client focused, team oriented, upbeat and winning. All of us are involved in selling and servicing our clients and we firmly believe as an enterprise we are just getting started. ","Over to you Doug.","Doug Howell","Thanks Pat and good morning everyone. Let's jump in and start on the second page of the earnings release with the brokerage segment. The first item you are used to seeing is the Heath Lambert integration cost. The (inaudible) size and we are on track to wrap up the integration in mid 2013. ","So you will see just a couple of pennies of integration costs in the first and second quarter and then about $0.03 in the third quarter. The third quarter actually reflects the cost to consolidate almost all of our London operations into new space near Lloyd\u2019s which will be the capstone on nearly two years of hard work by the team to put these organizations together. ","The next item is a $0.05 charge relating to contracting our middle and back office. We took these actions at a time of strength because it was the proactive step to realize savings from our process improvement initiatives, increased utilization of our operational service centers and our investments in improving technologies. It\u2019s also a prudent step to offset the impact of medical cost inflation to reduce the financial impact of our frozen pension plan and most importantly, allow us to continue to recognize and reward the broader work force.","And the third item in the brokerage segment is we resolved some tax items in the fourth quarter that cost us a couple cents. Recall that we resolved some tax items in the second quarter that generated $0.02 of earnings. So while it creates some noise between quarters, for the year they offset and have no impact on our annual numbers.","Moving slightly down to risk management, I\u2019ve already hit on the severance cost item and the next item is the ramp up efforts to onboard our new clients in Australia that Pat discussed and as a reminder, that client should generate about $20 million of annual revenues here in 2013.","Let\u2019s move on to page three. The brokerage segment had a terrific organic growth quarter, up 5.2%. That\u2019s excellent work by our production folks especially given they were also up nearly 5% in the fourth quarter of 2011. ","Looking across our units, each of them posted excellent growth. We saw about 5% organic in our domestic P&C operations, a touch over 5% in our domestic benefits units and a little over 6% internationally, so strong work across the table.","Turning next to the top of page four to the brokerage segment margin table. We're really pleased to continue to pose margin expansion here in the fourth quarter. Looking on an annual basis, for margins to be up 70 basis points on 4% organic growth is really, really good work by the team and more importantly, because we took the proactive steps to offset work force related benefit and compensation inflation, we're well positioned to control our compensation cost coming into 2013.","Next, while we don\u2019t normally spend time in these calls on the non-EBITDAC items, let me pause for a second and give you some thoughts related to modeling depreciation, amortization and change in acquisition earn outs in 2013. ","For depreciation, assume about $8 million of expense per quarter, for amortization assume about $27 million of expense per quarter plus you will need to make a [gap] for amortization from new M&A activity that arises in 2013. ","And finally, for change in acquisition earn outs assume about $3 million of expense per quarter and that will cover the amortization of the discounted earn out payables. Also as my annual reminder, please use our investor supplement that we post on the website to build your models. ","The adjusted pages removed is difficult to compare items which is helpful when you search your baselines, it also highlights how seasonally small we are in the first quarter which like I said last year has become even more pronounced because Heath Lambert is also seasonally smallest in the first quarter.","Okay, move down on page four to the risk management organic table. The temporary revenues related to the New Zealand earthquake claims are all but gone and without those we posted nearly 3% organic. This is down a bit from previous quarter and we believe that as an anomaly for two reasons. ","First, we eased back a bit on new business in Australia as a team ramped up for the new $20 million account and we did lose a decent account which unfortunately happens from time-to-time in a competitive business but we believe that\u2019s an anomaly. ","That said, looking to post 5.7% organic for the full-year is really good work in an economy that isn\u2019t seen much employment growth. As we look towards 2013, we have seen an organic growth environment similar to what we saw in 2012 plus we'll add about $5 million per quarter of revenues from our new Australian client.","Moving to the middle of page five, the risk management margins. We call last year at this time, the team set out to push its adjusted EBITDAC margins up about 50 basis points to 16% and also cover about a 4 margin point of cost to development some exciting client centric tools and resources, and you can see that they delivered. It was great work by the team.","This investing will continue in 2013, with productivity gains, we are still targeting 16 points of margin. All right, let's move to the bottom of page five to the shortcut table for our corporate segment. ","For the fourth quarter, we posted a loss of $0.05 which was right in line with our $0.04 to $0.07 loss that we forecasted in our third quarter call.","For the year, we came in at $0.03 versus a loss of $0.26 in 2011; virtually all of that improvement came from clean energy investment earnings. As for 2013, rather than rattling through a lot of numbers on this call, we have expanded page 14 of our investment supplement on the website to include our current best guess range for each of this corporate segment line items.","The punch line from that schedule is that the corporate segment should post between $0.17 and $0.34 of earnings in 2013 plus $0.03 of loss here in \u201812. Page 14 also shows quarterly ranges because is pronounced seasonality in our clean energy investment earnings, so please use that page when building your quarterly models.","As a last part in clean energy investments, it\u2019s important to remember that it was only 13 months ago that the team built in placing this service 15 new plants. Now when you read page six of the earnings release, you will see that we are only left with the few uncommitted plans.","Then when you look at page 14 of the supplement, you will see that we could make between $75 million and $90 million in 2013 from these investments, and that we continue to have success in ramping up the other plans that could bode well for even better earnings in 2014. The important takeaway on all this is that these investments could generate substantial cash flows which we would use to continue to fund our M&A program. That leads me to my wrap up commentary on capital management and funding our M&A growth. ","In our last earnings call I said we had not used much stock to do M&A in the fourth quarter and we did not. As we look towards 2013, we intend to again favor cash and more debt to fund our M&A activity and avoid using stock. We currently have about $160 million of cash in the bank and we are also working on another $200 million of 10 year notes. All that said, if M&A activity exceeds last year and realize from time to time we must use stock and tax for exchanges then we might need to use some shares. But we are currently favoring cash and debt. So those are my comments. It\u2019s been a really exciting year, but its time to put 2012 on the shelf and focus on delivering some excellent results here again in 2013.","Okay back to you Pat.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Thank you Doug and Christine we are ready for questions, hopefully some answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from the line of Mike Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Mike Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","I have one question on the charge, just trying to understand kind of what came first, was it the expectation that you would have that kind of $35 million expense or was it the expectation that you would incur these work force savings. Just trying to understand, have a thought process around the determination of that number, thanks.","Doug Howell","Good, just to clarify, we take $12 million of severance in related costs of charges and we expect to save about $35 million of which much of that will be offset by what we refer to as just work force inflation. Those were planned reductions based on our work in August and September to look at our staffing levels in light of the ramp up of our offshore centers of excellence and looking at our technologies and looking at our productivity gains. So it was a necessary step in order to harvest the savings that we expect as a result of the investments and just getting better at what we do everyday.","Mike Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","I mean but if we were to peel that out, just peel that piece out for a second, the second part which is the increased medical costs, reduced discount rate on the pension plan, salary increases, performance based compensation, long term incentive, did you know, is that new or was that the result of the study or was that something that you kind of expected that you would be incurring anyway down the road.","Doug Howell","Those costs are always in place. Medical cost is going up. I think the decline in pension yields has been there and we've known about that and giving raises to and incentive comp to our broader work force, it\u2019s something that is in our numbers every year. So this is something we just took, we saw it, but there was no surprise there at all.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Arash Soleimani with Stifel Nicolaus.","Arash Soleimani - Stifel Nicolaus","","I just wanted to clarify on Doug\u2019s comment on the M&A financing. Would it be fair to assume that it would be roughly 75% cash and then 25% stock,  is that kind of a fair breakdown?","Doug Howell","No, we intend to use 100% cash and debt to fund our M&A program unless for some reason in the structure of a deal, we need to use stock in order for tax to be at tax rate exchange, and if we have a merger partner that has a strong, strong desire to hold stock, we would consider give it in the stock in that transaction. But by and large, we are going to favor cash and debt.","Arash Soleimani \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","That\u2019s should continue in to 2014 also that logic?","Doug Howell","Yes, it should. But again if our acquisition appetite grows, we would have to use stock in the deal. We're trying to keep our debt somewhere south of two times debt-to-EBITDA. So at some point, if we really have a strong M&A pipeline, we would be back to using stock towards the end of the year.","Arash Soleimani \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","My other question, in terms of monetizing (inaudible) is there any update in terms of timing of that or?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","We had talked about that last year, trying to be ready by the end of \u201812 on that. We think its port more of a mid-2013 exercise at this point.","Arash Soleimani \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Okay, and then lastly, in terms of the health exchange, I know you have the partnership with Liaison. Are you guys also looking to form other partnerships with other exchange platforms or do you think that\u2019s going to be the primary partner over the next 12 to 24 months?","","Doug Howell","We are entertaining partnerships with other providers as well.","","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Gregory Locraft with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.","","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley","Just wanted to pursue - the core operations look great, just on the coal side a very helpful chart in the supplement where you give forward guidance. Can you just go backwards though and talk a bit about what the guidance was versus what the actual came in at for clean energy and why the differences?","","Doug Howell","Fourth quarter guidance we guided $0.04 to $0.07 of loss for a corporate segment. The clean energy production in the fourth quarter wasn\u2019t quite as high as I had probably guided generally due to warmer weather in a couple of locations where we have plants. So compared to the fourth quarter we are little short on that but still not too bad.","","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley","Okay, so what you really want us Doug to do is to focus on the corporate segment guidance all in, not in the component parts as much, because obviously we keep cutting finally the numbers and there is going to be puts and takes. What I am trying to understand is just 75 to 91 on clean energy, how baked in the cake is that? What\u2019s the difference between 75, what\u2019s the difference between 91?","","Doug Howell","I understand your question, we are highly dependent on the activities of the utility to dictate how much they actually burden of refined fuel or clean coal. So we sit down and we go through each of our utility partners and we get their best guess with respect to production for the next year, and we do suffer from weather issues, from plant maintenance issues. So I would say that our $70 million to $90 million is our best guess at this point, based on what we know now, and so I think it\u2019s a range that we feel reasonably comfortable with.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley","Okay, and then any of this contracts that you talk about in the release spread could come through mid-year, is that all upside?","Doug Howell","We are taking our best guess with respect to ramp up of all the plans that we disclose in page 6, but it does not include any of our best guess for the plans that have not been put into the construction phase at this point.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley","Okay, perfect great. And then jumping into the M&A side just an awesome year, as you mentioned, it seems like people are choosing you with the destination. So I guess what I am trying to do is just model it, and I think you have been very upfront in saying take off free cash flow, do we then add an additional amount due to the clean energy funding so say $75 million bucks on top of free cash and then that becomes affectively the budget for M&A in 2013 and forward?","Doug Howell","Yes.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley","Perfect, okay, any incremental debt you would add, because you just mentioned less then two times and you could squeeze some in there.","Doug Howell","In my comments I said we are right now looking at adding $200 million.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley","Okay, I missed that.","Doug Howell","So we got a $160 million in the balance sheet, we got free cash flows that will develop this year plus $200 million of debt, so we have a lot of money to spend on acquisition this year.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley","Great, and then what's the rough revenue range at which you buy these things at, or how should we think about backing into, what if it can get in the market?","Doug Howell","Our multiples of EBITDA have been between 6 and 8 times historically.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley","Okay, perfect.","Doug Howell","We don't buy on revenue, we buy on EBITDA.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley","Yeah, of course, okay. Okay, that's great. And then the last one from me is the organic is sort of above that 3% threshold, where I think you guys have said at least in the past I think you got margin expansion above that level. So it seems like we should continue to, you know, we are running at a good clip there and no break in trends, so should we just expect kind of what we've been seeing going forward on the brokerage side?","Doug Howell","Well, we feel like the environment this year is a lot like last year at this time. When it comes to margin I've always said that if you expand, don't expect much margin expansion greater than, unless we have organic greater than 3% on the brokerage side and 5% on the risk management, but what the proactive steps we've taken to control our compensation and benefit, the natural inflation in that we feel good about our prospects for holding and then expanding margin in 2013.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley","Okay, great. I'll squeeze one last one just for Pat then, just your view on the cycle, you mentioned quite bullish comments on pricing and where it\u2019s heading. Do you see an acceleration in the rate of change or do you think we are more in a unique world where we\u2019re in call it 5% to 10% depending on the line for the next few years","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","I think we are in a unique situation. This is my fourth cycle and it\u2019s completely different than anything I have ever seen before. I do think it\u2019s in that 5% to 8% continual pressure to push rates up.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley","Okay, multi-year?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Well, we are going into the third one right now.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Sarah DeWitt of Barclays. Pleas state your question.","Sarah DeWitt - Barclays","","I was wondering if you could elaborate on what drove the acceleration in brokerage organic growth versus the third quarter and maybe if you could break that down between what you are seeing in terms of rate versus exposure versus new to lost business that would be really helpful?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","I'll give you a general comment and let Doug comment on the break out if he can. But, we just had a great fourth quarter in new business and retention. I mean frankly coming into the fourth quarter and December in particular you know what your pipeline looks like and you don't know what your orders are going to look like. It\u2019s an aggravating quarter and an aggravating month for me to be perfectly honest, because you can get hurt by one big loss, you can really be helped by various operations doing well and this is just as time we are in the fourth quarter and in December in particular across every geography, so our international operations had an incredible quarter, our MGAs and wholesalers strong organic growth, I already commented on our benefits operation and our straight PC retail folks knocked it out of the park in the quarter and it really comes down to incrementally keeping a better rate of retention and adding more new business. And in Doug\u2019s comments this is the thing that I'm really proud of, it was a tough quarter to compare. Last year, if you recall in the fourth quarter, we also did 5% organic and didn't see that level of organic growth again for the three next quarters and to have a big quarter last year and then to do it again this year is just solid work by the team.","Doug Howell","Yeah, I think that Pat hit it; I mean basically we didn't get a lot of lift this quarter from economy and we didn't get a lot of lift from rate, it was just a little better new business and a little less loss business. So that's what we are seeing.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","The rate increases that we talked about by the way, I should comment on this, the rate increases that we are talking about by a comp by comp, we are working very hard to offset those for our clients. So we are seeing about 1% impact on our revenues from rate, so don't be thinking that just because the carriers are getting an 8% rate increase that necessarily our clients are paying that, they will take higher deductibles, they will move to self insurance; if it's really in a situation where they are squeezed economically, they will reduce coverage and overall impact in our numbers is just 1% from rate.","Sarah DeWitt - Barclays","Great, that\u2019s helpful. And then on risk management business, can you just talk about where you are seeing in terms of clean trends there and based on your comment, is it right to think about the right run rate for organic growth around the 6% range in that business?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Well, we thought the lower run rate for organic in the fourth quarter was an anomaly, and frankly, we did have some impact there, negative impact from a bit of a slower economy. So yes, I would think that our more normalized run rate would be something along the lines of 5% to 6%.","Sarah DeWitt - Barclays","Okay. And finally if I could just squeeze one more in, on the Australia business; is that business running around the 16% margin as well or something different?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Yeah, about 16.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Mark Hughes of SunTrust. Please state your question.","Mark Hughes - SunTrust","Pat, did you say how the workers comp claims were looking within risk management?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Did I say how they are looking?","Mark Hughes - SunTrust","Yeah.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","We didn\u2019t mentioned it, but I can tell you we're not seeing claim count growth, because we're not seeing employment growth and what we are seeing is the same thing that the insurance carriers are finding is that we're seeing medical inflation within the comp line to a point where the medical costs are growing much faster than the indemnity costs.","Mark Hughes - SunTrust","Right. How about the, you had mentioned, I think the new business startups were looking better. Could you elaborate on that a little bit?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Yeah, especially in our MGA book business market, that\u2019s very sensitive to that. So when the economy tanked in \u201809 and \u201810 and really for that business to do well we need bars and taverns and tattoo parlors and people like that to start businesses and when they do, they end up in the excess and surplus market and then specialty programs and so we are seeing -- we have over the last really three quarters seen some improvement in business startup which is helping us in our MGAs.","","Mark Hughes - SunTrust","Yeah, and the final question just touching on the margin issue again, Doug kind of the 5% organic but 40 basis points margin in brokerage. Should we expect a bit more than that if you are able to hold it kind of organic growth or is that an appropriate number?","","Doug Howell","No, I think there is behind the 40 basis points expansion of margin this quarter there is a couple of subtleties that I think you should think about. First is, margins would have expanded probably another 20 basis points, but our 2012 tranche acquisition of M&A partners happened to be seasonally smaller in the fourth quarter just like Heath Lambert is smaller in the first quarter, this tranche of acquisitions tends to have smaller margins in the fourth quarter.","We also spent about another 25 basis points on more travel this quarter; half of that was related to the M&A activity, so may be 12 basis points of expansion; about six basis points were related to our efforts to harvest the productivity improvements that we have talked about that led to our workforce contraction and then may be another six basis points related just more to organic travel to get out there and see our clients and pick up new business.","So I am not saying that those are one-timers, but they did have an impact on margin expansion in the quarter that would not have the seasonality and maybe just little less M&A activity, probably would have expanded another 20 to 40 basis points.","Mark Hughes - SunTrust","I know you can count on that level of detail from the award winning CFO.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","There you go Mark.","Mark Hughes - SunTrust","Again, I\u2019ll intrude by asking one more, how do those things look when we look at 1Q, the seasonality, the travel, productivity issues etcetera, are they is the impact similar kind of the slightly diluted in 1Q, or should it be more positive in 1Q?","Doug Howell","I think that the organic travel for new business and for our new business and our existing clients will be there in the first quarter, but that is only six basis points of costs. I think there is always a natural slowdown in M&A activity in the first quarter; there is, generally if you look at M&A activities and you do 60 deals, you know the first quarter people are kind of just catching their breath and then they target to get stuff down before the end of the year. So we always say we do a year worth of acquisitions in nine months, so that should be not be there the next quarter.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Adam Klauber of William Blair. Please state your question.","Adam Klauber - William Blair","Contingents on supplementals were up pretty good in 2012, how much of that is maybe having new carriers come into program or how much of that is just normal growth and what do you expect for 2013?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","I\u2019ll touch on where it\u2019s coming from and let Doug touch on what is sort of forecasting for next year. This is more about having new partners through the merger and acquisition process than it is new carriers coming in. Most of our supplementals and contingents are coming from the same partners that we worked with in building those programs over the last four or five years and its building more volume with the carriers that support us essentially with those revenues. ","Doug Howell","Yeah, to contributing to that Adam is that we spent a lot of time on carrier analysis and compensation analysis and that's starting to pay some benefits there. As we look into 2013 frankly, the teams are hard at working with the carriers right now to come up with fair supplemental and contingent commission agreement. So I really won't have a big deal of that until the April call. ","Overall, if you model that equal to what we did this year, you wouldn't be too terribly far off and then also we are starting to see a few carriers start talking about moving back from supplemental into contingents. That would create a timing issue perhaps that we normally accrued during the year but we might get it next March. So, I will give you more guidance on that in April on our call.","Adam Klauber - William Blair","","In the benefit business, there's been pressure on commissions for smaller businesses, 50 lives in west even 100 lives in west; is there any movement by the health insurers to push that up past that 100 to 50 lives?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","You know Adam for us its really, that's kind of a non-event to be honest. We don't do an awful lot of business in the under 100 life case area. What we do is primarily above that level and when you get over a 100 lives whether even if the client chooses to pay it by commission, it\u2019s a disclosed, negotiated discussed fee and so it comes through our books as commission but its really what the client agrees and we have for a decade now made it very clear to clients that in essence under risk for 20 plus years we've been transparent with our clients. If we have a certain level of cost, we need to cover that to do the work for the client. We are very transparent about that, we are very open and so the pressure on insurance companies to reduce commissions is not really impacting our benefits book-of-business at all.","Adam Klauber - William Blair","","Can you give some idea what was organic in the benefits business this year in 2012?","Doug Howell","It is almost the same as what it was for the whole company.","Adam Klauber - William Blair","","Okay, so pretty solid year and also in that same vein, how is organic in the London operations and Heath?","Doug Howell","It\u2019s good. I think that I'm actually pretty pleased with that. The revenue retention there, I think that we are culling out some of that book-of-business as we look at it to say if we can't make money we will put it out. They are doing a good job of holding in there and we picked up some nice accounts over there too. I think that\u2026","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","We picked up some very nice risk management accounts with their risk management team and the team that we had in London before the acquisition. We've done an excellent job of holding on to books of business in both the affinity which is small business programs that we have as well as middle market and in the branches around the UK. ","And as I said, we bolted on [four] acquisitions that we never would have been able to do if we hadn't done the deal so all in all organic growth is strong there and M&A growth is strong there and the team has done a really good job of integrating that business. ","Just as an example how difficult that is, you can imagine Heath Lambert\u2019s benefits programs were substantially different than our Arthur J. Gallagher\u2019s benefits programs. Harmonizing those is really, really difficult and our team did a fantastic job of working through that so that we are all now one company, one set of benefits across the entire platform. That's just one example of the work that had to be done.","Adam Klauber - William Blair","","Great and one last question what was the end of period shares if you haven't said that?","Doug Howell","Let's see, let me pull it out here its 425,600,000.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Brian Durubio of Yield Capital. Please state your question.","Brian Durubio - Yield Capital","Pat, a question for you, maybe, if Scott since there maybe he can answer it. If I heard you correctly a few moments ago, you said, you didn\u2019t see much in terms of claim count growth in Gallagher Bassett. Is that correct?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Organic claim count growth. Yes.","Brian Durubio - Yield Capital","So how should we think about employment growth, the [ADP] numbers were pretty good this morning. How that translates in to potential claim account growth? Is there any correlation that we can look to?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","It is very correlated. Gallagher Bassett is incredibly sensitive to the economy. When you are working three shifts and you take that down to one shift, you are going to lose two-thirds of your claim count. [Scott], go ahead. ","Unidentified Company Representative","Yeah, we look at two things. I mean there is the overall claim count growth which is influenced by the new business that we bring on and then we also breakout kind of existing claim count growth and that\u2019s the part that we kind of correlate to the economy specifically and that part of it is, we are talking about 5% to 6% claim count growth overall. The part that it is influenced by the economic growth that existing clients are about 1% to 2%, it is still relatively low and so until we see an uptick in the economic activity that part of it won't go much above that.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","I would also comment, Brian. We're not seeing FTE hires in our benefits book either. Our clients are not hiring people. Their businesses are getting a little better but they are not stepping up and hiring people.","Brian Durubio - Yield Capital","Okay, next question then, it's probably (inaudible) by Pat, yourself and Doug. So, inflation, there are signs of inflations moving up higher, you are seeing it in the yields of 10-year treasuries most notably. So I guess the two part question Pat for you how do you see that affecting pricing in the business in general and for you Doug I know you talked about raising $200 million in debt this year, but with your six and a quarter percent notes do in about [80 months] from now, would it make more sense for you to lever up a little bit more so you are locking them a lower rate for a longer period of time for when that bond matures in 80 months?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","","Let me take the first half of your question Brad and then Doug can talk about the capital management secondly. I am really impressed within this cycle and I think this is both information situation as well as just strong management. ","Senior management at the insurance companies know where they are making money, they know by line, by city, by country, by state they really have information at their finger tips. As I have said before, this is one of the first times in my career where what I am hearing from the senior executives at insurance companies is actually happening exactly as they are saying it on the street. ","There is usually a bit of a disconnect as you are getting towards the end of a cycle and they know exactly what\u2019s happening to their cost structure and if costs are inflating which (inaudible) is in fact inflating and medical is in fact inflating, they recognize loss cost are going up and they know exactly what percent that is and what the impact will be on the next year and they are going to try to cover that loss cost with rate increases and it\u2019s actually quite impressive, they are doing a very, very good job. ","And I think our people are getting better and better at explaining that to clients because when it first came about three, four quarters ago may be six quarters ago frankly, all the people we had hired for eight years all they had ever done is sell cheaper insurance with broader terms and all of a sudden they are explaining to clients that carriers have no return and they are having to become more sophisticated in how they explain how insurance works to clients and its been quite impressive and I do think that as long as yields remained suppressed, you are going to see carriers that fight hard to try to cover their cost of capital.","Doug Howell","Yeah, in terms of debt Brian, I think that, let keep those $200 million put to bad and then what we need to look at little bit of longer term, it doesn't paid right now to do that at this point, but if we have a little bit of trough in rates still for the rest of the year, we would look at doing something with our 2017 tranche.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel of Janney Montgomery Scott. Please take your question.","Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott","Pat, in light of your expense cuts, are you changing the dynamics of the 3% organic been the breakeven of margin hurdle?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Bob, great question and yes, you should look at that, it's in the past I have said that it takes 3% to cover the natural inflation that goes on inside of our book, if we believe we cut that natural inflation by this reduction enforce then it would stand to reason that we probably could have margin expansion at less than 3%, so you are providing the linkage there.","Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott","I have next seen recovery from restructuring charges so dynamic 200% plus ROI how does that phase in?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","It\u2019s immediate.","Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott","So its $35 million, I mean, I didn't know that was annual cost or cumulative cost recovery?","Doug Howell","No that's our one time severance cost we expect to harvest $35 million of savings.","Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott","$35 million accumulative or $35 million a year, I guess that's what I was\u2026","Doug Howell","Per year.","Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott","$35 million per year.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Which will offset additional costs Bob, don\u2019t drop that in the EBITDA.","Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott","No I wasn\u2019t, but I just wanted to make sure I understood your recovery. So that's evenly in the first quarter, your run rate is down by 8.5 million a quarter and you are going to spend some of that on inflation.","Doug Howell","Correct.","Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott","Okay. On the, it sounded like Pat for (inaudible) port cycle that we've had together, you are more bullish for this cycle than I have heard you on the environment, is that a correct read or\u2026","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Yeah Bob if I can get mid single digit increases in rate and if our clients businesses can recover to even a 2% economic growth, with our new business machine we will show very solid organic growth which is what showed up in the fourth quarter and if you give me 5% to 8% organic growth and I'm not predicting 8% right now, but if you see a real change in the economy and rates stay affirming you can show some real growth at the profit line.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Ray Iardella with Macquarie.","Ray Iardella - Macquarie","Just a couple of numbers question because I guess a lot of the topics have been covered already, but maybe Doug can you talk about the tax rate on the core business, I know we spent some time talking about the clean energy initiatives, but it seems like you guys maybe are expecting a lower tax rate going forward.","Doug Howell","Yeah, good question Ray if you read in our press release and income tax section we have moved historically we would say 39% to 41%, we are kind of south of that now. That has to do with the mix of our international business. As we grow internationally the tax rates in those jurisdictions are less than what we have here and so that does have a tendency to bring down the rate.","Ray Iardella - Macquarie","And then I know you mentioned the one large client on the risk management side, margins around 16%, but any other sort of drag you guys expect in the first quarter from bringing some of those hires online.","Doug Howell","No I think actually we should hit the ground running with respect to our South Australia clients, so I don't expect it to drag.","Ray Iardella - Macquarie","And then international versus domestic cash do you have that.","Doug Howell","Yeah, we have about 40 million free in the US and about 120 million internationally. So when I gave the 160 million in free cash, its about 40 in the US and a 120 internationally.","Ray Iardella - Macquarie","Okay and then I think I missed the number at the very beginning Pat in your prepared remarks, where you talked about you know $232 million of acquisitions that you guys did in 2012 but what was the expectation for 2013 for those acquisitions.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","A $130 million. ","Doug Howell","The roll over rate. ","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","That\u2019s the roll over. ","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Joshua Shanker of Deutsche Bank.","Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Doug can we talk a little bit about ace of plants coming online throughout 2013 comparing the early part of the year to the late part of the year.","Doug Howell","Just say your question again. You beeped out on the first part of the question.","Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Sorry ace of expectations for the pace of plants coming online.","Doug Howell","The pace that we have in here is, if you add up the ultimate numbers on page six, you get a number higher than what we have on page 14 of the investor supplement. So what that would imply is that the pace is probably a three months set back. So if you think about the pace of these plant coming on, not going to each one of them, but we have two that we think is going to be in mid-2013 and then the ones that were currently like we have been selected as the finalist, those would come up in the fourth quarter if that works. So I think the pace on six rather than going through each one is our best guess, but we\u2019ve given our selves a few months cushion age of those pieces.","Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Okay, and Pat, you said a word that I talked about a lot, but I don\u2019t hear a lot. Self insurance as at protection for your clients to avoid paying higher rates. Towards that can you see now and forecasting if we are in this continues rate environment that self insurance becomes a larger part of the pie.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Every single cycle, every single cycle it does and in particular, the workers compensation line. Workers compensation is running very high. Combined loss expense ratio for the industry as a whole, something on probably north of probably north of 115%. That\u2019s going to create a natural push from the carriers to increase workers comp premiums and those will be offset by people who will join pools, find together to create ways to self insure. It will take individual clients that will form captives or group captives and you will also see just individual clients that are on the cusp, taking more risk themselves, working harder at loss prevention and trying to not pay the premium but pay the losses themselves. This is our wheelhouse. This is what built our company. We got in to this in the 60s and in every single cycle, this is what expand for us greatly and that really benefits Gallagher Bassett as well as the brokerage side. Now remember part of that is a little bit self defeating on the brokerage side, because if we are writing an account with a very high commission that then take self insurance and takes a huge retention, our commission has actually come down. The fees on the Gallagher Bassett side our new fees that we didn\u2019t have, but those are little bit lower in terms of margin. Nonetheless it\u2019s the right thing to do for our clients and we are really, really good at it.","","Operator","Our last question is coming from Brett Huff of Stevens. Please state your question.","","Brett Huff - Stevens","Two questions Pat you said all in you guys end up sort of squeezing the rate down to 1% on brokerage, should I just to do the math and that implies a 4% in terms of unit growth?","","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Yes.","","Brett Huff - Stevens","Okay. And the second one and you mentioned Doug a little bit on this in terms of the acquired revenue seasonality and in terms of a little bit lower margin and I don\u2019t know if Doug or Pat is best one for this, but more generally in the just really big push you guys have done on M&A, have those new businesses you acquired come in at a lower margin and if so what is your expectation for expanding that margin to get back to a higher level or your average level or whatever can you sort of give us a sense of that?","","Doug Howell","I think of the portfolio of acquisitions if you look overtime, they come in not that dissimilar to us. So I wouldn\u2019t say that the fuel margin or depressed margin, you can get some quarterly anomalies like we talked about here, but by and large they look a lot like us and that\u2019s an important strategy of our M&A strategy. When it comes to most of these deals, we want to buy successful, growing entrepreneurs that know how to run a business to make money for themselves and because we want them to make money for us together as a combined organization, we try not to ever buy small deal that\u2019s a turnaround, we try not to buy retirements, we want to buy people, we want to continue to produce for us, and that they have shown that they can make for their family. If they don't make money for their family, they are never going to make money for us when they come in. So buy and large these are successful entrepreneurs that run margins that are on par with ours.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","In some instance it is better than ours.","Brett Huff - Stevens","Right, and there is nothing about this, the truant, the big truant that you guys acquired this year that's better or worse than that sort of historical view?","Doug Howell","No, the truants that I am talking about, they just were seasonally smaller in the fourth quarter, full year they are on par with us.","Brett Huff - Stevens","Okay, that's what I needed, thanks again.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Christine is that it for questions.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Great, let me just make a brief wrap up comment then. Again thank you all of you for being on the call this morning, we appreciate it.

Patrick Gallagher, Chairman, President and CEO of Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thank you, Devin. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions.","Before I get into our results, I want to acknowledge the devastation caused by hurricanes Florence and Michael. Our professionals now have the important task of helping our clients sort through their claims, get losses paid, and ultimately put their lives back together. And many of our own employees must do the same for themselves. I'm really honored to be part of the insurance industry, an industry which plays the lead role in repairing property, but more importantly restoring lives.","Okay. Onto comments regarding our third quarter. Doug and I are going to touch on four key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value. Number one is organic growth, number two is growing through mergers and acquisitions, number three is improving our productivity and quality and fourth maintaining our unique culture.","We had an excellent quarter and, once again, the team delivered on all four of our strategic priorities. Before I dive deeper into organic pricing and mergers and acquisitions, let me give some financial highlights for the quarter. For our core brokerage and risk management segments combined, 11% growth in revenues, 5.9% all in organic growth. Adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 67 basis points, excluding the roll-in impact of acquisitions and we completed 10 mergers in the quarter, nine in brokerage, one in risk management, totaling about $75 million of annualized revenues, a really, really fantastic quarter by the team.","Let me start with our brokerage segment. Third quarter organic growth was 6.3% all-in with broad-based strength across all of our divisions globally. We did see some stronger than estimated contingents in the quarter, but even excluding those, organic was a really strong 5.9%. Let me break that down around the world.","Our domestic retail PC operations had an outstanding quarter with organic of little less than 7% and, even after excluding the stronger than estimated contingents, we were up nearly 6%. Our retail PC operations in the UK and Canada each delivered organic of about 4.5%. Australia and New Zealand are really terrific quarter, up 7%. Our domestic wholesale operations posted close to 6%. And finally, our benefits business also had a strong showing this quarter, generating more than 5% organic growth. Overall, rate and exposure continue to be a modest tailwind, and these two items combined increased our organic by a little over a point in the quarter.","Let me give you some more insight into the lines where we saw some movement in the quarter based on our internal data. In our U.S. retail PC business, rate and exposures flat or positive across most major lines. For example, commercial auto is up about 4%, property is up 3%, and workers' compensation is down a little less than a point. Moving to our domestic wholesale operations, a very similar story to the retail side. Property lines up 5%, casualty lines up 2%, and workers' comp down a little more than 1%.","Canada is up 2.5% overall with property up 3%, and professional lines and casualty up about a point. UK retail is positive across most lines as well. Property, marine and commercial auto are off a bit over 2%, and casualty up a little less than 2%. Pricing in Australia, New Zealand remains the strongest, properties up 7% and is stronger than casualty and specialty lines, which were up 5%. So, overall, up a couple of points, down a couple of points, you've heard me say this many times before. It's essentially a stable market \u2013 one that is good for brokers, it's good for carriers and most importantly it's good for our clients.","Next let me talk about brokerage merger and acquisition growth. We completed nine brokerage acquisitions this quarter, representing about $62 million of annualized revenue, an average size of about $7 million. Through the first nine months, our merger growth has been exceptional. We've completed 27 mergers, representing about $234 million of annualized revenue. That's more acquired revenue in the first nine months than we did in any of the previous three years.","Looking forward, our pipeline of potential tuck-in merger partners is very, very full. Our internal M&A report shows over $500 million of revenues associated with about 70 term sheets either agreed upon or being prepared. We'll get our fair share of these mergers and I feel good about our proven ability to track tuck-in merger partners at fair prices who are excited about our capabilities, believe in our unique culture and realize that we can be more successful together. I would like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals.","Next, I would like to move to our risk management segment, which is primarily Gallagher Bassett. Third quarter organic growth was 4%, in line with the estimate we provided at our Investor Day in September. While organic growth can vary by quarter, we expect 2018 organic to be in the 6% to 7% range for the year. In the U.S., claim counts continue to inch higher. Workers' comp and liability claim counts are up about 2% year-to-date versus less than 1% last year. This is a result of increasing claim activity as our clients' payrolls and exposures grow.","Moving to mergers and acquisitions, Gallagher Bassett completed one merger in the quarter, a U.S.-based risk management consultant focused on environmental and construction risks. This particular franchise will deepen our expertise and enhance our core loss prevention and mitigation capabilities ultimately furthering our mission of providing clients with superior claim outcomes, another great example of the type of partner we are trying to attract to the Gallagher Bassett family.","And finally, I'd like to touch on what really makes Gallagher unique, and that's our culture. Even as we get bigger and more global, our unique Gallagher culture is as strong as ever. For example, we were recently recognized by Forbes Magazine as the World's Best Employer. This recognition is especially gratifying because it means we are treating people the right way and helping them to succeed. It's also noteworthy that we were the only insurance broker in the world to receive this distinction. And that is on top of being named as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies for seven straight years.","I'd also like to thank our employees. They came together last year and set a goal of 90,000 hours of community service in celebration of our 90th anniversary. The team volunteered more than 110,000 hours to their local communities over the past year, far surpassing our 90,000 hour goal. This is another great example of our people and their unbelievable drive to do what's right. Our people underpin our culture \u2013 a culture that we believe is a true competitive advantage.","Okay, an excellent quarter in all measures. We're well on our way to another tremendous year. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. As Pat said, another really excellent quarter. Today I'll make a few comments referencing the earnings release. I'll then move to the CFO commentary document we posted on our website and then I'll wrap up with some comments on cash and M&A.","Okay. Let's turn to page four of our earnings release to the brokerage segment organic table and take a look at the footnote at the bottom. This is what Pat mentioned. We had some stronger than estimated contingents this quarter that had a net positive impact on our all-in organic growth of about 40 basis points. Excluding these contingents, our organic would have been more like 5.9% than the 6.3% shown in the table right above that. Either way, being nicely in the upper 5% range for organic is really, really terrific.","I'm making a special point about this today because it does highlight a significant difference between old GAAP and new GAAP. Under old GAAP, we just book contingents when we receive the cash. Under new GAAP, we must now estimate these revenues. So, naturally, actual results will vary from our estimates. I harped about this during our Special Investor Call in April when we walked through the adoption of new GAAP and here it is. When I look to the fourth quarter, it is still early, but it is feeling more like 5% organic growth versus the 6% we posted this quarter. Recall that we had a really strong fourth quarter last year, so that creates a tough compare.","Next, turn to page 6 of our earnings release to the brokerage EBITDAC table. In our July earnings call and during our September 13 IR Day, we foreshadowed that third quarter margins would be compressed because of the seasonality of our roll-in acquisitions. So we've added a table that levelizes for this roll-in acquisition seasonality. It's the middle table on page 6. It shows that we would have posted 81 basis points of margin expansion without the roll-ins. This is excellent operating leverage.","We're always striving to improve our quality, increase our productivity and reduce our costs. Our service layer professionals continue to optimize our approach to small business, improve and standardize our workflows, shift work to our lower cost operating centers and reduce our real estate footprint. These productivity improvements were instrumental in allowing us to contract our workforce in September and early October, which we announced we're doing at our September IR Day. Our efforts will allow us to reinvest into additional production talent, more data initiatives and to build our brand, all done to help us sell more insurance, provide more consulting and deliver more risk management services.","Moving now to pages 6 and 7 of the earnings release, that's the risk management organic table on page 6 and the adjusted margin table on page 7. You'll see that we posted 4% organic growth and 18% adjusted margins this quarter. This is also excellent performance by the team, coming off a strong compare from the third quarter of 2017 when we posted 7% organic and 18% margins and we discussed that it would be a tough compare in our September IR Day, but the team delivered.","Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we're seeing risk management segment organic growth of 5% to 7% and margins more towards 17% than 18%. If that happens, our risk management segment will come in with full year organic of 6% to 7% and margins of about 17.5%, right in line with our targets we discussed during our January 2018 earnings call.","Let's shift now to the CFO commentary document that can be found on our IR website, page 2 of that document. Most of the items were right in line with what we published at our September Investor Day. The two items worthy of some highlight: severance expense, about $0.01 more in the third quarter than we forecasted, but we're forecasting about $0.01 lower in the fourth quarter. So, in total, it is looking like we will be in line with what we forecasted at our September IR Day.","Next, take a look at the amortization expense line. This one might be causing some modeling noise. It looks like Street estimates were a bit lower on expense than we provided at our September IR Day, call it about $0.01; likely arises because we have done considerably more M&A this year than last. So, in modeling future quarters, it's worth an extra few minutes to consider Note 2 at the bottom of the page. That note says that our amortization will increase about 1% for every dollar we spend in purchase price per quarter. So if you model that on your estimate for acquisitions that should get you close.","Let's turn to page 3 to the corporate segment; three items to highlight there. First to the clean energy line, you'll see that we had a really strong quarter, even better than we thought at our September IR Day. With Hurricane Florence, came a lot of heat and humidity, causing our plants to run full tilt during the last half of the month. To illustrate, the average daily temperature in the areas serviced by our South Carolina plants was about 7 degrees warmer than average over the final 14 days of September. This is a classic illustration of how weather plays a big part in our estimate. It's always good for me to caution that our estimates are never set in stone.","Looking forward, several of our utility partners will publish their fall maintenance routine soon and we expect that they will be pushing maintenance out of September into October and November. So you'll see that we've lowered our fourth quarter estimates just a bit. That said, it doesn't change full year at all and it looks like it'll be another great year provided, of course, the weather cooperates.","And then, move to the corporate line. We came in $0.01 better than our September estimates. There's one reason for that: the tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation. With the run-up in our share price during September, there were more options exercised than we expected.","And the final line in the corporate segment is the impact of U.S. tax reform. We came in a little better than we guided in the third quarter mostly because of true-ups related to the transition tax and non-deductible compensation items as we finalized our 2017 tax returns. But, as we've been saying all year, this line is mostly just a book expense. It doesn't really cause us to pay more cash taxes because we have an abundance of tax credits.","In the end, tax reform has been a really terrific outcome for Gallagher. The rate is down, it's offset a tad by eliminating some deductions, but the billion-dollar win was that it preserved our historical AMT and clean energy tax credits, which totaled about $850 million at September 30. And it also preserved our ability to generate future tax credits through 2021. At current production levels, that may total another $700 million of tax credits. That will reduce our cash taxes paid well into the mid to late 2020s.","Okay, some final comments on cash and M&A. At September 30, we have about $250 million of free cash. We expect to generate about $200 million of free cash in the fourth quarter and we have borrowing capacity of about $500 million. That gives us about $1 billion to do M&A without using stock. Thus far this year, our weighted average multiple is 8.2 times, showing that we can execute our tuck-in merger strategy at fair pricing, which gives us a nice arbitrage to our trading multiple. And if you consider that many of these mergers are in the U.S., if you factor in the benefit of our tax credits, it would effectively drop our multiple well below 8 times.","Okay. Those are my comments \u2013 an excellent quarter, an outstanding first nine months and we're in terrific position to continue our success in the fourth quarter and into 2019. Back to you, Pat.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks, Doug. Devin, we want to open it up for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good evening. My first question, so just a couple things on organic growth. So 5.6% year-to-date and I know in September you kind of pointed to 2019 looking better than 2018, obviously another stronger-than-expected quarter in the third quarter. So does 2019 still seem like it'll be kind of in that over 5.5% organic growth range?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Well, Elyse, we were about 4.5% to 5% when we met last. And I think about 5.5% is really terrific. So I'd say I think 2019 looks probably more similar than higher.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","But similar to the 5.5%?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yes.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then, a little bit more color on the quarter, pretty strong broad-based growth in the U.S. and internationally. How was the new business growth in the quarter? Would you attribute more of the growth to new business versus retention or just greater purchases by some of your existing clients? Just trying to get an understanding of what really continues to drive the strong organic growth within the company.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Well, first of all, I think you know this, I'm extremely proud of the fact that we are an aggressive new business company and we did have a good quarter. But I think this quarter an awful lot of it was also just down to (00:19:10). We're doing a better and better job of keeping our clients and that's critical to organic growth. You can't fill a bucket with a hole in it. So proud of the team, retention was up nicely and new businesses were strong.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then, in terms of the margins, you guys did have that table in the press release kind of showing the drag, about 60 basis points for M&A in the quarter. I know in the past you guys have said that that is kind of equal to your margins on a full year basis. So when are these deals seasonally stronger? Like, will they help your margins in the fourth quarter or is it more taking into Q1 and Q2 of next year that you might see greater margin improvement driven off some of these deals?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Elyse, it's probably split between the three quarters: the first; the second and the fourth if you really look at the way they perform. They'll have higher margins in the fourth quarter than they did in the third clearly and that should be above the margins they would have posted in the first and the quarter.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then just one last question. In risk management, your book is about two-thirds in comp and I know you guys kind of highlighted a pickup in claims trends there. Claims trends continue to pick up, what you're hearing across the industry. Do you think that that could lead potentially to stronger organic growth within that segment when we start thinking about 2019?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","I hope so, but as our clients' businesses become more robust and they add new ships and things like that, the more hours worked \u2013 and we work hard to mitigate this, the more claims occur. And so, yes, I think a trend from 1% of growth to 2% is good. Do I predict it will go higher than that? I do not. But our clients' businesses are showing strengths.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you very much. I appreciate the color.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks, Elyse.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good evening.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Good evening.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","First just on P&C insurance prices, you commented how you continue to see those increase. I was curious on your thoughts on how you expect that to persist going forward. We've heard a couple insurers this quarter say that the pace of increase has either slowed slightly or stabilized and I wanted to get your outlook going forward.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Well, Sarah, I think you've heard me say this for the last eight, nine years. I grew up in an era where markets were hard and soft. A hard market was seeing increases of 25% to 50% to 75% and probably not able to fill out the line of insurance. Soft markets were down 15% to 17% to 20% and would go on like that for years and years and years. What we're in right now and have been for almost a decade is what I would refer to as a flat market. So I wouldn't be all that concerned as an analyst as to whether or not we're seeing a break from 2% to 1.5%. If the market's down 2% to up 2%, I look at that as flat.","And so I just think \u2013 you look at this and the reason we give the color we did around the world is, with maybe the exception of Australia, New Zealand, I would just simply call the market flat. Now, within that, you have certain lines that will exhibit the strengthening they need. For instance, transportation right now is difficult to place and the prices are moving up. On the other hand, workers' compensation is softer and clients deserve a break there. So I think you've got a really rational market. It's been rational for 8 to 9 to 10 years. If that's the new norm, that's as good as it gets for clients because clients don't need hard markets and no one benefits from softening markets that are just having the premium erode out from under them at huge chunks. And so I think it's been a pretty interesting decade and I think you'll see it continue to be flat.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just on the brokerage margin, if you can continue to generate the strong organic growth of 5% to 6% or so, how much higher do you think brokerage margins can expand over time, and is there a ceiling on the margin there?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Well, listen, trees don't grow to the moon, but it think that when you get into the short term bursts of 5% or so, you can drop some of that to the bottom line. The bigger question is what can you do with the excess proceeds to help you fuel future organic growth. The efforts that we have to put more boots on the ground is to sell insurance, the efforts we have to harness our data and our digital efforts to sell more insurance, the ability to expand our brand that allows us to hire more, to acquire more and to sell more, those are opportunities that you can invest in at this point.","There is underlying wage inflation that's happening, but we believe that we can control that. So, as we get extra organic growth, it's really more about the opportunities to invest in the business that should lead to further organic growth. I think that right now clients in a stable mode that we have, they see our capabilities, they see our resources, they understand they get more from Gallagher, and our ability to show them that to compare their pricing to what they could get elsewhere, et cetera, that's a really important thing and ultimately that will lead to better organic growth.","Just like the efforts that we invested in improving our middle office layer, I believe that's directly attributable to the increase in retention. We just don't make mistakes for clients anymore. They have a higher quality service because of the efforts that we launched 12 years ago to improve our middle office operations. So, can margins go up? Sure. The more important thing is what you're going to do with the excess that you get from it and that's reinvesting in the business, so it turns into more organic.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks for the answer.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks, Sarah.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Hey, thanks. I'll try a follow-up to Sarah's question on the investments. So, organic has clearly been excellent year-to-date. The margins ex the roll-in acquisitions have improved, I think, under 50 basis points. And so, just curious if we're thinking into 2019, it sounds like we should expect a similar level of investments to last year, should organic stay at excellent levels, is that what you're saying, Doug?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Well, I think there's opportunities for additional investment, but I don't see us spending more than last year, if that's your question. And to clarify in the front end, in the table that we provide on page 6, actually, we've expanded margin 53 basis points excluding the impact of roll-in acquisitions for the year. So our level of investment is controlled. It's not like we're going to plow in and just dump it \u2013 chase a lot of efforts and dump a lot of money into it. But I think there is a lot of good things that are going on and I think the level of investment that we have today, it'll notch up a little bit, specifically in data, but we're talking about $5 million to $10 million type of investment there, not $50 million, $60 million, $70 million.","Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Okay. Okay, got it. And another follow-up on the margins. So, thank you for showing the margins ex the roll-in acquisitions. But I just wanted to clarify, are those acquisitions lower margin and, over time, they'll kind of \u2013 their margin will increase more than the company-wide ex them or are those kind of permanently in the run rate (00:27:12)?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","I think it's almost pari passu with our margins by the time you get a full year in and by the time we get a little bit of our synergies and efficiencies there. So this happens to be in a quarter where they're just seasonally smaller and that will probably keep going in the seasonality. But when you stack them up at the end of the year, they'll be pretty close to our margins.","Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Okay. Okay, got it. And my final question is on the M&A pipeline. We've seen some sizable kind of top 50 business insurance deals this year and it seems like the bigger you get, the more expensive \u2013 the higher the multiple. Just curious do you feel that there is some kind of big fish in the pipeline or I don't know if you agree with what I said about the bigger, the more expensive, just kind of curious around the M&A dynamics in the pipeline.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah. This is Pat. I think that it's clear that as you get to what private equity firms might consider a platform acquisition or you get someone that's publicly traded or you get someone that's in the top 100, those multiples are higher. Doug went through the multiple that we're spending, but you also have to realize that the average revenue for what we've done so far this year is $7 million. Those people we can really get to touch and feel their culture. We're looking for folks that want to stay in the business that love the business and love our capabilities and that will come aboard and grow faster than they can grow on their own. And our pipeline has never and, I mean, in my career, never been this full.","Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you, guys. Nice quarter.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thank you.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good afternoon. Obviously, congrats on the quarter.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thank you.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks, Paul.","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","I wanted to ask about the contingent commissions in a little bit more of a broad way. I would have assumed that contingent commissions would slow down as profitability of the industry decreases and, obviously, we had some pretty heavy cat losses last year. What is offsetting that profit-related contingency piece? Is it just growth? Or is there something else that I'm missing here?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Okay. A couple questions. We actually did have about $2 million to $3 million of lesser contingent commissions as a result of the catastrophes. In particular, Hawaii really hurt us on one of our programs. I think we lost $1.5 million on that one. So, what's happening right now to still cause the growth in contingent commissions, I think that the reality is, is as we continue to grow as our acquisition pipeline comes on, there is actually we can improve the business of those acquisitions. And as they roll into our contracts with the carriers, you can pick up some additional contingent commissions that way.","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","So, essentially your contingent commission deal is better than the companies that you're acquiring. So you're getting a little bit better cut of the total piece as you acquire these companies in contingent.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","That's correct.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah. I think that the carriers \u2013 I mean, some of the things that we do with loss control, our knowledge on risk management, I think the carriers are a little more comfortable with paying us more than what you'd have in maybe a standalone independent.","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. That makes sense. Thank you. That was my question. Appreciate it.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks, Paul.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you and good evening.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Good evening.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, my first question, Doug, you mentioned about the restructuring programs, 350-person plus, that's 30 positions. I just want you to give a little bit explanation for that is ongoing process or (00:31:33) sort of one-off and any potential savings were coming from these restructuring?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah, okay. Good question. I think if you go back in our history, there's probably been four times where we've kind of taken an opportunity to tighten our belts. Usually, it's when we get an opportunity \u2013 when a lot of our improvements are happening in the middle office layer, we get the opportunity to increase the span of control for the management ranks. That's usually when we have the opportunity to tighten our belts a little bit. You'll see in there that we think that this effort can save us $25 million to $30 million and we'll reinvest that into data, some additional production talent and a lot of our branding that we've been doing. So how much of that will hit the bottom line? Maybe a third of it, something like that.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. When you mention tightening the belt, normally it will associate with the sort of top line growth probably slowing down, you need to sort of like tighten up the expense, but now you are running pretty well. So, why now?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","It just was the time when some of our technology initiatives and some of our work shifting to our lower cost labor locations came online. Frankly, it had very little to do with the timing of the strength of our organic and sometimes the best thing to do is to get better when you're stronger.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's great. And then on your clean coal for 2019 \u2013 2019-2021, the two tax credit will expire. Could you lay out sort of like the process that impact on your GAAP earnings? I know probably not impact much of your cash earnings, but on GAAP earnings basis, how much will you lose at which year and do you have any offsetting factors up to 2019 and the 2021?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","All right. So there's about four questions in there. First and foremost, if you want to understand how much of our GAAP earnings are contributed by the clean energy efforts, you can go to the page 8 of the earnings release and you can see the table in there on how much our clean energy contributes on a GAAP basis. You are right to say that there is a significant difference between a GAAP basis and a cash basis. Interestingly after 2021, if these all go away at that time, we'll actually have a substantial increase in our cash earnings at that time, although the GAAP earnings will go to zero for that. So you're right on point on that one, Kai, that we will actually increase the cash that flows from these once we stop producing new credits.","So how much is going to go away at the end of 2019 when some of our plants cycle off, we're working on ways in order to try to extend some of those locations by redeploying some of our lower volume 2021 plants back into the 2019 site. So I really can't give you that answer now. We do know that 2019 looks as good if not better than 2018. But I need another year to work on it in order to give you what the impact is in 2020 and 2021.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's good. Last one, if I may. And Pat, when you did the big acquisition of the international back in 2014, you're seeing this build a big enough platform you can do bolt-on acquisitions. But now sort of four years later, how do you think the bolt-on acquisition international has been?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Seminal moment, Kai. Probably one of the best things we ever did. It was a big reach for us in terms of moving ourselves into really an international player and it's probably the best thing that we've ever done.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","The number of acquisitions that are on our sheet right now for international location, strong in Australia, strong in Canada, strong in the UK. New Zealand frankly I think that we might have 25% of the market already down in New Zealand, but surprisingly there is a lot of little brokers still that we have the ability to partner up with there too. So, in those geographies, the opportunity to continue to do acquisitions the same way we've been doing it in the U.S. is very high.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","And the proof is in the pudding here, Kai. When we bought Australia in particular, we knew that that business in the form that it was before we bought it was going backwards over 5% a quarter. They're now nicely in positive territory.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks, Kai.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Hughes with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you very much. Good afternoon.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Good afternoon.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Hi, Mark.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","You had mentioned how you pick up extra contingents when the acquisitions roll-in to your program. Generally speaking, how well do those acquisitions do, more broadly in organic growth if you look out a year or two, is it usually a pretty meaningful uptick? And if so, now that you've accelerated the pace of M&A, will that be a tailwind on your overall organic?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah, it could. I think that if you look at it in the first year, our organic right when some of the merger partners comes on, the first few months it takes them a little while to get themselves organized in that, but we do have some nice organic that happens in the first year that we own them, but we never reported in our organic numbers because we keep them out of organic numbers for a full year. Then what happens in years two and three, there is some pretty good momentum from then. Does it move the needle on our total company organic? Not that much just because of the sheer size differential from what's coming on versus the mass that's here already. But those that join us that are excited about our capabilities really do well over the three or four years after we open them. And that's evident by us paying in on earn-outs. They're hitting their earn-outs because they are growing better than we expected.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I've got a question just maybe to narrow gauge, but you talked about workers' comp being down 1%. Some of these loss cost numbers state by state are down high single and even low double-digits. I'm always surprised to hear people say pricing is down 1%. It seems like it's probably down more than that if you look at what clients are actually paying. How do you square that?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Well, we've got good data on our own book of business and I think probably expenses are up, but we know what the rates are doing by geography, by line around the world.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","The other thing (00:38:24) understand when we quote rate, we're actually quoting rate in exposure so, as payrolls rise, the exposure are offsetting the decreases in the rates too.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Right. So, net-net down 1%.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Right.","Mark Douglas Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to start off, Pat. I noted with interest this announcement earlier this month about your being named to the Hall of Fame by the Katie School and I am just curious if you're going to use that as an excuse to write off into the sunset or do you plan to keep on going from here?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Greg, you know me well enough that you could answer that question for me. Do I sound like someone who's headed to the beach?","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I just saw all this press about it. It was worthwhile just checking in to make sure I wasn't missing something.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Well, thank you for mentioning it. It was a great honor and we raised a lot of money for Katie School, which is a very important educational institution for our industry.","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Perfect. Well, on a, I guess, slightly more serious note. And a couple people have referenced this before and you have as well. There has been a couple of large transactions by your competitors \u2013 one in the U.S. and one internationally. And if I think back in your company's history when your peers have made large transactions, it's usually been an opportunity for you to pick up dislocated brokers and sometimes customers and you've been pretty good at it. And I'm curious if you're hearing any noise in the market, and granted it's early in both cases and the two deals that I'm talking about and you know of, but I'm curious if you're thinking about anything in those terms?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Here's the thing, Greg, whenever \u2013 and you've followed us for years. Now, whenever there's change in the marketplace, when there's dislocation of any kind, up or down, people combining, what have you, it always creates opportunities and we're an opportunistic company. Now what we don't believe in doing is violating non-competes, advocating against gardening leaves or any of that stuff. You're also not going to see us pick up 250 people, shift and lift them and ignore their contractual obligations.","But we provide I think a very unique place to work. I think we've got an unbelievable team and our team, you've seen this because you know the company well, goes from folks like myself that have been around for 45 years down to what we call externs who are now starting to be accretive three years into their career. And so, yes, those acquisitions will clearly give us opportunities and we'll continue to be very opportunistic.","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. The final question just around M&A, because the multiples you're paying are considerably lower than what we're hearing about these larger deals (00:41:46) at. Curious if your multiples are an adjusted multiple based on your assessment or after you right-size the organization or if that's just as is type of multiple that you're paying on? And I think, Doug, you've answered this question before, but maybe you can just remind me.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yes, as is adjusted for excess owners' comp. So, in some cases, you'll have an owner that pays himself $1 or herself $1, and then some will say they'll pay themselves a 100% of whatever the EBITDA profits are of the company, right? And so what we do is adjust that down to what the fair compensation level would be for somebody that's running a branch or a unit of that size and we have so many around the company, it's a $3 million branch, they're going to make x, if it's a $6 million maybe they make 1.5x or whatever, and then we pay a multiple on that. We usually target 5% growth in order for them to get a little bit of an earn-out and then if they can grow 10% or 15%, they can max their earn-out on that.","And so it's a proven method. And I'll tell you what we do is we quote on the page here what we pay initially. Every year, we take all the deals and we stack them up against our earn-outs to see what the multiple is at the end of it. And it's actually no greater than what we paid on the front end. So we're not paying \u2013 the earn-outs don't elevate the multiple.","Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. Thanks for the answers.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Pat or Doug, I was hoping you can talk about whether pricing trends in workers' compensation, in particular, have any meaningful impact on risk management organic growth?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Well, typically, when you have a harder market on workers' comp then people will look more to the self-insurance arena. So, if anything, a softer workers' comp market right now would say that fewer people are looking at self-insurance or high deductible insurance. On the other hand, there is a lot of educated buyers out there right now that see that Gallagher Bassett can deliver a much better claim outcome. So I think they're getting just as many shots even in what I consider kind of a lower or a modestly lower market.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","And I think it's fair to say, Doug is right. 1% up, 1% down, go back to my earlier comments. It's a flat market. That's not driving Gallagher Bassett organic growth.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Right.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","We're out selling in the marketplace every day that if you move your work to Gallagher Bassett, we'll deliver better outcomes on your claim costs. And that's what's moving the organic needle there.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","And it's been pretty impressive thus far this year.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Yeah. No, I'm really trying to figure out if there was a headwind sort of baked in there that you've been overcoming. Second thing...","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","I would say, yes, a little.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. The second question is just employee benefits. I was wondering whether you could break down the overall growth conceptually into employee counts or pricing or client retention.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Not really. Our employee benefit consulting division now is so diverse, it goes from communications to where we have some really very large unique companies that I won't mention names, to health and welfare, which is of course our cornerstone and traditional product offering across voluntary and now across geographies internationally. So our retention there is very good. It mirrors what we do across the rest of the organization.","And frankly we just have so much to offer our clients now. When you think about property\/casualty, there is no pain in property\/casualty. We're not going out and solving a lot of pain point problems, but you get the benefits and you get clients trying to hold onto employees in this full employment environment and, at the same time, balance their employee benefit costs, which are huge and painful and going up, that's what's driving that growth.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. No, that's very helpful. Thank you.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thanks, Meyer.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Just quick follow-up on the tax rate. Doug, in your CFO commentary, looks like the range you narrowed that, the low end going up 1 point. Is that good rate going forward to 2019?","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Yeah, actually, good catch (00:46:35) I mentioned in my opening comments. Actually the tightening from a 24% to a 26% to a 25% to a 26% rate is basically because we're nine months through the year right now. So I think our insights into what our full year rate in our blend of our domestic versus international is going to be, that's the reason why we tightened it.","What will we look at next year, probably go back for the full year, in January we'll probably get 24% to 26% again. The important thing to remember on that, however, is that that's the book tax rate, that's not the cash tax rate. We said this in the last call, maybe I shouldn't repeat it again here. Because of our tax credits we really don't see ourselves paying more than 5% cash taxes paid, 5% of our EBITDA in 2018 or 2019. So the cash taxes paid are well below that 24% or 25% number you're looking there on the sheet.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's great. Thank you so much and good luck.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thank you, Kai.","Douglas K. Howell - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Thank you, Kai.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. - Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","All right, Devin, I've got just one quick remark as a wrap up here. I want to thank everybody for being on the call here this afternoon. I think you could tell from Doug's and my comments, we're extremely pleased with our 2018 performance so far. I believe we have a very strong finish to the year coming up and we look forward to speaking with you again at our IR Day in December.

Patrick Gallagher, Chairman, President and CEO of Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Thank you, Devon. Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings call. With me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions.","As I do each quarter, today I\u2019m going to touch on the four key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value. Number one, is organic growth. Number two, is growing through mergers and acquisitions. Number three, is improving our productivity and quality. And number four is maintaining our unique culture. The team once again executed on all four resulting in another great quarter and a fantastic year.","Let me start with some finance financial highlights for the quarter. Our core brokerage and risk management segments combined to deliver 11% growth in revenue, 5.8% all in organic growth, adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 45 basis points and we completed 19 tuck-in mergers during the quarter, representing about $90 million of annualized revenue.","And let\u2019s not forget about clean energy. $22 million of after tax earnings in the quarter bringing the full year total to almost $119 million, just a great performance by the team.","Now for some more detail on our results starting with the brokerage segment organic. Fourth quarter organic growth was 5.6% all in, reflecting strong base commission and fee growth of 5.9%. Combined, supplemental and contingent commission growth was 1.7% light by about $2.5 million in the quarter, mostly related to catastrophe loss experience.","This shortfall didn\u2019t move the organic needle much, but it did pull our brokerage margin expansion down from 65 basis points to 70 basis points to 46 basis points. Regardless, a really strong result by the brokerage team in the face of a tough comparison from last year\u2019s fourth quarter.","Let me break down our fourth quarter organic growth around the world. First, our domestic property casualty operations had a really great quarter, with base organic of over 6%. Our domestic retail benefits operation was closer to 2%, which is good performance given that the unit was up against that tough comparable of nearly 8% in the fourth quarter of 2017.","Outside the U.S., our U.K. operations posted 8% organic. Canada was up 6% and Australia and New Zealand grew around 9%. Property casualty rates and exposure combined are trending higher across all major geographies and continue to be a modest tailwind to our organic growth.","Similar to last quarter, these two factors added a little over a point to organic. Let me give you some rate soundbites during the quarter, focusing on a few noteworthy lines of business. In our retail P.C. business, commercial, auto and property lines are up about 5% and workers compensation is down a little less than a point.","In our domestic wholesale operations, property and commercial auto lines are up 4% casualty lines up 3%, and workers compensation down over 3%. U.K. retail is flat or modestly positive across almost all lines with the exception of professional liability, which we see up over 5%.","In Canada, property is up more than 4% while commercial auto and casualty lines are up less than 4%. And finally, Australia, New Zealand continue to show the strongest impact casualty and specialty lines are up over 5% and property is up around 9%.","Overall, the PC market remains stable, similar to past quarters, but we do see it trending just a little higher than say we saw in the fall of 2013. Regardless, it\u2019s a market that is good for brokers, it\u2019s good for carriers, and most importantly, it\u2019s good for our clients. Looking forward, 2019 brokerage organic growth feels like it will be around 5%.","Next, let me talk about brokerage merger and acquisition growth. 2018 was an outstanding merger and acquisition year. We completed 44 mergers, representing about $318 million of the annualized revenues. I would like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals.","Looking toward 2019, our merger and acquisition momentum continues. So far this year we have announced seven mergers representing about $130 million of annualized revenue. In addition, our internal M&A pipeline report shows around $350 million of revenues associated with about 50 term sheets, either agreed upon or being prepared.","Well not all of these will close. The continued strength in our pipeline shows our ability to attract tuck-in merger partners at fair prices, who are excited about our capabilities and believe in our unique culture and realize that we can be more successful together.","Moving to productivity and quality. As I mentioned earlier, lower contingent commissions tempered brokerage margin expansion by about 20 basis points in the quarter. But even with the shortfall in contingents, adjusted EBITDAC margin was up 46 basis points in the quarter, a really nice result.","The brokerage team continues to work hard to find efficiencies across the organization and further leverage our scale, helping us become better, faster, and deliver higher quality service to our clients.","Next, let me move to our risk management segment, which is primarily Gallagher Bassett. Fourth quarter organic growth was a really strong 6.7%, domestic organic was 6% and international posted 11%.","In the U.S. workers compensation and general liability claim counts are moving higher, and finished the year up around 3%. Our insurance carrier business once again grew nicely during the quarter as more and more insurance carriers realize that we can customize and handle claims more efficiently.","Outside the U.S. growth was excellent in Australia and the U.K,. which reflects our ability to deliver superior claim outcomes for our clients anywhere around the globe. As we look forward, 2019 risk management segment organic growth feels like it will be in the 6% to 7% range.","Moving to mergers and acquisitions; Gallagher Bassett completed two mergers in the quarter an Australian based provider of worker risk management services, and a U.K. based provider of property repair services. These are two excellent examples of the type of specialized partners we are attracting to Gallagher Bassett.","In terms of margin, the risk management segment fourth quarter adjusted EBITDAC margin was increased by 17 basis points. This brought our full year adjusted EBITDAC margin to 17.4% within our 17% to 17.5% expectation.","Looking forward, we see margins in a similar range next year as the team leverages its scale through shared services, increases its utilization of our offshore and domestic service centers, and invest in technology and analytics.","And finally, I\u2019ll touch on what truly distinguishes our franchise, and that\u2019s our culture. It is a culture that values teamwork, ethics, client service and a dedication to the communities we operate in.","The core tenants of our culture, which have been part of this company for generations are memorialized in the Gallagher way penned by my uncle in 1984. Every day, our colleagues get up and work diligently to maintain our culture, to promote our culture, and to live our culture. There\u2019s a culture that has also been recognized externally. This past year we were the only insurance broker to be recognized by Forbes magazine as a world\u2019s best employer and for seven straight years we have been named the World's Most Ethical company by the Ethisphere Institute.","Awards and recognitions aren\u2019t everything, but I believe these continue to show that even as we grow and become more global, our unique Gallagher culture resonates with all of our offices.","Okay, an excellent quarter and a tremendous year on all measures. I\u2019ll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?","Douglas Howell","Thanks Pat, and good afternoon everyone. Today I\u2019ll highlight a couple of things in the earnings release and then move to the CFO commentary document we posted on our website. But first, as Pat said, a great quarter to wrap up a fantastic year, deserves special mention. I\u2019d like to thank all of our worldwide professionals for such a strong finish.","Okay, to the earnings release. Pat hit the highlights of the brokerage and risk management segments. So let\u2019s turn to Page 9 to the corporate segment shortcut table, that\u2019s a little noisy. So let me break that down.","First, you\u2019ll see that we had a terrific quarter for clean energy, due to favorable December weather conditions our clean energy earnings came through to post an additional $3 million of after tax net earnings than we had forecasted during our December 11th Investor Day.","That completely offset the slight shortfall in contingents that Pat mentioned earlier. In effect, a nice weather hedge for our total corporate earnings. I know it isn\u2019t technically a hedge, but it certainly worked that way this quarter.","Second. You\u2019ll see that we had two favorable items that we have adjusted out. So looking at the last line in the fourth quarter table, that\u2019s at the top of page nine. That\u2019s the adjusted line. You\u2019ll see that our corporate segment came in about $5 million better than the midpoint estimates we provided during our December IR day.","The first adjustment is the favorable impact of reorganizing our legal entity structure, a $22 million benefit from releasing a tax value valuation allowance. It\u2019s not really a cash item this quarter, but it does help reduce our ongoing administrative costs, and it will reduce cash taxes paid over the next 10 years, equates to a couple of million dollars a year of cash savings going forward.","The second adjustment is an $8.9 million favorable impact from clarifying guidance issued last month related to the Tax Reform Act passed in December of 2017. It clarifies how U.S. taxes -- how the U.S. taxes earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. I\u2019ll come back to the other corporate segment line items in a few minutes when we get to the CFO commentary.","Next, flip to page 10 of the earnings release. The third item from the bottom called other. We did sell a small brokerage unit in January. We thought the product and customer service offering fit better with the buyer\u2019s underwriting business. So it ended up being a nice win win for both of us.","Let\u2019s go now to the CFO commentary document, to page to 12 [ph]. We\u2019ve now provided our first look at items for 2019. Two modeling notes. First, amortization expense. Please take a quick look at your quick look at your brokerage segment amortization packs.","We\u2019re forecasting $74 million in the first quarter and as a footnote says, you\u2019ll need to tick that up a couple of million a quarter for M&A that we could do for the rest of the year, and that will get you close.","Second, the earnings from non-controlling interest line. Our first quarter is when our brokerage segment has the largest impact from earnings from non-controlling interest. Please double check your models as this has caused some modeling noise in the past.","Let\u2019s now turn to page three to the corporate segment, let me walk you through that page. First, the blue section is just a reprint of a corporate shortcut tables from our earnings release this year. Next, we\u2019ve added the yellow adjusted section to remove the favorable tax items, I discussed with you a minute or so ago.","We believe the yellow adjusted numbers are more helpful when comparing to both the grey section and that\u2019s just a reprint of our estimates given last month during our December IRR day, and in comparison to the pinkish section, which is our first estimates for 2019.","Let me take each line in that table. Interest and banking. Our fourth quarter came in better than our December estimates, call it a million dollars after tax. Stronger cash flows in the fourth quarter kept us out of our line of credit. Our borrowings are a little bit lower.","As for 2019, again in the pink column, you\u2019ll see that our estimates for interest expense are going up to reflect our additional 600 million of borrowings, as noted in Footnote 1 on that page, and also in the 8-K we filed with our earnings release this afternoon. We use all of that for M&A, which I\u2019ll touch on later in my comments.","Moving down to the M&A expense line. M&A expenses ran a little hot in the fourth quarter, coming in about $4 million more than our estimates. It\u2019s simply more external, legal and due diligence costs related to two international deals that we\u2019ve recently announced, and one larger domestic deal that we pulled the plug on in December.","Looking forward, we see 2019 more like the first three quarters of 2018 than we do the fourth quarter of 2018. The corporate line, adjusted fourth quarter came in about $3 million better than our December IR day forecast.","Looking forward, we again see 2019 being more consistent with adjusted 2018. So let\u2019s go next to the impact of tax reform line. While the guidance gave us a benefit in 2018, unfortunately other guidance takes away a different benefit in 2019. So you\u2019ll see that 2019 is more in line with the adjusted amounts in the yellow columns, but again, it\u2019s very important to remind you that this line is mostly a book expense not cash because the additional taxes are nearly all offset by the use of our credits.","In the end, tax reform has been a homerun for Gallagher. Finally, to clean energy. As I mentioned earlier, fourth quarter came in about $3 million better than we forecasted due to a cold last half in December. When you look at our full year 2018, we estimate that ideal weather patterns contributed about $8 million to our full year net earnings of $119 dollars.","So now, as we and our utility partners look out over 2019, we\u2019re not expecting increased production levels from another ideal weather year. Rather, something closer to production levels we saw back in 2017. It\u2019s fantastic \u2013 it\u2019s fantastic that we\u2019re still forecasting another year over $100 million in net earnings, but we just don\u2019t see it as being amazing as it was in 2018.","Okay let\u2019s flip to Page five of the CFO commentary. You\u2019ll see that we\u2019ve updated our roll-in revenue estimates for mergers that we have announced thus far this year. Usually our first quarter is a little slow, but it\u2019s certainly not the case this year.","For full year 2019, let\u2019s say we can do about $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion of M&A with free cash and debt. That consists of $300 million of cash on hand, will generate another $700 million after our dividend here in 2019, plus another $600 million borrowing that I mentioned earlier.","Of that, we use or will use about $500 million for mergers we\u2019ve already announced, and have been included in our roll-in revenues in the table, meaning that we still have about a billion dollars to fund additional M&A in 2019.","In 2018, our weighted average multiple was around 8.3 times, and it equates to much lower than eight times when you factor in our tax credits showing that we can execute our tuck-in merger strategy at fair pricing which gives us a nice arbitrage to our trading multiple.","Okay. Those are my comments. An excellent quarter to close out an outstanding year and we\u2019re in a really terrific position to continue our success here in 2019. Back to you Pat.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Thanks Doug. Devon, I think we can go to questions and answers now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good evening. My first question going back to some of your comments Pat when you kicked off the call. You described the market as stable, but you did say, it\u2019s a little bit better than the fall of 2018, which is good to hear, but then also you said organic growth probably around 5%. I know you guys have been talking about 2019 being about the same as 2018. So it came in at just 5.6% this year as well. So is there any reason I know it\u2019s only half a point slowdown, but how you\u2019re kind of coming to that 5% of cost next year to drop a little bit from where 2018 was?","Douglas Howell","Yes, I think, Elyse that item, Pat and I were looking. I think it\u2019s just a little more conservative than we are seeing here in this year. There are you know we will see how our contingents and supplementals come out next year. We\u2019ll see how the if there is -- if there\u2019s any slowdown at all in the economy, we\u2019re not seeing it now, but I think a 5% pick feels more it\u2019s more like 5% than it\u2019s 6% that's for sure.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Plus I think, Elyse, when rates go up a little bit, what we really had a hard time tracking is the opt-out. So for instance, someone may take a higher retention, bring that premium back down. Someone may drop limits. Instead of buying $100 million, drop it down to $50. It\u2019s really hard to track that stuff. So as rates go up, they don\u2019t just flow through, which is why when you see us talking about rates up here at 5, and somewhere there 3, and in Australia New Zealand 9. But the impact to the company from rate and from exposure units is only about 1%.","Elyse Greenspan","And you would expect it to continue to be about 1% in 2019 as well.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Yes.","Elyse Greenspan","Yes. Okay. And then on, another question. You guys are going to be issuing some interest expense. It sounds like the M&A pipeline is very robust. So obviously we update our models to factor in higher corporate expenses due to the interest expense here, but then the offset should really be that it sounds like there\u2019s going to be a lot more revenue flowing through this year. So can you just give us a sense, I mean, obviously decent uptick in corporate expenses, but is the offset that as you guys kind of model this through internally you see earnings going up because it\u2019s the firepower it gives you to finance future transactions.","Douglas Howell","Yes. I think, Elyse, I think it\u2019s important to look at page 5 of the CFO commentary, for just acquisitions that we\u2019ve closed and we have announced thus far this year, the roll-on impact is 92 million bucks in the first quarter 80 million in the second, but then there\u2019ll be new acquisitions that come on there too. So yes, if you push up your interest expense and your model, you need to make sure that you put in the role and impact of the acquisitions that we\u2019re using that debt for.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. That makes sense. And then so you guys did 318 million of annualized revenue in 2018, already 130 million so far this year. So I guess, based off of the strong start to the year and the pipeline that you alluded to earlier, both of you guys, you would expect I guess the revenue -- the acquired revenue on that metric to on deals that you announced for all of 2019 to be higher than 2018, I would assume.","Douglas Howell","Yes probably 40% higher, 30% to 40% higher.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay that\u2019s great. And then you guys didn\u2019t call out just one last margin question. I know there were some acquisitions that were dilutive to your margins in the third quarter, and the thinking was that for the full year on an annualized basis they would be margin kind of neutral. Did you see a benefit in the fourth quarter or? Or is that something that we think about more benefiting the first half of 2019 margins?","Douglas Howell","Yes, it\u2019s about 7 basis points in the fourth quarter of margin left next to nothing on that. We had -- maybe I think for the whole in the third quarter is 40 basis points if my memory is right or maybe it\u2019s 10 basis points of positive in the first second and a little bit here in the fourth. So year-to-date not much.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much. I appreciate the color.","Douglas Howell","Thanks Elyse. Have a good evening.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Kai Pan","Yes, thank you and good evening. So my first question is on margin. So if you look at past three years mentally, what I\u2019m drawing two lines. If you look at organic gross, 2016, 3% 2017, 4% and 2018 is almost 6%. So the organic growth accelerating, then the other line is margin expansion year-over-year about 80 basis point 2016, 50 basis points 2017 and 40 basis points 2018.","So why these two line diverging? And can you help us to see is that wage inflation investment you need to make or, or\/and to we\u2019ll try to figure it out, in 2019 were the pace of margin expansion better than the 40 basis point you seen in 2018.","Douglas Howell","First I see 2019 very similar to 2018. So that will help you on that one. In terms of why, I think it really comes down to the fundamental investment layer that\u2019s going on inside of the business. We\u2019re seeing \u2013 we\u2019re investing heavily in data analytics, sales support tools, branding, sales support on the marketing side. So there is an investment layer there Kai, that\u2019s happening underneath.","As for actual wage inflation, as you know that we feel like we have a little bit of a safety valve on that with our offshore centers of excellence where we can continue to move work to lower cost labor locations. So the real cost is that the any additional cost that we\u2019re spending are primarily going to two things that we believe should help us grow better in the future.","Kai Pan","Including producer hires?","Douglas Howell","Yes, that\u2019s right.","Kai Pan","Okay, that\u2019s great. And then my second question on the acquisition, looks like you have a very strong pipeline and I saw up like a press release every day. So -- in January the seven deals seem particularly harsh on average about $18 million each. Much larger than your normal deal, where you\u2019re talking about $3 million, $5 million, $7 million. Is there is a trend that you\u2019re getting more larger deals? And also, what do you pay for them? Is that the larger deals tend to command higher multiple?","Douglas Howell","Yes, I think the one that\u2019s inflating the first quarter numbers in terms of the revenue per acquisition as we announced Stackhouse Poland in the U.K. We think that\u2019s a terrific addition to our growing retail operations there. The multiple on that was above 10 times, but I think our portfolio for the year, this year was three times. And then again for anything we do in the U.S. our tax credits bring that number down. As a matter of fact, it ends up being a multiple about 7, 6.9 to 7 times on U.S. acquisitions. So, the little bit larger one that we\u2019re doing here in the first quarter is what\u2019s -- what you\u2019re seeing there.","Kai Pan","Okay. That's very helpful. Last one if I may on the sort of your leverage level. With the $600 million additional debt, what's your leverage level? Are we going to see like a further sort of leverage as you grow your business, doing more acquisitions or is there -- the leverage level you're going to just go up with the sort of EBITDA growth?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","I would -- it's more the latter of what you\u2019re saying. We -- this is not a levering up of our balance sheet. We think this is a safe level consistent with what we've done in the past. Our cash flows at the end of 2018 were particularly strong. So our debt ratio dropped down maybe point two turns of EBITDA and we'll reset that number at point two. But it's not going to be -- you're not going to see us run three times or something like that.","Kai Pan","Perfect. Thank you so much and good luck to those 2019.","Douglas Howell","Thanks Kai.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.","Yaron Kinar","Hi. Good afternoon.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Good evening.","Yaron Kinar","I had a question on the risk management margins. I think you call out a non-recurring favorable settlement in business insurance. So could you maybe quantify what margin impact that had?","Douglas Howell","In the quarter maybe it's \u2013 I\u2019m just doing the math in my head here. Maybe is \u2013 its a 20 basis points that what I guess, 10 basis.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. So, not very significant.","Douglas Howell","Yes, right.","Yaron Kinar","And as we keep hearing these or seeing these headlines about potential recession at some point, at the end of this year or maybe next year. Can we remind us or talk through some of the expense structure. Basically what component that would be variable and what actions could you take to manage expenses, should organic start flowing?","Douglas Howell","Yes. I think that there's two things. First of all, we're not seeing a recession in anything in our clients at this point. We're seeing our clients continuing to grow. We\u2019re considering -- so, we're not seeing that yet. But what would happen if they did? I'm going to talk about a slight recession not a great recession. Usually what we do is we -- as we just tighten our hiring a little bit, we typically have not been one to go to large layoffs. We don't cut benefits back. We don't really cut back on those things that are building our franchise going forward. But rather what we'll do is we'll be just a little bit slower to hire and when you're having a 10% of your workforce turnover every year you can tighten your belt a little bit and reallocate work. And that tends to be what you can do in a recession. So the model is highly flexible to respond in a recession and usually just a little tightening of the belt that allows us to get through just a modest recession.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Two things I'd add to that. This is Pat. Number one, Doug started off saying, we're not seeing that and we've checked with our fields people, and our clients businesses are strong. So, what's going on right now is clearly not a recession. The other thing I'd point out is I tell our people this all the time, we're in the luckiest spot in the world of commerce. I don't care what happens to the economy. You're going to buy your insurance.","Yaron Kinar","Right. Look, I'm not in any way suggesting there is a recession. I take the fact that you're actually -- it sounds like you've actually increase your organic growth estimates here because I think only a month ago you were talking about 5% organic for 2019 off of a lower base. And so, clearly the organic numbers are very strong. Did not in any way\u2026?","Douglas Howell","Yes. We\u2019re still seeing five. But our best guess for next year is 5%.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. Well, I thought you said 5% for brokerage and 6% to 7% for risk management?","Douglas Howell","Fair enough, yes, you\u2019re right.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","You\u2019re correct.","Yaron Kinar","Okay, okay. That\u2019s a great organic growth numbers. Thanks again.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Thanks Yaron.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with question.","Mike Zaremski","Hey, good evening. On the risk management segment I guess I'm just little bit surprised about your guidance for no margin improvement given the healthy revenue trend and outlook. Maybe you can just quickly and I think in the past you've also talked about you could -- you can squeeze some margin improvement out as long as organics above. You can correct me if I'm wrong about four or five-ish. So if you can kind of talk to the rationale on the guidance there?","Douglas Howell","Yes. I think that -- we're been saying between 17% and 17.5% on the risk management segment for a number of years now. Where we like to see it that 17.6% or 17% that might happen, but right now we're pretty comfortable that 17.5% margin range. In that business it's not quite as levered as the brokerage businesses. Is that still a heavy labor, so you really need -- if you go back and listen to it you really need margin expansion above 3% in the brokerage space and you only need organic growth of at least 3% or more to expand into brokerage space and you need at least 5% in the risk management space just because it's not heavily leveraged or geared business.","We'll see what happens when we come through the year this year. We'll see what. There are some pretty exciting things that we're doing with some of our domestic service center work. But 2018 -- 2020 might be a year to see more of a step up.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Mike, let me make a comment too. This is Pat. When you write claim business you better put the people on because the bags of claims are coming. You better have them on. You better haven't trained and you better have them ready. You can't wait till the claims start flowing and they go recruit people.","Mike Zaremski","Okay, understood. My other question is on, Pat, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that worker\u2019s comp general liability claim counts are up a few percent year-over-year. I think -- does that figure include exposure growth or is that a frequency statistic?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","That\u2019s a frequency major.","Mike Zaremski","Okay. I ask because we sometime use that as a read through for the carriers. Okay.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","And also I would say that it also gives you an idea of kind of what\u2019s going in the economy a little bit. When claim kind of start to rise, it\u2019s usually because there\u2019s more work being done by our clients.","Mike Zaremski","Okay. Got it. And I guess just a final on this and I don't know if this is a big deal or not, but does your 1Q guidance for clean coal take into account the lovely weather we're experiencing in January in the Midwest and parts of the northeast?","Douglas Howell","I don't have those productions levels today, but it's pretty darn cold here and we have a lot of plants in Iowa. Actually it's interesting enough electricity use in the south that drives it more than it is necessarily that cold weather in the Midwest because there's so much natural gas in homes in the Midwest in the north when you get in the south it's much more baseboard heat et cetera. So you really need to cold weather in South Carolina, happening a little bit now, but yes, we'll see a little bit better first quarter results as a result of this week's weather.","Mike Zaremski","Okay. Stay warm and good luck until 2019. Thanks.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Thanks Mike.","Operator","[Operator Instructions].Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.","Ryan Tunis","Hey. Good evening. Follow-up on Kai's question like thinking about the wage inflation aspect of things, Doug, if you had a -- it's probably just a guess at this point. But what do you think inflation did in 2018? What impact did that have do you think our industry expense growth component? Was it 1%, 2%, 3% just the wage inflation aspect? Thanks.","Douglas Howell","Hi. There\u2019s two components in that. There's the actual raise, increase and that\u2019s probably was about a 1% pool this year and just turns the wage inflation. And then when you take a look at the replacement cost, this year our average replacement was running about 8% more than what our termination rate was -- level was. So that's also a little bit that we're hiring perhaps more technical folks in the data, the analytics area, but we're continuing to become more efficient in some of the middle paid layers as we implement technology and use our offshore centers of excellent. But by and large as a percentage of revenue we're seeing wage and replacement inflation somewhere around as a percentage of revenue 1.2%.","Ryan Tunis","Got it. That's helpful. And if I could, what percentage of your workforce in the normal years, new employee?","Douglas Howell","We typically replace about 12% of our workforce just through natural attrition.","Ryan Tunis","And then, I mean Doug in 2019, 1.2, is there more marquee on that or is that\u2026?","Douglas Howell","No, I think that's a pretty good number right now. I feel like that 2019 we can operate at that level.","Douglas Howell","Got you. Then the other thing I wanted to ask about was, again, I want to use the recession word, but back in 2008 you guys had much smaller employee benefits. And trying to get a feel -- that's obviously been a pretty big growth area for you guys and competitors as well, but what's really been driving that? Is that been more health? Is that been talent? And how much of that is tied to? How much of that revenue growth is tied to essentially payroll versus just projects and hours and that type of thing?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","This is Pat, Ryan. You've got two things that are influencing that. As we grown through acquisitions we've brought on more product offerings for our clients. We're much bigger now in the retirement field, much bigger in HR consulting and all the other services that are folded in and around health and welfare. Health and welfare still remains our biggest. And that is of course -- that attaches based on headcount and population. But the rest is a mix of project work. Most of the HR stuff would be project work and ongoing which you might call annuity revenue from things like retirement.","Douglas Howell","And realized through that, right now, even if even if we have an uptick of a point in unemployment, right now employers number one issue is the war for talent and that's exactly where our benefits, folks play in that, its how do they create a better workforce to attract more talent. Because even if employment goes from three and a half back to four and a half to five there's still going to be a war for talent out there. We are not seeing a great recession before. So this isn't like payroll numbers are going to be dropping dramatically 10%, 12% something like that.","Ryan Tunis","Thanks for the answers.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Thanks Ryan.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. ","Adam Klauber","Thanks. Good afternoon guys.","Douglas Howell","Hi, Adam.","Adam Klauber","How did our RPS do this year? Was it in line with overall organic or somewhat better or worse? And then on top of that, there's been some dislocation in the E&S markets, Lloyds and AIG are pulling back. Is that a help or is that can be challenged for our RPS next year?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Well, RPS was basically in line with the brokerage segment in terms of growth and what have you. They are seeing a little bit stronger tailwind in terms of some of the placements they are making in the E&S market. But to your point, you do have some pullback at Lloyd's and AIG. But I will tell you we're finding no problem in particular with the U.S. domestic market gobbling those disruptions up. Business will move from London back in United States, D&O policy quoted by Chubb here versus Lloyds there that will move. So, I think there's good there's good in RPS. And there's a lot of great cross-sell into the Gallagher organization by our brokers to RPS and I see that continuing.","Adam Klauber","Okay. Thanks. And then -- sorry if you said this. You U.K. business, what's -- I guess what's the general outlook in 2019 versus 2018 for the U.K. for your business?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","I think. I'm really pleased with our U.K. business. I mean that organic number that we mentioned earlier today is a real really good improvement. And the franchise, the retail franchise throughout the U.K. is up in the Scotland as well is really strong and has just great opportunity to continue growing. And our specialty operation in London is second to none in that market. And is growing in spite of what Lloyd's is doing.","Adam Klauber","Okay. Thanks. And then as far as sort of same store produce I don't think you give out that number, but in general is that, did that grow last year and do you expect it to grow this year?","Douglas Howell","Yes. We're up about this year considerably better than we were in 2017. We typically don't talk about specific numbers but if 2017 were flat to up 2% we probably triple that this year.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Well, Adam you know pretty well. This is sales machine. You're not going to be here if you're not growing your book.","Adam Klauber","Right, right. Okay. Well, thanks for the answers guys.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Thanks Adam.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Hughes with SunTrust. Please proceed with your questions.","Mark Hughes","Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Hi, Mark.","Mark Hughes","Hey, Pat. You had mentioned maybe a little more tailwind in early 2019. I think you're talking about P&C pricing compared to the fall. Could you expand on that a little bit? What might the magnitude of it would be? What's driving it?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Well, I think part of it is you know you've got good economic activity. I'm trying to get to what my actual prepared comments were. But we're seeing -- rates in the U.S. commercial, auto and property, up about five, and that\u2019s being driven a lot, Mark, by auto. The transportation market is actually tough right now. And property lines, of course, you had the storms. And that's got to be spread out across the book. But at the same time workers\u2019 compensation is down about a point. So, I think what you've got is some recovery from the storms in the property market and the transportation market is driving a bunch of the others.","Mark Hughes","But you feel like it's a little better in Q1 as opposed to the back half of 2018?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Yes. But, Mark, don't adjust your model. It's up slightly. And remember I talked about the fact that clients opt out. So I might take a bigger retention depending if I'm a small piece of -- if I'm a small account, I don't have that opportunity. But any commercial middle market account has levers they can pull to reduce the rate impact.","Mark Hughes","Understood. On the domestic benefit I think you're up two. Last quarter you're up five. Anything going on there?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Just a tough comparable the last year, they had a dynamite fourth quarter last year.","Mark Hughes","And then finally on contingents, I don't know whether you said what drove that? Was just a timing issue or some sort of the shift in the mix on payments? What's behind that?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Catastrophes took our loss ratios up.","Mark Hughes","Okay.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Drove our payments down.","Mark Hughes","Understood. Thank you.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Thanks Mark.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Meyer Shields","Thanks. If I could just spring off of that last question. I guess I'm surprised that the travel time between catastrophe losses and the impact on contingencies as quick as it is. Does that mean that there won't be a continued impact from let\u2019s say California wildfires or Michael in 2019?","Douglas Howell","Well, remember, Meyer, that with new GAAP accounting we must estimate our contingent commissions and -- rather than booking them when we receive them like we have done in the past. So, it shows up faster because we have to estimate those today. And so that's the reason why that happens. And I\u2019ve warned about that volatility since we started talking about new GAAP a year and a half ago that you're going to see a little bit earlier recognition of those things that you would have in the past. And that also is admittedly a little harder to estimate. But we take our best shot at it. With the information that we have at hand and it cost us a couple million bucks this quarter.","Meyer Shields","Okay. Fair enough. I feel like I'm missing something here, but there's a footnote with regard to the commentary for brokerage segment amortization and excluding Stackhouse Poland?","Douglas Howell","Yes. Number, the 74 million exclude Stackhouse Poland. And then, in my comments would say that we need to take it up a little bit. I don't know we're going to close out for sure whether we'll be here in this quarter or next quarter. So we just said that we would footnote it. It's not in there. But you'll have to increase the amortization in the second, third and fourth quarters. Take it up a couple of million dollars and you'll get close.","Meyer Shields","Okay. That's perfect. And then final question, with regard to risk management are the economics on carrier business any different from when clients are just retaining a layer of risk?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","No, not really.","Meyer Shields","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Douglas Howell","Thanks Meyer.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Alison Jacobowitz with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your questions.","Alison Jacobowitz","Hi. Thanks. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more picture about the acquisition environment. Maybe give some color on maybe that if you're -- the nature of the deals you're looking for has changed, if the nature -- I'm curious if you're seeing a change in the landscape of agents or targets approaching you to sell? And also the competition that you're seeing for the companies you're looking at. Has there been any change there, private equity versus other avenues?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Yes. I would say the changes over the last four or five years there are significantly more competitors for deals specialty deals of size. And that's the private equity world that is very aggressive right now. So what I'm really proud of is that the people that have chosen us have chosen us to win that battle and that's really what it comes down to. Every one of these, you\u2019re fighting to win, just like it was just an account. And you\u2019re going to fight that battle on a bunch of themes, and one of those themes is culture. And if in fact what you want to do is sell to someone that says, I\u2019m not going to change anything about you. I\u2019m not going to change your name, I\u2019m going to change your marketing, I\u2019m not going to change your systems. I just want you to send me the check every quarter, and make sure you make as much of a margin as you can. That\u2019s not going to be something that\u2019s going to fit Gallagher. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing every day, is trying to figure out who is going to fit.","And then the second thing that I think we\u2019re pretty good at, that is really important, is the entrepreneur going to stay? Because they are the connection to their people and the people that the people that are excited about joining us because they are going to get capabilities and they are at a place that is stable and is not for sale are the ones that fit. So yep there's plenty of product out there. This is an incredible business. There's the baby boomers are looking at monetizing their life\u2019s work. And they were not just out buying baby boomers. And there are literally thousands of these agents and brokers that aren\u2019t even over 20 million in revenue. Thousands of them.","And so, we offer I think a very, very stable home. I\u2019m proud to be able to say to these people as they come through my office, any account, any size, located anywhere in the world, we can do it. Now isn\u2019t that cool, if you\u2019re a little broker from let\u2019s say Cincinnati.","Alison Jacobowitz","Thanks.","Douglas Howell","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with their question.","Yaron Kinar","Hi, just one quick follow up. Doug, I think you said that you were thinking of margin expansion brokerage in 2019 roughly in similar vein as the margin expansion we saw on 2018. Why wouldn\u2019t a rebound in -- contingent commissions actually drive margins, margin expansion a little higher?","Douglas Howell","Well, first of all let\u2019s take a rebound for the full year. If we pick up an extra $3 million of contingent commissions next year versus this year, it\u2019s going to move at 8 basis points, something like that. So it\u2019s not a big number on a $3 billion to $4 billion number. It had little impact in this quarter, but we still posted 46 basis points of margin expansion. So yes, rebound would certainly help in that. But, if I said, if we post 5% organic growth next year we should be showing that margin expansion similar to what we have this year.","Yaron Kinar","Okay, thanks.","Douglas Howell","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question and answer session. And I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing remarks.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Thank you Devon. Thank you again for being with us this afternoon. In closing, I\u2019m extremely pleased with our 2018 performance. And I want to personally thank all of our 30,000 colleagues for their hard work and dedication. I believe, our long term strategy will continue to serve this company, our colleagues, our clients, and our shareholders well. 2019 should be another great year for Gallagher. We look forward to speaking with you again at our March 12th IR day in Rolling Meadows. Have a good evening and thank you for being with us today.","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.

These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that will be discussed on this call and which are also described in the Company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Gallagher & Company. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thank you, Manny, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning if you hear me rasp rest through the call this morning is because I\u2019m fighting my way through a cold. This morning, I'm joined by Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as some of the heads of our operating divisions.","What a great quarter we had and what a great finish to an unbelievable year. And as we go into 2015, we remain very bullish. Our team performed exceptionally well everywhere across the globe in an every operating business that we\u2019re in.","Strategically, I believe 2014 was really a seminal year, a year which we established a global base that will allow us to continue to grow over the coming decades. We\u2019re done integrating our Bollinger acquisition and our new operations in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the UK are all integrating well and delivering results.","In 2014, we went from a small retail presence in Australia, Canada and New Zealand to a top five broker with a real platform for both organic sales and mergers. And our acquisition pipeline is growing there nicely. In UK, Oval and Giles are now Arthur J. Gallagher across our 70 UK offices we are seeing good sales momentum as well as many acquisition opportunities. I am very pleased with how the UK team is coming together putting the days of private equity ownership behind them and selling the Gallagher brand.","In addition, to our larger deals we did 57 other acquisitions that\u2019s more than one a week. These were a classic Gallagher deals. Entrepreneurially owned, looking for a home to continue to grow and build their business. In a nutshell, they see how joining Gallagher gives them access to our resources, expertise and capabilities. So they can sell more, I want to welcome all of our new partners together we will continue to grow a great business and I know you all had choices. So thanks for joining Gallagher.","Let me go back to the operating results. As we said in the press release the brokerage and risk management businesses had an outstanding quarter. Good growth combined revenue up 31% on an adjusted basis. Good organic growth 5.6% all in. Brokerage basic commissions and fees were up 4.2%.","Risk Management organic was 12.6% and we had nice margin expansion in both segments. And on top of all that growth, our clean energy investments took another big step up and generated over 50% earnings growth. Well done to all my colleagues and the whole team around the globe. I am very, very proud of these results.","Let me go into a number of our operating businesses for a little bit more color. First, I will start with U.S. retail property\/casualty. The Council of Insurance Agents & Brokers rates report is out and once again rates are begin reported as essentially flat, which we agree with by the way. Small accounts were up 1.1%, medium accounts were reported about flat, large accounts were reported down about 2.2%.","In my opinion, we are in a new era of a prolonged stable and rational rate environment. In my meetings with domestic insurance companies they resolved to continue their four-year market flattish rates. Accounts that deserve decreases are getting them for those that need increases are being coated higher.","This really is an excellent market for our brokers and our clients like. This is a market that will continue to reward expertise. And one thing we are building everyday around the world is expertise. Secondly, let me move to employee benefits. In 2014, the employee benefits team was very busy helping our customers manage their benefits and HR needs. This trend will continue nicely in 2015, as the complexity grows along with higher benefits and wage costs.","In the U.S. employers continue to deal with the impact of the ACA, the Affordable Care Act. Our team has the tools and resources necessary to assist our clients in compliance with this law. We continue to see solid interest in the Gallagher marketplace, our private label insurance exchange as more employees, employers understand the advantages in offering this to their employees. 2015 will be a very busy year for the exchange. The team continues to invest in tools and resources, our clients need to manage their employee benefits and human resource needs.","This has helped with strong new business sales and it continues to drive increased merger and acquisition opportunities in the U.S. and truly globally. Thirdly, we would look at our UK and Canada. We are seeing the market there is flattish to a little down in Australian and New Zealand it\u2019s down maybe mid single-digits. And even in this environment, our existing operations posted 2% in organic growth. Fourth, our wholesale and specialty businesses both in the United States and London had a fantastic quarter.","Solid organic growth of about 5%, domestically our wholesalers overcame strong headwinds in the property market and international our London specialty unit grow stronger by the day as we continue to service customers all around the world.","Fifth, let me shift to our Risk Management business which is Gallagher Bassett, what a strong quarter, what a strong year. 12.6% organic, adjusted EBITDAC margin improved 225 basis points over 16 points of margin and a great finish to the year. Revenue growth was fueled by a number of things: First, strong new business domestically and internationally and across both our large commercial and carrier units; secondly, client retention at about 95%; and thirdly mid single-digit growth in claim counts.","Finally, we continue to invest in our managed care offering, our IT systems and our claims analytics all with the goal of delivering industry leading claim outcomes. I want to thank all my colleagues across the globe for pushing through the whole 12 months. What a great finish we had. We\u2019re still in focus for integrating our new partners, selling a lot of new business and taking good care of our clients and retaining those clients and in 2014 continuing to be recognized as one of the world\u2019s most ethical company\u2019s.","Let me finish by rephrasing why I think 2014 was in fact in our history going to be looked at it several year. We\u2019ve had aspirations of being a global growth enterprise since my dad open our offices in London and Bermuda in 1974. We now have 20,000 plus people spread across the globe bringing the expertise of our organization, no matter where in the world that expertise is located to our clients. We developed more clients, we developed more mergers, we developed more geographies, we really made some giant strides in our journey in 2014 and I am very, very pleased. Doug?","Douglas K. Howell","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. What a terrific finish to a game changing year for Gallagher. All right, let\u2019s please flip to the table on Page 2, and here some other items for you to consider as you review our results and work on your models for 2015. We\u2019ll start with the brokerage on Page 2. Brokerage segment adjusted EPS of $0.50, up 22% in the quarter. Foreign currency did not have much impact year-over-year in the quarter, but have the dollar remained at third quarter levels we would have earned another penny.","Looking towards 2015, if the dollars stays at current levels it will cost us about a penny in the first quarter and then about $0.02 to $0.03 in the second and $0.02 in the third. Next integration, you heard Pat\u2019s comments that Bollinger is done and the others are moving along as planned.","Looking to 2015, we are seeing integration cost of about $0.07 to $0.09 a quarter in the first half and $0.05 to $0.06 a quarter in the second half. Again that\u2019s $0.07 to $0.09 a quarter in the first half and $0.05 to $0.06 a quarter in the second half.","Staying with brokerage, but turning to Page 3 to the organic revenue table at the bottom. Pat gave you some flavor around the world. So let me give you some more detail behind the 4.2% organic growth in base commissions. We saw about a little over 4% came from our domestic retail operations, international was nearly 4% and domestic wholesale was around 7%. So, solid numbers around the globe, no matter how you add them up.","Second, as for supplements and contingents together organically about flat in the fourth quarter, which given we had a gangbuster fourth quarter in 2013, should be viewed as really excellent work by the team. For 2015, we are feeling a little preference from carriers to move from supplements to contingents, but buy and large we are renewing most of our contracts as is and we see some moderate growth in these lines.","Third, rate in exposure together basically have zero impact on our organic growth this quarter. This is consistent with what we have been seen since mid-2011. So like Pat said we are in a new rate environment and still a very healthy one for that matter.","Look now to Page 4, to the brokerage segment adjusted EBITDAC margin table near the bottom of the page. Adjusted margins are up over 180 basis points about two-thirds of that results from the rolling impact of the larger deals and about a third from organic growth and expense controls. Again, that\u2019s also great work by the team.","Now let me give you some thoughts as you prepare your models for 2015 for the brokerage segment. First, we\u2019ve said this a lot in the past, but I can\u2019t emphasize it enough that our brokerage segment has substantial seasonality in our first quarter. You can really see it on Page 4 of our investor supplement.","As a result, our first quarter has historically had by far our lowest margins and we historically posted a smallest amount of organic growth in the first quarter versus the latter quarters and full year. I really encourage you to reflect this dramatic first quarter seasonality in your models.","Second, given the sizeable amount of M&A we have this year, projecting rollover revenues can be difficult. So for your 2015 models assume rollover revenues about $175 million in the first quarter 2015, a $125 million in Q2, $25 million in Q3, and $10 million in Q4. Then you will need to add your pick for organic and for 2015 acquisitions. Also when you make your pick for 2015 acquisitions, please consider that M&A historically in a quarter tends to skew towards the last month not the first month. That can have an impact in your models and we don\u2019t control for that also.","Third, also please be careful in your model investment income. We call that our investment income has revenues from our premium financing business. While revenues are somewhat apparent in that investment income line, it isn\u2019t easy to see the cost associated with that revenue. That cause some confusion last quarter, so we\u2019ve added a footnote on page 12, of the release to show the net impact to EBITDAC which is very small relatively speaking. So please make sure your models don\u2019t have all the investment income hitting the bottom line.","Fourth, as for first quarter 2015 margins, we estimate about 80 basis points to 100 basis points of margin expansion from our larger deals as they roll into the numbers. But I am not seeing much more margin expansion from organic in the first quarter given our seasonality.","Fifth, let me give you some non-cash estimates for the first quarter for the brokerage segment. For depreciation assume about $15 million of expense, for amortization about $55 million, for acquisition earn out amortization assume about $5 million. Then as we do more M&A for every dollar we spend you need to increase amortization by about 1% of the purchase price per quarter and that will get you close.","Let's turn to Page 4 to the Risk Management segment. Really, an excellent quarter across the board. Breaking down the organic, our domestic operations grew near 12% and internationally near 17%. Margins were nicely up over last year and we surpassed our 16% target for the year. I guess that was on Page 5.","Let's turn to Page 6 to the corporate table. Overall, we came in slightly above our midpoint guidance and you\u2019ll see the retirement de-risking strategy that we discussed in our last call and in the December 8-K. And remember the de-risking charge is non-cash and those payments are made from plan assets, not from our corporate cash. We saw a very nice outcome on all fronts.","Looking forward when you get ready to model 2015 for our corporate segment, please take a look at our investors supplement Page 15. We provided a 2014 adjusted view and we\u2019ve also provided our estimates for the corporate segment for each quarter of 2015. We\u2019ve adjusted 2014 on that Page 15 for both de-risking and non-cash accounting gains on our clean-energy investments giving you an apples-to-apples view with our estimates for 2015.","A few other thoughts on 2015. First, we are still waiting for some production estimates from our utility partners, so there are still some wide ranges on the clean energy line of the estimates.","Second, you\u2019ll see that the midpoint in the clean energy estimates is about 10% up over 2000 adjusted 2014. We see 2015 as a stair step year to 2016 where there could then be another move up in the earnings as we put a few more plants back into service this year.","Third, you\u2019ll see that our first quarter clean energy estimates were also seasonally smallest which results from the accounting rules not from production. Affectively the accounting rules require recognition of tax credits somewhat in proportion to our pretax earnings not as such credits are generated. In our case we produce more credits in the first quarter then we can recognize in earnings, but then catch up over the following quarters.","Footnote 1 on Page 16 shows this affect. Finally, some comments on our M&A program. Excluding the large deals we did 57 mergers in 2014 at an average multiple of EBITDAC of 5.9 times in a weighted average multiple of 6.7 times. Average pro forma margins where in the very high-20s.","Second, looking towards 2015 M&A, we can spend about $400 million a nice tuck-in in bolt-on mergers in 2014 without having to issue any stock. That said there will be tax structure deals and mergers where the sellers wishes to take our shares, so of course we would do that.","Based on our pipeline, we see opportunities that might pushes over $400 million in purchase price, so if we did another $150 million to $200 million of purchase price we might need to use about 3 million to 4 million shares in 2015. Our pipeline is terrific at this point.","All right, those are my comments and like I said to start what a great way to finish a game changing year. Thanks, Pat.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Doug. Mannie, you want to open the lines up.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael S. Nannizzi","Sure, thank you. Hey, one question I had was in risk management. There's been a lot of growth there. I know you talk about the 16% margin as kind of a target. Is there operating leverage in that model that could allow you, if you continue to see the kind of growth that you have seen to reset that to 17% this year maybe higher? Just trying to get an understanding of the leverage of that business and where the leverage might be. Thanks.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Yes, I see I think we\u2019re targeting about 16.5% of margins, so there is some opportunity improve in the Risk Management segment.","Michael S. Nannizzi","Got it. And just in terms of what is driving that? Is it - is there a relationship between top line and margin? Or is that just kind of that mid- to high-teens margin business no matter how big you are?","Douglas K. Howell","Well, listen, no matter how big we are \u2013 that could change the answer, but I think in the size that Gallagher Bassett is right now with the investments that we want to make for improving our customer\u2019s claim outcomes. We think 16.5% is pretty healthy and industry leading at this point.","J. Patrick Gallagher","I was going to say thesame thing Mike, this is Pat. We believe we have the industry leading margin. And I will tell you it\u2019s not the same as the brokerage business. When you write new claims business, claims show up, and you'd better have somebody there to adjust them.","Michael S. Nannizzi","Got it, got it. Okay, great. And then just trying to get an understanding also of the comp ratios in the brokerage business. And obviously, there's a lot going into what those numbers were this year and also other operating expense. Is there a way that we should be thinking about those pieces separately? Or is it just - is there just too much noise to be thinking about extracting or extrapolating a trend line?","Douglas K. Howell","Listen, I think that our investor supplement on Pages 4 and 5 of the investor supplement provide a good historical trend on that. We see a comp ratio in the high-50s and we see a operating expense ratio in that 17% to 18% range as probably a good go forward ratio.","Michael S. Nannizzi","Got, it.","Douglas K. Howell","You\u2019ve got to look at that for the entire year remember that that can cause issues on our first quarter because our comp ratio is \u2013 because of our seasonality, when I am saying that you know in the high-50s for, that\u2019s for the year 17%, 18% for operating that\u2019s for the year, too, but again our first quarter is so seasonal, you\u2019ll see those numbers higher than that.","Michael S. Nannizzi","Got it. Then just wondered - one quick news point. I saw that the CFO of international had left. Can you talk about what is happening in Europe? Maybe an update on the integration and any sort of update on management out there would be helpful. Thank you.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Sure, I was just there last week and had some very good sessions with the leadership team there. And we have a CFO that was offered another opportunity to work someplace else, that we\u2019re started to lose him. But he is a good guy and he is taking an opportunity in private equity that he thinks will be better for him. So but the team remains very solid. Very pleased with the integration I\u2019m seeing.","As I mentioned in my prepared remarks we are now trading as Arthur J. Gallagher everywhere. We are seeing organic growth, we\u2019re selling more than we\u2019re losing that\u2019s good. And I think the troops in the leadership team over the last six months really come together nicely.","Michael S. Nannizzi","Great, thank you.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks Mike.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Adam Klauber of William Blair & Company. Please go ahead.","Adam Klauber","Thanks, good morning guys. Couple of different questions.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Klauber","How are Noraxis and Wesfarmers doing on an organic basis? It's not included in organic, but how are they looking so far?","Douglas K. Howell","Together just slightly between 0% and 1% organically between them maybe a little softer in Australia and New Zealand and little better than that in Canada. Now with that caveat, there is some difference in accounting. We\u2019ve tried to levelize for that as best as we can, as I give you that answer, but we are nice flat a point or two between those two units.","Adam Klauber","Okay, thanks. And I think you mentioned there is going to be some more integration cost in 2015. Could you give us some idea I guess just more what that's about and what should be the ultimate impact of that integration cost?","Douglas K. Howell","Yes, I said at the opening part of my comments, so we see $0.07 to $0.09 a quarter in the first quarter and second quarter and $0.05 to $0.06 a quarter in the third and fourth quarters. Most of that has to do with system integration, real estate consolidations and moves. We have incentive compensation for some of the teams that are working on that. There are some employee change costs that are in that number. So there is of course lot of excess travel that goes on with it, lease abandonment charges.","So it\u2019s the common thing that you would see similar to what we get with Bollinger. We brought in 12 different units there. We moved some folks around. We rebranded, so there is cost in that. So it\u2019s just a standard integration cost that you would see just like Bollinger. And it takes us Adam, a year to 15 months to integrate a larger deal, maybe I\u2019ll stretch to 18 months on some of them, really each one of them is different.","In Canada, Australia, and New Zealand it\u2019s more extracting them from their former parent those cost, when you get into the UK, it\u2019s a little bit more intricate as you put together Oval, Giles, the old Heath Lambert, and the old Arthur J. Gallagher. So it depends on a country, but if you look at past Bollinger\u2019s done and the cost were very similar when it came to that one too.","Adam Klauber","Okay. So do you think 2015 will be for, I imagine these are mainly Noraxis\/Wesfarmers. Do you think the 2015 will be mainly the end, and 2016 we shouldn't have too much? Or should these be ongoing through 2016?","Douglas K. Howell","No, I think we are pretty well done by the end of 2015. There will be some drips, one of the issues when it comes to real estate abandoned the cost, so you don\u2019t take the charge on an abandon to your last folks are out of the building. And we would never do, but we had 300 personal offices and two people allow technically can\u2019t take the charge until the two people move out of the building. So we would obviously not do that, we get it done faster, but there might be a little bit of that that creeps into 2016, but by and large will be done.","Adam Klauber","Okay, okay. That will be great. And then switching to the wholesale MGA segment, clearly there's been some pricing pressure on property. I noticed for most of the year you've had pretty good flow still coming from the standard market to the E&S market that helps submissions. I'm hearing some inklings that that flow is slowing down a little. What are you guys seeing in the market?","J. Patrick Gallagher","We had a great fourth quarter and we killed in the fourth quarter, we had a lot of activity. I\u2019d say the property rate decreases really did affect us in the first and seriously in the second quarter July 1, September those tend to be big months, but as we came into the fourth quarter, so that property is behind us, we just, we killed it, it was fantastic.","Submission flows were up, our hit ratios were up. Remember we are the largest MGA in the United States and so those are many times small startup businesses around the country that are coming in. That\u2019s kind of a good sign for the economy, we are seeing small startup businesses that need cover. So I\u2019m very bullish and we are excited about the acquisition pipeline in those businesses as well.","Adam Klauber","Okay, okay. Thanks, that's helpful. And then, Doug, on net cash provided by operations, could you give us some idea -- we have it around $350 million, 2013. Is that going to be up materially in 2014?","Douglas K. Howell","I\u2019d say above $400 million in 2015. So we can do $400 million with the deals mostly from our free cash flow and we have decent amount of stock, we go to $600 million of deals we are doing that, but by and large we see a cash flows being pretty strong, the nice opportunities are that we are seeing global opportunities for our - to use our cash in acquisition, so we are seeing nice opportunities in Australia, Canada and New Zealand.","And also to on that point, one of the things we\u2019ve talked about in the past, if you look at us from a global basis on our cash taxes paid, we\u2019re down to basically about 10% of our EBITDA overall if you just - you can\u2019t use exactly the 10-Q or 10-K numbers, because that have some estimated taxes, but we\u2019ve done a really job between our tax credits and our structure internationally we are paying about, only about 10% in actual cash taxes paid as a percentage of our EBITDA. So cash flows are pretty good.","Adam Klauber","Okay, one thing, so if dividends are running in the 200 million plus range and then you have 400 million of cash flow. How do you have 400 million for acquisitions?","Douglas K. Howell","Well I took the dividends out when I got to the 200 million, so if you want to start with an EBITDA number 10% goes taxes, about 10% goes CapEx, about 5% goes to cost of reducing our taxes, 25% goes to dividends so to speak, it could get down to about 40% number of our EBITDA number that available for acquisitions.","Adam Klauber","Okay, okay. Maybe we can talk more detailed, I don\u2019t want to take up too much time, but that\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Douglas K. Howell","Okay, thanks Adam.","Adam Klauber","Yep, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from John Campbell with Stephens. Please go ahead.","John Campbell","Hey guys congrats on a good quarter and a good year.","Unidentified Company Representative","Thank you John, appreciate it.","John Campbell","Absolutely. So it looks like you guys used some of that at the market stock plan in the quarter. I think you have got about 166 or so remaining in the balance of the \u2013 I guess the next year or two, but just trying to get your thoughts on the programs for the remainder of the year and then Doug is that going to be tied to the kind of north of 400 million acquired revenues without using stock comment you just meant?","Douglas K. Howell","A couple of different answers to the question is that when we talk about using stock for acquisitions, we can either use the dribble out to bring the cash in and then push that out in an acquisition or we can use stock directly to the sellers depending on the structure, but so my commentary about maybe using 3 million to 4 million share in 2015 would include \u2013 we can choose to use the dribble out to do that or we could choose to do it directly to sellers. So they are inclusive of one another.","John Campbell","Okay that makes sense and then Doug just two housekeeping items here. So what was CapEx in the quarter and then maybe if you can get us a sense for what you guys are budgeting out for the year and then is a 35% tax rate a good starting point for brokerage for the year?","Douglas K. Howell","Yes to the last question, I think that in terms of CapEx the general rule of thumb is whatever we depreciate we probably spend in CapEx plus maybe 10% or 15% more of that number that\u2019s kind of the way that we budget our CapEx. So I think that was your two pieces of the question right.","John Campbell","And then CapEx in the quarter?","Douglas K. Howell","Oh CapEx in the quarter, hold on a second, I\u2019ll see if I can get that. Maybe $22 million. Yeah $22 million.","John Campbell","Got it, okay thanks guys.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks John.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Daniel Farrell with Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.","Daniel Farrell","Hi, good morning.","Douglas K. Howell","Good morning Dan.","Daniel Farrell","A question on your smaller M&A - the sort of 57 other deals that you do. How do we think about the margin of those deals coming on? I know you have talked about the larger ones having a higher margin, but when we think about smaller M&A, does that generally come on at the same margin? Is it a lower margin? And then as you bring it onto the platform, you can lift those margins up?","Douglas K. Howell","Now typically the pro forma maybe a couple margin points better than lets say our overall brokerage margin segment, but then by the time we \u2013 put our employee benefit plans, we don\u2019t really - on the smaller deals there is a not a lot of synergy opportunities Dan on the tuck-ins. The place where we get opportunities on the smaller deals is in our capabilities and resources allows them to go out and sell more insurance.","Daniel Farrell","Right. Okay.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Yes, I would say margins in general margin is pretty similar to what we\u2019ve got.","Douglas K. Howell","Right.","Daniel Farrell","Okay.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Pro forma.","Douglas K. Howell","They are in the high-20s just like ours somewhere in the 25 points.","Daniel Farrell","Okay. And then unrestricted cash of $314 million at the end of the quarter - how much would you characterize as usable cash within that number?","Douglas K. Howell","So I think it\u2019s about $200 million.","Daniel Farrell","Okay.","Douglas K. Howell","Most of that is offshore at this point, and so as our acquisition opportunities internationally there is $200 million there. Also on our balance sheets since we\u2019re talking about as we do have credit carryovers of almost $250 million. So that\u2019s those are warehouse credits that we will be able to use to reduce our tax rate going forward to.","Daniel Farrell","Does that factor into your previous comment that you are sort of in reality at 10% tax rate on the EBITDA? Do you factor that in when you think about it?","Douglas K. Howell","Right now we are actually producing more credits than we\u2019re using to actually warehousing some of the credits. Some of - that the reason why is through 2015 lot of those credits have a special feature with them that allows us to reduce our AMT down to about 8% or 8.5% so those are special credits that\u2019s okay to have in the warehouse so to speak, but that will help us reduce our cash taxes paid going forward substantially.","Daniel Farrell","Okay. Great thank you very much.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","The next question is from Mark Hughes of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Mark Hughes","Yes, thank you. In the corporate segment, you described or suggested there would be a step-up in 2016 in the contribution from the clean coal. Would it be similar to what we're seeing from 2014 to 2015?","Douglas K. Howell","I would hope to better that. I think it\u2019s a little early at this point to say, but we\u2019d hope to see a betterment to what we are doing this year. You really look at it - if you look at how these things work, we get plants up and running, we put them in service and then we move into different locations during the year. This is year there will be a lot of further work by the team and we hope to get more of those plant online towards the end of 2015. So you will see that the hard work that\u2019s going on right now will start paying in 2016.","Mark Hughes","And so to be clear, the clean-energy-related contribution of $90 million stepping up to, say, $100 million at the midpoint for 2015, it ought to step up even faster in 2016?","Douglas K. Howell","Based on what we are seeing now, yes that can change, but yes.","Mark Hughes","And then the 1Q guidance you give for corporate, does that include some de-risking, which I presume would be non-operational, and you would segregate that out when you report operating earnings? Or is this did not include the de-risking?","Douglas K. Howell","There is no de-risking charge in the first quarter of 2015, there were non-cash gains in the clean-energy line in the first quarter of 2014. So we\u2019ll treat that as a adjusted item when we report our 2015 result. You should be able to see that on page 15 of the investor supplement, where we give you an adjust - we take reported, corporate, we adjust for the de-risking and for the non-cash clean-energy step up in basis gains, and then we give you 2015 on a comparative basis. But we don\u2019t see step up in basis gains in 2015 nor do we see a de-risking charge in 2015.","Mark Hughes","That rollover guidance you gave for the organic growth or to help us calculate revenue, does that include all of the deals you did through the end of 2014?","Douglas K. Howell","Yes, so that is not just big deal that\u2019s all deals through the end of 2014 does not include any organic nor does that include any 2015 mergers that we haven\u2019t closed by 12\/31\/2015.","Mark Hughes","Then final question, did you give the organic growth in the benefits business?","Douglas K. Howell","The benefits business was north of 4% in the fourth quarter.","Mark Hughes","Thank you very much.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Bob Glasspiegel with Janney Capital. Please go ahead.","Robert Glasspiegel","Good morning, Gallagher.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Good morning, Bob.","Robert Glasspiegel","Question on currency, the numbers you gave us on the impacts for Q1 through Q4 those will be adjusted out? So those are not going to be in the adjusted earnings?","Douglas K. Howell","What we\u2019ll do Bob, is typically when we present current year information in order to make a comparable, we\u2019ll make an adjustment to the prior year. So when we get to 2015 we\u2019ll basically adjust 2014 to remove the currency impact as an adjusted item.","Robert Glasspiegel","Well, I guess I'm not sure I follow the answer, sorry. Is this going to be something we should factor in as a headwind in our adjusted operating earnings? Or is it going to be neutralized?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Well, it depends on what you start, what I would do, as I would take down the prior year 2014 by few pennies and then project half of that. I said a penny in the first quarter, two to three in the second and two in the third. So I\u2019ve dropped down 2014 and project half of that, because that will be a new base line for 2014.","Robert Glasspiegel","Okay. I've got to hit you offline on that. Are you factoring in both income statement and balance sheet when you are giving those numbers?","Douglas K. Howell","This is the income statement fact we don\u2019t have balance sheet changes that go through the P&L.","Robert Glasspiegel","No assets overseas that get marked?","Douglas K. Howell","No, that goes through OCI.","Robert Glasspiegel","Okay. And your severance charges and lease were heavy in the quarter. Anything specifically that was driving the $0.12?","Douglas K. Howell","If you look at the integration efforts that we\u2019ve had I mean are you talking about in the integration line, you are talking about the severance and at least abandonment line.","Robert Glasspiegel","The $0.12 for workforce and lease termination $26 million...","Douglas K. Howell","Well, actually you are on the $0.12 was in the acquisition integration line, but we didn\u2019t have much in workflows and lease termination a $1.8.","Robert Glasspiegel","Okay.","Douglas K. Howell","And of course it\u2019s the $0.12 of acquisition, yes, that\u2019s up a little bit from the guidance I gave in October by a few pennies largely had an opportunity to push forward on a couple contract terminations and we did have a nice move that if we got taking care of that allow us to take a charge in the fourth quarter.","Robert Glasspiegel","Okay, last question: your dividend increase is a lot slower than your EBITDA per-share growth, and you are issuing stock, so \u2013 and the shareholders are getting less of the increase in earnings \u2013 understandably, because you are using the money for deals. Is that something we should expect? Or does the dividends and capital management start to march in line with the EBITDA growth at some point?","J. Patrick Gallagher","I think we\u2019ll probably keep that growth in dividend at a slower rate than EBITDA growth depending on the deal pipeline.","Robert Glasspiegel","And the thought process behind that, Pat?","J. Patrick Gallagher","We took our dividends up substantially number of years ago, Bob you remember that..","Robert Glasspiegel","Yes.","J. Patrick Gallagher","I guess to a point where we kind of at constraint cash with dividend still have the best yield in the business, have share I think nicely with our shareholders our growth where we had a slowdown in the great recession, we did not deduct any of that from dividend payment and I think as we build our capital plan going forward, we see our selves being modest in dividend increase and continuing to be very acquisitive.","Douglas K. Howell","That was just a terrific opportunity for M&A activity right now Bob, I think that as the baby boomers are getting closer to retirement, there is really nice number of family owned entrepreneurial franchises out there, so we see lots of M&A activity that can be a good use of our cash.","Robert Glasspiegel","Got you, thank you.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks Bob.","Douglas K. Howell","Thanks Bob.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Arash Soleimani of KBW. Please go ahead.","Arash Soleimani","Thanks and good morning everyone.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Good morning.","Arash Soleimani","I Just wanted to follow up again on the FX question. So just kind of making up a number here, if we were expecting, let's say -- again, making up a number -- $1.00 for 2015, does it make sense to take that down a few pennies for the FX in the adjusted EPS estimate?","Douglas K. Howell","Yes I think so. I mean for the whole year, maybe $0.02 or $0.03 and then you are going to have the impact of \u2013 the real issue is the pound spiked up during the middle of the year and then fell off, the Canadian Aussie dollar just kind of had a trickledown effect throughout the year and then kind of fell off a little bit as the Canadian dollar did in the fourth quarter. So you get a little bit of this spike up and spike down during the year, but I think that\u2019s probably a good way to look at it.","Arash Soleimani","Okay, yes because in the press release, I think it said FX is excluded from adjusted, but it sounds like the adjustment is made to the prior-year numbers, from what you're saying.","Douglas K. Howell","Correct. Yes, we represent prior year to show the impact of FX that\u2019s comparable without currency movements.","Arash Soleimani","Okay, that makes sense. Thanks. And then can you -- I know you talked about some of the rollover numbers from acquisitions. Can you just talk about the seasonality of revenues in those acquired companies and how that seasonality compares to Gallagher's historical seasonality?","Douglas K. Howell","Well listen if you roll them all up and you put them all together actually it accentuates our seasonality a little bit more, we were always a small first quarter company and a lot of these transactions we\u2019ve done has not I would say changed that much.","Arash Soleimani","Okay, okay. And then the first quarter of 2014 adjustment that you guys made -- this might be, again, a better question for offline -- but if I get to the net adjusted $16.5 million that you have for the first quarter, on a per-share basis, I can't get to that $0.06. Is there something else in there that could be impacting that, or\u2026","Douglas K. Howell","Sorry. Help me where are you.","Arash Soleimani","So I guess it\u2019s the corporate as adjusted page of the supplement and you start with $4.6 million as your net earnings for corporate in the first quarter and then with the adjustments it goes to negative $16.5 million and then you have negative $0.06 as the EPS for that quarter in corporate adjusted and I guess that\u2019s page 15 of the supplement. So basically just on a per share basis.","Douglas K. Howell","Yes, let me look at that offline.","Arash Soleimani","Okay, that\u2019s fair, probably a better offline question, but.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks Arash.","Arash Soleimani","Yes, I appreciate the answers. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Kai Pan","Good morning. Thank you for taking my call.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Good morning Kai.","Kai Pan","First question on the organic growth in the UK and in Australia, New Zealand, Canada it looks like overseas organic is kind of slower than you had in the U.S. just wondering its just mark environment over there or if there are anything your control you can improve that organic growth going forward.","J. Patrick Gallagher","I\u2019ll touch on some operating aspects and let Doug give you the numbers, but I think what we are finding is when we put on a nice tuck-in acquisition anywhere in the world that thing is integrated in nine months they are hitting the ground rather than Gallagher is helping them, our resources are working and they are selling more business. Into these larger ones like Heath, Bollinger it probably takes 18-months till the troops have found the rest room, they know what they are doing, they know how to get to the resources, the resources are engaged and organic growth is influenced by the fact that they joined Gallagher.","And so I think you have to expect that to occur in Australia, New Zealand, Canada a bit and the UK. Now also to your point the market is softer in Australia and New Zealand a bit softer in Canada, a bit softer in the UK than it is in the United States and as Doug said in his prepared remarks we are seeing almost no impact from market advances or declines in the U.S. domestic business, but that\u2019s not true in these other countries. And Doug can talk about the specific numbers and yes I do think that overtime as we have with our acquisitions in the United States, once they are integrated into Gallagher organic growth does improve. Do you want to talk about the specific numbers?","Douglas K. Howell","Yes, look and I think that when you look at the ones overseas right now, we are seeing nice net unit sales growth in Canada, we are having nice net unit sales growth in New Zealand, Australia is the place where brining our sales culture there will helps us do that but still they are selling some nice business there. And then the UK, we had really nice results out of the oval acquisition, Giles was steady so I am not seeing any particular weakness as I go around the globe on that.","Kai Pan","Okay, that's great. And then there is like a distressed situation - Towergates in the UK. You said in the past you're not interested in it. I just wonder, given the situation over there, do you see organic opportunity from that, from competitors, such as hiring brokers or getting new business?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Well, Kai, we\u2019re always looking to hire good people into the organization, but I would not say that that provide us any astronomical opportunity.","Kai Pan","Okay, that's great. And then a number of questions for Doug. Just wanted to clarify - you said a margin expansion from these large deals last year going to help you about 80 to 100 basis points. Is that for the full year or just for the first quarter?","Douglas K. Howell","That\u2019s first quarter.","Kai Pan","And will that help the subsequent quarter as well?","Douglas K. Howell","Well, remember by the time we get to the second quarter every deal really will have been in our second quarter numbers from last year expect for Noraxis, which is the Canadian acquisition because remember we bought Oval on April 1, so that was in our second quarter 2014 numbers, we bought Wesfarmers effective mid-June. But they have a strong June. So we picked up some of their numbers. And really Noraxis we closed on July 1st. So the impact of the roll in of the larger deals were pretty well be in our numbers. And there might be a little bit of an impact in the second quarter, but I don\u2019t have that number in front of me.","Kai Pan","Okay. Organically you said that you expect no expansion in the first quarter. Is that right?","Douglas K. Howell","I think it\u2019s very hard for us to show organic growth, organic expansion in the first quarter given our seasonality.","Kai Pan","Okay. But you do expect some margin expansion in the latter half of the year?","Douglas K. Howell","Listen I think that you know depending on what organic as we\u2019ve said, that it\u2019s anything above 3% we might have a chance at it. Anything below 3% its hard work to remain flat and if you get negative of course that\u2019s hard to hold margins. But we\u2019ll see where organic comes in and a lot better feel for that at the end of the first quarter.","Kai Pan","Great. Lastly, if I may, you have a terrific year in terms of number acquisitions we've done. It seems like people are waiting to join the Gallagher family. And I just wonder, do you see any increase in competition in terms of getting deals, in terms of just valuation? Because you are paying still a pretty reasonable - 6 or 7 times EBITDA. But I just wonder, is there increasing competition in terms of valuation for deals?","J. Patrick Gallagher","If you just take a look at the size of those deals in the 57, I would say that there is competition for every single one of them, but it\u2019s not as fierce as it is when you get bigger.","Kai Pan","Okay, great. Well, thank you so much for all the answers.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thank you, Kai.","Douglas K. Howell","Thanks, Kai.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Scott Heleniak of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott G. Heleniak","Hi, good morning, thanks.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Good morning, Scott.","Scott G. Heleniak","I just want to touch on a couple questions, first in risk management. The organic growth rate was higher than the overall growth rate for that segment. And just wondered if you could refresh me on the difference. Is that just currency, then? In other words, organic\u2026","Douglas K. Howell","Say your question again, the organic growth was\u2026","Scott G. Heleniak","It was higher in risk management. It was 12.5%, but the overall revenue growth rate, I think, was 11.5% for that unit. So is the difference, is that currency, then?","Douglas K. Howell","Yes, it is.","Scott G. Heleniak","Yes, okay. I figured it was. Just clarifying. And then the - I wanted to clarify on the risk management margins, the target you gave, the 16.5%, is that for this coming year? Or is that just over time you are targeting that?","Douglas K. Howell","That\u2019s 2015 target.","Scott G. Heleniak","Okay. And then the client retention you mentioned 95% of risk management, which is very good. Can you compare that historically is that an all-time high? Or how does it compare to previous years?","Douglas K. Howell","I would say it\u2019s pretty similar.","Scott G. Heleniak","Okay.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Over the last couple of years is probably up a point or two.","Scott G. Heleniak","All right. And just a question on the recent move in commodity oil prices. Does that have any impact on your ability to utilize any of the tax credits that you have? Is there any impact on that at all?","J. Patrick Gallagher","No, there is no phase-out based on oil prices. There is a phase-out based on coal prices, but as oil comes down and price so does coal. So that actually helps us and we are a long ways away from a phase-out in coal prices.","Scott G. Heleniak","Okay, all right. Thanks a lot.","Douglas K. Howell","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","J. Paul Newsome","Good morning and congratulations on the quarter.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thank you, Paul.","J. Paul Newsome","My first question, are you seeing claim count increases in your risk management business on kind of a same-store basis or an account-by-account basis?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Yes, we are seeing same-stores or account-by-account up about 5%.","J. Paul Newsome","So given that it's mostly workers' comp, if I recall, that suggests that we would get a little bit increase in frequency of workers' comp?","J. Patrick Gallagher","I think we are seeing frequency and more employment, so it\u2019s not that our customers are less safe is that they have more employees.","J. Paul Newsome","Excellent. And then I wanted to ask a little bit of a devil's advocate question. So if we are indeed going into a environment where rate is pretty flat, why is that necessarily a good thing for a brokerage operation, which obviously makes \u2013 you know all of them make a lot of high margins when you could argue that much of what you provide is dealing with the volatility, the inherent volatility in insurance prices, which historically have been pretty volatile. And you needed a lot of help to make sure you were on top of what was happening in the market?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Well, first of all our clients need a lot of help no matter what the rate environment and which you had in the past historically you get these hard markets where all breaks loose, you can\u2019t get the insurance, it becomes a sellers market, it basically make every single one of your clients unbelievably angry and when the rates starts to settle down your loss business goes up.","In a flat rate environment you are not ticking off every single client, because prices are going crazy, you\u2019ve got a reasonable request for increases if in fact their losses have not been good, you can help cope with their loss situation and improve their pricing by reducing loss and you don\u2019t have somebody show up was a one-off broker with a 25% decrease in the cost of the program.","Now we are all in the level playing field, base costs were about the same that\u2019s why my comments are now becomes an expertise game. Who do you want to hire? You want to hire the Jones's agency down the street that has a really nice guys and plays golf with you on Saturday\u2019s, but really doesn\u2019t have any expertise or you want Arthur J. Gallagher that has latterly hundreds of capabilities behind us to help that client regardless of what their business is and regardless where they want to play in the world. Give me that opportunity without having a rate declines of any substance I will outsell my loss business and I will not have to factor in rate decreases and we will do extremely, extremely well.","J. Paul Newsome","Thanks for the answers guys. And congratulations in the quarter.","Douglas K. Howell","Thank you, Paul.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Joshua D. Shanker","Yes, I apologize for joining a little late, but given my notoriously byzantine questions, I can't imagine anyone has asked them yet. So the first question is; just thinking about acquisition pipeline for 2015 and your direct-to-capital ratio, is there any difference in how you think about paying for deals with cash whether it's cash on hand versus with debt issuance or paying with equity?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Yes, of course we always think about that and I think this year is that we're kind of targeting a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.5 X by the end of the year, our free cash flows it does leave us some more borrowing capacity towards the end of the year too, so but I don\u2019t see us issuing a lot of dent this year and I don\u2019t see us using a lot of stock this year, our pipeline is good right now, the multiples are reasonable out there, franchises that are coming up and for us to do 50, 60 deals again in 2015 at a nice revenue multiple like this year was $4 million I think on a size deal.","So it looks like that we can buy $200 million to $ 300 million of revenue with cash you know maybe just to smidge more debt by the end of the year and then obviously if the appetite is bigger than that we can use some of our shares, but right now when you can pick-up nice franchises in the six to seven multiple range I think that\u2019s a good opportunity for us. And like Pat said it bring some terrific resources to us, some great niche players that have some great, great niche \u2013 it will fit well in our niches, fit well with our products set that we all have some nice programs. There are some really nice opportunities out there right now.","Joshua D. Shanker","Okay and switching gears a little bit, looking at the investment income book gains line; do you happen to know the number for book gains?","Douglas K. Howell","Yes it\u2019s on page two, the book gains were 4.7 in the quarter.","Joshua D. Shanker","Okay so that\u2019s kind of what I guessed. And if I look at that and I look at last quarter the yield on fiduciary assets seems to be close to 2%, am I crazy or I mean that seems fantastic.","Douglas K. Howell","I can\u2019t speak to whether you are crazy or not, but I could probably do some math here while we are on the phone, let me work on that and see if I can get back to you. I think that we are seeing some \u2013 we do make some nice money on our fiduciary funds in Australia and New Zealand where yields are a little bit higher there that could be influencing a little bit, but let me see if I can do the math and get back to it. Now you did see the premium finance note on page 12, so if you take out - maybe that\u2019s what you are looking at. If you take out the investment income on our Premium Finance business maybe that will produce a different math for you.","Joshua D. Shanker","I think we did it, but we can get to play around with it.","Douglas K. Howell","Got it. Let me just look at it here while we're talking.","Joshua D. Shanker","That\u2019s it.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Great. Thanks Josh.","Douglas K. Howell","Thanks Josh.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] and the next question is from Ken Billingsley of Compass Point. Please go ahead.","Kenneth G. Billingsley","Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on adding more plants in 2015. can you talk about how the impact of regulatory changes and I guess until the last few weeks a more milder weather, the impact that its going to have on maybe the projections that you had initially set out for plant expansion and maybe what would create maybe a slowdown in those expansion plans.","Douglas K. Howell","Right, so first of all regulatory changes on the appetite for coal in the U.S. there is no new news and that the fact is that most of these plants run till 2021, it takes a long time to take a plant offline should a utility decide to do that but I just don\u2019t see a major disruption by utility because of regulatory changes taking any of our clean energy plants offline. If they were to do that and shutdown a utility, those plants are portable and they can be moved to another utility that hasn\u2019t been \u2013 hasn\u2019t shut themselves down on that.","So moving the plants around is an option, I don\u2019t see threats by displacement of substantial amounts for natural gas in a lot of our plants that we use and frankly when we sit there and pick plants you know we are talking about 33 machines with an opportunity of thousands of boilers at plants around the country. So most of the places that we put them in that we have a long-term view of the utilities appetite to continue to run the plants through 2021.","That said, we will get a plant from time-to-time that decides to shift to natural gas and we will take it down and we will move it, that\u2019s why we would rather own a portfolio of 33 of them than maybe own 40% or 50% of those versus own a 100% of 15, there are some nice diversification aspects of that. So I don\u2019t really see the risk that you highlighted there as being a reason why we wouldn\u2019t get more plants up in running in 2016.","Kenneth G. Billingsley","Okay and regarding the natural gas, are these alternatives that are in place using natural gas or is this the infrastructure that they have built out?","Douglas K. Howell","Most of them would have build out substantial infrastructure and that also just giving the gap to the plant in such volumes there are some plants there that \u2013 since it would have to have some pretty big pipes going across a long range in order to get natural gas into these plants. The rail lines are there, the coal has been coming in for decades.","So that\u2019s a big move by the utility plants, they would have to do a smaller plant that \u2013 its not that running that many tons, they might be able to pumping up gas and then they got to retrofit their burners, its not an easy thing for them to convert to gas and it takes a long time and we have proactive conversations with the utility managers on this. So we have insights into what they are going to be doing with their plant and we don\u2019t see big threats from that right now.","Kenneth G. Billingsley","And was it most of your plants that\u2019s a 33 there in place, coal is the primary, there is not another alternative already in place there now.","Douglas K. Howell","That\u2019s correct.","Kenneth G. Billingsley","Okay. Thank you.","End of Q&A","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thank you Ken. Thanks everybody for being with us this morning. I appreciate you being on the call and thanks for your questions. I think that its fair to say that we just finished with a incredible year and I couldn\u2019t be any prouder of the team in what we accomplished, we just accomplished an awful lot in 2014 and I\u2019m looking forward to continuing to our growth journey in 2015, so thanks for all of you being with us today and have a good rest of the day.","Operator","Thank you.

So let me add some color to these numbers, and then I'll start with mergers and acquisitions.","We did 4 transactions in the quarter, a little bit of a slowdown from the fourth quarter, which of course, is to be expected after the surge that we had in the fourth quarter of 2012. But I'll say, the reasons people join Gallagher have not changed one bit. We offer our partners a deep expertise across all disciplines and the ability to operate in a culture that is team-based, focused on servicing clients and selling, just the type of environment that allows us to have 1 plus 1 equal 3, 4, 5 opportunity for our merger partners. Our partners all have choices. As I do every quarter, I want to personally thank those who have joined us. We're honored to have you as part of our expanding team. Our pipeline is very robust, and we do expect to have a solid merger and acquisition year.","Let me turn to retail property\/casualty. The Council of Insurance Agents & Brokers survey reported that property\/casualty rates continue to climb. Average increases in the first quarter for all accounts were reported to be about 5.2%, and we are seeing carriers asking for similar levels of increases and even more in worker's compensation,  which in many states, is going to need substantially more rate to get back into a profitable position.","I'd remind you again, this is not a traditional hard market, but rather a continuation of carriers recognizing that in this environment, with no investment returns, they have to make money on underwriting. This is not a balance sheet-driven change. Carriers are very aware of loss cost inflation and know that increases in their rates are necessary. We're not seeing discipline weaken here. We continue to believe this is actually a better environment for our customers. All of us would rather help them work through 5% to 10% increases than have a huge leap in prices with significant cuts in coverage.","On the international side, our business had a strong quarter with organic growth approaching double digits. Our acquisitions are coming on board as expected, and as I've said before, the Heath platform is doing exactly what we hoped it would do. This has given us a great platform to continue to do acquisitions. Our international expansion is very exciting, and it's a bright spot for the company.","Our wholesale business was very strong in the first quarter. Submissions are increasing as the rate environment continues to firm. Our submissions are strong, and we are binding many of our quoted opportunities.","On the benefits front, we are running hard. The Affordable Health Care Act is keeping us busy with clients, prospects and mergers. In my opinion, many businesses in America are just waking up to the reality that this act is going in place in 2014 and frankly, they have failed to prepare. Regulations are being issued. We expect thousands of pages of regulations, and clients need to react and they need help. Our benefit merger and acquisition pipeline is particularly strong and growing as smaller brokers and consultants realize they need our expertise to help their clients deal with this new law.","Simply put, the smaller broker consultant cannot keep up. We have invested in software that helps our clients calculate the cost of changes and in training to help our professionals stay up-to-date and in a private exchange in partnership with liaison. This will help all of our clients with choice, and we know we'll see continued growth through 2013.","Our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett Services, had a fantastic quarter. We had adjusted organic revenue growth of 11%. Growth was strong in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Adjusted EBITDAC was up 13%. We're fully ramped up in South Australia, and new business is off to a good start globally. We just returned from the RIMS conference, where Gallagher Bassett rolled out our most updated version of our analytics workbench. This product allows our clients to use our RISX-FACS system to spot trends and analyze data in almost an unlimited array of reports customized at the click of a button, all focused on helping our clients get better and better at managing their cost of risk. We believe these upgrades put GB clearly at the forefront of data analytics in the property\/casualty risk management world.","So pulling it all together, our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments, adjusted revenue up 16%, coming in at $606 million; adjusted EBITDAC up 24%, coming in at $108 million; EPS, up 19% to $0.32; and margins improved over 100 basis points. If the economy holds up, if rates continue to trend up, I expect the rest of 2013 to be another outstanding year. Doug?","Douglas K. Howell","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. It's nice to be off to a good start, especially given that our first quarter is seasonally our smallest. Let's start on the first page with Brokerage segment. First is the Heath Lambert integration cost. We are still on track to wrap up the integration in the third quarter, so you'll see a couple of pennies of integration cost in the second quarter and then about $0.03 to $0.04 in the third quarter, most of which relates to the consolidation costs when we consolidate our London operations into new office space near Lloyd's. But then by the end of the third quarter, we'll be done with integrating Heath.","Moving slightly down to Risk Management. Recall last quarter, we broke out the start-up costs related to our new Australian client. This quarter, the team hit their start-up targets, so you'll see we received one-time fees to partially compensate for our ramp-up cost. That was good work by the team.","Moving to Page 2, our Brokerage segment. In the organic growth table, they had an excellent organic growth quarter, up 4.8%. We saw around 4% domestically and over 9%, internationally.","On the lower half of Page 2, you'll see tables for our comp and operating expenses. Please make sure you read the footnotes to those tables because there was some noise between the 2. The punchline is some of our 2012 U.K. acquisitions run lower comp ratios and higher expense ratios.","That said, regardless of the geography, when you turn to the top of Page 3, you'll see that we expanded EBITDAC margins by 130 basis points. We're really pleased with that expansion here in our first quarter.","Moving down to the middle of Page 3 to the Risk Management organic table. Gallagher Bassett, you heard Pat say, had a terrific quarter, up 11%. But even without our new Australian client coming online, to be up nearly 7% organically shows acceleration in that business, even in an economy that isn't seeing much employment growth.","Turning to the middle of Page 4, you'll see that we also expanded margins in our Risk Management segment. Recall that we are targeting about 16 points of margin, so to be above that is really good work by the team, while they continue to make investments into product enhancements and client service improvements.","All right. Let's move to the bottom of Page 4 to the shortcut table for the Corporate segment. In our last earnings call, in investor supplement, we forecasted a $0.04 to $0.07 loss for the first quarter. But we actually posted $0.02 of earnings. Two reasons explain the difference.","First, we were able to recognize about $0.02 more of tax credits than we had previously anticipated; and second, in late March, we closed a transaction that resulted in a onetime gain of about $0.05. We had not contemplated closing that transaction until later in the year. This gain arises because a co-investor lost their appetite for tax-advantaged investment, and we were opportunistic in repurchasing their share of the plants.","Next, turning to Page 5. You'll see that we've evolved our disclosure to make it tabular rather than a page of words. We hope this provides a more succinct way for you to quickly track the status as we roll out the plants. That table also provides annual aftertax earnings estimates, but realize those are ultimate estimates, and there are many reasons a plant might not run at ultimate levels. Accordingly, as you build your Corporate segment models, please be sure to use Page 14 of our investor supplement that we post on our website. That page provides our range of estimates for the rest of the year.","When you compare this quarter's Page 14 to what we posted last quarter, you'll note that there is movement between quarters, and we have narrowed our full year range. This results partly because of the earlier recognition of the gain that I just discussed and partly because we have received updated production estimates from our utility partners. The biggest difference in production estimates from last quarter relates to one utility that is using a few of our plants. They unintentionally purchased some lower grade coal that causes some inefficiencies in their boilers. So their production estimates have come down. The silver lining is they have decoded the issue, and they believe they could be back, burning the better coal later in the year.","That said, when you really look closely at that table, we remain optimistic that here in 2013, we can generate more than double the amount of cash we made in 2012, which we will, in turn, use to help fund our M&A program.","As for capital management, you'll see at the bottom of Page 4 of our earnings release that we have committed to another $200 million of debt, and we expect to close that here in June. So we are well positioned to favor cash and debt to fund future acquisitions. But don't forget, if M&A activity is near last year's levels or if some transactions are structured as a tax-free exchange, then we will be back to using some shares.","So those are my comments. It's nice to kick off the year with a really good quarter. Back to you, Pat.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thank you,, Doug. Melissa, we're ready for questions if you want to open it up.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.","Eric J. Fraser - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's actually Eric Fraser for Mike. First question is on the debt and the M&A pipeline. I mean do you have extra deals lined up? Are these -- are you targeting more deals in the U.S. versus the U.K.? And do you have a preference for benefits brokers or kind of straight P&C retail commercial brokers?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Well, Mike, the answer to that's all of the above. We have an appetite for benefits brokers, not a greater appetite than property\/casualty, but there's more opportunity there. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're seeing that the smaller consultants and broker in the United States is recognizing that they really do need some help with this new act. And if they've got clients, literally, over 150 life cases, they're going to need help from someone like ourselves. And so that pipeline remains very robust. As you know, of the 60 acquisitions we did last year, 30 of them were in the benefit space. Not all of them very sizable; we're very happy to pick up $2 million, $3 million, $4 million agencies as we go along. That remains very robust. We have a very, very strong appetite for good partners in the United States. If you look at our investor slides at our website, you'll see 2 slides that we use frequently, one that shows where we are located in the United States and another that shows population centers over 100,000 where we're not. And we covet those locations across the U.S. And then globally, we're very active. We've been active, as you know, in the U.K. We've got good activity there. We've been active in Australia. We've been active in Latin America and in the Caribbean, and those pipelines remain very, very strong. So all in all, we think we're in a pretty unique position as an acquirer. We're most interested in the people that will join us. It's not geography -- it's not geographically-driven. We like to be able to add to some of the services and niches that we know that we're strong in. And it really comes down to the culture and the people. So it's hard to predict when they're going to hit. They are individual transactions that occur along the way, but we think we're going to have a very good year.","Eric J. Fraser - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So you're confident you're going to be able to put that cash to work?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Yes.","Eric J. Fraser - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. One follow-up on the Risk Management section. I guess you know, organic growth's a bit higher than it's been in a while. Curious if you can also talk about -- you mentioned the impact of a lost client last quarter. And what's the outlook for being able to continue to run at a margin that's above your target?","Douglas K. Howell","Well, Gallagher Bassett, yes, last quarter, we mentioned that we did lose one client, and that was why we were a little bit lower on organic. And that's why we said we thought that 2013 would look a little bit more like 2012. And it's turning out to be that way, to be at 7% organically. The new client is the Australian, one of the WorkCover schemes there that we've picked up. That's a sizable client. I've said that we think that will add about $5 million of revenue per quarter, above the -- that whatever you pick for an organic number. So we think that they're very well positioned for growth this year.","Eric J. Fraser - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And just in terms of the margin, this being above -- can you run sustainably at above 16 for the rest of the year?","Douglas K. Howell","We'll have to take a look at that. We've asked the team to hit at least 16 for the year, and I think they'll be able to do that easily. How much above 16? That all comes down to how much more we want to invest in product enhancements and client-service improvement. These are -- this is a very well-organized process. And if it looks like our margins are moving up, we will make some more investments.","J. Patrick Gallagher","And Eric, this is Pat. This is a different business than the Brokerage business. Claims show up every day. You better have people there to handle them. This is not a business that's going to show great margin expansion. As we grow top line, that means there's big-time claims coming in behind.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just wanted to get a couple of clarifying items. One is on the coal division. Doug, I think you mentioned that there was one person that opted out. Can you give us some color, I mean what's their view of the world versus your view of the world for the outlook in coal, and then maybe a bit about how the accounting works that you guys got the $5 million gain?","Douglas K. Howell","Yes. One of our co-investors, for internal reasons, decided that they no longer had an appetite for tax credits. So they decided -- it had nothing to do with our plants or what we're doing. It's just they don't want tax credits anymore. So that's -- they chose to exit their investment. So I think that when you account -- so we were opportunistic in buying that back. And when you buy that back, there's a step-up in basis with respect to your -- our ownership interest piece. So what you do is you just run some of a fair valuation going forward. You present value that back at a steep discount, and then you look at how that -- how the enterprise looks as a total fair value, and then you step up your old historical basis to that. And that's what created the gain.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just to clarify, their appetite for tax credits, what was precipitating there? I assume at one point, they went into this and said, \"This is a great thing,\" and then now it's not. And you, obviously, were able to get a good price out of them because of the gain. I mean what...","Douglas K. Howell","I'm speculating here, but usually when somebody loses their appetite for tax credits, it's 2 reasons: The internal sponsor is no longer with the company, that happens; or they are no longer in a position, tax wise, where they need the tax credit.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then last, is there -- are there any other kind of partners out there? What's sort of the -- what's your visibility with regards to others that might go this way? Because it sounds like you guys basically have a right to call or...","Douglas K. Howell","No, we haven't played out -- we actually don't have a right to call. Our other partners actually would love to buy this, these portions of our plants from us.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So you guys stepped into the breach and just took them out of it. Okay.","Douglas K. Howell","Yes, there was no breach. They just chose to exit. We just -- listen, they just lost their appetite. That's what it is.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Perfect, great. Okay. Just totally shifting gears, and this is a small thing. But the share count, for some reason, I seem to recall that you guys are, obviously, issuing debt. You actually did well on the free cash line relative to historical seasonality in the first quarter. Is share count going to still be going up from here? I seem to -- thought that maybe share creep wasn't going to be occurring anymore just because you're going to use all your cash to buy businesses?","Douglas K. Howell","Yes. We did not use shares in acquisitions, but just the natural increase that happens when the stock price moves from in the 30s to the 40s, you get more dilution on outstanding shares. So when you look at the treasury stock method of accounting for outstanding shares and then you have option exercises, you will have some creep in the shares that go up. So that's what you're seeing this quarter. So it's really purely related to options. Then we also have a small employee stock purchase plan that we issue shares to, but that's not the lion's share of it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ray Iardella with Macquarie.","Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research","Maybe touching on the M&A topic a little bit differently. Maybe Pat, could you talk about sort of the appetite of Gallagher, sort of reentering the reinsurance Brokerage business in any material way?","J. Patrick Gallagher","No, we don't really have much of an appetite for that, Ray. You're not going to see us go back into big-time competition with Guy Carpenter, Aon, Re Willis. We do reinsurance and always have even when we exited the heavy treaty stuff. We've always been supportive of our cap, do with [ph] reinsurance, the pools that we do and the programs that we run in London. So we have reinsurance expertise, but you won't see us reformulating Gallagher Re.","Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe, Doug, numbers question. I mean just thinking about or setting the bar in terms of acquired revenue for the rest of the year, is there any way you can quantify sort of -- no acquisitions were to happen the rest of the year, what the impact might be on the rest of the year's revenues?","Douglas K. Howell","Well, we have such a great carryover from last year from the acquisitions that we did on '13, so I don't think there would be much, much difference in our growth in revenues for this year because just because we closed so many deals in the fourth quarter last year, so this year is pretty good. The impact of next year is easy to quantify. I mean we just pick -- how much do you think we're going to do for the year, and then most of that will hit the second half this year or into next year. So the actual impact of acquisition rollover, I think that it will still put us into double-digit growth easily for the rest of this year.","Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research","Okay. And maybe just talk about strategy and how the state exchanges will work on the Retail side and more specifically, I guess, how can Gallagher generate revenue for potential business that might go into the state exchange? I know it's not a big piece of your employee benefits business, but any thought there could help us out a lot.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Sure, I'll touch on it, and we have Jim Durkin in the room. If I want to throw you the ball, maybe hear Jim as well. But the exchanges are still up in the air. Some states are forming them on their own. Some are relying on the federal government. There are private exchanges, as we've done, being created. Rules are being promulgated. It was originally going to be a matter of choice, now the Feds are saying it looks like it will be one set of choices. You're going to have clients that take a look at what we refer to as total rewards. So when you get over 100, 150 lives in a group, it's not just about health insurance. You've got to take a look at everything you're doing to compensate and maintain the relationship you have with your employee base. And let's face it, we always talk -- all of us in most businesses talk about the fact that there's a war for talent. Every single day, we get paid for the people we put on the playing field. And so we have to make sure that we do a good job of compensating them, rewarding them and covering them with health insurance. And our clients have the same problems. So the exchanges, I think, will probably suck most of the business from the smaller end of the group business. We think the 40, 50 life case tends to go that direction, maybe all the way up to 100 lives. When you get over that, we do see the employer maintaining a very active involvement in making sure that the health care cover for the clients are maintained in a way that reflects their total view of compensation. Jim, do you want to add anything to that?","James W. Durkin","Only thing I would add is that there's been a strong indication by many of the state exchanges of willingness to pay commissions to brokers. They see the value. They understand that brokers will help them. And so those brokers that, for their customers that might be using those state exchange, there is an opportunity to get a commission. And then I guess, lastly, remember our model is to provide advice, consulting services. And we're going to get paid for the work we do. So if we help a customer who makes a decision to move to a state exchange, that's not a onetime decision. They have to look at that each year, and we're going to be there to help them do that. Plus there are ancillary products that we'll continue to be involved in: the life, the disability, retirement. So there are opportunities to continue the revenue stream.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Brian DiRubbio with Yield Capital.","Brian DiRubbio - Y\/Cap Management, LLC","I've got 2, 3 questions. First one, Pat, could you give us any color on what the organic growth of the acquired revenue would have been if it was sort of there for the full year? Because you're acquiring the revenue, so to give a number of what it did in the last 12 months, but that revenue is obviously doing better also. Can you give a sense how well that's growing?","J. Patrick Gallagher","About the same as our general book, Brian.","Brian DiRubbio - Y\/Cap Management, LLC","Okay. And for Risk Management, 2 questions there. Can you give us a breakdown of the organic growth rate versus change in claim counts?","J. Patrick Gallagher","I'll throw that to Scott.","Scott R. Hudson","The -- on the rate itself, you're talking about the fee increase. We're probably -- we're still seeing a little bit of growth. It's probably just around 2%. And then the claim count growth, would account for the remainder of it. So it's still not -- it's very competitive, pricing wise. So it's not much above 2%. It changes a little bit, too, for our larger clients where it's even more competitive, so that may drop as low as 1% to 1.5%.","Brian DiRubbio - Y\/Cap Management, LLC","But you are seeing claim counts increasing?","Scott R. Hudson","Claim counts are increasing. Combination of -- if you were to break the claim count growth down in 2 ways, too, it's -- from our existing book of business, it's around probably 1.5% to 2%. And then the remainder of the growth on claim counts comes from new business.","Brian DiRubbio - Y\/Cap Management, LLC","Great. And then just the final question on there. Are you seeing any signs of customers moving to self-insurance given the rate increases we've been seeing over the last 12 months?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Yes, that's a really strong point, Brian. Thank you for bringing that up. I mean that's one -- this is our core expertise. What builds our company is our ability to take clients that are in the traditional market and help them mitigate rate increases by assuming certain portions of risk themselves, by bringing Gallagher Bassett in with higher retentions and having them pay the claims in various forms of self-funding. As a public entity, that might be a risk-sharing pool. In a state, that may be a group captive -- funded and founded in our Artex operation. It may be just a state worker's compensation program going to self-insurance. But that is always a big driver. Now that also, Brian, mitigates our commission growth to a degree. So you'd be looking at these 5% and 6% rate increases across the board and wondering why Gallagher is benefiting to the tune of only 1 percentage point. Well, our job is to mitigate that for our clients. And one key way that we do that is help them enter what we refer to as the alternative market.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens Inc.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Two questions. One on margin. Doug, you had sort of given as a rule of thumb about margin growth relative to organic growth. Any changes to that based on what we've seen again this quarter? It seems margin expansion, at least, relative for what we expected, is better than we thought.","Douglas K. Howell","Yes. I think that the old rule of thumb was that we needed 3% organic growth in the Brokerage segment showing margin. We did 4.8% this quarter, and we dropped 130 basis points out of that into the margin. I would say that growth above 3%, you could see kind of 1\/3 of that going to the margin line. I think if you get down to 1% or 2%, we are seeing some inflationary pressures in certain lines. We talked a lot about it at the last call that we had salary inflation. We've had a little bit of pension inflation. We've had some medical inflation. The control of our headcount has helped control some of that, but there are other inflationary pressures in our expense line. But by and large, we think that we're well positioned this year, that even with the organic growth above 1% or 2%, we should see some margin expansion.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then Pat, I think this is more of a question for you. Can you just comment a little bit on particular verticals in the U.S. that were good or bad? And then maybe also client sizes, if you see any changes in the organic growth in those and then maybe also geography? Just is there anything notable maybe among those 3 parameters in the U.S. business organic growth?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Yes. But we continue to be very, very strong in a number of the verticals that we talk about. So higher education, religious and not-for-profit, construction, real estate, we're all -- and hospitality, all had very good starts to the year. We follow that across other lines, such as directors and officers and professional liability lines. That was a good start for us for the year. So the verticals are doing well for us, and those are our primary ones. I mean public entity, we are very, very strong, as I said, higher ed, construction, real estate, hospitality and what have you. All of those are off to a very good start. I don't have any of the verticals that we report on that I would say are lagging. We're not seeing a decrease in rate across any of those. We're not seeing a lack of appetite by underwriters in any of those. So we continue to be very focused on that, and get stronger in those verticals every single quarter. In terms of geography, I think the Midwest seems to be probably strongest in rate. The West Coast seems to probably be weakest. But when I say weakest, you're probably seeing 90% plus of your accounts in the Midwest and in the East receive some form of rate increase. It's probably closer to 70% in the West Coast, and I really don't know why that is. And that doesn't tend to break much by size. We're seeing pretty good discipline in the underwriting community across most sizes. Yes, if you're a real large account taking a good portion of the risk yourself, you're probably going to be able to mitigate these increases a little better than that commercial middle-market account in the Midwest. But by and large, the increases are kind of across-the-board with one exception being the strongest, which is worker's compensation. The carriers really do recognize that they've got significant problems in that line. And they are taking remedial action. We're seeing rate increases there approaching 10%, pretty much across the country. So I want to make sure, Brett, did I answer your question?","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division",". That's great. That's exactly what I needed.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Leikhim with William Blair.","Chris Leikhim","Just 2 quick questions for you guys. Doug, I just wanted to touch on contingent supplementals quickly. It looked like they were up modestly for the quarter, but on an organic basis, they're pretty flat. Any guidance for the rest of the year? Do you expect that trend to continue?","Douglas K. Howell","I think that organically flat to maybe a touch up for the rest of the year. And then we -- when it comes to our acquisitions, we generally get most of that in the first quarter because they're more contingent-based and supplemental, so I would say flat to slightly up from last year.","Chris Leikhim","Okay, great. And then just wanted to dig into the Brokerage segment a little bit on the organic side. I know from the Spring Meeting that you guys highlighted wholesale and benefits division were doing pretty well. And I might imagine maybe mid to upper single-digit organic. Is there anything going on in sort of the core domestic P&C Brokerage business that might be a little bit less, or are they all sort of running around that 5% range?","J. Patrick Gallagher","No, the PC U.S. domestic business is running a little less than that.","Douglas K. Howell","It's a little tough to judge in our first quarter. I know it's comparatively the same size, but in our first quarter, you can get some -- one person moving from -- or one client moving from the traditional market into the alternative market can have an impact on our organic just because it's so small.","J. Patrick Gallagher","But benefits are really solid. Benefits are solid. And then our domestic wholesaling is solid also. It's -- we're seeing nice growth from those also.","Chris Leikhim","Great. And then just one number. Do you have the end of period share count by any chance?","Douglas K. Howell","Yes, I think it's at the, on the very last page of the press release. Let me pull that out for you. I think it's a -- outstanding shares are 127 -- or 126.2. I think I have that right.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Arash Soleimani with KBW.","Arash Soleimani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question on coal. So once we're at -- fast forward to 2019, 2021, when the tax credits expire. Obviously, Gallagher then has the interest in these plants. Do they -- are you kind of on the hook for the disposal costs at that point, or what's the process there?","Douglas K. Howell","Yes, the answer to that is twofold. If they convert, which we hope they do, to pure mercury control at that time, which is the reason why they're doing it in the first place is because of environmental control, but those plants would continue to be used. If they decide that they no longer want to use it at that point, there would be a demolition and disposal, but these are pretty small. You need to realize that, if you recall from any of our presentations, most of these plants are about the size of a semi tractor-trailer, so there's not a ton of machinery to dispose of at that time. So and there's -- so it's not a big cost at all for us.","Arash Soleimani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And when you say that, you just mean the utility partners or...","J. Patrick Gallagher","Say your question again?","Arash Soleimani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","When you said, if they're still interested in running, did you mean the utility partners?","Douglas K. Howell","Yes, the host utility at that point -- if you believe that the MATS standards, mercury control standards come in, in 2016, they will have to replace our system with some other type of mercury control system or continue to use our system. If they continue to use our system, there would be no disposal with respect to these plants. We would work on a royalty at that time, and without the benefit of the tax credits. But that's the objective is to commercialize as many of these locations using the Chem-Mod Solution, so that there is an aftertax credit life that continues to generate royalty income for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Hughes with SunTrust.","Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","The better growth in international, how much of that is a function of the strength in those operations? Are the markets stronger, or now that you have them in hand for some time, you've been able to improve and so it's more of an internal improvement? I don't know if you can make that distinction.","J. Patrick Gallagher","I think I can make that distinction. I think in Australia, you have a very strong economy. And that's helping with economic growth and with just the increase in premium income in the environment, plus we are doing a fantastic job in Australia on new business. Our team is very strong in Perth, Sydney, and I'm talking on the PC side now. That's been a very, very strong bright spot for us. I can't say enough about what the acquisitions have done for us in the U.K. in terms of positioning us for great organic growth there, the Heath acquisition in particular. But as you know, we did 4 additional mergers in that space over the past year. We look to have another 1 probably done -- soon in the U.K. as well. And those are all very additive to the effort. The economy in the U.K., when you get outside of London, is not very good. It's probably better than the European continent, which we have virtually no exposure to. But what's happening is the folks we've brought on are just doing an outstanding job of generating new business and new opportunities.","Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Do you have a particular focus on expanding into other countries? Is that a priority, or is it going to be just -- as the opportunities emerge?","J. Patrick Gallagher","It's both. I think as you saw with the move we made in the fourth quarter with our partners in Latin America, we're excited to now have a platform on Mexico with the Casanueva family that we own 21% of that business, and we'll continue to expand through Latin America. We have a very good appetite for continued acquisition activity in the U.K. and in Australia. As you know, we completed the 80% purchase of CGM in the Caribbean, so we feel pretty good about that. And if there were places in the Caribbean that we could do bolt-ons and roll-ins, we'd do that. So it's both. It's geographically focused. We like Canada. We like the U.K. But it is also opportunistic in that the fact we're trading in over 100 countries with independent brokers in our Gallagher Global Alliance. As those families and partners decide that they'd like to take some equity off the table, we're opportunistically looking at that.","Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And one final question in the Risk Management business, the underlying claims increases of 1.5% to 2%. Could you give us a little context for how does that look now versus what you were seeing a year ago versus 3 or 4 years ago? Any cyclical commentary on that number?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Yes. That number is a direct proxy for the economy. You go back to '08 and we are humming with that number. And clients were doing 3 shifts and things were wonderful. Crash in '09 comes, and claim counts fell off the table. And they're making their way back slowly. But 1.5% to 1% is going to be a bit of a proxy for what you're seeing in the U.S. economy.","Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Right. So that's not necessarily some separate frequency cycle on worker's comp. That's more influenced by the economic activity?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Correct.","Douglas K. Howell","Yes, nod yes [ph] .","J. Patrick Gallagher","Great. I think that's our last question. Melissa, anybody else on the line?","Operator","No, that was our final question, sir.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Just make a closing couple of remarks here. Thanks again, everyone, for being with us this morning. We appreciate it. Obviously, we're excited about our franchise. We just have had a great quarter. There's no doubt that every single quarter, and every single month, we're adding to the tools that we provide for our clients to help them deal with their areas of risks. Just as importantly, it's abundantly clear to the people at this table, that our commitment to our culture and to selling is as strong as ever. In addition, you might have noticed that on March 6, the Ethisphere Institute announced that Arthur J. Gallagher & Company, for the second year in a row, was recognized as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies. And we're very, very proud of that. We're excited about the start of the year, and we're looking forward to the rest of 2013. We really do believe we're just getting started. So thanks for being with us.","Operator","Thank you.

Gallagher & Company. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.","Patrick Gallagher","Thank you, Jeremy. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions.","As we do each quarter, today Doug I\u2019m going to touch on the four key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value. Those are number one, organic growth. Number two, growing through mergers and acquisitions, three, improving our productivity and quality. And number four, maintaining our unique culture. The team delivered on all four of our operating priorities to begin the year, resulting in a great first quarter.","Let me give you some highlights. Our core brokerage and risk management segments combined to deliver 14% growth in revenue, 5.5% all in organic growth, and adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 75 basis points. We also completed 11 tuck-in mergers during the quarter, and culture was recognized again by the Ethisphere Institute, as one of the world\u2019s most ethical companies. I couldn't be prouder of the team, just a great performer.","My comments today will be focused on revenue growth, insurance pricing, our dynamic culture. Doug will go into greater detail on productivity quality, clean energy and capital management.","So let me start with our brokerage segment. First quarter all in organic growth was 5.7%, including base commission and fee growth pushing 5% and strong contingent and supplemental revenue growth.","Organic was solid across all of our divisions globally. Let me give you some more detail. In the US, a retail brokerage operation generated around 6% organic in the first quarter, with benefits a bit lower, PC a bit higher.","Domestic retail PC pricing was positive across all our major lines of business except for workers compensation. For example, property and commercial auto pricing were up over 5% and casualty and specialty lines were up a couple of points. Within our domestic wholesale PC business, organic was about 4% and relative to retail pricing a similar stronger across most lines of business.","Moving to the UK, our organic was around 5% in the quarter with retail a bit lower and wholesale a bit higher. Our retail PC pricing in the UK is up 3% on average with professional liability pricing up over 5% and most of the lines up a point or two.","The UK retail - I'm sorry the UK specialty market is seeing rates up 5% on average and pricing on catastrophe exposed classes is up over 10%.","Next, in Australia and New Zealand, organic was about 8%. Rates there continue to trend in the mid single digits across most lines. In total, I would characterize the market very similar to recent quarters, but we do see rate trending just a little higher than we saw in the fourth quarter of 2018. As we look forward 2019 brokerage base commission and fee organic feels like it will be around 5%.","Next let me talk about brokerage, merger and acquisition growth. In the quarter we completed 11 brokerage acquisitions at fair prices, which should add about $70 million of annualized revenue"," So far in the second quarter we have completed three brokerage mergers, including Stackhouse Poland with estimated annual revenues of almost $80 million. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals.","Looking forward, our merger and acquisition pipeline is very full. In addition to the previously announced JLT aerospace acquisition that we hope to close late in the second quarter, our pipeline has around $350 million of revenues associated with about 60 term sheets either agreed upon or being prepared. Well we won't close all these mergers. We continue to be the partner of choice for brokers that are excited about our capabilities, align with our unique culture and realize that we can be more successful together.","Next, let me move to our risk management segment, which is primarily Gallagher Bassett. First quarter organic growth was a solid 4.1 % with no significant variance between domestic and international operations. We recently announced our new GP Specialty Division which is focused on the resolution of complex claims in construction, health care, transportation and products liability. This has been an area of growth for Gallagher Bassett and the new GB specialty team will be showcased at the Annual RIMS Conference in Boston next week.","Also on Display RIMS will be our new Treatment Equality Index and our smart claim benchmarking methodology. Two recent examples of innovations that GB is utilizing to drive superior claim outcomes for our clients.","And finally, I'll touch on what really makes our company unique and that's our culture. It's a culture that emphasizes doing things the right way for the right reasons with the right people. Just last month Gallagher was recognized by the at the Ethisphere Institute as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies, an award that underscores our commitment to ethical business standards and practices.","This is our eighth year in a row receiving the award, an accomplishment less than 40 companies globally can claim and we were once again the sole insurance broker recognized.","This distinction is a direct reflection of our 30,000 plus colleagues united, working as a team, grounded in the Gallagher way every day, all of our people get up and work diligently to maintain our culture, to promote our culture and deliver our culture.","Okay, an excellent quarter on all measures. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?","Douglas Howell","Thanks, Pat. And good afternoon, everyone. As Pat said, another really excellent quarter of top end line results and a strong way to start off 2019. Today I'll make a few comments referencing the earnings release. I'll then move to the CFO commentary document we post on our website and I'll wrap up with some comments on cash and M&A.","Okay, let's turn to page two of the earnings release to the brokerage segment. You'll see that we posted $1.45 of adjusted earnings per share. As you compare our results to your models, looks like there are about 3 puts and takes compared to consensus. First, it looks like contingents came in better than most of you thought. Call it an additional $8 million or about $0.02 after incentive compensation and taxes.","However there are two offsetting items. First, it looks like your picks for M&A roll over revenues were above our March 12 guidance by about $8 million or $9 million. And second, non-controlling interest tax were lower than our March 12th guidance by about $2 million to $3 million, combined that $10 million to $2 million or about $0.03 after expenses and taxes is going the other way. So net, net these items about offset, bringing us back to about a $1.45 of EPS or even $1.46.","One last comment on page two of the earnings release, only one significant non-GAAP adjustment this quarter, a one time $0.17 net gain from divesting of some smaller brokerage operations in the first quarter.","It's a bit of old news given we discussed the largest one during our January earnings release and conference call. But you can see it there now. Otherwise a very clean quarter.","Next. Let's turn to page three of the earnings release to the brokerage segment organic table at the top of the page and then go down a little bit to the contingent revenue section. That's where you'll see contingents being organically up $8 million in the first quarter, as I just mentioned.","About half of that rises because 20 develop more favorably than previously estimated. The other half is due to new agreements and a slightly more bullish outlook for 2019 based on our view of premium growth and rate increases.","But remember that new GAAP accounting requires us to estimate these amounts many times a year or so before we receive them. So it does create a lot of estimation risk. Loss ratios look decent now. But if those deteriorate over the year contingents might not develop as we currently expect.","Next, let's turn to page 4 to the brokerage EBITDAC margin table in the middle of the page. Terrific margin expansion this quarter, up by 61 basis points, actually would have been even better given a stronger contingent commissions, but offsetting that is the role in impact of M&A which did compress margin expansion by about 60 basis points.","The dilutive impact of mergers on our first quarter may actually happen annually, with first quarter now seasonally our largest, you'll see margins are over 35 %. And then they drop into the mid 20s in later quarters you can see that in last year's numbers.","Very few of our merger partners have that type of seasonality, especially in our P&C mergers. Nor do they run annual margins at high. So most of them will naturally be dilutive to margin in the first quarter, but wouldn't have that impact on a full year basis.","In the end stronger contingent revenues offset by M&A roll in margins about wash. So being up 61 basis points feels about right when posting base organic growth of about 5%.","Still on page four and moving to the risk management segment, organic growth table at the bottom of the page. You'll see that we posted 4.1% organic growth, that feels right for the full year. However, we see a little lumpy. We see more like 2% in the second quarter because of a difficult comparison to last year second quarter when we posted over 10% organic. So again, it will be a little lumpy quarter to quarter, but somewhere around 4% to 5% for the year.","Turning to Page 5 to the adjusted margin table at the bottom of the page. 17 points of margin, that's up over 60 basis points and right at the lower end of our 17% to 17.5% range for the full year. We still feel that - that range seems about right for an entire year.","Turning to Page 6 to the corporate segment tables. Interest and banking line and the acquisition line right in line with the guidance we provided at our March 12 IRR day. Clean energy actually came in a little better than we thought at that time, mostly due to better production in the last half of March than we saw in the first half of the month.","And finally to the corporate line, with tax reform settling down, we have collapsed the line we previously called impact of U.S. tax reform into the corporate line. During our march IRR day, we forecasted those two lines would combine to a $14 million after tax loss.","You can see we came in about four $4 million better. But much of that is timing of a couple tax related items. So when you get to the CFO commentary document our full year 2019 forecasts for this corporate line hasn't changed that much.","So let's go and shift to the CFO commentary document, that can be found in our IR website, to page 2. You'll see that most of the first quarter items were in line with our March 12th forecast. And looking forward foreign exchange, integration and amortization are fairly straightforward.","Then when you get to page 5, that's where we provide our estimate for rollover revenues from M&A. As I mentioned before, please take an extra few minutes to tighten up your models for your role in the revenue picks.","And finally cash and M&A. At March 31 we have around $700 million of available cash on our balance sheet, about $350 million was used in early April to close on the Stackhouse merger leaving $350 million of free cash.","That plus expected free cash for the remainder of the year and maybe some more debt to bring our full M&A capacity to around $1.5 billion before using a stock. So those are my comments. A truly excellent quarter and we're in terrific position for another successful year. Back to you, Pat.","Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Doug. Jeremy I think we can go to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, thanks. My first question going back to just the organic guide for the year, you guys would say about 5%. So was that guide all in or is that the 4 the impact of contingent and supplementals and I guess as part of that answer I believe it - you're March investor day you guys had said that the Q1 is seasonally weaker on organic. Is that still the case? Would you expect the remaining three quarters to be above the first quarter? And is that a comment both before and after considering contingency supplementals?","Douglas Howell","All right. A lot of questions there, and I'll jump in on that, and Pat wants to add again. I think that when it comes to the base contingents \u2013 excuse me, base commissions and fees, somewhere in the 4.5% to 5% range \u2013 5.5% range seems about right, right now.","When it comes to contingents and supplementals, the positive development we have from last year and then our board - a little bit more bullish outlook here in the first quarter. I would hope that would continue for the rest of the year or that all stack up maybe a brokerage total organic between 5% and 6 %. Does that help?","Elyse Greenspan","Yes. And then in terms of the margin guide, so or maybe just some color going forward. So 60 basis points this quarter and then you did point to a negative impact from some of the recent deals that you've done which I would assume should benefit margins during the out quarter. So can you give us a sense of just the type of margin improvement we should expect to see just given if organic remains in line, kind of that 5%, 5.5% range. What kind of margin improvement we could see in brokerage?","Douglas Howell","I think that - I guess, that I think that for the full year if we post between 5% and 6%, maybe the full year will come in at 50 basis points of margin expansion for the full year, not gets a little - a little harder later in the year when raises go in.","As for the impact of M&A it's mostly pronounced in the first quarter, in this case the acquisitions that are rolling in right now don't have big seasonality in them, like we have last year in the third quarter.","So we \u2013 so because we posted nearly 36 points of margin this quarter, the impact will be more dramatic in the first quarter, when you get to the second third quarter maybe it's 10 basis points something like that.","Elyse Greenspan","10 basis points negative or positive?","Douglas Howell","It should be a little positive in those quarters.","Elyse Greenspan","Thanks. And then my last question on, in the U.K. a couple of things going on, we've had on - some of the wholesale and the other reviews going on have kind of been settled and I know in the past I felt like you guys insinuated that, however those are views on kind of shook out that this could be an opportunity for Gallagher to take advantage.","And so could you comment on what's going on over there. And then also there has been a sizable deal by one of your peers. And I would think if there is any kind of shake out that maybe you guys could benefit is in the U.K. or other area. So you're seeing that impact your U.K. opportunities as well?","Patrick Gallagher","I mean, start with the TLT aerospace. That was a great opportunity. That came to us because of the EU and the competitors getting [Technical Difficulty] so, yes I think there's going to be great opportunities frankly globally and we just will take them one at a time, we'll take a look at them and we'll be cautious that will not just be London focused by any means.","IN terms of London market and how we trade, we are confident from the beginning that the way the wholesale business was run and managed was going to come through a review and its just fine. And that's in fact what happened.","So what you're going to see is business as usual, but it does get more costly to operate in London, regulatory pressure is greater and greater. And that gives us opportunities on the M&A side in the team recruiting side. So really Gallagher's in a very good spot in London around the UK and globally to take advantage of some of the dislocation.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, that's great. Thanks so much. I appreciate the color.","Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Elyse.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Zaremski","Hey, good evening. First question is on probably Pat on the pricing commentary. Any thoughts on what the impetus of why pricing is increasing. Do you think it has momentum and maybe also any bifurcation in pricing between small, middle or large accounts?","Patrick Gallagher","So if you take a look at our results and this is I've said this probably almost every quarter. Typically we've said rate and exposures contributed something like 1% of our organic growth. In this quarter it was probably closer to 2%.","So when you hear my commentary on the rates around the world don't take them to mean that we're facing a firming hard market. There's offsets to that, when DNO goes up, workers compensation is likely to go down. If you look at the last probably 11 or 12 years and you look at a graphic of what's happened to PC rates they'll go up two, they'll come down three, they'll go up four, the high flat [ph].","That is a really good market for us. I grew up in an environment where every 10 years there was total dislocation, rates were jumping 50% to 70 %. Insurance was a complete seller's market and clients were really unhappy. The market would then start to soften and anybody that had a license could beat you on a price sometimes very substantially just by getting to a market that nobody thought even had appetite.","So with a market like this our skill set really makes a difference. No one out there can just run to X Y Z company get this crazy low vote. I mean it does happen from time to time, but it's just not a general rule.","So when we're working in the 2%, 5%, 3% up, 4 % down environment, then the skill set makes all the difference in preparing the risk management approach for the client. So this is really a good environment. A little firmer and that's really what I wanted my remarks to say, that don't go out and say wow we're going into a hard market, a little firmer. And I think that's probably justified by cat losses and by some capacity shrinkage in particular in the London market and by other discipline underwriters, you saw Traveller's results, I mean, those guys are - they're smart they're smart underwriters.","Mike Zaremski","That's helpful. Maybe for Doug, the restructuring initiatives you took last year or some of the charges. Is there kind of a rule of thumb on a payoff for those and just \u201919, I don't know if there's a go, is it a one for one or 50% payoff you get in the subsequent year?","Douglas Howell","I think that in terms of what we did for the - for some of the headcount reductions that we took last year, we actually reinvested that into data and marketing, in some of our system need, including cyber.","So the actual payback on the displacements directly was pretty high. The payback came probably within about nine months, but we turned around and reinvested that at into our data initiatives, which are really taking off well. I think that you're seeing it, we've got another service center that's really paying benefits there. So we reinvest it but the payback on that actual take out was pretty fast.","Mike Zaremski","Okay. Got it. IF I could just sneak one last one, just curious maybe it's too early, but as you know if the intern class which is \u201819 or is growing versus last year?","Douglas Howell","Yes, that\u2019s going to grow a bit. I mean, we're kind of getting to the stretch point at 450 young people coming into learn about our business, but it'll be up a skosh.","Mike Zaremski","Thank you very much.","Douglas Howell","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.","Ryan Tunis","Good evening, guys. First I had a couple for Doug on [indiscernible] contingence. First of all should we think about, I mean the upside it's being driven I think you should 8 mil [ph] Is that pretty much 100% margin or is there a cost associated with that variance?","Douglas Howell","First answer that is typically the contingent commission line is what helps fuel the incentive compensation for field leadership. So I would not say it's 100%. It's probably more in the 60% range that would hit the bottom line.","Ryan Tunis","Okay. And then I was a little bit - I think a malicious [ph] question, Doug it sounded like you thought that there might be a possibility for more dis-favor with development over the remainder of the year. Could you just give me some idea of what exactly was driving that in Q1 and what potentially could make that continue to be out of this in the coming quarters?","Douglas Howell","Yes I think that I understand it. I think you need -- I think that if my memory is right we had about $90 million dollars contingent commissions last year, so when we're talking about tightening up a $90 million estimate by $3 million votes or something like that is really what's happening here.","It's not a big variance around the path right. Second of all in our case we might have several hundred or more contracts that all contribute, some of them bigger, some smaller to the contingent commission number. So we're talking about a very small change in estimate on a per contract basis.","Looking forward if we had a good performance in 2018 on these contracts and developed a little bit better it probably stands to reason that we might have a little bit better development on 2019 assuming we don't have loss ratios deteriorate substantially between now and the end of the year.","So as we - as we stand here in the first quarter and we trying to estimate what we're going to get, a year from now we might be a little bit more optimistic today than we were a year ago at the same time. So maybe it's a couple million bucks, but I don't know if there's a large trend here. I think it's just more just tightening up our estimates on a large variety of contracts.","Ryan Tunis","Understood, okay. And then one on the M&A pipeline, I think you said there's $350 million in the pipeline. Just curious how much is that. Give us some idea of how much of that is from these bigger type of acquisitions. I mean Stackhouse is obviously very big or is most of that turned 50 mil [ph] the much smaller deals that were - that were more accustomed to?","Douglas Howell","When you take a look at the number of acquisitions that are in the pipeline, the dominant number are small tuck-ins. But you're right there are one, two, three, four in there that are sizable, that would be substantially bigger than even a number of the tuck-ins combined.","So it's very - it's an eclectic mix. It's across the entire set of our geographies, as you know Stackhouse Paul was UK. There's others in there that are a little bit sizable that are in the US but by item count and as we do our announcements and put out a press releases most of those are going to be tuck-ins.","Patrick Gallagher","When we say final, we're talking about $20 million to $50 million type revenue shops too.","Ryan Tunis","So Pat do you think we'll see another $100 million plus deal this year?","Patrick Gallagher","Yes.","Ryan Tunis","Thanks, guys.","Patrick Gallagher","Thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes line of Yaron Kinar, Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Yaron Kinar","Hi, good afternoon. It's far too Doug's answer to Elyse's questions on margins. Did I understand correctly that you were thinking that that margin is expansion will be in the 10 basis point range in the second or third quarters?","Douglas Howell","No, that would be the impact of the Rowan [ph] acquisitions on the margin expansion in the second quarter and third quarter.","Yaron Kinar","Okay, that's helpful. And then we're leaving. And can you maybe talk a little bit about some of the other puts and takes that would go into margin expansion throughout the rest of the year?","Douglas Howell","One of the things that were - wage inflation does exist, but we've been fortunate since 2005 to have invested substantially in our journey on creating some lower cost labor locations.","Right now we have six locations around the world, we're pushing 5000 employees there. And so as a result of that we have a little bit of a safety valve on wage inflation. So we think that our productivity lifts not only using our offshore centers of excellence but also new technology investments that we're making can help offset that natural wage inflation that you're seeing up there in the market. Competition for talent is getting tougher. But we do believe that we have a safety valve for that.","So pressure is on the margin. We're going to come wage inflation, you're seeing real estate costs are going up. So that's in there. But we have techniques in order to better utilize our real estate footprint. And then also just the amount of money that's necessary in order to have a rock solid cyber platform, in order to be able to deliver that technology needs. That's an expensive proposition.","So now looking at margin expansion we have 5% organic growth that we can do 50 basis points of margin expansion. It's really good especially when we're talking about 450 interns that are coming and we're talking about cyber, we're talking about wage inflation, we're talking about other the services that are so necessary for our clients and the placement of their insurance, and then also paying their claims. That's really good work for us to build a harvest that kind of margin expansion.","Yaron Kinar","Got it. And you know when you look at some of the larger acquisitions, I think you said there may be something in the $100 million or more range coming in or the JLP aerospace business. Are those immediately margin accretive or are they dilutive and you need to do a little bit of integration there. How should we think about that?","Douglas Howell","Well, that depends on the nature of the business. I mean we're not afraid to go out and buy a really well-run shop that's for some reason is running 20 points of margin, even though we're coming into the high 20s in terms of the brokerage margins. If there's something about the way their business is run and what the clients need for service we would not be afraid to buy a 20 point margin business just because it would roll in to our - into our business and maybe be slightly dilutive on margins.","The point is it's about the growth. What is their EBITDA doing? How do we have an opportunity better together? So most of the ones we're looking to tuck-ins they come in pretty close to what we're at.","Patrick Gallagher","I would say that. And I would say some of the big ones, I think they'll come in - they'll come in close to our margin, once we've had them on board for a bit. when we bring in a sizable PC or benefits operation and then get them moved to as Doug was talking about our centers of excellence where our lower cost labor is, we impact those margins favorably. So I think they I think you should look at them as probably coming in pretty close to what we've got.","Yaron Kinar","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Hughes from SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Hughes","Yes, thank you. Good afternoon.","Patrick Gallagher","Hi, Mark.","Mark Hughes","I'll ask the usual question about the workers comp to sort of curious Pat you've, I think you've expressed in some recent quarters that you've seen a uptick, but we don't seem to see that flowing through to any of the carriers losses or are really describing any sort of uptick in frequency?","Patrick Gallagher","No, no. I've I have not said uptick in comp. I've said just the opposite. We've seen decreases in comp all year.","Mark Hughes","I'm thinking - I'm thinking the claims frequency. I'm sorry. Yes I was thinking the claims of frequency, just sort of curious to get your latest thoughts on that?","Patrick Gallagher","Yes, we are seeing - we are seeing about something like 2.5% increase in the claim count that's coming through Gallagher Bassett kph an existing business. I think that's because the economy is robust. You do have more people working and they're working longer hours.","You also have the whole distracted driver thing which is really driving a big part of the auto market being very tough. But it also is leading over into some of the some of the losses in the comp world. And so I think that's a natural thing and we go into some form of a recession, our claim counts generally dropped pretty substantially because our clients are reducing workloads and closing down shifts.","Now shifts are pretty robust and you have a little bit more. And hopefully our clients lost control that we assist on can help mitigate that. So that that the uptick in claims is a good thing but a bad thing. And we'd rather be on the side of preventing that than counting them.","Mark Hughes","Seems like the risk management growth that the 4% is still good organic but you've had very strong and stronger growth in the past. Is there anything to restraint on the growth and you've got a tough comp in the second quarter. But aside from that anything holding the growth back there?","Patrick Gallagher","No in fact I think what's happening is the Mark there's even going to be more and more differentiation around outcomes and that's what we're out in the marketplace talking about. Two things that I think you're going to make a huge difference over time in that business.","The idea that you could adjust as a risk manager or as a buyer these services just keep pushing down the price and get the same work for cheaper, cheaper, cheaper. That's a cheap thrill and it's going to start to show up very, very clearly in outcomes.","The other thing is I think you're going to find more and more carriers and captives outsourcing their work either in lines of cover that they want to get into geographies they want to get into and in some instances full on situations like their entire risk management book.","It's becoming a much more relevant approach. So I think the really good providers in the claims business globally have an unbelievably future for 4.1% was a very nice quarter given the comparable to last year.","Douglas Howell","Now I think Mark, if you look at it we had 4% in \u201817 we had 7% in \u201818 organic growth. Some of that - some of the business that comes into our risk management segment can be kind of elephant hunting as we pick up some larger like work comp or work cover schemes down in Australia and some of these larger governmental programs. And then as carriers do tend to find that our claim outcomes are pretty compelling so they start bringing work.","So it wouldn't surprise me that this is a business that you see 5% one year and you see 8% or 9% another and there is a little bit of the impact on that this year. If we can bring it in at 5% between 4% and 6% I think I'd be a pretty good year coming off a total of 7% last year.","Mark Hughes","Thank you.","Douglas Howell","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of our question and answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.","Patrick Gallagher","Thank you, Jeremy. Thank you again for being with us this afternoon. We had a great first quarter and I would like to personally thank all of our employees across the globe for their hard work and our clients for their continued support. 2019 should be another great year for Gallagher.

Patrick Gallagher, Chairman, President and CEO of Arthur J. Gallagher & Company. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.","Patrick Gallagher","Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today is Doug Howell, our CFO, as well as the heads of our operating divisions.","Today, as we do each quarter, Doug and I\u2019m going to touch on the four key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value. Number one, organic growth. Number two, growing through mergers and acquisitions. Number three, improving our productivity and quality. And number four, maintaining our unique culture.","Once again the team delivered on all four of our strategic priorities and I couldn't be more pleased. We really do have some terrific momentum. Let me give you some second quarter financial highlights for our combined core brokerage and risk management segments.","12% growth in revenues, 5.3% all-in organic growth, adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 49 basis points, and we completed 13 mergers with about $195 million of estimated annualized revenue. Just another outstanding quarter for the team.","Let me break down our results by segment. Our broker segments second quarter organic was 5.8% all-in. There were some geography change between base and supplementals in the quarter. So think of base organic more like 5.9% and organic for contingents and supplementals combined of about 4.5% a really nice quarter.","All of our divisions globally contributed. Our domestic retail brokerage operations had a great quarter with organic of about 5%. PCA operations were slightly better than that, and our benefits operations a bit below. Our U.S. wholesale and program business had an excellent base organic quarter, posting more than 5% with contingents and supplemental revenue growth above that.","Internationally our brokerage operations combined to post about 8% organic and very broad based strength in the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Just fantastic results wherever I look in our business.","Moving on to the rate environment, our internal data and our internal mid-year race survey are indicating a trend of increasing property casualty pricing. Almost 75% of our producers surveyed, indicated rates increased during second quarter in the row - colonies approaching about 5% with international a bit higher and domestic a bit below that.","What caught my attention though is that about 15% of our surveyed producers indicated they were seeing race up more than 10% very few had indicated that level of increase last year.","Let me give you some more detail by geography. I will start in the U.S. Rate overall is up about 4% in our retail operations with the greatest increases across commercial auto, property and umbrella. Most other casualty lines are flat to up a few points while workers compensation rates remain a negative territory down about 3%.","Staying in the U.S., pure rate within our wholesale operations RPS is up 5% to 6% with price increases in low double digits for many property related lines, especially on large or loss impacted accounts. Additionally, medical malpractice, general liability and umbrella are experiencing average price increases about 5%, while comp casualty and some professional lines are closer to flat.","Let me move to the UK. Overall pricing is up about 5%. However, a different environment in retail and our specialty operations, UK retail pricing is up about 3%, while pricing is increasing in our UK wholesale operations by almost 8%.","Career seem to be pushing for more rate in casualty oriented lines such as DNO, and ENO and general liability in addition to the property. In Canada, pricing is up 4.5% with property auto and medical malpractice practice rate increases in the high-single-digits. Most other casualty lines are closer to flat.","And finally, in Australia, New Zealand, pricing is up around 7%, which is very similar to what we have been seeing for the past few years. So to sum it up around the world property casualty rates are up close to 5% and exposures are still growing. This is when we Excel. Our talented production staff is fully engaged helping clients and prospects mitigate the challenges of an increasing rate environment.","Next, let me talk about brokerage, merger and acquisition growth. In the quarter, we completed 13 brokerage acquisitions, which should add about $195 million of estimated annualized revenue. I was in the UK just three weeks ago and was able to meet with our new stack house polling and aerospace colleagues.","I couldn't be more excited about them joining our team. Together these two mergers account for about 75% of acquired revenues this quarter, and give us a top notch UK and high network business and make us an industry leader in aerospace brokerage overnight.","The other 11 mergers average about five million in annual revenues is more consistent with our historical tuck-in merger and acquisition strategy. I would like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals.","As I look at our merger and acquisition pipeline, I have seen more than $400 million of revenue associated with about 50 term sheets either agreed upon or being prepared. None of these 50 brokerage mergers have more than $40 million of annual revenues. We know that not all these transactions will close, but it illustrates our pipeline is still very strong and full of small tuck-in opportunities, run by entrepreneurs with excellent sales skills and client relationships.","Next, I would like to move to our risk management segment. Second quarter organic growth was 3%. In-line with the estimate we provided at our Investor Day in June. Recall we posted over 10% last year in the second quarter so it may for is difficult comparison this year, but still very respectable.","In the U.S. claim counts are increasing year-over-year as our clients businesses grow. Call claim counts up about 2%, our expanded specialty offerings are generating encouraging new business leads and wins, while our insurance carrier business continues as positive momentum.","In fact, last year alone, we paid out claims totaling over $1.5 billion on behalf of our insurance carrier clients. Growth in these areas has been driven by investments in analytics and innovative technologies that are delivering positive claim outcomes for our clients.","Outside the U.S. growth was strong in the UK while Australia was weaker due to lower performance bonus fees which can be lumpy from year-to-year. Looking forward, we are expecting stronger organic growth in the second half of 2019, due to some new client wins and we think organic for the full-year should be in the mid-single-digit range.","Lastly, I'd like to touch on Gallagher's unique culture. Our culture is really about our colleagues and the rock solid foundation they from based on every interaction we have with clients, with underwriters and with each other across divisions and around the world. Our culture makes our franchise distinctive and it's why we are constantly looking for the right people to join us whether through new hires, mergers and acquisitions our internship program.","Next month, we will conclude our 54th year of the Gallagher Summer Internship Program. This rigorous two month program for nearly 500 young men and women is an essential investment in our future to ensure our unique culture thrives for many years to come.","Okay, a great first half, which bodes well for another excellent year. I will stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?","Douglas Howell","Thanks, Pat and good afternoon, everyone. As Pat said, another really excellent quarter of top and bottom-line results, combined it with a terrific first quarter. It puts us in a great spot halfway through the year. Today, I will amplify a few comments that Pat made from the earnings release. I will move to the CFO commentary document that we posted on our website. And I will conclude my usual comments on cash and M&A.","All right, to the brokerage segment organic growth on page three of their earnings release. A great quarter at upper 5%, nearly 6%. As we look forward, we see it more like 5% than 6%, as we had a really strong third quarter last year, so that creates a tough compare this year.","And for brokerage margin for the quarter, we delivered about 50 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. Looking forward, that seems about right in this environment, organic of 5% should yield about 50 basis points.","Risk Management, we posted 3% organic growth and 17.5% adjusted margins this quarter. That is right in-line with what we forecast at our June IR Day and great performance by the team, especially considering the second quarter of 2018 and as Pat said, we posted over 10% organic and 17.6% in adjusted margins.","Looking towards the second half and our risk management segment, we are seeing organic over 5% and margins still north of 17%. As for the corporate segment turn to the table at the top of Page 7 of their earnings release.","Relative to the midpoint of the arrangement provided at our June IR Day, interest expense came in a little lower due to stronger cash flows. Clean Energy earnings a little higher, I will add some flavor to that when we give the CFO commentary.","Acquisition expense a little higher due to the JLT aviation transactions. And then corporate expenses, about $3 million lower two to three items, a onetime refund of some ex-taxes, we had an FX adjustment and a little more tax benefit due to option exercises, each about $1 million.","Let's turn now to the CFO commentary document like we said that is founded IR our website. Go to Page 2. Relative to the estimates we gave it our June IR day, most of the items pretty much show in-line, except for the non-cash items that the amortization and depreciation coming in touch better. That is simply because we were just a little conservative when we were making our initial estimates on the aviation business that had closed just 12 days earlier on June 1.","Next, turn to Page 3. Again, we are in the CFO commentary document. Looking out towards the third and the fourth quarter. Our estimates for interest, M&A costs and corporate expenses are still consistent with what we provided in June.","As for clean energy, or while we posted better than our midpoint estimates in the second quarter, we are widening our range for the next couple of quarters. There is three reasons for that, we are not seeing extreme weather like we have last year. One host utility had a fire taking the plant offline several months. And we are feeling the impact of or natural gas prices.","So there was a lower side scenario leading us to drop the lower end of the range by about $5 million. That said we are still on-track to produce over $200 million of tax credits this year. And at June 30, we have nearly $950 million of carry forward credits. So we are we are clearly in a terrific position to have very low cash taxes paid well into the mid to late 2021.","One operational comment before we get to cash and M&A. You will see in our earnings release that we talked about a $7.2 million or $0.04 after tax charge for severance this quarter. We are seeing some real opportunities to bring efficiencies and productivity left to our back office support layers.","We have started a transformation journey similar to what we did with our middle office layers, centralization, standardization, automation and further use of our centers of excellence all focused on lowering costs and improving quality.","The charge we took this quarter is the first step in that transformation journey. I have a more detailed update our September IR day. But needless to say we are excited about some early views of the opportunity.","And finally, out for cash and M&A at June 30, we have about $250 million of available cash on our balance sheet. That plus expected free cash flow for the remainder of the year and some more debt to bring our full-year M&A capacity to around about $1.5 billion before using any stock.","So okay, those are my comments. A truly excellent quarter. A truly excellent first half. We are in a great spot for another successful year. Back to you Pat.","Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Doug. And Mike, do you want to open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Call is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from line of Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. You may proceed.","Mike Zaremski","Hey good afternoon.","Patrick Gallagher","Good afternoon Mike.","Mike Zaremski","First question Pat, in terms of your commentary and the earnings are at least about your internal surveys suggested rates are approaching 5%. Maybe you can comment where was that last quarter and you also said right after that, that around half of the survey producers see rates moving higher. Maybe you could comment on do they have a good track record for forecasting? And just another one on just the same topic is maybe can you remind us of your sensitivity to higher pricing in terms of the fee versus commission and kind of what the beta is about, what hits the your organic?","Patrick Gallagher","Okay. Well, it\u2019s a lot of questions Mike. Let me jump in and try get through them and do my best. First of all, I think it was 15% of those surveys said they are seeing rates move even higher than the 5%. So figure that rates are approaching that 5% number with workers comp being soft in the meantime.","But remember, and I have put this in my prepared remarks. Our job is to mitigate that, that is what we do for our clients. So if you take a look at our results for the quarter. All-in exposure units and rate contributed about 2% organic.","Now that is up a point, historically and even through the first quarter, we would have told you it was closer to 1%. So we could get a 1% additional lift from exposures and rates. In terms of accounts moving back and forth between commissions and fees, and what that does to the P&L.","You will recall it since 2006 with our friends, the Attorney General's. We have been transparent, and particularly here in the United States. So everybody that is buying from us knows exactly what we are making and they can choose to either pay us by fee, or they can choose to pay us by commission and a good 80% plus choose to use the commission vehicle and do allow us to take supplementals and contingents.","Of course supplemental and contingents are very important, because, they are very profitable, but having the base commissions and fees up about 5.9%, these are benefits and closer to five is still good work for the team. So tell me that you get half of them.","Douglas Howell","It is about 3% in the first quarter is what we would. We didn\u2019t survey then, but that is probably worth.","Mike Zaremski","Okay got it. You got them. And then just lastly, when we think about if your survey producers are right and rates are keep moving North. I think us from the outside are going to kind of start thinking about putting in some more margin improvement into our estimates our forecasts. Do you think there is kind of a governor on how much margins can improve because maybe there is initiatives you guys want to further invest in the - kind of take advantage of the great market environment currently maybe you could touch on that. Thanks.","Douglas Howell","Well I think there is wage inflation Mike, so I think that if we can grow 5%, put 50 basis points of that onto the bottom line, I think that is pretty good in this environment. We have lots of investment initiatives that we have here in the Company doing data between our sales management tools, between developing our interns as our niche strategies, our marketing that we are doing to create a brand. We think that we can run ourselves with 50 basis points of margin expansion if we are hitting that 5%.","Patrick Gallagher","The other thing too Mike as I said in my remarks, our people go out every day and try to figure out with their clients how to make sure that these rate increases don\u2019t hit them. Now first of all let me comment on hard market soft market. 5% increase no hard market you got to go all the way back to 2001 to see what real hard market looks like.","So 5% you are sitting across from the client that is getting a reduction in the workers compensation. They can tweak the - up they can drop a line of cover, there is bunch of things they can do to mitigate the impact of that. So while I'm pleased that we have a bit of a tailwind, I would not get extra bullish on the rate environment.","Mike Zaremski","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please state your question.","Elyse Greenspan","Thanks, good evening. My first question on you guys posted 5.8% organic growth in the first half of the year. I know you guys kind of set the bowl here at [indiscernible], Doug in your comment I know you alluded to a tough comp in the third quarter, but then you know the tough the comp obviously you guys had a good year last year, does it get a little bit better in the fourth quarter. So should we think about that kind of evening out and should the 5.8 kind of be where the full-year to end up for 2019?","Douglas Howell","Yes. So I think between five and 5.8.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay great and then in terms of the CFO commentary, I know you guys added this quarter in terms of above 5% organic growth 50 basis points of margin expansion. I'm assuming that is just was your printing above [indiscernible] I just wanted to know the thought process behind added that disclosure. And then you did mentioned taking a severance related charge this quarter, is that for the savings there, is that for reinvestment or is that something that maybe you could help get that margin above the 50 basis points target.","Patrick Gallagher","So its couple of questions in there, we had just a little bit of at least as referring to kind of about a third of the way down the CFO commentary on page two that we just - we have always said that it\u2019s tough to expand margin if you have organic, less than 3% you will get a little bit between three and four and into fours and maybe if we hit 5% we will get 50 basis points of margin expansion. That is what I have been saying in our IR days for the last couple quarters so we thought we would have put in writing there.","So it doesn\u2019t signal anything more or less than just putting in writing what we have been saying. The second half of your question is in terms of the opportunities for us to take a little severances quarter and maybe restructure some of our positions. That does show us an opportunity, but it\u2019s more of a long-term play Elise, I think we have got raises coming up in the second half of the year. So that will help that. But I still think with $7 million of severance 200 to 300 total people related to that. This isn't a big move on the margin at this time.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. And then also on the CFO commentary, in terms of the acquisitions roll forward on Page 5. It seems like for the deals you closed in the second quarter, and I'm assuming that is really stemming from Stackhouse Poland and JLT. Let's have them come into the third quarter in terms of revenue and more into the fourth quarter. I know, we don't have the Q1 and Q2 of next year. But is there something seasonally with either JLT or Stackhouse Poland that would make them have less revenue in the third quarter versus some other quarters of the year?","Patrick Gallagher","Yes, JLT is heavily weighted into the fourth quarter.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Okay. Thank you very much.","Douglas Howell","Thanks Elyse.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.","Ryan Tunis","Hey, thanks. Good evening. I guess my first one is. I\u2019m actually a little bit surprised that only half of your surveyed producers fee rates moving higher in the second half of 2019.","Douglas Howell","No, no, no. That is not. Let me go back to my prepared remarks. Because -.","Patrick Gallagher","Yes. I don't think we said that, Mike. I think somebody else repeated maybe at the front.","Douglas Howell","75% of our producers surveyed indicated rates increase during the second quarter renewals, at approaching about 5%. But what caught my attention is that about 15% of our survey producers indicated they are receiving rates up more than 10%. So that would be people in tougher geographies with bigger property schedules. And a few indicated - nobody indicated that last year.","Patrick Gallagher","There is 90% of the survey results so.","Ryan Tunis","Okay. Understood. I guess I wanted to come back a little bit more to some of the offsets though to the better pricing. What percent of your clients you see either I guess buying down or insurance in response to the higher rates or just increased deductibles?","Patrick Gallagher","Yes, I would say most of them are looking at how do I get this thing back to flat. And that is kind of the marching orders that we are being given. So come to me with ideas. I don't want to pay 5% to 7% and certainly don't want to pay north of 10% on property. So what suggestions do you have?","Now in some instances, there is not much you can do, which is why some of it will flow through and why we see about 2% in the books right now, is that much if you have got already a variable deductible for property, and the property is going to go up 7% or 8%, you are not going to get much savings taking your deductible of another 100 grand.","It's the bigger part of the of the exposure that they want the weigh that. And they are going they are going to get it. I can't give you a percentage of which of our clients and drop cup, but we do keep trying to keep an eye on terms and costs. And by and large our people are doing a really good job of number one getting out and explaining that the pricing dynamic is a little bit different. And number two, I will be back to you with suggestions.","Ryan Tunis","Got you. And then I was wondering if you could go into a little bit more detail on what you are seeing competitively I guess to the workers comp, clearly pricing is down but, sort of understand if that is because there is more - underwriters that are trying to write more of it - just because you have had so much good experience over the past few years. It's just the impact of that flowing through, I guess in the pricing side.","Patrick Gallagher","I think it's right. Alright I mean, it's been a successful line across the United States. They want more of it, when you want more of it and your pricing off against your competitors. One tactic, you are going to have to use is to reduce price.","Douglas Howell","And we have seen some favorable loss cost development -.","Ryan Tunis","Thank you.","Patrick Gallagher","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Joshua Shanker","Good evening everybody. You and your publicly traded competitor stocks are materially more expensive now than they were at the beginning of the year. I understand there is a difference between the public market and the private market. But I'm wondering, if you are potential acquisition targets see that and demand they hire cost to acquire their businesses, or our prices for acquisitions, generally consistent with where they were six, seven months ago?","Douglas Howell","Well, first of all, I don't know, if I would say that our stock is expensive. Certainly, I have nice\u2026","Joshua Shanker","No. On the number, you can just, it is up 30%.","Douglas Howell","So but we like to like that. So I think that we are seeing pricing move up a little bit, our tuck-in acquisitions. We are still doing in the eights , the low eights. And then if you throw on a little bit larger ones, that they pushing our total multiple up to about 10. That is still a four plus turn on our trading multiple.","So we still think it creates great shareholder value for us to go out and merge with a lot of folks. So I think that yes, you are seeing pricing up over the last three or four years, is there a material change in the last seven months, which I think was your specific question, I don't really see that.","Patrick Gallagher","But I will tell you what is changing, which is interesting. And I think it feeds right into our pipeline. The difference between a private transaction to perpetuate your agency, remember, most of our acquisitions are smaller, $5 million, $6 million, $7 million, $8 million and what you can get by selling to a strategic is getting to be like a 50% differential, which is taking owners and saying, really, if I'm going to perpetuate to my younger team mates, I'm going to take a 50% cut, haircut, I don't think so.","So I think that is bringing a lot more potential sellers to the table. And prices are up as well. And I think the advisors out there are saying, look, we haven't seen multiples of this height, especially for a large deal in a long, long time. The banks did this 20 years ago. But you might want to move while the opportunity is there, which is again, good for us.","That makes our pipeline longer, we can be very discerning. We only want - look 90% of our due-diligence is on culture. We only want people that are going to fit from day one. And we have got lots of opportunities to look.","Joshua Shanker","And if we look out at the pipeline, I guess it's going to back three or four years ago you changed your methodology, you were issuing a lot of stock and you said we are no longer going to issue stock without buying it back. Is there any chance that a good acquisition come along that you would be willing to issue stock for at this point? Are you still saying you know what we have made a commitment to shareholders and we want to keep this share account where it is?","Douglas Howell","Yes, I think that clarify that. I think since 2016, when we actually have had such ample cash flows and the ability to borrow on that. That I think we have only issued a total of a net two million shares. So less than 1% of our shares outstanding in the last four plus years. So yes, you are right. We have done that."," I think our cash flows are strong, I think we can do a $1.5 billion of deal this year without issuing stock, but I don\u2019t think that we would hesitate to use a little stock in an acquisition, if we get down to the end of the year we need to do a $100 million or $200 million of stock or first quarter next year we would probably do that.","I mean if you are still buying in that eight times range on the smaller deals then we would issued some shares directly to the sellers, I think that is still a good value creation. But we are working very hard to not - do not use shares, but we haven\u2019t had to.","Joshua Shanker","Okay thank you for the answers. Good luck for the remainder of the year.","Patrick Gallagher","Thank you Josh.","Douglas Howell","Thanks Josh.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Yaron Kinar","Hi good afternoon everybody. My first question is around risk management so I think in the last couple of years we see some favorable seasonality in margins in the third quarter. Are those recurring - is the recurring seasonality there or should we think about maybe flatter seasonality?","Patrick Gallagher","I think the thing that impacts the most is our performance bonus revenues and some of those do trigger in that summer and fall. This year you can see that we are actually down a little bit in this quarter, a couple of million dollars which should be organic, but we saw that coming, because every year our clients raise the bar on our quality and there are sometimes it takes a year or two to work into that. So that is probably what you are seeing in there.","Yaron Kinar","Okay got it and then just maybe a silly question here, but as we look at supplemental and contingent commissions, are the margins further to roughly aligned or are they different?","Patrick Gallagher","Generally we don\u2019t see a lot of difference. Anything that we do with the supplement and contingent is usually how we compensate the field leadership levels so there is not a big difference between those two, we wanted execute the right contract with our underwriters. If they want to do a supplemental, we will do a supplemental, if they want to do a contingent we will do contingent. So we try not to differentiate too heavily - much on that.","Yaron Kinar","Got it and then final quick one what is the rational for the choosing private placement over public debt?","Patrick Gallagher","Yes at this point we just haven\u2019t had access to public market. I don\u2019t know if there is a long history of rational in that, but I think that you for the first time we did our first private placement in 2007 they said you might have one or two lost in it and here we are 12 years later and there seems to be plenty of capacity for it.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. got it thank you.","Douglas Howell","Thanks Yaron.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Newsome","Good afternoon thanks for the color guys. I was wondering if you could look out a little bit into the market environment, I think it\u2019s sort of hard markets as being mostly characterized by a lot of more shopping behavior and period or level of retention to changing are you seeing that in your book are you having - are your customers asking to shop and spreadsheet more or is that not necessarily the case?","Patrick Gallagher","Well, no that is the case, that is right. I think what you have got is you have got the good sales people are outweighed advance, letting customers know that things are a little bit different than they were a year ago. Customers then turned around say what is your mitigation strategy and the dialog you have within this well there is a couple of things.","We really like the relation with XYZ carrier, we are going to talk to them about your good account and why it shouldn't be necessarily changed in terms of rate. But there is also others that are very competitive. And part of the job of a broker is to shop the account for your -.","Douglas Howell","And we do see retention coming down. Listen, I haven\u2019t read every single insurance carriers release that have come out. But there, I think their retention is are down just a little bit, which would show there is movement.","In our case, that gives us a great opportunity for us to go in with our customers, and that for those prospects that we don't have to demonstrate that we have some creative ways in order to help mitigate what is facing them.","Patrick Gallagher","Remember too, this is when - that is very well not too long ago, this is when the capability shine. So we know that 90% of the time when we compete in the marketplace, we are competing with somebody smaller than we are. So something on the order of 10% of the time, the four bigger players are butting heads a bit.","Now, when you have got to mitigate some increases, you want to look at your balance and what have you. Now our capabilities really play well. We have got much better data analytics than any of the small guys, we have got much better carrier relations, we got a broader set of carriers that we are very well related with. And that is hard for that little guy to come in and pick your pocket. So it's really pretty good. It's a good environment for us, our skills get to show off.","Paul Newsome","And I guess similarly, last couple hard markets I saw - do you saw changes in commission levels as well. Carriers trying, not always succeed, but at least trying to reduce the commission levels for the -.","Patrick Gallagher","That is true. That happens. But let me be really clear. This is this is really important guys, do not overemphasize this as a hard market. This is not a hard market. We are getting our accounts quoted, we are not having accounts canceled in a wholesale fashion. We are working through a little bit of increase here.","And I have been saying for the last decade, you take me up two down three, up four down two that is not our market. If you go back to 2001, our organic growth was 19%, the market rates were up in average of over 20. And many accounts never could get the cover they wanted. They couldn't fill out their lives. That was a hard market. So let's not let's not get crazy here looking at this as a hard market.","Paul Newsome","I couldn't agree more. But thank you very much.","Patrick Gallagher","Thanks Paul.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from one of Meyer Shields with KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Meyer Shields","Thanks. I have a question on your commentary where you talked about having difficult comps with last year or in some coming quarters and I'm not sure I understand why having high organic growth in a proceeding this quarter makes it harder to maintain the same organic growth going forward. Is it something impermanent about the revenues in high organic quarters.","Patrick Gallagher","Yes, I think one of the things to look at is that about 40% of our business is actually not annual renewable type policies. We do have surety bonds, construction programs, et cetera, where you might get some lumpy - or its base commissions and fees. But those are not recurring revenues. So we don't have 100% of our book of business that are what you would think about as a standard commercial policy that renews every year.","So last year, if you have a little bit of you hit well on a bunch of surety bonds, they might not be back for three or four years. So that does influence. And when you are talking about a point on - talking about 10 million bucks, in total. So you can have a tough compare. If you have 30 or 40 good hits in a quarter you will have a little lumpiness still in our revenues.","Meyer Shields","Okay. That is really helpful.","Patrick Gallagher","That is all [indiscernible].","Meyer Shields","Okay. No that is clarify. I really appreciate it. I have asked this in the past. Is the sort of recurring rate decrease story in workers compensation having any impact at all, in terms of clients looking to retain more of the workers comp disclosure?","Patrick Gallagher","No.","Douglas Howell","We are talking a little bit. When you are talking about down 3%. That is not a huge change.","Patrick Gallagher","No and people don't move in and out of self assurance that often. So if you have got a large retention and you have got a TPA or Gallagher Bassett paying your claims, and you find out that overall, you can get a 3% reduction if you go back to a first hour policy. You are way down the road. You are at the deep end of the pool and you are not going back to the shell in.","Meyer Shields","Okay. perfect, thanks so much.","Douglas Howell","Thanks Meyer.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And with that, it looks like our last question comes from the line of Mark Hughes with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Hughes","Thank you good afternoon. As I say RPS is up 6% organically in the quarter?","Patrick Gallagher","I think that is what the number was yes.","Douglas Howell","Yes. 5% to 6%, Mark.","Mark Hughes","Would you anticipate, if rate continue to go up? Would you see more activity perhaps in the E&S for one, and maybe that might push that growth a little higher?","Patrick Gallagher","Yes. You just said if you could. And that is part of the mitigation strategy. You might have a large portfolio property with maybe one market right now and you get down the road, it might be better to layer that thing. And then you are going to be in the wholesale market. And yes, I think and our team at RPS is very good at that stuff.","Mark Hughes","And then final question on the fourth quarter contribution from acquisition, it looks like there is an outside contribution. Is the margin impact also more outsides, is that high margin stuff in Q4?","Douglas Howell","There would be a slight - on that incremental revenue yes, you would see a slightly higher margin on that just because of the seasonality. But I don't know if it moved the entire billion or billion one that we post in the fourth quarter.","Mark Hughes","Very good. Thank you.","Patrick Gallagher","Alright. Thank you Mark.","Patrick Gallagher","Mike, I have got a few just wrap up comments here. Thank you again for being with us this afternoon. In closing I'm extremely pleased with our 2019 performance thus far, and the team is poised to deliver another strong finish to the year. Look forward to speaking with you again at our IR Day in September. Thank you for being with us this afternoon. Have a great rest of the evening.","Operator","Thank you.

Participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. Your lines will be open for questions following the presentation. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Some of the comments made during this conference including answers given in response to questions may constitute forward-looking statements within the meanings of the securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties discussed on this call are described in the Company\u2019s reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Patrick Gallagher, Chairman, President and CEO of Arthur J Gallagher. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.","Patrick Gallagher","Thank you very much and good morning, everyone thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2017 earnings call. With me this morning is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions. As we do each quarter, today Doug and I are going to talk about the four key components of our value creation strategy. Those are number one organic growth; two growing through mergers and acquisitions; three, improving our productivity and quality; and four, maintaining our very unique Gallagher culture. The team really delivered on all 4 of the strategic priorities this quarter resulting in excellent top and bottom line results. I am extremely pleased with our first half performance which sets the stage for another outstanding year in 2017.","Let me start with some comments on our broker segments. Second quarter all-in organic growth was 4.2% up nicely over our first quarter. To the first two quarters 2017 organic stands at 3.5% right in line with the level of organic we experienced last year. Let me give you some granularity around our brokerage segment organic growth in the quarter. In the U.S. organic growth was about 3.5% for the quarter with retail growth stronger than wholesale. Internationally all-in organic was about 5.5% for the quarter with Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the U.K. all delivering organic growth greater than 4% just a fantastic job by our international team.","All of our brokerage operations that are on the globe grew organically in the quarter. And my optimism for the remainder of the year is based on the broad strength of our operation. As I said in the first quarter I continue to see full year 2017 organic growth in our brokerage segment similar to 2016's result.","Moving to the rate environment. Our internal data shows global PC pricing down only a point in the quarter very similar to last quarter and when I look at the first two quarters combined pricing improved by 50 basis points compared to 2016 within our global retail business. One really interesting observation is in Australia and New Zealand pricing has really turned as higher by 4% to 5% during the second quarter.","By product line commercial auto is still experiencing highest rate increases up about 1.6% within the U.S. during the second quarter. Professional liabilities experiencing positive pricing overall particularly within U.S. wholesale which was up 2.1% and U.K. retail was up 1%. The recent rate trends we are seeing in our own internal data were further validated by responses to our annual internal pricing survey which indicated global PC pricing as down about 80 basis points in 2017.","Further our midyear internal rate survey showed almost two-thirds of the respondents expecting no significant change in pricing for the rest of the year. So in the end up a point or down a point this is effectively a stable pricing environment. Second, let me talk about brokerage merger and acquisition growth. We completed nine tuck-in acquisitions this quarter at a weighted average multiple of about 7 times EBITDAC. The average size of the 9 tuck-ins we completed in the quarter was $3.5 million of annualized revenue.","As I look at our internal merger and acquisition report our pipeline remains full. I see about $250 million of revenue associated with around 40 term sheets either agreed upon or being prepared. Not all these transactions will close, but we believe we have the right mixture of culture, service capabilities, niches and tools that will continue to attract talented independent sales and consulting professionals to our organization.","As I do every quarter, I would like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professional. Third, I want to spend some time on our productivity and quality. Last month the entire senior leadership team was in London. Now that our large merger integration is essentially behind us the focus was on the opportunities ahead for our U.K. operation. By leveraging our centers of excellence, streamlining the back office, becoming more efficient on small business and standardizing process, we should be able to increase our margins, improve quality and delivery sustainable organic growth. It's an exciting time for our U.K. team.","So to wrap-up the brokerage segment, the team posted 9% total adjusted revenue growth and 4.2% organic. Adjusted EBITDAC growth of 11% and adjusted EBITDAC margin was 31% up 51 basis points over second quarter 2016, so really strong results sitting here at the half way market for our brokerage team.","Next, I would like to move to our risk management segment which is primarily Gallagher Bassett. Second quarter organic growth was 5.6% and reflects excellent organic growth domestically and internationally. The team has notched a number of new business wins this year across all segments and geographies many of which were directly with insurance carriers.","In terms of merger and acquisition growth, our risk management team completed two acquisitions in the quarter one in New Zealand and the other in the U.K. Both of these new merger partners have unique capabilities that will increase and help round out our service offerings in these respective geographies. Risk management adjusted EBITDAC margins showed about 10 basis points of year-over-year improvement and fell within our expected range for the quarter at 17%. The team has done really a fantastic job managing headcount as the segment was experiencing lower levels of organic growth over the past couple of quarters.","Lastly culture, our culture is the key differentiator of our company and we are constantly looking for the right people to join us whether through new hires, mergers and acquisitions or internship program. In August, we will conclude our 52nd year of the Gallagher summer internship program. This extensive two month program for over 300 young men and women is an essential investment in our future and is forming a rock solid foundation for our culture for many, many years to come.","Okay, an excellent quarter, a great half for the year, I will stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?","Doug Howell","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. Like Pat said, a really terrific second quarter and first half of 2017. This morning my comments are going to cover some modeling items using the CFO commentary document that we posted on our investor website as well as my typical commentary and margins, clean energy, M&A and cash and capital management.","Okay first page 2 of the CFO commentary. You will see that most all of the second quarter 2017 actual numbers came in very close for the estimates that we provided during our June 13th Investor Day. In addition, you will see that our third and fourth quarter commentary is right in line with what we provided in June also, so really no new news on page 2.","Next please turn to page 5 of the CFO commentary to the table showing you roll-in revenues from M&A. During our June 13 IR Day we provided our updated estimate of $43 million of roll-in revenues. Now we posted right about that number 42 million. However, it looks to us like [indiscernible] consensus was about $50 million with some having a much wider range around that number. While $8 million of difference to the consensus isn't a huge number, it does cause about a penny of difference in EPS.","We fully understand that making an estimate for roll-over revenues is a difficult pact. So we will continue to provide an update towards the end of each quarter during our quarterly IR meeting. Meanwhile please take a few minutes extra when you are updating your models between now and then.","Okay let\u2019s move back to the earnings release and some comments on the brokerage segment margin. Adjusted brokerage EBITDAC margin expanded 51 basis points in the quarter. Nearly all of our operating units around the world held or improved margins and nice healthy results reflecting strong operational discipline. Natural question might be why did adjusted margins expand a 120 basis points in the first quarter and 2.7% organic, net expense 51 basis points and 4.2% organic here in the second quarter. It has to do with our seasonality and the roll-in of M&A.","First is understanding that our second quarter is by far our highest margin quarter at 31%, first 24.6% in the first quarter. Second, to understand that the tranche of mergers that are moving in this year do not have the same second quarter seasonality. In fact this tranche of M&A rolling in is posting about 25% margins both in the first and second quarter.","Accordingly, they didn't really impact margins in the first quarter and overall we were at 24.6%. But here in the second quarter, when overall we're poking 31%, they do bring down margins. If I were to levelize for this in the second quarter, we would have posted about 80 to 90 basis points on margin expansion here in this second quarter.","I hope that answers the natural question that might arise.","Now, looking forward. Last year, the brokerage segment adjusted margins were 27.9% in the third quarter and 25.8% in the fourth quarter. Again you can see some seasonality there and we posted about 20 to 30 basis points of margin expansion last year in those quarters over 2015.","That expansion came on organically about 3.5% in each quarter. So, this year we're targeting similar margins in the third and fourth quarter, so please don\u2019t model much of any margin expansion in the second half.","Now, let's move to our risk management segment. We posted adjusted EBITDAC margin of 17%. As Pat mentioned, the team did a great job of controlling the headcount as we move past a lower period of organic growth, which but it still resulted into margin expansion here in the second quarter. We continued to see margins for the full year in the range of 17% to 17.5%.","Let's turn to clean energy. With a warm June, we had a great second quarter and our earnings came into the high end of our estimate. You can see on page 3 of the CFO commentary that if we hit the midpoint of the full year range, it will be a nice step up in 2016 but also I have to say we all understand that weathers going to impact those estimate.","A cooler summer or a warmer early winter can move our estimates by a million. At June 30, 2017, we have about $550 million of tax credits on our balance sheet. Effectively a $550 million receivable from the government. This assets will reduce our future cash taxes paid for many years to come, even with or without tax reform.","Next, M&A. we're still seeing fair pricing on tuck-in merger. With a weighted average multiple through June 30 of below a time, it shows that merger partners are choosing Gallagher because they value our capabilities and our culture and they know that we will be better together. When I look at our pipeline I see similar pricing for the rest of the year.","Finally, cash. At June 30, we're pushing $300 million or pushing up towards $300 million of available cash on our balance sheet. Combined with a debt offering announced in June, it looks like we can fund it 2017 M&A with free cash in debt. So, those are my comments, outstanding organics, solid execution and our tuck-in M&A program, excellent operational discipline and margin expansion at a strong cash position.","A terrific quarter and terrific half on all measures. Thank you, Pat.","Patrick Gallagher","Thank you, Doug. And operator, we're ready to open up for questions, hopefully some answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good morning.","Patrick Gallagher","Good morning, Elyse.","Elyse Greenspan","My first question on is just on the organic outlook just combined with a broad I guess more color on the market. As you think to the back half of the year to hit your full year target would imply maybe just a little bit of a step-up in the first half of the year. As you think about that, how are you thinking about organic, internationally should it remain as strong as we saw in the second quarter.","And then, also what are you seeing on exposure growth in the U.S. but also around the world?","Patrick Gallagher","Well, as it relates to organic internationally, I'm pretty bullish. We got rate improvement in New Zealand and Australia, those businesses are doing very well. We've got positive organic in Canada and the U.K. at a level that's greater than the United States. In the U.S. is in very nicely positive organic. So, I feel the 2017 should look and feel a lot like 2016.","Elyse Greenspan","And then what about exposure growth?","Patrick Gallagher","Exposure growth is interesting. It's not having much impact yet. When I look at the worldwide employment figures, I keep wondering when exposure is going to show some nice shoots but it has an impact that is by more than a percent.","Elyse Greenspan","So, the exposure growth does start to pick up, that would be additive to your debt and close outlook?","Patrick Gallagher","Absolutely.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. And then, you guys in the commentary pointed to flat margins in the brokerage business for the second half of the year. I guess, if you continued hit, say about 3.5% organic, I know there are some of those acquisitions Doug, that you pointed to coming in but why won't you be able to expand margins or is it just a matter of some investments. I know that you've spoken about in the past that you're making on within the company?","Doug Howell","Yes. Historically in the second half of the year, margins expansion has not been as much in the first half. Thus far year-to-date we're up 84 basis points. We're in a similar position last year this time we brought it in right around 50 basis points for the full year.","Part of the reason for that is we typically give our reasons during the second half of the year. Those will be coming in, so that does have a little bit of a -- it keeps margins from expanding as much because that's when we give the raises and then we see the result of that as what's full there.","So, basically like we're saying, this year feels a lot like last year. If we end at 35 for the year, if we end up with just a little bit of margin expansion in the third and fourth quarter, we'll bring it in somewhere around 50 basis points of margin expansion on 3.5% organic growth. That's pretty much so how the model work.","Patrick Gallagher","Also, in September, typically when we bring our into our new hire's on.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. And then in terms of the weighted average share count went up a little bit in the quarter. Is that due I think last quarter you pointed out the stock comp accounting I think has a weight as your share count. Am I thinking about that correct, is there something else going on there?","Doug Howell","Yes. Let me clarify in that. It really doesn't, this stock option the new stock option accounting produces a little bit of a gain in the corporate segment that used to go through, it goes with the P&L now, it used to go through other comprehensive income.","It doesn't really impact the number of shares outstanding. The reason why shares are creeping up a little it right now is we do have -- we did have more stock option exercises in the first half of the year. So, that puts more shares out of the market.","Our employee stock purchase plan puts them out into them. So, that increases it. We did use some shares in M&A this quarter in tax reexchange. So, that puts it out but recall we purchased those last year. So, I think we're still above flat when it comes to shares purchased last year versus those years we've issued an M&A. So, we're pretty bottom.","So, that's the three pieces that caused the slight creep from I think we're at a 181 million last quarter and we're pushing a 182 million this quarter.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. Thanks very much for the color.","Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Elyse.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi there, thanks, good morning. Actually it's Mike Phillips sitting for Kai Pan this one. Good morning, everybody.","Patrick Gallagher","Good morning, Mike.","Unidentified Analyst","Question on -- good morning. Supplemental continued to commissions as they grew pretty well in the quarter. I guess, just of your outlook on there for the second half of the year how that varies by quarter and seasonality. And then how much did that impact the margin growth in the quarter?","Doug Howell","Yes, all right. First and foremost, the different three ways in supplemental I've always said is kind of it's a blurry line between that. So, I wouldn't read too terribly much into the fact that it grew 10% year-to-date in base of that pack 3% and there is some blurred lines there. I think that continue commissions of the one that there really kind of have a little bit more impact to the bottom line and they're up 2.7% in the year-to-date.","So, it does have a little impact on margin expansion, maybe 10 or 15 basis points by the time you look at after compensation elements that are associated with that.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great, thanks. And then I guess second one just more broadly. What impact do you think will have on you guys of the USO and Wells Fargo deal, I guess acquisition activity and maybe organic growth as well?","Doug Howell","Well, I mean I wouldn\u2019t comment on what it'll do for organic growth. But whenever there's change in the business and people are looking for another place to maybe rest their head, we try to provide a pretty nice house.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. So, no major impact. I guess lastly, on clean coal with its sunset coming. Just refresh us again on your view of the prospects for tax reform and kind of what you're pursuing other tax wedded fields to keep your cycle tax rate down.","Doug Howell","Great question. I don\u2019t really have any views on tax reform at this point. I think it's a crap shoot anyway you look at it. I think that regardless what happens, we have generated a substantial amount of credit carry forwards, 550 million of them. We'll use those going into the future.","We can produce new credits all the way through 2021. By the time we get to that in the current tax environment with our current balance sheet, I don\u2019t think there will be a paying meaningful taxes in the U.S. until late in the 20's. What do we have wind up between 2025 and 2030 for further reductions and taxes, I don\u2019t know at this time.","But we've been very good over since the history of Gallagher build always find some new tax credit strategy. So, we'll see how the, that's something we'll start working on in 2022.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thanks, very much. I appreciate it.","Doug Howell","Thanks, Mike.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Adam Klauber of William Blair. Please go ahead.","Adam Klauber","Thanks, good morning everyone.","Patrick Gallagher","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Klauber","Just a couple of different questions. Did I hear correctly, did you say U.S. wholesale rates were up 1% to 2%?","Doug Howell","On professional lines.","Adam Klauber","On professional lines, okay. Well, in wholesale, what's the just generally the ballpark the level of submissions and how does that compare to a year ago?","Patrick Gallagher","Submissions were up nicely, probably up 3%, 4%. Finding continues to hit ratio, continues to be pretty significant. And the business is very, very healthy.","Adam Klauber","Okay. And then how about the benefit business, is that growing more or less in the overall U.S. retail business?","Patrick Gallagher","A little bit more.","Adam Klauber","Okay.","Doug Howell","Yes. Not measurably more, I mean, maybe just 4.5 this quarter versus 4.2 all in.","Adam Klauber","Okay. And then I think you mentioned exposures are doing generally okay. How about audit premiums, are those more a tail wind today than a year ago?","Patrick Gallagher","No, they're not a tail wind, it's kind of flattish. That's why the, that's kind of the quandary. We're seeing employment figures look strong and I see that globally and yet we're really not seeing payrolls jump and we're not seeing sales jump. So, it's the audits are kind of flattish.","Adam Klauber","Okay. Thanks, that's all I had.","Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Adam.","Doug Howell","Thanks, Adam.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Arash Soleimani of KBW. Please go ahead.","Arash Soleimani","Hi, thanks.","Patrick Gallagher","Good morning.","Arash Soleimani","Good morning. Couple of quick questions. I know you had mentioned that $250 million pipeline and the brokerage M&A, within the risk for Gallagher Bassett I think you said that you had recently hired a full time M&A person and you didn\u2019t have a full time person in that capacity before.","I'm just wondering how should we think given that how should we think of the pipeline there.","Doug Howell","I don\u2019t know if we actually said there's a full time person inside a Gallagher Bassett. I have a team of folks that are really good about looking for opportunities. I remember in Gallagher Bassett, what we're looking for is geographic expansion and where our multinational clients we want to have us have places to do business.","That's one thing we look for. The other thing is there are some nice specialty claim related businesses out there that can round out our product offering and offering to our client. Those are the two types of things that we're looking for there. And so, but it\u2019s Gallagher Bassett provides a full array of services.","So, those are they are out there but there is not an abundance of them.","Patrick Gallagher","And you're not going to see the level of activity out of Gallagher Bassett that you see in a brokerage unit. The brokerage, the brokerage world is incredibly fragmented, it's virtually huge and the opportunities are limitless.","Doug Howell","And that's not a business where we're just trying to acquire people for our customer list. We do really well on competing every day for that type of business organically. So, just to be able to pick up scale through a customer list is not something that's all that interesting to us.","Arash Soleimani","Okay. That's helpful, thanks. And my other question is, and within your interim program, how many of those interims typically come on full time?","Patrick Gallagher","So, you take, we are 300 instance this summer and the split between people who finished their sophomore year in college and people who finished the junior year. And the juniors are probably will be something on the order of a 100 out of that 300. So, they're going back for their senior year, we'll probably recruit of about 80 of those.","There will be starters in September of 2018. And by the way, five years later we'll have 80% of those still with us and 20 years later we'll have 80% of those.","Arash Soleimani","Okay, great. Thank you very much for the answers.","Patrick Gallagher","Take care.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Mark Hughes of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.","Mark Hughes","Yes. Thank you, good morning.","Patrick Gallagher","Good morning.","Mark Hughes","Any change in underlying claims frequent your severity within the risk management business?","Patrick Gallagher","No, not really. I mean, claims frequency's probably up 1% and that severity has not shown any real change.","Mark Hughes","And then the medical professional liability, you talked about professional lines being up about medical professional?","Patrick Gallagher","Medical professional's kind of flat.","Mark Hughes","And then whole sale, I think you had in your opening comments that retail was above average wholesale, below average in terms of growth. Is that a change from the recent trend that it decelerated this quarter?","Doug Howell","Yes. There is that, no, it's been about this same. There is one program in particular in our trucking business that if you recall we've talked about this before that the carriers have kind of come in and out of that and so we lost our market on it. That pushes back a little bit, there's markets that are coming back into the space now when pricing's a little bit more reasonable.","So, I would say that we see that it tends to be a little bit more of a volatile business than let's say our basic brokerage retail space. So, when a market comes in and out of a space it does tell you. Till the last few quarters the trucking business kind of held us back a little bit on that but still close in those single digits is good for that space right now.","Mark Hughes","And then, what did you say your available cash was at the --.","Doug Howell","We're pushing $300 million right now.","Mark Hughes","$300 million, okay. Thank you, very much.","Doug Howell","Thanks, Mark.","Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ryan Tunis of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Crystal Lu in for Ryan. I just have a question on the acquisition this quarter. The case of acquisition seem to upload a little bit and even though the year-to-date is basically on pace as a year ago. I thought that the target is goal is to spend about $800 million on acquisitions this year.","Is that still what you're targeting to spend more than you spend in 2016?","Patrick Gallagher","Well, Crystal, this is Pat. Let me address the number of deals and then I'll let Doug talk about the amount we'll spend on them. The merger and acquisition process is a sales process just like when we go out and get new cars. And these things it's not like you get to turn on this big and say we'll do six this month and next month we'll do seven.","I mean, these are entrepreneurs that are selling their baby and we get that. And they're not coming aboard until they're ready and we got to do out due diligence. So, doing the number that we've done this year is still a very good pace for us. And if it accelerates a little bit in the second half great and if it slows down a little bit that's fine too.","We want to get the right partners on the boat and we're not just trying to do deals.","Doug Howell","No, I think from cash flow standpoint we do still see ourselves spending $700 million to $800 million on deals this year if they -- if depending on the pipeline develops the way we think it will, we still see a lot of deals in that sub eight multiple range that we really like tuck-in acquisitions.","And if it's a little lower than last year, it wouldn\u2019t be by much, if it's a little more than last year, it wouldn\u2019t be much either. And triply if we ended up with a situation where we didn\u2019t have so much, may we buy stock back with that, would have to look at what our pipeline would be for the first quarter.","And remember, the one thing to remember is that historically our first half of the year is slower when it comes to M&A in the second half of the year.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, that's helpful. And the one other question was, I've noticed as sum of the margin expansion this quarter came from headcount control. Is this part of something that is a broad initiative that's happening across the company that you think will continue to the rest of the year or is it just something that happens periodically just one time?","Doug Howell","Now, we've actually had nice headcount controls for last couple of years on that. I think as our technologies are innovative technology that we put into the middle output layer come online allows us to contract our domestic workforce with having very good success with pushing work into our offshore centers of excellence.","So, that's helping us control our headcount. So, it's with the operational discipline of harvesting the hard work that we put in over the last decade become an operationally excellent company. And that's really what's happening, it's allowing us to control the headcount which is really important. If we get into an inflationary wage environment, that's a competitive advantage for us in that we've proven that our technology's work and that we can control our headcount for it.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay.","Doug Howell","And what's interesting is our quality with our customers has gone up dramatically even during this time.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you, so much.","Patrick Gallagher","Thank you, Crystal.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Patrick Gallagher","I'll just make a few comments and then we'll say thank you for being with us.

Patrick Gallagher, Chairman, President and CEO of Arthur J Gallagher & Co. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thank you, Donna. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2017 earnings call. With me this morning is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions. As we do each quarter, today Doug and I are going to touch on the four key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value. The first is organic growth; secondly, growing through mergers and acquisitions; thirdly, improving our productivity and quality; and fourth, maintaining our very unique Gallagher culture. The team executed on all 4 of our strategic priorities this quarter and resulted in a strong first quarter. Even though our first quarter is seasonally our smallest, I believe this sets the stage for another outstanding year in 2017. ","First, let me talk a little bit about the Brokerage Segment. First quarter organic growth was 2.7%, all-in, with base commission and fee growth even a bit better than supplemental and contingent growth. The 4.8% organic in the first quarter of 2016 set a high hurdle to grow against this year, and I\u2019m extremely pleased with this quarter\u2019s growth. Domestic property and casualty organic growth was a little lower than our all-in organic, while international property\/casualty was over 4%. ","Property and casualty rates globally continue to be a slight headwind, but are being offset somewhat by exposure growth. Taken together, rate and exposure reduced our domestic property and casualty brokerage organic by about 1 point. So we really haven\u2019t seen much of a change in the U.S. operating environment. Internationally, the rate environment varies more by geography. Pricing remains challenging in our London specialty unit, while UK retail continues to see modest pricing headwinds. On a more favorable note, Australia and New Zealand appear to be turning the corner into positive-rate territory. When combined with the modest economic growth, this is encouraging for our business. ","Our employee benefit and HR consulting business posted about 4% organic in the quarter. Our benefit team \u2013 our benefits teams remain focused on helping our clients navigate rising health care costs, uncertainties around the ACA and the challenges of attracting, retaining and motivating a global workforce. Our offering to clients and competitive position has never been stronger as we have a winning combination of insights, tools and service that our smaller competitors cannot match. When I look at organic going forward, I continue to see an environment much like 2016. There will naturally be some volatility from quarter-to-quarter, but right now, 2017 organic feels like it will end up being similar to 2016 or maybe even a little better. ","Second, let me talk about merger and acquisition growth. We completed 12 acquisitions this quarter at fair multiples representing about $63 million of annualized revenue. As we discussed in our last earnings call, we normally see a lull in activity during the first quarter. We had a terrific start to the year, benefiting from prior year carryover and a very strong pipeline. I\u2019d like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. ","As I look at our merger and acquisition pipeline report, I see about $350 million of revenue associated with over 50 term sheets, either agreed-upon or being prepared. As I\u2019ve said in the past, not all these transactions will close, but our pipeline remain strong and is full of small tuck-in opportunities, run by entrepreneurs with strong sales skills and excellent client relationships. ","Third, I want to spend some time on our productivity and quality efforts. I\u2019m particularly pleased that our large merger integration efforts are effectively done. This quarter, we incurred less than $3 million of integration expense, down dramatically from the $14 million we spent in the first quarter of 2016. The team has done a fantastic job of getting through this final push of integration. As our Global Chief Service Officer discussed at our New York Investor Day in December, we now are setting our sights towards sharing and implementing our leading-edge service model, developed in the U.S. with our units in the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. ","While never exactly the same country to country, we feel we can get our client service model fairly consistent across geographies. Over the next 2 to 3 years, we will leverage those skills and techniques to help our global units become more efficient, more productive and also deliver the highest quality in the business. ","So let me wrap up the brokerage business with these stats: 8% total adjusted revenue growth on 2% organic; adjusted EBITDAC growth of 14%; and adjusted EBITDAC margin of 24.6%, up 121 basis points over the first quarter in 2016, so really solid start to the year for our brokerage team. ","Next, I\u2019d like to move to our Risk Management Segment, which is primarily Gallagher Bassett. First quarter organic growth was 1.6%. We delivered solid U.S. organic growth of 2.5% organic, while our international results were negatively impacted by a law change in one program in Australia. Essentially, the law capped the time an injured worker can receive benefits and cost us about $2.2 million of revenue this quarter, which is over a full percentage point of segment organic growth. The law change will likely be a headwind for our international business through year-end.","However, we did have a number of new business wins in Australia that should allow us to post greater than 3% organic growth for the year. This past week, our Gallagher Bassett team was at the annual rooms conference in Philadelphia. Through interactive claims experiences, we showcased our outcome-driven approach to claims management, utilizing our proprietary decision support and benchmarking tools. It was a very successful rooms conference, and the team generated an extremely high level of client interest, including over 100 new prospect meetings.","Our Risk Management team also recently completed the small acquisition in New Zealand. This new merger partner will round out our service capabilities in New Zealand with specialization in property and motor classes. Luckily, in terms of productivity, the Risk Management team did a great job of holding expenses, allowing us to post adjusted margins of 17.1% in the quarter. This was solid execution by the team, as we continue to make investments in innovative tools, new products and the very best people, all aimed at driving superior claim outcomes for our clients and future growth. ","And now let me speak about our unique culture. I\u2019m very pleased that just a few weeks ago, we were recognized as one of the world\u2019s most ethical companies for the sixth consecutive year. We\u2019re honored to be one of only 124 companies globally to receive this award in 2017 and one of less than 70 companies to be recognized 6 years in a row by the Ethisphere Institute. Let me tell you, this award did not just happen by chance. We work hard to promote the values that were instilled in our company by my grandfather, Arthur J. Gallagher when he found at Gallagher 90 years ago. These tenants, articulated in The Gallagher Way, continue to drive our global team success today, and we believe that our unique culture is a key differentiator and a competitive advantage. ","Okay. A strong quarter, great way to start off our year. I\u2019ll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?","Doug Howell","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. Like Pat said, what a nice solid start to 2017. Today, I\u2019m going to provide my typical commentary on modeling, margins, clean energy, M&A and cash and capital management. Both of my comments will be using the CFO commentary document, which is posted on our Investor website. ","Let me point out a few things as you model the next 3 quarters of 2017. Starting on Page 2 of the CFO commentary, we provided our guess on the impact from foreign currency exchange rates on both revenue and EPS based on current FX rates today. For brokerage, you\u2019ll see about a $20 million impact on revenue in the second quarter of 2017, but not much in the second half of this year. However, that doesn\u2019t translate into much impact on EPS. About $0.01 or $0.02 drag in the second quarter, but next to nothing in Q3 and Q4. As for Risk Management, you\u2019ll see not much impact on revenue or EPS. ","Next, if you flip to Page 5 of the CFO commentary, where we show you the roll-in revenues for the next 3 quarters for mergers that we closed through yesterday. Then, you\u2019ll need to make a pick for revenues related to future mergers that we have not yet closed. And then finally, I\u2019d suggest that as you roll in revenues for future acquisitions that you use the mid to late-quarter closing assumptions in your models. ","You\u2019ll also notice on Page 5, and you heard Pat say that just a minute or so ago that Gallagher Bassett completed a nice little merger down in New Zealand, and we\u2019ve given you those roll-in revenues too. And finally, as a reminder, remember to apply your organic growth pick to last year\u2019s revenues after adjusting for FX, but before roll-in for a new M&A revenues.","Let\u2019s move to margins, adjusted brokerage EBITDAC margin expanded 121 basis points in the quarter. That\u2019s really terrific work with organic growth hovering just around 3%. Our international operations led the way with really solid margin expansion in the quarter and the retail teams in the UK and Australia are still hard at work improving their margins over the next couple of years. Looking forward, as I always say it\u2019s tough to expand margins of organic is in that 3%.","Moving to integration, Pat said it, but it deserves mention again. Our international integration efforts are basically done. We only spent $3 million this quarter versus $14 million last year first quarter. Looking forward, we have just a few small IT projects that are wrapping up by the end of the year that might cost us about $0.01 or so a quarter. Again, excellent work by our international folks for posting solid organic expanding margins, all the while putting finishing touches on our integration efforts.","Moving to the Risk Management segment, posting EBITDAC margin of 17.1% keeps us in the running for our full year pushing 17.5%. The team did some really good work to hold their expenses and overcome the first quarter revenue headwind Pat talked about down in Australia. That said, you heard it Pat say, we do have a strong new business pipeline in Australia that should help us a lot towards the end of the year.","Moving to clean energy, even with the warmer winter than normal, we had a solid first quarter, with net after tax earnings coming right around the midpoint of our estimate. You\u2019ll also see on Page 3 of the CFO commentary that we didn\u2019t change our outlook much for full year 2017. We\u2019re still forecasting a nice step-up from 2016. But there is a little bit of movement in our estimates between the second, third and the fourth quarter, so please adjust your models accordingly.","After-tax credits on our balance sheet, effectively a receivable from the government, at March 31, we have over $500 million, which will help reduce our future cash taxes paid for many years to come, perhaps even past 2025. One thing to highlight in the corporate line within the corporate segment, the midpoint of our guidance was an after-tax loss of about $6.5 million. We beat that by about $3 million.","All of the beat versus our guidance comes from more income tax benefit from the new accounting standard for income taxes related to employee stock-based compensation. In other words, we had more stock option exercises than we forecasted in the first quarter, resulting in more tax gains.","As for cash, first quarter tends to be our smallest cash generation quarter, but at the end of the quarter, we had over $300 million of available cash. Our efforts to unlock our bank account consolidation efforts and wind down integration efforts are clearly working.","As for mergers and acquisitions, we used about 260,000 shares this quarter for tax-structured exchanges, but recall, we prebought those shares mid-2016. You\u2019ll also see on Page 2 of the CFO commentary that our weighted average multiple cropped up to about 8.5 times.","There were a couple of specialty shops that commanded a slightly higher multiple this quarter. But as I look at our pipeline, I see this coming in for the year below 8 times, and it looks like we can fund deals in 2017 with cash and debt.","So those are my comments. Solid organic, great M&A, terrific margin expansion and an excellent cash position, a really solid first quarter that sets us up nicely for the rest of 2017. Back to you, Pat.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thank you, Doug. Donna, I think we\u2019re ready to go for some questions and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The call is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Kai Pan","Thank you and good morning.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Good morning, Kai.","Kai Pan","Pat, so first question on the expense ratio reduction Brokerage segment. If you look back since the third quarter of 2014, your quarterly run rate about $140 million, pretty consistent despite you being growing your business. So could you talk a bit about how do you control that expense? And can you keep a same level here going forward that you will have natural leverage as you grow your top line?","Doug Howell","Yes, great question, Kai. Yes, our operating expense ratio and then just the absolute amount, the teams done a terrific job as we start to take our sourcing initiatives, our real estate initiatives, leveraging our IT even this quarter, our ability to go on source our office supplies contributed in the quarter. So you\u2019ll see us being able to hold that operating expense ratio into the future as our sourcing efforts. We\u2019re getting great traction in Australia and in the UK, using a lot of the techniques that they\u2019re good at, we\u2019re good at, and together, we\u2019ve done a really good job of controlling those expenses.","Kai Pan","Okay. So even at sort of like low to mid single-digits organic growth like to be below 3% organic growth, if you can help this scenario, we\u2019ll still be able to see some margin expansion?","Doug Howell","Well, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve always said that if it\u2019s tough to expand margins. You don\u2019t have 3% organic growth in the brokerage space. And we\u2019ve done it \u2013 if we have long 3%, yes, maybe there\u2019s margin expansion in there.","Kai Pan","Okay. Second question is on your contingents and supplements. In the past two years, you\u2019ve been growing year-over-year about if you add them together, about 15%. But this quarter is kind of flat year-over-year. I just wonder anything that\u2019s behind it and because it\u2019s high-margin business was that \u2013 if they\u2019re slowing down, would that impact sort of potential margin expansion?","Doug Howell","Good question. Last year, we had a nice step-up in our supplementals and contingents in the first quarter that contributed to the 4.8% organic. Our base last year, I believe, if my memory\u2019s right, was about 3.5%. Our base this year is 2.9%, so it\u2019s not all that dissimilar on the base commission and fees year-to-year. Supplementals and contingents again, geography between the 2, I wouldn\u2019t worry about that too much. But in total, I think the step-up after last year and holding it this year was good. We still believe that there are opportunities for us, especially as we buy \u2013 continue to buy businesses to roll them into our supplemental and contingent programs. I think our relationships with the carriers are really good right now. So I see that line kind of being consistently growing. But it\u2019s always going to be a little bit lumpy.","Kai Pan","Okay. Lastly, just quick one and on the clean coal. For 2017, it looks like you're on track to achieve 10% year-over-year growth. Do you have any sense about 2018?","Doug Howell","Not at this time. We need to look at coal consumption. We still \u2013 our plants are running well. I don\u2019t really have a thought about that right now, Kai.","Kai Pan","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Doug Howell","Thank you, Kai.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good morning.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Good morning, Elyse.","Elyse Greenspan","I wanted to follow up on some of the comments you gave in terms of organic growth. You guys printed around us 3 in the Q1. And Pat, your comments imply you\u2019ll come in about last year\u2019s level, which was 3.6%. So I guess, how do you envision the step-up as we go through the remainder of the year?","And as you think about getting 2017 looking like 2016, how do you see the components moving forward domestically and internationally, especially as you point to the market potentially turning harder in Australia and New Zealand? And one other question on that front. Did you say when the wholesale organic growth was in the quarter?","J. Patrick Gallagher","I didn\u2019t mention it. Let me answer the first part of your question, Elyse. First of all, over the last few years, as you know, we built a much more balanced portfolio. We\u2019re now one of the bigger players in New Zealand, Australia, Canada and UK. So we get the benefit of that balance. Organic in the United States this past in the property\/casualty area was a struggle this quarter, and I think we\u2019re going to see some improvement there.","I also think we\u2019ll see some improvement in organic at Gallagher Bassett as the year unfolds. Our benefits business was particularly strong in the quarter, and I see that continuing to strengthen. Australia and New Zealand were strong and Canada was strong. So with that balance and really what I\u2019m seeing in the rate environment is \u2013 when I say that we\u2019re down 1 percentage point from rate and exposure, that\u2019s a great market for us.","Really, we\u2019ve been almost flat with regard to rates. To some up, some down property, in particular, over the last four years has been down significantly. But by and large, we have not seen the swings in the property\/casualty market over the last five to six, seven years that we\u2019ve seen for the last 40 years. And I think that\u2019s a great environment for our people to be out producing, and I think that we\u2019ll have a good new business here. We\u2019ve got a very strong pipeline. I can look at that in sales force. And the bottom line, it just feels like last year. I think we will probably do about the same as we did last year maybe even a little bitter.","Doug Howell","On the wholesale side, Elyse, first, let\u2019s define wholesale. When you look at our program business, our program business was basically flat. We have some commercial auto in there that the markets are shifting on that. You\u2019ve seen that in some of the carrier\u2019s reports. So as markets come in and out, that\u2019s flat, so they held in there nicely. Our open brokerage, I think, was over 5% for the quarter, and then our binding businesses were somewhere around 3% to 4% something like that. So we have good results across our wholesaling platform other than maybe in the program business. All-in, may be in the mid-2s.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. And then in terms of thinking about the organic for the remaining three quarters, do you guys have a view kind of following up on the earlier question in terms of how the growth you might see in the supplementals and contingents? I mean, they did see strong growth in the Q1 last year, but a bit more even throughout the year. So as you think about the organic growth for the all three quarters, do you think the growth within supplementals and contingents will pick up?","J. Patrick Gallagher","I think it will outpace base, commissions and fees. So I think that in total, supplementals and commissions will actually contribute to more organic growth relative than how it did this quarter. Also, one of the things about organic growth, other than maybe a year or two. In last 10 years, our first quarter organic growth has historically been the lowest organic growth quarter. Not just seasonality, but in percentage-wise organic growth. So last year, about one in the case and maybe one other year in the last 5 wasn\u2019t. So we feel as we lookout property, we don\u2019t see as much as the headwind this year, as we come into the second quarter. Of course, that can always change. So that\u2019s why we feel that this year, we should end up like last year maybe a little bitter.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then in terms of the margin within the brokerage business, I mean, was pretty \u2013 the 120 basis points is pretty strong in the quarter. From your comments, I know you pointed to pretty strong international margin expansion, but it doesn\u2019t seem like its anything on that\u2019s one time in nature that would potentially cause us not to see a good level of margin improvement when we think about going forward right there wasn\u2019t anything onetime in the numbers.","Doug Howell","Not really, no. I think it\u2019s just steady improvement. We are \u2013 our international folks are doing a terrific job of bringing the franchises together, working hard about trying to \u2013 we understand that their synergies, and there\u2019s economies of scale and they\u2019re doing a good job of getting after it.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then one last question, if I may, on the deal front. You guys mentioned pretty strong pipeline there. Have you seen any change in private equity interest in the group? I know last quarter, there was you kind of speculated what potential tax changes could do to deal prices as well as interest in the brokerage space. Have you seen any of that play out? Or is it we kind of waiting to see actually how tax changes in the U.S. will take shape?","J. Patrick Gallagher","No, I won\u2019t see any hesitation out there, Elyse. This is a frothy market. I mean, there\u2019s a lot of private equity money that wants to be in the brokerage space. And every single deal that is going to have private equity competitor, it\u2019s going to be a fiercely fought deal.","Doug Howell","But frankly, also, Elyse, those that we\u2019re actually courting and those that are actually merging with us have decided that they want to be with a strategic. They want our capabilities, they want our resources, they don\u2019t want to be a part of a roll-up. They\u2019re looking to sell insurance with us. They believe that their family and our family together will be better. So yes, there\u2019s price competition out there. And of course, that always keeps it interesting at the negotiation table. But by and large, we\u2019re looking for those partners that want to take a fair price to come sell insurance together with us.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you very much.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thank you, Elyse.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Adam Klauber of William Blair. Please go ahead sir.","Adam Klauber","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Klauber","Pat, I think you mentioned that the economy \u2013 the impact to the economy exposures pretty much leveled, if I heard correctly. Are there some regional differences with some regions are actually helping with some are more neutral.","J. Patrick Gallagher","I can\u2019t really pick out too much on that, Adam. I think probably the West Coast is getting a good lift. We still I think are still seeing some decrease in the whole energy play in the South and the oilfields. Northeast seems okay and Midwest is fine. So I think that bottom line, we\u2019re just feeling that our customers are, the businesses are in pretty good shape. We have a Board Meeting this week and we invited a customer to come in the board to ask to meet some of the actually work with us. And he was a small manufacturer locally, about a $100 million, $150 million manufacturing firm, U.S.-based. They do fire suppression work. Sprinkler systems seems like that and he was very bullish on his opportunity, so I think I see that, when I bump into customers across the whole spectrum.","Adam Klauber","Okay. Then on the benefit side, I think so the growth area is doing well. With some of the noise about ACA repeal and obviously, change in administration, has there been any slowdown in the decision-making or just clients pulling back saying we just want to wait till we see what\u2019s going ","to happen? Or is the market \u2013 would you say the market proceeding more along normal range?","J. Patrick Gallagher","No, I think the markets proceeding normal. Well, let\u2019s put it this way. I don\u2019t think that market seem normal since the ACA was instituted. ","Adam Klauber","Right.","J. Patrick Gallagher","We\u2019ve got 30-plus people in our compliance department, most of them are lawyers. And that is all around having to help our customers comply with all these regulations across the board. And at the same time, they\u2019re trying to balance that with the problem they\u2019ve got at cost increases, with a problem they\u2019ve got with a war for talent. So that is right at the heart of what we do for our clients. And that there\u2019s no stepping back from that. That\u2019s a constant concern, and it provides us with basically constant opportunities. ","Adam Klauber","Okay.","J. Patrick Gallagher","And frankly, Adam, the beauty about it is the small guys can\u2019t do it, right? So we\u2019re doing acquisitions in the benefit space. And frankly, I can tell when they come in, when I meet them, if they have met our compliance people or not. Because when they come in, to be perfectly honest, they\u2019re cocky about the ACA. They know they can handle it. They work, went there and sitting along [indiscernible] Once they\u2019ve met our compliance people, they\u2019re scared. So whole different deal, they go all, which must be advising our clients on all that? So it\u2019s a great opportunity for us. It couldn\u2019t be better.","Adam Klauber","Okay. And then on U.S. retail nicely acquisitions have picked up. How about growth in the producer force aside from acquisitions? Are you growing the force? Is it more \u2013 we always have a trained program, sorry, cut you off. Is it more from the training program? Are actually hiring from outside or both?","J. Patrick Gallagher","We\u2019ve grown our producer headcount three ways. First of all, really excited. We\u2019re coming into June and we\u2019re going to have 400 kids domestically in our internship program. We\u2019re going introduce 400 new young bright people to this industry and I\u2019m hopeful that we\u2019ll hire a good portion of those. So that\u2019s number one. And by the way, that\u2019s domestic. So if you had the additional about 100 globally that we\u2019ll do. So we\u2019ll end up introducing about 500 young adults to this business.","Secondly, we grow producer kind of courses through acquisitions. And you guys can see that every day, every week. And then of course, we\u2019re out looking for new people. And about 2 years ago, we started a program that the call Hire Right. At Hire Right is an effort to go out and find really good salespeople that are not in the insurance business. They can sell copiers, pharma, whatever it might be. Find people that have no call reluctance that really like to get in front of people and sell and teach them insurance. And that is going extremely well for us and is adding to our organic headcount in the producer force. So I feel really good about that.","Adam Klauber","So can you give us just a ballpark? Should the producer [indiscernible] acquisitions grow in a 2%, 3% range? Or is that a little too much?","J. Patrick Gallagher","I don\u2019t have a number, Adam.","Adam Klauber","Okay. Thanks a lot.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mark Hughes of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.","Mark Hughes","Hi, thank you. Good morning.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Good morning Mark.","Mark Hughes","What about the tax reform? Any early thoughts on what that could mean for the clean coal business?","Doug Howell","Mark, just repeat your question? You kind of broke up on us.","Mark Hughes","Yes, sorry. Any early thoughts on what tax reform could mean for the corporate segment, for the clean energy business.","Doug Howell","Yes. Actually, in the CFO commentary, we republished our pro forma where we took 2016 and we ran it assuming a 20% federal tax rate. So we did that pro forma for you. We published at January. It\u2019s still out there. We didn\u2019t update it, but we just pro forma, and history doesn\u2019t change that much. How do I feel about and it tax credit strategy, as I believe that the credits that we have will continue to have value going forward. I believe that \u2013 it\u2019s a credit, it\u2019s not a deduction. So $1 under older tax and under new tax is same.","And overall even with tax reform we\u2019re going to reduce our taxes even more because if AMT goes away, we\u2019ll actually going to use our credits even more. So I feel good about it. I think we\u2019ve got a good inventory of credits that have a long life on it. We have the ability to produce more credits also going forward. But remember, this law sunsets on credits in 2021. So we\u2019ve got four more years of generation on it, but I think that, that will create an inventory and warehouse that can stretch well into the late 20s.","Mark Hughes","Thanks for that update. And then any comments on line by line you would pointed out, I think property wasn\u2019t as much of a headwind. Anything else you would call out as being particularly strong or weak from your perspective lately here?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Well, I think first of all, the world of risk is certainly growing every single quarter. Right now, I think the one that is that gives us the most opportunity and the most concern is cyber. And cyber is a very strong offering and something that all of our clients really need. Property, as you know, has been down significantly over the last four years and now is really kind of relatively flat. Transportation is a bit of an issue. That\u2019s really kind \u2013 it\u2019s an issue to our clients. Those prices are going up. And then I think I\u2019d look across regular general liability, umbrella, et cetera, et cetera is basically flat.","Doug Howell","Yes, I think and I just give you some actual numbers. If you go back to first quarter 2016, commercial property by illustration, was off according to our data here, 5.1%. And this quarter, we saw it only 1.4%. If you look at marine, marine was down 5% in the fourth quarter of 2015. It was actually up 1.7 this quarter. Package is flat, commercial auto is flat, so professional lines is flat, workers comps shows a little bit of an uptick this one quarter. So you\u2019re kind of seeing that in the charts here where rates are that I\u2019m not giving you quarter-over-quarter negatives, I\u2019m given more flat or slightly up.","Mark Hughes","That\u2019s very helpful. Then I have to ask, any thoughts on clean trends within the risk management business, if you think about the kind of U.S. workers comp business? What do you seen?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Client\u2019s trends up about 1%","Doug Howell","Yes, our clients \u2013 our U.S. business was up 2.2% pretty in the quarter, so overall.","Mark Hughes","Very good, thank you","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thank you Mark, anybody else got them. Anybody else, Donna?","Operator","Not at this time. Sir, do you have closing comments today.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Yes, I do thank you. I\u2019d like to thank everyone again for being with us this morning. We believe we started off 2017 on an excellent footing, and our focus remains on executing on each component of our value creation strategy. We will grow organically. We\u2019re going growth through acquiring the best mergers. We will improve our quality and productivity and we\u2019re going to invest in what we believe is a strategic advantage, which is our unique culture. Thanks for being with us today. We appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day."],"2827":["Arthur J.

If you have any objection you may disconnect at this time. ","Some of the comments made during this conference call, including answers given in response to questions, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties described in the company\u2019s reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today.","It is now my pleasure to introduce J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr., Chairman, President, and CEO of Arthur J. Gallagher & Company. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Thank you, Rob, and thank you everyone for joining us this morning in our fourth quarter conference call. I appreciate you been here. We are sitting here in beautiful 45 degree weather in Chicago, a year ago we were settled under 22 inches of snow. ","2011 was a great year, and we finished we think was a very, very strong fourth quarter. At the beginning of 2011 things still look to be really tough out there, but during the year we continue to build significant momentum which culminated in a very strong finish to the year. I\u2019m proud of our team\u2019s performance in the quarter and last year, and I want to sight some key highlights for the group this morning.","All divisions, all of our operating divisions across the entire globe contributed to our profit growth this year. Brokerage revenue on an adjusted basis was up 22%, we were back with positive organic growth at 5.2% which is really, really good work, I\u2019m pleased with those results. Remember 2010, our organic revenues were down 2%, so a 7% turnaround is great work by the team. ","Adjusted EBITDAC up 27%, if you look at that organic growth there is a very simple calculation. We essentially had flat rates for the fourth quarter, we had a flat economy, zero really declined from the economy and the organic was made up of new business less our loss business.","Our Risk Management segment adjusted revenues up 13%; our organic growth was very strong at 12.6% which Doug will make some comments on in a moment. Very good work by the team, adjusted EBITDAC in the Risk Management segment up 22%. ","During the year our merger and acquisition activity, we had a record year, we purchased $277 million of additional revenue. During the year we did our largest acquisition ever which was Heath in the UK which is integrating very well. We finished in the Risk Management segment integrating the GAB acquisition all those clients are now up and operating on our claim system and our client retention is very strong. ","2011 adjusted EBITDAC with our Brokerage and Risk Management segments combined, we broke through $400 million market $428 million. 2011 supplemental commissions and contingents came at over $94 million which is outstanding work by our field management team. Business was strong throughout the year, but especially strong in the fourth quarter. We finished the year with 12,000 colleagues and over $2 billion of revenue. ","During the second half of 2011 we finished 15 more clean coal plant that will contribute significantly to after-tax income in 2012 and beyond. Total return to shareholders in 2011 was 20% and if you go back to 11\/08, what we view as the start of the great recession, total shareholder return is 70% including our dividend and our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend to 3% at the last meeting. All and all just a great year, I\u2019m very proud of our team. I think everyone contributed from all over the globe. ","Let me highlight three particular points, so I\u2019d like to add some color to it, and those will be the property casualty rate environment, our economy and mergers and acquisitions. And I will start with the PC rates. The Council of Insurance Agents & Brokers survey came out last week. It shows small accounts up 3.1%, medium accounts cost going up about 3.5% and larger accounts about 1.8% which averages out to 2.8% and that\u2019s pretty much exactly what we are seeing. There are some exceptions, catastrophe exposed properties especially the big wind exposed accounts are virtually in a hard market. In some instances we have seen a 100% rate increases. ","Property in general across the Board is increasing more than the 3%, work comp as a line of coverage needs significant rate adjustments especially in California, Illinois and New York. Management liability, directors, officers, etcetera in particular in the middle market is showing some firming. I think it's fair to say in general, carriers are resisting decreases. Now having said that I\u2019m declaring a hard market here, a great account with a good loss record one that hasn\u2019t shopped every year is likely to receive a very competitive proposal.","And secondly, on the economy, I\u2019m not an economist but my own anecdotal evidence as I travel our network shows that our clients\u2019 businesses are improving. I\u2019ve talked to a number of clients across many of our offices, whether it\u2019s a small contractor or a medium-sized manufacturer, their businesses appear to be improving and we are actually seeing some additional premium audits.","Finally, in mergers and acquisitions, as I said already, 2011 was a great year. Our pipeline remains very, very full. It does look like capital gains tax rates may reset in 2013, so we think we\u2019re going to see a continued strong interest in joining our firm. I believe 2012 has all the potential to be even a stronger year than 2011. As I\u2019ve already said, rate reductions appear to be over, organic growth is back after three years of reductions, the economy does appear to be improving and our merger and acquisition pipeline is strong.","But, most importantly, our team is incredibly energized. We\u2019re winning way more than we\u2019re losing. We\u2019re focused. We\u2019re turned on and the team is producing. We have a strong new business culture. Everyone, from myself through the entire organization, is involved in serving our existing clients and producing new accounts. We all realized nothing happens until someone rings the cash register. Doug?","Doug Howell ","Thanks, Pat and good morning, everyone. Hey, it\u2019s really nice to wrap up 2011 by delivering excellent financial results. Today, I\u2019m going to flip through the earnings release like I do and I\u2019ll give you some flavor on a few items and help you with some of your thinking as it comes to building your 2012 model.","Okay. On the first page, looking at the Brokerage segment, the big item is the Heath Lambert integration cost of $0.04 per share, which is in line with what we were expecting. Looking forward to 2012, we anticipate about $0.08 of integration cost for the year in 2012 and then about $0.04 in 2013.","Staying on the first page but moving down to Risk Management, as we forecasted in the third quarter call, we had about $0.01 of integration cost related to wrapping up GAB Robins. We\u2019re done and we don\u2019t expect any integration cost in 2012. I\u2019ll also echo what Pat said earlier. The GAB Robins deal is really turned out to be a nice deal for us and we have lots of positive thoughts about Heath going forward too.","Flipping to the organic revenue table on the second page and for the Brokerage segment, as you model 2012, please apply your organic growth pick to only the commission and fee line. Then please think about supplementals and contingents separate from core commissions and fees. At this point in the pricing cycle, we\u2019re not expecting supplemental and contingents to go up in 2012. Holding them flat in 2011 should be viewed as good work in this environment.","Now flip to page three to the Brokerage segment margin table. Posting margin expansion this quarter is consistent to what we\u2019ve been telling you. If organic is over 3%, you\u2019ll see a bit of margin expansion assuming a low inflationary environment. But below 3%, don\u2019t expect margin expansion, also one other important modeling point for 2012. Because our first quarter is seasonally our smallest revenue quarter and Heath Lambert is also seasonally smallest in the first quarter, please do not expect any margin expansion in the first quarter of 2012.","Moving to the bottom of page three to Risk Management organic table, we\u2019ve added a line at the bottom of that table that shows you organic without both the performance bonus revenues and without the New Zealand earthquake claim settlement revenues. Effectively, that is organic for core fees. We think that\u2019s a better number to focus on because performance bonus revenues can be lumpy and we\u2019ve been discussing that the New Zealand earthquake claims will begin to dry up later in 2012. So, when modeling 2012 revenues for Risk Management, apply your organic growth pick to the fee line only.","Next, assume between 2 and $4 million of performance bonus revenues per quarter and finally grade down the New Zealand earthquake revenues from about 4 million in the first quarter to about 1 million in the fourth quarter and that should get you close.","Turn to page four. I want to spend a little time on how we are viewing margins for the Risk Management segment. You\u2019ve heard us say before that we are targeting adjusted EBITDAC margins between 15 and 16%. We\u2019ve essentially hit the upper end of that range for the last two years and we hope to hit that again here in 2012.","Let me explain why you shouldn\u2019t model margin expansion in this segment in 2012. First, remember the business model. As claim counts grow, we need to hire more adjusters. Accordingly, as a general rule of thumb, 20 to 25% of incremental revenues hit the bottom line. So, if you do the math, you\u2019ll see that organic growth before 5% would not move overall margins much at all, especially if you factor in a bit of inflation. Even organic growth between 5 and 10% doesn\u2019t have that much impact on margins again, if you contemplate a little bit of inflation.","Second, also contributing to a flattish margin in 2012 is our Risk Management team is planning to invest about $5 million during 2012 to improve our service offering to our clients. Two examples include developing predictive models focused on medical management and fraud detection. Another example is building some new litigation management and return to work tools. We think these client-centric investments will help us improve our retentions and attract new customers over the long haul.","Let\u2019s flip to page five for a minute and then I\u2019ll come back to the Corporate segment on page four. On page five, we provide a detailed update on all of our clean energy investments. In a nutshell, we successfully built and placed in service all 15 of the 2011 era clean coal plants in the fourth quarter. Five of the new plants are burning coal under long-term contracts. We\u2019ve got an agreement in principle for another plant, and we\u2019re making headway on deploying the remaining nine 2011 Era Plants and the remaining two 2009 Era Plants. It will take most of 2012 to get most of the other plants deployed, but progress is encouraging.","Also, it\u2019s important to note that the quarterly earnings estimates we provide on page five are ultimate run rate amounts. There will be some operational tweaking that happens during the first half of this year, so we don\u2019t expect to hit those numbers immediately out of the gate here in 2012. Also near the bottom of page five, we\u2019ve added a paragraph about forecasted earnings from our 42% investment in Chem-Mod. Recall that Chem-Mod is the entity that owns the technology recipe used in the clean coal plants that we build and is also being used in plants built by other unrelated parties. As of today, we believe we could earn 2 to $2.5 million of net after-tax earnings per quarter from Chem-Mod. Looking forward, as we deploy our remaining plants into long-term contracts and other unrelated licensees do the same with their plants, we expect our earnings from Chem-Mod to grow, but we are not in a position at this time to make an estimate.","All right, with that on the clean energy, let\u2019s turn back to page four and look at the Corporate segment. We believe that the best way to view the Corporate segment is the shortcut table we put on page four. So looking back, as for the fourth quarter, the interest line, clean energy line and acquisition line came right in where we forecasted in our October conference call. The Corporate line beat by $0.02 and the legacy investment line beat by $0.01. The beat on both of those lines was because we favorably resolved some tax positions in the fourth quarter. So you should view that beat as one-timers.","Looking forward to 2012, here\u2019s what you should model for the Corporate segment. And the numbers I\u2019m going to give you here are net of tax, so the right column in that table. Assume about $7 million of interest and banking cost per quarter, assume about 1 million of acquisition cost per quarter, assume about 2.5 million of Corporate cost per quarter. Now, assume about 9 million of clean energy earnings in the first quarter and grade that up to about 17 million of earnings in the fourth quarter. And then I wouldn\u2019t assume anything for legacy investments at this point.","Okay, when you get done with that, back check what you end up with. You\u2019ll end up with a Corporate segment that should about breakeven in the first quarter, show about $0.02 of earnings in the second quarter, $0.04 of earnings in the third and $0.06 of earnings in the fourth. Clearly, a lot can happen to cause those numbers to change, but that\u2019s our best guess based on what we know now.","All right, for my last comment, just a reminder that our first quarter is seasonally our smallest. And once again, I really encourage you to convert your models to closely follow our financial supplement that we post on our website. When you do, please make sure you\u2019re using the adjusted numbers as your baseline for projecting future results. There\u2019s not that much difference between reported and adjusted in the first quarter of 2011, but there are significant differences in the last three quarters.","All right, those are my comments. The team did obviously a great job closing on 2011. I\u2019m looking forward to 2012. Back to you, Pat.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr. ","Thank you, Doug. Rob, we\u2019re ready for questions and answers. Hopefully some answers.","Question-and-Answer Session ","","Operator"," ","Thank you. The call is now open for questions. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from Yaron Kinar for Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank","I have a question or maybe the first question would be on the P&C markets and exposures, listening to a lot of the underwriters, it seems like they\u2019re expecting additional improvements and we\u2019re already at roughly 2, 3% rate improvement. I think, Pat, you had mentioned in the past that you are expecting kind of very slow and modest but longer term improvement in this cycle. Do you still see that as the case and if rates actually do improve more than, I think the 2, 3% rate improvement that we\u2019re currently seeing, do you think that\u2019s going to start hurting your clients\u2019 ability to buy insurance?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Yes, Yaron, I think you raised a great question there. What we\u2019re seeing at the present time is in fact that the 3s, 4s, 5s, 6% increases were accounts that have hurt underwriters. You can see more than that. But in fact where the market is hard, as I mentioned in catastrophe-exposed, wind-exposed property on any of the coasts, we\u2019re seeing exactly what we predicted. If the rates are up 100%, their drop-in coverage is 50%. I mean, we do not think that our clients in this economic environment can take a spike recovery that we saw in 2001.","And we are, in fact, seeing kind of a slow steady increase in that 3 to 5% area and it\u2019s interesting. I\u2019ve been to a number of our production meetings across the country. There have been times when carriers have asked for an increase. We\u2019ve said this doesn\u2019t seem warranted. We\u2019ve gone out to the market and in fact found the coverage back with the originating carrier. So rates are moving up slowly, but they are steady. It\u2019s across virtually all geographies and most classes of business with some additional cost for property and some of those other areas I mentioned in my prepared remarks, but we don\u2019t think that the economy and the clients can take a big spike.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And with that in mind, looking forward, should we expect like what mid single-digit organic growth in Brokerage now that you\u2019re also facing a little bit of more difficult prior year comp as opposed to in the last couple of years?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Well, let me put it this way, yes, if I get a flat economy and flat rates, you see exactly what the organic was in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re a new business machine. That\u2019s what we do every day. Every single one of us gets up every day and thinks about taking care of the clients we\u2019ve got and get new ones. If I don\u2019t have the headwinds of a bad economy and think about that 2008, 2009, many of our businesses lost 50% of their business. And If I don\u2019t have a 5 to 6 to 7% rate decline, yes, I will maintain organic growth.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then, maybe one final question again on Brokerage. You talked in the past about how anything above 2% organic growth and you should see some modest margin improvement or more. And, I guess I was just a little bit surprised that with 5% organic growth, margins only improved like 50 basis points.","Doug Howell","Yaron, this is Doug. I think actually we improved basis points in the fourth quarter 140 basis points if you exclude the Heath Lambert acquisition. We improved 70 basis points, if you include Heath Lambert which we know has lower margins. A point, a point and a half with 5% organic growth, that hangs together pretty well. ","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank","Okay.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Also, let\u2019s get this straight. What Doug has been saying to the street forever is 3% organic, no margin expansion.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank","Right.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Not, two.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Yes, and the Heath Lambert, I did not factor that in, that\u2019s a good point. Well, thank you very much.","Doug Howell","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Adam Klauber of William Blair. Please state your question.","Adam Klauber - William Blair","Again, great growth. So, in the first half, what was the first half of 2011, what was the headwind from written exposure?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Boy, all right.","Doug Howell","I can pull that out.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Throw us another question and Doug will dig.","Adam Klauber - William Blair","Sure. 5% net new. I mean, that\u2019s great. Any big wins in there or is that just a lot of (inaudible)?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Singles and doubles across the whole network.","Adam Klauber - William Blair","Great.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","And I\u2019m very pleased. I think what we\u2019re seeing, Adam, is that we\u2019ve talked a long time about our niche focus, understanding our clients\u2019 business, being out talking about our capabilities. Those things are really paying off.","Adam Klauber - William Blair","I\u2019d have to imagine that RPS was doing really well in this environment. Did that help growth in this quarter or is that something we\u2019ll see more in 2012 than 2011?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Helps very nicely in the quarter.","Adam Klauber - William Blair","Okay.","Doug Howell","Adam, the answer to your question is between exposure units and renewal, we were seeing negative 3, negative 2, if you combine those two numbers together and we\u2019re flattish now between that. And in the past, we\u2019ve said it\u2019s about 50\/50. So, I\u2019d say that\u2019s probably a pretty good guess for the first half.","Adam Klauber - William Blair","Okay. And then Heath Lambert, obviously that\u2019s not included in organic, but how is that doing from an organic standpoint?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Right now it\u2019s flattish, but it\u2019s hanging together very, very well. The integration is going well. It\u2019s a difficult integration. We probably moved 400 people\u2019s desks in London alone, just where they sit, who they sit with, where they\u2019re located, what have you. So, it\u2019s been a very active six months of integration. I think we\u2019ve done a terrific job of making sure those people feel like a welcome part of the family. And we\u2019ve worked very, very hard on that. I think things are settling in and we\u2019ll start to see some new business production. We\u2019re also seeing some teams of people and other acquisition opportunities emanating out of that.","Adam Klauber - William Blair","Great. And one last question. Other expense growth in the Brokerage was materially less than revenue growth, that\u2019s great to see. Anything unusual in there or can you keep other expense growth at a relatively low rate?","Doug Howell","In the fourth quarter, we did tighten our belts on some travel. In the fourth quarter, we saw an opportunity to maybe pull back a little bit on that compared to our first three quarters run rate. And the team did an excellent job of really targeting where they need to go and who they need to see. And we also had some pretty favorable business insurance experience in the quarter too.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Arash Soleimani of Stifel Nicolaus. Please state your question.","Arash Soleimani - Stifel Nicolaus","Just a couple of quick questions. Just looking back, it looks like natural gas usage has been increasing while coal usage has been decreasing. Just looking forward into the future, I\u2019m just trying to get an idea of how big of a risk factor do you think that is when it comes to the clean coal tax credits going forward?","Doug Howell","Good question. Well, there\u2019s a lot of different risks that affect our clean coal investments, so one of them is that coal could be displaced at a plant with natural gas. In our case, I believe that the plants that were put in, the utilities that were putting these plants in have a good idea about whether they are going to immediately replace those plants with natural gas and probably would not be putting these plants in place if they have that expectation. That\u2019s the first thing. Second thing, if they do displace coal with natural gas, those plants are movable. And we would find another utility to put them in or hope to find another utility to put them in and resume production. So it could take us out of service for a year on them. But at this point right now, we don\u2019t see that the current ones that we\u2019ve got in place are high exposure to displace sort of natural gas.","Arash Soleimani - Stifel Nicolaus","Right. So the numbers that you had provided on page five for the clean coal, are those best-case scenario or the quarterly after-tax?","Doug Howell","I think that the reasonable run rate expectations based on the plants that we know based on their historical production rates; it\u2019s a nice down-the-middle number.","Arash Soleimani - Stifel Nicolaus","Down the middle. Okay. And then my next question is just on to Risk Management. I guess, right now I think CIAB had workers\u2019 comp rates around 7%, market scale had them around 3%. How high do those really need to get for you to see an uptick in business in Risk Management?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Well, it\u2019s a great question. I really don\u2019t know the answer to that. I think that any time rates begin to run in the workers\u2019 comp world, we see more people enter into self-insurance and the alternative market. And that\u2019s been historical fact for the last 40 years. Do I have a specific number like 5% and then it\u2019s Katy bar the door, no. But what ends up happening in the work comp line is, when it goes bad, it seems to get really bad. And those rates tend to not run three, fours, and fives, but you tend to see customers really being pushed hard and that\u2019s when they will jump to the alternative market. So any rate increase bodes well for Gallagher Bassett.","Arash Soleimani - Stifel Nicolaus","Great. Okay. And then, I guess, the main reason for the lack, I guess, the reason it\u2019s more difficult to see margin expansion within Risk Management if that\u2019s what you were saying before, having to hire more adjusters rather than Brokerage, you don\u2019t have to hire necessarily more producers.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Yes, exactly. It\u2019s a very labor-intensive business. With every dollar revenue comes claims work.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Glasspiegel with Langen McAlenney. Please state your question.","Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","I guess three areas of questions. On your Risk Management, do we look at Q4 as a reasonable run rate ex the extra Australia, New Zealand claims or is there something else we should be considering thinking about the quarter because that was certainly a mini breakout relative to several years of results there?","Doug Howell","Yes. I think, Bob if maybe a penny\u2019s worth I mean, by the time you look at page 3 of 14 and you see the adjusted in fees relating to international disasters, it\u2019s not all that rich in margin. The additional performance bonus fees, that\u2019s heavy margin business. So by the time you factor it out yes, I\u2019d say that the Risk Management was a little hot this quarter.","Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Okay. On the tax line, if I use sorry, about this, on page six, if I divide the 17 million federal statutory rate into my calculation of pre-tax that gets to about a 36% rate before we get to the good guys, was that that sort of penny in Brokerage that was a little bit lower that you sort of backed out or because you\u2019re sort of saying 38 to 40 is a normal stat rate.","Doug Howell","Bob, I\u2019d have to retrace your math to see how you\u2019ve gotten there, but that number is intended to be somewhere around 38% of the number, so.","Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Okay. My model says that you had 47 million of aggregate pre-tax earnings. Actually I can\u2019t find complete pre-tax company-wide model in all your great releases.","Doug Howell","I\u2019ll work on it if you want to go to the next question.","Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","And then, we got the 1.7 million, 3.8 of other items. The 1.7 is prior year and the 3.8, other net what\u2019s in that?","Doug Howell","The other net, we resolved some tax positions and because of the mix of our business in certain states in the U.S. as a result of our clean coal production efforts and some other corporate realignments, it reduced our state taxes.","Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Okay. And that 5.5 million isn\u2019t broken out as a good guy on the front page, right, because you only do that for Brokerage and Risk Management?","Doug Howell","Pieces of those numbers are taken out. If that was released through the Brokerage or Risk Management segment then we chisel that out and we put it out as separate line item.","Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","So the $0.02 isolated up, but there\u2019s another $0.03 in sort of Corporate I guess?","Doug Howell","Yes, that\u2019s what I said. And if you look at the Corporate segment, there was $0.02 of beat in the Corporate line and $0.01 of beat in the legacy investment line and that comprises the difference.","Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Okay. Last question, is your run rate for financial services for Q4, is that sort of a quarterly run rate into 2013 or is there some seasonality in the pace of that?","Doug Howell","Say your question again, Bob, because you said \u201811 and then you went to \u201813, I thought.","Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","No, you said 2, 4, 6 your break-even 2, 4, 6 as sort of the financial services corporate trend line for 2012, so as we go into 2013, is that $0.06 quarterly run rate a good one or is there seasonality in that $0.06?","Doug Howell","I\u2019m not giving any guidance on \u201813 yet, but those numbers that I gave you have no new plans being signed up under long-term contracts.","Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Okay, so it could even go higher than that in future years or lower, I mean, compared to.","Doug Howell","Yes. It could go either way, Bob.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian DiRubbio of Y\/CAP Management. Please state your question.","Brian DiRubbio - Y\/CAP Management","A couple of questions for you, on Risk Management, Pat, how much of that was from increased claims activity versus new business that you guys brought in?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","I\u2019m going to throw this to Scott Hudson.","Brian DiRubbio - Y\/CAP Management","Okay.","Scott Hudson","A significant percent was related to the claim increases, I mean, we were seeing through the fourth quarter somewhere in the neighborhood of about 2 plus percentage points just in claim count increases. And we\u2019re also seeing marginal increases in rates with existing clients somewhere in the neighborhood of 2 to 2.5%. So, a lot of that is on the existing book. If you think about the new business, it takes a while that to take hold. So, even though it was coming throughout the year, we had a good new business year, we won\u2019t see the majority of the effects of that until this coming year.","Brian DiRubbio - Y\/CAP Management","Got you. And you have to forgive me. I\u2019m finding a little bit of a head cold this morning. The 2% claims increases, is that the biggest that you\u2019ve seen in a while, because I mean claims have been sort of flat to down in that business?","Scott Hudson","Well, claim counts were going down through 2008, \u201809, \u201810.","Brian DiRubbio - Y\/CAP Management","Yes. So is this the inflection path that you\u2019ve been sort of looking for?","Scott Hudson","Yes.","Brian DiRubbio - Y\/CAP Management","Okay. ","Doug Howell","And Brian that hangs together. The business insurance came out this week and talk about more frequency in the workers comp line.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","It\u2019s another one of my anecdotal areas where I look at the economy, Brian.","Brian DiRubbio - Y\/CAP Management","Yes.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Because one of the big reasons for claim-count drops was the fact that you\u2019re going from three shifts to two to one.","Brian DiRubbio - Y\/CAP Management","Got you. That makes a lot of sense. And then, Doug, as I was going through the release, are we down more comfortable with, I guess, Heath Lamberts contributing to lower overall tax rate in Brokerage?","Doug Howell","It will, yes. So, if you go to top of 6 of 14, we\u2019ve actually moved it down a full percentage point. We used to give a range of 39 to 41 for that segment. We\u2019re down to 38 to 40. And as that business starts to contribute more, it will have the impact of bringing the rate down slightly even more maybe in \u201813 or \u201814.","Brian DiRubbio - Y\/CAP Management","Got you. So maybe longer out, we can think maybe 37 to 39?","Doug Howell","I\u2019m not willing to go there yet, but you\u2019re welcome to think what you want.","Brian DiRubbio - Y\/CAP Management","Got you. And just finally, was there any FX headwinds for you guys in the quarter with the dollar strengthening?","Doug Howell","Nothing of significance.","Operator","Our next question is from Dan Farrell, Sterne Agee. Please state your question.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee","Could you just comment on current trends in the employee benefits business and if organic growth is materially different from the overall organic in Brokerage segment and then also just your outlook for that area going forward?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Yes, we\u2019re very bullish on the benefits business. Our benefits business has had a higher organic than the PC business even including in the fourth quarter. I\u2019ve said many times that the new law that we\u2019re all facing now under the healthcare regs is providing us with tremendous amounts of additional work. Our clients are now having to face up to the fact that these regulations are coming into being. It\u2019s I think putting tremendous pressure on the smaller agents and brokers out there which is helping us with our mergers and acquisitions. And underlying costs in health and welfare accounts are up. So, our organic there is a little bit stronger than the PC business.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee","Okay, great. Thanks. And then, just another question, just on the clean energy. Doug, when you guys are coming up with your estimates for what these can generate, I\u2019m assuming you have some assumptions for what you think coal price will be versus the other commodities. And is there any sensitivity that you guys do around the fluctuations? And then, any sort of ranges that we can think about tracking ourselves from the outside looking in?","Doug Howell","There\u2019s two things to think about. Longer term, tax credits can go away if coal prices get too high compared to a reference price. So, there is a phase out. We\u2019re well below that number at this point. It\u2019s not a real easy number to track and at some point, I\u2019ll have to figure out a way to be able to provide you guys that information. So, you can just monitor, it\u2019s not like you can pick up a Wall Street Journal and find the reference price. So there is that sensitivity. But really that doesn\u2019t impact the production of the coal. That\u2019s a risk for the credit to go away. Do you have a second part of the question?","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee","No. I think that essentially hit it. ","Doug Howell","Yes. I think right now, we believe coal prices are well below any type of phase-out level at this point. And so we think that we should have a clear site to produce over the next few years.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ray Iardella with Macquarie Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Ray Iardella - Macquarie","Quick question, I guess, on the M&A front. I know you guys had mentioned in your prepared remarks that 2012 could be a pretty active year from an M&A standpoint. And it already seems like you guys are off to a good start, but just curious, I mean, how much cash do you think you have available to do acquisitions in 2012?","Doug Howell","Well, we think that now that we\u2019ve got significant amounts of tax credits coming in, also we think a pretty good proxy for that is half of our reported EBITDA is what we generate. Of course, it could be used for acquisitions. Maybe 20% is better number.","Ray Iardella - Macquarie","Okay. And then just one other quick question, looking at your balance sheet, it looked like AOCI declined a little bit. I mean, is there something maybe pension-related? I know you said FX wasn\u2019t a big, big deal in the quarter, and maybe can you guys just remind us about your pension plan and kind of your assumptions there, that would be useful.","Doug Howell","Yes, it\u2019s great. Good question. And yes, we did have, if you look at the other comprehensive income line in our balance sheet, it\u2019s a negative $47 million. 15 of it relates to FX and the balance of it relates to underfunded pension liability. The reason why that changed and this is going to impact probably the rest of the world too, is the discount rate assumption. We move down from 5.5% down to 4.5 and that produced basically an underfunded pension by 30 million, which is really kind of peanuts in our environment here. We froze that plan in 2005, which in retrospect looks like a good move, but that\u2019s the difference that you\u2019re seeing there, Ray.","Ray Iardella - Macquarie","Okay, great. And then return assumptions on the assets. I mean, did that change year-over-year, or is that something you guys are keeping consistent?","Doug Howell","Not dramatically. The recovery of the equity markets probably took a little pressure off of that line. The number is 7.5% is our return expectation and I think that\u2019s pretty well in the middle point of the range for what people will be using, again, because of the equity balance in the portfolio.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Mark Hughes of SunTrust Robinson. Please state your question.","Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Anyway you can shape up for us, perhaps, the other opportunities within the clean coal technology. I think you had talked about, you expect maybe the Chem-Mod to make more of a contribution, but you can\u2019t shape it up right now. Can you give us a sense of the magnitude of the business that you are pursuing; maybe what\u2019s your historical win rate has been to something to shape it up for us a little better?","Doug Howell","You know, Mark, I think that anything that I gave you on that right now would be subject to such a wide range of possibilities. I\u2019d rather not do it now. I think I can give you a better answer in our April call. So, I think that I\u2019d rather just wait to see. We\u2019re a little downstream on that because Chem-Mod, while we managed that company here and that\u2019s why we consolidated even though it\u2019s only 42% owned, the other third-party licensees of that, they report to us on a lag basis and they\u2019re not all that forthcoming in how their pipeline looks because to a certain extent we compete with them because we have other plans that we\u2019re going to put in place. So I really can\u2019t give that to you now until April but we have some cautious optimism on that.","Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. Do you have a number for cash from ops for the full-year?","Doug Howell","Cash generated from operations?","Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Yes, exactly.","Doug Howell","Let me see if I can dig that out. Do you have another question?","Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","No. I think that was it.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","Okay. We\u2019ll dig for that answer and Rob; let\u2019s move on to the next question.","Operator","Our last question is from Scott Heleniak of RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question.","Scott Heleniak - RBC Capital Markets","First question I have was on M&A. Obviously; the entire sector there\u2019s been a lot of consolidation going on. And I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re seeing any newer players in there, banks and private equity and some of the other guys that haven\u2019t been as active coming back in. And if so, what is that doing to multiples in general that are paid for deals? Are you seeing any kind of big move and so, I would think that the multiple\u2019s obviously going up a little bit?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","No, actually we\u2019re not seeing a lot of multiple move. You\u2019ve got our usual competitors have a very interesting kind of market out there when you look at M&A. As I said in my remarks, there is 18,000 agents and brokers or some number like that. We get that number from Hales & Associates in the United States alone. So, you got to at least to have doubled that globally and we\u2019re active in the acquisition world globally. And most of these businesses are run by baby boomers.","There is probably five very active acquirers and there are others as well. There is some private equity activity, very little activity on the side of the banks with maybe one exception with Wells. So, really what you\u2019ve got is a huge supply of interested parties. I don\u2019t want to diminish the amount of work this takes. We\u2019ve got people out working hard every single day and every deal we do, even if it\u2019s a 3 or $4 million deal, is in fact the marriage that\u2019s taken a lot of courting to get it done. So, our people are working very, very hard.","Having said that, what\u2019s interesting about the process is the five main acquirers, we do each of us have very unique personalities as companies and through the process we generally get to a point where that seller has decided where he or she wants to land. And we\u2019re very lucky and very pleased with those people that have decided to join our company. But that has produced no shortage of opportunities for our competition.","So, I look out over the next decade frankly and see just a tremendous amount of consolidation that\u2019s going to occur, both because of the baby boomer age situation, as well as the fact that the buyers, the clients are demanding a higher level of expertise. And it\u2019s just no longer going to be I think a decade from now, just that relationship purchase is going to be far diminished from what it is today. So, lots and lots of opportunities and no, we\u2019re not seeing a lot of expansion.","Scott Heleniak - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. The next question I had was you mentioned Risk Management, the increase in the claims accounted, up 2%. And I was wondering, obviously you guys see a lot of the claims activity comes in. I was wondering was there any particular class where you\u2019re seeing frequency uptick more so than others, obviously, workers\u2019 comp in the market, we\u2019ve kind of heard that anecdotally. Is there anything any particular class where the trend is kind of going much higher?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","No. The major line of business that we adjust is workers\u2019 compensation, but it is across all client types.","Scott Heleniak - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then, I was wondering the $4.6 million amortization write-down from the two acquisitions, I was wondering if you could touch on that a little bit more when those two acquisitions happen, and do you expect any additional write-downs for 2012 at all based on what you see here?","Doug Howell","Okay. First of all, let me go back to Mark\u2019s question. We had $283 million of cash generated from operations. And then now, let\u2019s go to the 4.6 write-down was two or three deals that we took small impairment charges on their amortization, unamortized intangible. Probably 3.5 to 4 million of it related to one particular broker that we bought. He is still with us. He is a tremendous deliverer. They were selling a product, a life insurance product that was dependent on borrowing some leverage from banks. That availability of lending has dried up for the time being. We expect that product to be back. It\u2019s a nice product used for estate planning. It\u2019s not viatical. So, we didn\u2019t meet the recoverability test. So, I\u2019d say this is as much an accounting write-down as it is, it\u2019s not a bad deal. He just has to wait for lending to become a little looser for him to get back into selling these products.","Scott Heleniak - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. That makes sense. And then, my last question was just, Pat, you mentioned a comment about some of the clients that you\u2019re seeing around the country feeling better about their businesses. Was there any particular sector, geography where that was true more so this quarter than last quarter? And any change in customer buying behavior as a result?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","I think, probably, where I\u2019ve had the most opportunity to interact with clients has been in the Midwest and I think the Midwest has sort of led the improvement. But, we are seeing improvement in a number of our businesses across all of our geographies. The buying pattern that we are seeing that is important to note is that where we are seeing a spike in pricing and this is particularly a catastrophe-exposed property, clients are buying less cover and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been saying all along. If this thing spikes as it did in 2001, if we have a violent rate increase environment, clients are going to buy less coverage.","Operator","And we have no further questions, Mr. Gallagher.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","All right. Then I\u2019d like to make just a few quick wrap-up comments. Again, thank you, everybody for being with us this morning. I want to just remind all the listeners that we\u2019re very focused on four things strategically. Number one, organic growth; number two, mergers and acquisitions; number three, productivity and quality; and finally, maintaining what we know is a very unique culture and I want to touch on each of those very briefly.","As it relates to organic growth, every single office, every division, every person, everyday is taking care of clients and looking for new ones. When it comes to mergers and acquisitions, I\u2019ve already mentioned the fact that the pipeline is very full. Most of these are baby boomers, but more importantly, I think it\u2019s the capabilities that we built as a company that are attracting people because they know once they joined Gallagher, they can actually grow their business significantly. That pipeline is strong.","As it relates to productivity and quality, if you go all the way back to 2008, which is essentially what we believe the beginning of the great recession, we\u2019ve built our high quality service centers offshore and we\u2019ve actually increased our margin in this very difficult economic time.","And fourthly, we worked very hard to maintain what we know is a unique culture. This company has something special. It is the ball team. We\u2019re together. This culture keeps us together in good times and in tough times, and good times and bad times, we\u2019ve stayed focus on those four strategies that we continue to believe will create growth for our shareholders. We\u2019ve never wavered in that belief and that\u2019s what we\u2019re concentrating on as we go into 2012, which we believe we can build on the success of 2011 very well. So, we\u2019re looking forward to 2012. We appreciate your being with us this morning.","Thanks very much and have a great day. Thanks, Rob.","Operator","Thank you.

Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today.","It is now my pleasure to introduce J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr., Chairman, President, and CEO of Arthur J. Gallagher and Company. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","","Thank you, (Claudia), and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter conference call and thank you for being with us this morning. This morning, I'm joined by Doug Howell, Chief Financial Officer as well as the heads of our operating businesses.","As we usually do, I'll add some color to the quarter, Doug will make some additional comments, and we'll move quickly to questions and answers. As I said in our press release, I am really very pleased with the performance in the quarter and frankly, year to date. I feel like we're hitting on all cylinders.","All of our operating divisions contributed to our growth in the quarter. Adjusted brokerage revenue's up 18%. Five percent organic is a solid result. Adjusted brokerage EBITDAC up 21% is simply outstanding. Seventy-two basis points of margin improvement illustrates the leverage that this business enjoys.","Year to date, we've completed 32 acquisitions, which will bring in over $130 million of revenue. All in all, a strong quarter in brokerage.","Our risk management segment is also very strong this quarter. Revenue's up 7% and base organic fees up over 8%. Adjusted EBITDAC up 11% and our margin expanded by 50 basis points.","So all in when I put both our operating segments together, brokerage and risk management, we had adjusted revenue growth of 15% and adjusted EBITDAC growth of 20%. ","These results don't just happen. They happen because our great team gets up every day everywhere around the world and works hard for our clients. I could not be prouder of the team. Our unique Gallagher culture is alive and well as we continue to grow our business","Remember, every single day at Gallagher, we focus on four strategic areas; the first is organic growth. We have over 140 interns that are winding up their internship this week, very exciting summer. Secondly, we focus on mergers and acquisitions. We've had a solid six months.","Thirdly, operational excellence in productivity. We had margins expansion again this quarter and fourthly, our culture which we believe we have a very unique team-oriented global culture that we continue to foster. The organization performed nicely the first half of this year in all four key strategic areas. ","Let me add some more color to our operations. Property casualty retail continues to show organic growth around the world and in the United States. We continue to see rate increases. The Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers quarterly survey came out this week. ","The major lines that we placed \u2013 work comp, property, commercial auto, general liability, and umbrella are up approximately 5.3% for the quarter for a sequential gain of 60 basis points over Q1. This is not \u2013 and this is very important. This is not a classic hard market. Frankly, that's a very good thing for us, our clients, and our markets.","This is my fourth cycle. We don't want to see 100% rate increases and big cutbacks in coverage. The industry is not reacting to balance sheet problems but rather the income statement and loss ratio concerns. An environment of incremental rate growth is ideal for us. If we had a 4% rate gain per current quarter per year for a number of years, that would produce an opportunity for organic growth each and every quarter.","New business was strong in the quarter. Our retention remains nicely in the mid-90s and I think that speaks volumes about our aggressive sales and service capabilities and we continue to see our customers' businesses stabilizing to growing slightly. We did not see our clients adding employees so there's still caution in the marketplace but we are seeing additional premium audits which is a good sign.","Our wholesale and NGA business had a very strong quarter with solid organic growth. This reflects business moving back to the excess and surplus markets and an increase in small business formations.","Our benefits business continues to be helped by the new health law. Now that the Supreme Court has ruled, our customers and prospects know they need our help. The compliance issues alone in this law are very difficult for our customers to deal with so they need our expertise.","Mergers and acquisitions in the brokerage segment has been a key strategy at Gallagher for over 26 years. We're thrilled that our new partners chose Gallagher. Each of the firms that joined us had a choice and we want to welcome them to our growing family. Our merger and acquisition pipeline remains very strong and we contemplate a number of additional transactions will close before year end.","Our international brokerage is also showing improving results. Our acquisition of Heath Lambert in the UK last year is proving to be a significant strategic move in the UK. We're growing the business with some very nice account wins and some additional acquisitions outside of London.","The Heath acquisition is doing what we thought. We're recruiting people we couldn't have and doing acquisitions in the UK \u2013 three so far this year \u2013 which we wouldn't have been able to do if Heath and Gallagher had not joined forces.","Let me move to our risk management business. As I said, a strong financial quarter, great client retention and globally, good new business propelled the quarter. Underlying our organic growth, we saw existing client-to-claim counts were up about 1.5% and we're getting about 2% in rate increases. As our clients' businesses expand, we will also benefit.","Our international risk management business had another great quarter primarily in the UK and Australia. I'm convinced that Gallagher Bassett continues to gain recognition as the best provider of claims management services in the marketplace. I'm pleased with our progress and I'm glad two quarters are in the books. As an aside, we're up double digits on almost all important measurable metrics.","Doug?","Doug Howell","","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. It's nice to post another strong quarter. We'll start on the first page of the earnings release in the brokerage segment. First you'll see $0.02 of Heath Lambert integration costs and appending of severance. That's been lying with our comments from our last conference call and we heard Pat mention that we're on track and progressing nicely with integrating that merger.","Looking forward, we're still seeing \u2013 we're still forecasting integration and severance to run about $0.02 to $0.03 a quarter through mid-2013 and then we should be done with that.","Next you'll see we picked up a couple of pennies from acquisition-related adjustments. We adjusted our estimated earn-outs on 12 deals which totaled about $7 million of adjustments and we wrote off about $3 million of intangibles relating to three historical deals. Those net to $4 million which after tax is $0.02.","Finally, you'll see we booked $0.02 because we prevailed on a tax position related to one of our foreign brokerage operations. So while there's some ups and downs, it all washes out to about a penny.","Let's look to the second page to the brokerage organic revenue table. Let me put some flavor behind the 5% organic growth on our base commission and fee line. Our domestic P&C units \u2013 that's our US retail and wholesale units \u2013 posted mid-5% organic growth. Our international operations organic was up in the upper single digits and our US employed benefits unit posted organic of about 3%.","Moving down a table to supplementals and contingents, let me give you some help in modeling the third and fourth quarter. As of now, we are seeing total supplementals and contingents of about $20 million to $22 million in the third quarter. That's down a few million from 2011 mostly because of deteriorating loss ratios on a couple wholesale programs and another million or so will get pushed back to 2013.","As for the fourth quarter, we are seeing total supplementals and contingents of about $16 million to $18 million which is about flat with last year. So it's backing up to be another good year for contingents and supplementals for us.","Moving to page 3, you'll see that we've added tables that show adjusted compensation and adjustment operating expense ratios and both of those had nice improvement this quarter. We've added a table to put the computations next to the commentary and it also allows us to eliminate the full adjusted P&L columns from the back pages of our earnings release.","However, please note we are still providing the adjusted P&Ls on pages 5, 8, and 13 in our investor supplement that we post on our website. We really encourage you to use that supplement when building your models, especially the adjusted pages.","Moving to the bottom of page 3 to the brokerage segment margin table you heard Pat talk about but we are really pleased to again post margin expansion in this environment. Similar to the first quarter, we were up 60 to 70 basis points or up about a full point without Heath. About half of the favorable upside was additional supplements and contingents and the other half was from compensation and expenses discipline.","Next moving to page 4 to the risk management tables; organically, we are seeing really nice growth in our base fee line. You can also see that we had solid performance bonus revenues this quarter and you can see that our work on the New Zealand earthquake is running down quickly.","So when modeling future quarters, we suggest you apply your organic growth pick to the base fee line only then assume about $2 million to $3 million of performance bonus revenues in each of the third and the fourth quarters and then assume next to nothing related to the New Zealand earthquake claims.","Moving down the page, we've included an operating table like we did in the brokerage segment. Both of those had \u2013 we had nice improvement on our comp ratio but we got stung by about a million dollars in additional litigation costs this quarter which hurt our operating expense ratio a little bit. It's unfortunate; these things can happen sometimes.","Moving down to the EBITDAC margin table, we still believe we can post 16 points of margin for the second half of the year. ","Finally when you get done building your models for the risk management segment, step back for a minute and make sure you have contemplated that the third and the fourth quarters of 2011 each had about a penny of earnings from the New Zealand earthquake claims and remember, that program is effectively over.","Next let's turn to page 5 to the corporate segment and here's an update as you build your models. All of these amounts are after tax. First assume about $7 million of interest and banking costs per quarter. Assume about $5 million of acquisition costs per quarter. ","Then assume about $2 million to $3 million of corporate costs per quarter and finally, assume about $12 million to $14 million of clean energy investment earnings in the third quarter and about $7 million to $9 million of earnings in the fourth quarter.","When you get done, the corporate segment should show about $0.02 to $0.03 of earnings in the third quarter and show about break even in the fourth quarter. Clearly those are approximate. A lot can change, especially when it comes to wrapping up and rolling out our clean energy investments.","Speaking of which, we continue to work out the kinds related to those plants operating under long-term contracts and you can read that we are making steady progress on getting three more plants deployed. ","As for the other plants, we feel like our prospect list for deploying those other plants is developing very nicely. That said, these things take a while to deploy, especially as you put new plants into utility so we measure that in terms of quarters, not weeks. ","As a wrap-up comment, like Pat said, we had an excellent six months on all fronts and the team, in my opinion, is hitting it out of the park. If inflation stays in check, the rates continue to firm, and the economy doesn't stutter, we are well-positioned to deliver solid results. ","Okay, Pat, those are my comments.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","","Thank you, Doug. (Claudia), we'd like to open it up for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the call is now open for questions. (Operator Instructions). Our first question is coming from the line of Greg Locraft of Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Yes, hi, good morning, and very nice quarter.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","","Thank you, Greg. Good morning.","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Just wanted to get a sense with the top-line doing as well as it's doing and it sounds like some good visibility there if current trends hold. Can you talk about the margin potential for each of your businesses? How high can it go?","Doug Howell","","Oh, well, I think a better way to answer that, Greg, is saying that we believe that in an environment of plus-3% organic growth, you'll see some margin expansion in the brokerage space and when you look at the risk management's going to take a plus-5% environment to continue to grow to margin. ","In risk management, I wouldn't expect any margin expansion over 16 points for the remainder of this year and the brokerage space, when we have 60 to 70 basis points of margin expansion incrementally, that probably could hold true for another couple quarters. So in this environment with low inflation, you can get maybe 60 or 70 basis points of expansion.","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","OK, so just to reiterate, the threshold is a three on the brokerage side and then a five on the claims side.","Doug Howell","","Right.","Greg Locraft \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","OK, perfect. Thank you very much.","Operator","","Our next question is coming from the line of Mark Hughes with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please state your question.","Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","","Thank you very much. The Supreme Court decision, once that settled, did you see an up-tick in activity in the benefits area?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","","Yes, Mark, we did. I think there were an awful lot of clients that just weren't going to spend a lot of time and effort on this if the whole law was going to be found to be unconstitutional. We heard that repeatedly and now that they know this law is, in fact, going to go into place, there's an awful lot of effort that clients have to go through to get ready for it.","Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","","And then on the clean energy business, Doug, did I hear you correctly? Break even in the corporate segment in the fourth quarter?","Doug Howell","","Yes, $0.02 to $0.03 in the third quarter and break even in the fourth quarter for the total corporate segment.","Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","","Right, and then how do we think about that going into 2013 in terms of run rate?","Doug Howell","","I think that our 2013 position will be better than it was in 2012 as we get more plants deployed. Give me til October to give you kind of a firm number on that but I see the second quarter as being a little illustrative of what \u2013 probably illustrative of what 2013 would look like each quarter.","Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","","Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Brian DiRubbio with YCAP Management. Please state your question.","Brian DiRubbio \u2013 YCAP Management","","Good morning, guys, how you doing?","J. Patrick Gallagher ","","Great, Brian. How are you this morning?","Brian DiRubbio \u2013 YCAP Management","","Doing well. Just a quick question. I think you took your ownership stake in CGM up from 38.5% to 80% in the quarter. Did that have any \u2013 is that business meaningful enough to have any impact on any of your results?","Doug Howell","","It's not of the size that would cause any change in any of our organic or top-line numbers of significance and we do not include any of it in our organic numbers. So moving from a 30% to an 80% does not fuel any of our organic numbers.","Brian DiRubbio \u2013 YCAP Management","","Got you and just on the (Ken mod), Doug, any thoughts about your ability to monetize some of that investment in the actual company by year end or early next year?","Doug Howell","","I don't know If I can comment necessarily on the timing of it but I still remain with my earlier comments that there will be a time where we would like to monetize our (Ken Mod) ownership interest there. If you recall that we are now five years into \u2013 six years into our ownership of (Ken Mod).","As a matter of fact, a notable point is in June, if you add up all the cash that we've deployed on all of our clean energy investments since 2005 til June 30 of this year and look at all the cash flows that've come back to Gallagher, we are now in positive territory. ","The entire clean energy program is in positive cash flow territory at this point. We're getting good success on rolling out our plants and we think that (Ken Mod) has a demonstratable product now that could position it to be better owned by somebody else.","Brian DiRubbio \u2013 YCAP Management","","Great, and I guess just a final question. With the cash now that you're bringing in from (Ken Mod) and obviously the better operational results that you guys are posting, do you see the potential for you guys to be using more cash rather than shares for acquisitions going forward?","Doug Howell","","Yes, I think two things. I think our pipeline is so strong right now that we will be using stock in the near future. I think the cash flows that come off of our clean energy investments are exactly for that purpose. Remember, those cash flows are to go out and have us expand our core operations but that certainly would reduce the amount of stock that we need to use in the future.","Brian DiRubbio \u2013 YCAP Management","","Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Sarah DeWitt with Barclays. Please state your question.","Sarah DeWitt \u2013 Barclays","","Hey, good morning. If you could just talk about your view of the cycle and to what extent you think rate increases will persist, particularly if we don't have any hurricanes this season.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","","I'll do that and it'll be a great forward-looking statement but nobody knows if I'll be right or not but just as I said in my remarks, my thought cycle, and it's completely different in its feel and its look in any that I've seen before and I think in many respects, that could be a positive thing.","What we're seeing right now is, I think, disciplined management recognizing that present rates with no investment income to speak of, that they have to improve the pricing of the product that they sell in the marketplace in order to have any kind of return to shareholders.","Now that's driven primarily by two lines. Worker's compensation is a real nightmare for underwriters across the United States and property continues to be problematic. I think underwriters would tell you that three, four years ago they felt that the place where they could really get nicked on property was probably the coasts with wind and earthquakes. ","In the last few years, the center of the country is really hitting them and so there is an environment that I believe is sustainable in terms of getting rate increases across the book and there's not a balance sheet need here that says we have to dump all our clients or cut back on coverages and what have you. There's simply a discipline.","Now I'll make another side comment. This is the first time in four cycles in my experience that what the CEOs of the trading partners we have, the insurance companies are saying is exactly what we're seeing from the underwriting desk and there is significance discipline and I think there's just better information today than there ever has been in the past in this market.","And our people on the street are finding that they have to take these rate increases out to our clients. Now let's recall, rates today are probably at par or maybe lower than they were before the last market turn in 2001. So when we're asking clients to consider \u2013 not asking them to consider. Actually telling them that they don't have a choice because the market is what it is, to consider the fact that there's a 4% to 5% to 7% or 9% increase","They understand that. They thrilled about it? No, they don't want to see increases but at the same time, they do understand and the carriers I think are proving that this time around, they can get these increases incrementally.","Sarah DeWitt \u2013 Barclays","","Great, thank you, and then on acquisitions going forward, how should we be thinking of the acquisition revenues now that the Heath deal has (lapsed)?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","","I'll speak to the pipeline; I'll let Doug speak to the numbers. I couldn't be more pleased with the pipeline that we have. I've said that quarter after quarter and we continue to crank out just incredible work completing 30-plus deals so far this year. The team is working extremely hard. I mean, that's not easy to close, as you know, an acquisition and whether it's $2 million or $8 million, the work is still the same.","We've got our human resource people in place. We've got to integrate these operations into our family and we're really, really good at this and we now have \u2013 if you look at our investor slide at our website, we've got numerous operations that are expert in bringing \u2013 in sourcing, helping us price, and bring aboard acquisition partners and the partners that we've brought aboard this year are excited, they're turned on, and the ones we brought on in previous years are still with us.","So I think it's just a really, really good place as it relates to the pipeline and the opportunities to grow our business and rank position. Doug, you want to hit on the numbers?","Doug Howell","Yes, couple things. As you're thinking about the numbers, obviously you can see int eh press release that we've done 27 for around $100 million. You heard Pat say we've done another five since then that adds another $30-some million and I would say that we'll continue to be strong through the end of the year.","In terms of the numbers, one of the things about our acquisition program, it's going to add more amoritizations. So every time we do a deal, the departure between cash earnings and GAAP earnings gets bigger and that's one of the things I would encourage everybody on the call to do is to make sure you understand that amortization is going to be going up, that we're going to be using shares in acquisitions so we're going to have share create.","But by and large, the deals that we're doing right now are nice, strong, individual, team-type acquisitions. They're nice, tuck-in mergers with us. We're getting great production talent that are profitable organizations. We always say around here if they're not making money for their family, they'll never make money for the collecting guy, Gallagher Organization, and we're really excited to have them join forces with us.","They're seeing the need for our expertise and so the numbers generally are pretty good performers. So you see margins in excess of \u2013 we've even had margins in excess of 20% and they have some nice growth prospects ahead of them.","Sarah DeWitt \u2013 Barclays","","OK, great. Thanks for the answers.","Operator","","Our next question is coming from the line of Dan Farrell with Sterne Agee. Please state your question.","Dan Farrell \u2013 Sterne Agee","","Thanks and good morning. Yes, Pat, I thought you made a good point of gradual organic over multiple years being a good environment for brokers. I was curious when we think about margin in successive years if the multiple years of gradual organic have a ramping impact on the margin. ","I guess what I'm trying to get at is this year, you've talked about 3% organic being the threshold to start to get margin improvement. I'm wondering as you get successive years of organic if that threshold maybe drops to 2.5 or 2 because you're always reinvesting but you need to reinvest at the same pace or can it slow a bit?","Doug Howell","","I think \u2013 hey, Dan, I think you're right. I think you're on point there. If we have five years of 3% organic growth, I believe in this current inflation environment and the current workforce environment, you would have margin expansion even at a 2% or 3% level. We're still working very hard to improve our quality and our productivity and we're having some significant wins on those fronts still. ","We've got an engaged workforce at this point that I believe has been fairly compensated. We've been given raises along the way. So if a workforce inflation problem doesn't develop, you would have margin expansion going forward in this current environment but looking too much further than six months is pretty tough for us to do at this point.","Dan Farrell \u2013 Sterne Agee","","No, understood, and then just on the unrestricted cash, can you tell us how much is in the international versus US subsidiaries?","Doug Howell","","A hundred and twenty million.","Dan Farrell \u2013 Sterne Agee","","Is in international?","Doug Howell","","Correct, $120 million is in our international operations. We probably will not bring that home. We'll probably use that to fuel our acquisition pipeline in the UK and Australia, which is where most of that cash sits right now.","Dan Farrell \u2013 Sterne Agee","","OK, and I'm guessing do you feel as favorable on the international pipeline as the US, as well? I know you've done some more recent US deals but does that pipeline still look good, as well?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","","Yes, in my comments, that's why I mentioned the Heath deal. We would not've had the pipeline building in the UK that we have today had we not done the Heath acquisition. In Australia, we have a very nice pipeline developing and so I think you'll see us be active in both those markets over the next six months and in the years beyond. Great opportunities.","Dan Farrell \u2013 Sterne Agee","","Excellent. Thank you very much.","Operator","","(Operator instructions). Our next question is coming from the line of Brett Huff with Stevens. Please state your question.","John Campbell \u2013 Stevens","","John Campbell in for Brett Huff, good morning.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","","Good morning, guys.","John Campbell \u2013 Stevens","","Hey, so I was just wondering on the share count, looks like that accelerated a bit from 1Q and Doug, I believe you briefly touched on this on a previous question but was that share count increase more of just excess shares used over cash used in acquisitions or more a product of just less shares repurchase in the quarter and then just a little further on that, just give us a sense of what the company is thinking about for share repurchase going forward if you were to assume the stock kind of stays at these current levels.","Doug Howell","","Let's work backwards. We're assuming no share repurchases and we haven't been active in that arena in the last three or four years. The amount of shares we're using in acquisitions tend to be between 50% and 75% of the acquisition purchase price. We're putting shares in our merger partners' hands.","In terms of the share growth in the second quarter, we used about 1.6 million shares for acquisitions. We used about 200,000 in earn-outs and we used about 600,000 related to option exercises and just dilution as a result of our stock price inflate for outstanding options that are unexercised. So you can see that year-to-date we've used about 3.7 in acquisitions and about 1.7 million came from option exercises.","John Campbell \u2013 Stevens","","OK, great, thanks, and then just on the international organic growth, that seems like it's tracking along pretty nicely in high single digits. I mean, given the weak UK economy, I mean, you guys see that kind of continuing and then further on that, if you guys could break out by country kind of what you're seeing.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","","Well, most of our global brokerage business is in the UK and in Australia. We do have some brokerage business, of course, in Canada and Bermuda but the lion's share of it is in the UK and Australia and both those markets are performing in that high single-digit area and we think that'll continue.","Doug Howell","","Yes, we're having some really good success with hiring teams, especially in (heat field) right now but I think there's an appetite to join our operations over there in the UK and so we're doing a pretty good job of picking up some nice producers.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","","I think that there's sort of a feeling, at least when I visit the offices in the UK, that there's somebody fresh in the marketplace. We're not positioning ourselves as a Bluefin or Towergate roll-up company. We're positioning ourselves to do in the UK what we did in the United States, bolting on smaller acquisitions, giving people a career path, trying to recruit the best producers in the cities that we're in.","In Australia, we're very strong in Perth and Sidney, lots of opportunities to look in Melbourne and Brisbane for acquisitions as well as in Sidney and Perth. So I think that in both countries, we're kind of looked at as a fresh face in the marketplace.","John Campbell \u2013 Stevens","","OK, great. Thanks for taking our questions.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","","You bet. Have a great day.","Operator","","Our next question is coming from the line of (Chris Lakim) with William Blair. Please state your question.","(Chris Lakim) \u2013 William Blair","","Hi, good morning. Just a quick follow-up on the clean energy side. I saw that Doug mentioned the volatility over the next two quarters versus the run rate right now. Is that a product of the investments going on or is there some seasonality in the cash flows on the clean energy side that we should be aware of?","Doug Howell","","There is seasonality in the cash flow and particularly the reason why the fourth quarter is lower than our expectation of the third quarter is that we're not going to be running one of our plants in the fourth quarter as we look at it right now. As we take that down for further testing for maintenance and so now I say that now but if we have an extremely warm fourth quarter, maybe we won't be taking that plant down.","And it's really not our decision to take the plant down. It's the utility's decision but that's our best view right now. So I would say just normal operational running of the plants that we just don't think it's going to be quite as strong in the fourth quarter right now.","(Chris Lakim) \u2013 William Blair","","OK, great, thanks, and then on the acquisitions side, I saw you guys did the debt placement in July. Is that sort of an additional option on the table in terms of deal financing? How do you sort of weigh that versus additional shares and cash going forward.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","","Well, we thought it was a good opportunity to pull down $50 million. We had a maturity opening in eight years from now that we've filled in with the $50 million and we just saw it as a \u2013 our acquisition pipeline is so strong. Just taking that extra pill at $50 million seemed to make sense.","(Chris Lakim) \u2013 William Blair","","OK, great, thanks a lot, appreciate it.","Operator","","Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Brian DiRubbio with YCAP Management Please state your question.","Brian DiRubbio \u2013 YCAP Management","","Thanks. Just one final question Pat, with your comments about worker's comp and property lines being sort of the focus of price increases, do you see any opportunity for unbundling to occur with claims management?","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","","Any time the market firms at all, Brian, it gives us opportunity for that. For instance, a lot of our captive activity \u2013 we have an operation we call (Rtex) Captive Management seeing a lot more success. A number of our school and public entity pools are adding members again. So any time there's some price move, people are interested in the alternative market and we get the benefit of that. ","Now 4% and 5% aren't going to drive the kind of jump that we see in the alternative market when the market slams up 100% and there's no coverage available but it's a \u2013 any time there's movement to the positive, people are very interested in alternatives and the benefit of being part of Gallagher, frankly, is that we've got great expertise in that area and we've built terrific alternatives.","Brian DiRubbio \u2013 YCAP Management","","Great. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","","There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor over to Mr. Gallagher for closing remarks.","J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.","","Thank you, (Claudia). Thanks, everybody, for being with us this morning. We appreciate it. We know there's a number of other calls going on and I think our company has performed across all divisions extremely well for the last two quarters. As Doug mentioned in his remarks that the economy continues to show improvement and rates continue to move up even slightly, we believe we're on track for a great year.","The team has really turned on. We are winning. We're having fun building a world-class company and you know what? All of around here are excited because we believe we're just getting started.

Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer as well as the heads of our operating divisions. ","Let me just start by saying we had another excellent quarter. Our combined brokerage and risk management segments delivered 13% growth in revenues, 5.8% all in organic growth. Adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 66 basis points and we completed 14 mergers with about $85 million of estimated annualized revenues, just a terrific quarter by the team. ","Today Doug and I are going to spend our time focused on the four key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value. First organic growth, I'll review Organic by geography, comment on the pricing environment and give you some insight regarding exposures. Second, going through mergers and acquisitions. Third, productivity and quality. Doug will hit this topic after my remarks and fourth, maintaining our unique culture.","Okay. To Organic, let me start with the brokerage segment. Third quarter Organic was 5.8% all in which is similar to our organic performance through the first six months of 2019. I'm very pleased that all of our divisions globally contributed to this result. For example, our domestic retail PC operations had another strong quarter where the organic of about 5%. Our wholesale operations set an excellent quarter posting about 6.5% organic. This includes over 10% in our domestic open brokerage operations. ","Our benefits operations also had a strong showing this quarter posting base organic of about 4.5%. And then internationally our retail brokerage operations combined to post 7% organic with Canada more than 10%, Australia and New Zealand up about 6% and the UK up 5%, another really strong quarter of production by the team. ","Let me move to the rate environment. We've been hearing a consistent message, whether it's from our carrier partners at the CIAB and the WSIA conferences or from our global leaders during our recent strategic planning sessions. Rates continue to increase across nearly all areas of the market. Our own internal data also points to an increasing PC rate environment with global PC pricing up about 5% which is a bit stronger than what we saw in our mid-year internal pricing survey. ","Let me break down what we are seeing. I'll start in the U.S., rate overall up around 5% in our retail operations with workers compensation, the only line not showing incremental pricing strength relative to the second core. Within our domestic wholesale brokerage operations, pricing is approaching 6%. Moving to the UK, UK retail pricing is up over 3% to touch higher than the second quarter and our UK wholesale operations pricing is approaching double digits across many lines. In Canada, pricing is up around 8% with property increases more than 10% and finally in Australia, New Zealand pricing is up around 5% to 6% about a point lower than what we had been seeing over the previous two years, but still a substantial increase.","Moving to exposures, in early October, we surveyed our producers specifically asking questions related to their client's payroll and exposure units. Over 75% said their customer\u2019s payrolls and exposure units grew during the third quarter. And more than 95% of these respondents said they were seeing similar or stronger client exposure growth as they begin working on 2020 renewals. This is consistent with the results from our May, 2019 benefits benchmarking survey, where more than 70% of the 3,900 employers believe that their revenue would be increasing over the next two years. ","So when I look around the world, PC rates and exposures continue to move higher. This an environment in which our talented production staff excels by delivering the best insurance, risk management and benefits consulting advice by leveraging our vast array of resources and capabilities. As I sit here today, I see our fourth quarter Organic nicely in the mid-5% range. ","Next, let me talk about our Brokerage merger and acquisition growth. In the quarter we completed 11 tuck-in brokerage acquisitions with estimated annualized revenue of $70 million. I would like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing family of professionals. The brokerage team has had a very busy M&A year completing 35 mergers with more than $330 million of annualized revenues during the first nine months. Adding to that, we have already announced the number of mergers in October that should add an additional $90 million of annualized revenue. ","This is on top of our M&A pipeline report that shows $400 million of revenue associated with about 50 term sheets either agreed upon or being prepared. While not all of these transactions in the pipeline will ultimately close, as I look around the world, it's clear that our tuck-in merger opportunities remain very robust. ","Next, I would like to move to our Risk Management segment. Third quarter organic growth was 5.7% with similar results in both our U.S. and international operations. The growth we are experiencing is also broad-based by client type, including large commercial, public sector, alternative markets, and insurance carrier clients. Our investments in innovative products like the award winning mobile app GBGO combined with our expertise by product and industry continue to set Gallagher Bassett apart from the competition. ","Looking forward, we see mid-single digit organic growth in the fourth quarter. In terms of mergers and acquisitions, we completed three risk management acquisitions in this quarter, adding annualized revenue of about $15 million. These acquisitions provide us with incremental capabilities and services that will benefit our clients in Australia, the UK, Europe, and the U.S. I'd like to extend a very warm welcome to our new Gallagher Bassett professionals. ","Lastly, I'd like to touch on a true competitive advantage that's Gallagher's unique culture. It is a culture that helps us attract and retain the very best talent. A culture that promotes our relationships with our carrier partners, a culture that distinguishes us from others in a highly competitive merger environment and it is the basis for our people coming together as a team to serve as clients focused on doing the right thing.","Nowadays, we're hearing a lot about company culture and purpose. This is nothing new to Gallagher. We've long-valued all of our stakeholders as defined in our mission statement. Ultimately, we believe, if we provide value to our clients, take care of our employees and build strong relationships with our insurance carrier partners, our shareholders will be rewarded. Autumn line, our culture always has been and will continue to be a true competitive advantage.","Okay, a great quarter and first nine months. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?","Doug Howell","Thanks Pat, and good afternoon everyone. I'd like to start by thanking the team for another outstanding quarter. It really does position us very well to close out in the outstanding 2019 here in the fourth quarter. Today I'll make a few comments from the earnings release. I'll walk you then through the CFO commentary document we post on our website and I'll conclude with some comments on cash and M&A.","Okay, let's go to the bottom of page five of the earnings release to the Brokerage segment margin. For the quarter, we delivered 68 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. That's terrific result on 5.8% organic growth and this marks the 32nd straight quarter of Brokerage segment margin expansion, a truly amazing run and an excellent illustration how we're constantly focusing on raising our quality and productivity.","Looking forward, we would expect to see about 50 basis points of margin expansion, if organic growth is in the low-to-mid 5% range. Let's flip to page six of the earnings release to the Risk Management segment margins. During the quarter we posted 18 points of adjusted EBITDAC margin, that's really great work by the team but well above the upper end of our targets. So we wouldn't expect to see that in the fourth quarter, perhaps more like 17% to 17.5%, which would finish off a year nicely towards the higher end of our full year target also in that 17% to 17.5% range.","Let's now move to the CFO commentary document that we can find at our website. Let's turn to page two. Relative to third quarter estimates that we provided during our September IR day, nearly all of the lines came in very close, a few other comments. First, our integration efforts, mostly related to the aerospace and Stackhouse mergers we did this summer. Both are moving along as planned and on budget.","Second, we're making nice progress on our back office support layer transformation project, we discussed at our IR day. We've already contracted a few 100 positions and we have a nice line of sight into areas where we can lower our cost and improve our service quality by centralization, standardization and automation of most of our back office functions. We\u2019re redeploying these savings into processes to help us drive our organic growth. Sales support and sales management systems and tools, data and sales analytics, additional production talent, marketing and branding. In other words, all our efforts that will help us sell more, hire more and acquire more.","And finally still on page two, some modeling note. Please make sure your models are picking up our estimates for changes in estimated earn-outs and also earnings from non-controlling interest. Neither are big numbers but still can move your estimates by $1 or $2. Let\u2019s stay in the CFO commentary document, but flip to page three to the corporate side. Relative to the estimates we provided during our September IR day, interesting corporate expense lines were both within the range, acquisition expense was just a touch higher, mostly due to a couple of smaller international deals.","And then finally to clean energy. You'll see that in the third quarter adjusted results came in a couple million dollars above the midpoint of the range, a great quarter. Looking forward, fourth quarter is looking a bit lower than what we were seeing during our IR day. Weather thus far in October is not nearly as hot as last year, so we moderated our fourth quarter outlet just a bit. That said, it's stacking up to be another $100 million a year for this investment strategy.","You'll also see a clean energy adjustment line this quarter. The clean energy had a very busy quarter. Footnote two describes four items, we resolved a five-year patents squabbled with a great outcome, we prevailed in tax court, we opened new patent defense litigation, which we think is without merit, but we intend on defending it vigorously. And finally we're making terrific progress and moving three of our 2011 Era lower production machines into a really great 2009 year locations.","You can see this clearly on page four of the CFO commentary. In the fourth row on that page, shows the machines are currently producing less than $1 million of earnings here in 2019, but by moving them we can achieve $10 million to $15 million of earnings. Hats off to those engineers and operators that we use to make those happen, really a great job, it's also affirmation from our utility partners that we truly have an excellent process and that we are delivering substantial environmental benefits. Well, stay on that page four, you'll see that we are also providing numbers around what we think is possible for clean energy earnings in 2020, that's the far right columns.","These numbers are still in line with what we said as a very early month during our September IR day. You'll see that by moving these machines we can counteract the natural trends and power production towards renewables and natural gas. It's an early lug, a lot can change, but here we are a decade ladder and still looking at an investment strategy that can deliver great returns for a couple more years.","At the end of the quarter, we have over $950 million of credit carryovers on our balance sheet and at least another two years of production ahead of us. So we're well positioned to harvest those hard earned cash flows well into the mid-to-late 2020s.","Finally, let's move to cash and M&A. At September 30, we had about $300 million available cash on our balance sheet, this plus our free cash flow through the end of the year and our borrowing capacity should round out a year where we can still invest deeply in our business, pay a great dividend and still fund about $1.5 billion of M&A before using any stock. When I look at our pipeline through year end, I think we'll be close to that level and if we happen to go over, it would only mean using a very small amount of stock. This clearly demonstrates to the strength of our growing cash flows.","When I look out towards 2020, that looks like we can easily do another $1.5 billion of M&A without using any stock. So those are my comments, an excellent quarter and excellent nine months. Back to you, Pat.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thank you, Doug. Devin, we're ready for questions if we have some. Did you open it up?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Zaremski","Hey, good afternoon.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Good afternoon, Mike.","Mike Zaremski","First question. So as you guys know better than I do the \u2013 there's a lot of commentary about the P&C commercial market hardening and there's certain views out there that rates will continue to harden. I know Pat you've said that 5% is no hard market, and you said you got to go all the way back to 2001 to see what a real hard market looks like. Since it's been awhile let's just, if we had to hypothesize that rates just continued to move north, maybe you can kind of help us understand what a hard market would mean in terms of AJ Gallagher's impact on your financials and the pluses and the minuses?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Mike, yes, sure. Thanks for the question. First of all, you hit it right on exactly my line. This is not a hard market, It's getting firmer, there is no question about it, that when you get into some higher end property stuff on catastrophe exposed or places where there'd been losses, our people are working very hard to place those. Some of this stuff is getting done at the last minute, it takes more effort more submissions to more E&S markets to get it completed. We're seeing casualty take a little more effort and costs more money as well.","But this is not 2001, 2002 by any means. There is still plenty of capacity, deals are getting done. And remember, our job is to mitigate this for our clients. So number one, we're training our people across the globe, get out in front of this and explain to your clients that in fact in many instances we can show you that your rates are lower today than they were in 2005. So you've had a very good run, this is not a knee jerk. People \u2013 the rates that are being requested in many instances make a lot of sense, but it's certainly not a message that anybody wants to hear.","Now, let me compare that with what a hard market is. And again, you've got to go back to 2001, 2002. And that's when the door slam shut, you got people getting cancelled left and right, cancellation notices are going out every month, you're out trying to explain to your clients why they've been lost free and yet the x, y, z insurance company is not going to renew them. And they better get ready for the consequences of significant deductible increases and possibly the reduction of limits on a drastic basis.","Frankly, that's not good for anybody. Now I've been through three or four of those in my career and it's a little bit like going home and finding out the electric company just decided to change the current, none of your appliances work. And so that's not good for anybody and I don't see that happening. I do see disciplined need for rate and that is being explained by our professionals and were necessary. We\u2019re doing everything we can to help them find cover at a cheaper price.","Mike Zaremski","Okay. So as a follow-up then. So if we kind of get maybe goldilocks and the rates keep drifting up by just a couple points. I mean, do you expect, the question we get from investors is, will AJ Gallagher continue to say it's 50 basis points of improvement are \u2013 if we get into 6%, 7% organic territory, would you expect for more of the organic to fall to the bottom line?","Doug Howell ","Yes. Mike, it\u2019s Doug. Yes, I think that if you got over 6% for a continued period of time, you would see \u2013 you could see some more margin expansion than 50 basis points.","Mike Zaremski","Okay. Great. And just lastly I\u2019ve for Doug on the M&A sandbox. It's interesting there's been some IPOs of smaller companies that have been very successful and they're trading at nice multiples, there's one this week as well. Does that have any impact? And in terms of maybe making another pipelines robust, but maybe it removes some potential for some of the larger deals, if these companies find out that choose to go the IPO route.","Doug Howell","I don't know if it makes a dramatic difference or not. I think, remember, people join Gallagher because they see our capabilities, our resources, they know that being together with us that will be a better opportunity to deliver value to their customers. The folks that might want a IPO or go to a financial sponsor that's really not what they're trying to do with their business. The ones that we're trying to attract and we get 40, 50, 60 of those folks a year that want to come in and be better to Gallagher. So it could happen, but I don't see it pulling a lot of folks away from us.","Mike Zaremski","Thank you.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question?","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, thanks. Good evening.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Good evening.","Elyse Greenspan","My first question on, at your Investor Day kind of just a little bit over a month ago, you guys had pointed to, I believe a little bit of a slowdown in organic in the third quarter. I know Doug, I think you said last year was a tougher comp. Obviously the growth that you guys printed in line with what we had seen through the first six months. So did some business outperform relative to your expectations? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what might've changed in those few weeks towards the end of the quarter?","Doug Howell","I think that we did have a good September, we're talking about a few million bucks here. So, but if you really look at places that were particularly strong, our UK and London operations are really killing it right now, they're doing great, just saw a good growth in Canada. Now, if you go through where Pat talked about, where we're seeing some left there. But I think that September is a big month for us as December. So \u2013 and we did have a difficult compare and I was pretty proud of the team to grow over the top of that.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, that's helpful. And then, so as we think about 2020, it sounds like you guys are pretty optimistic in terms of what's going on with exposure growth, as well as property casualty, pricing momentum at least being maintained at its current level. So does it seem like 2020 can be kind of in that 5.5% range that you're guiding to for the fourth quarter? Just any kind of initial view there?","Doug Howell","Yes, I think that's how we're seeing 2020. Surprised in the 5%, remember that also during this time, as losses go up, you could have some programs that need to reprice. You could have some carrier decide that they're going to pull back on some stuff. So it's the repricing piece that's always hard for us to take a look at this far in advance.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. That's helpful. And then I appreciate giving the color on the clean energy earnings for 2020. So there is a $20 million range, which does seems a little bit higher than typical. I guess why is there a slightly bigger range and how should we think about, I guess, falling towards the higher end versus the lower end of that range for next year?","Doug Howell","Well, it's a long ways away, there's still \u2013 the utilities are still doing their budgets, we pulled them here during the last month to see if we can get an early luck. So we typically don't provide this to January, so I'd expect to narrow that range. But also when you look at the utilization of coal for electric power sector production, 2018 has been declining about 3% a quarter, maybe 4% a quarter. We had a big drop off in April and through June of this year in the second quarter, I\u2019m just looking at some of the statistics you can find out on the EIA. And they were down 18%, that\u2019s weather related more than displacement.","But if you really think about it, the line to look at is the $50 million to $60 million where the production related to those plants that were making us $56 million to $58 million this year, that maybe a 4% to 5% pullback in the numbers, maybe a little bit more. But between $80 million and $100 million, we're still really darn happy with us when we set out 10 or 11 years ago to do this investment strategy, the idea was making, call the midpoint of the rate $90 million in the ninth year, that's, I don't think we would have dreamt about. So we're pretty proud of that effort.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, that's helpful. And one last quick question. Your acquisition revenue on page five for the fourth quarter, the $116 million that's about $21 million higher than what you guys have provided at that September IR day. I that \u2013 it\u2019s like one deal driving that from either that was announced in the fourth quarter or is that just a compilation of some of the smaller deals you announced in the fourth quarter to-date that flow into the fourth quarter?","J. Patrick Gallagher","Elyse, can you just restate the question? You're looking at something in the fourth quarter, our estimates for roll in revenues $116 million, right? Is that what you\u2019re looking at?","Elyse Greenspan","Yes. So that's $21 million higher than what you had told us at the IR day. So is that \u2013 is there one big deal that you announced since then that benefits the fourth quarter that much? Or is it just more a lot of deals that were announced on since September.","J. Patrick Gallagher","All right, so I think some of its Q4 deals that came in, call it half of that different than we closed Q4 deal. And then also I think the JLT, the aerospace business, we've got a better line of sight on what we think is rolling in from that.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Doug Howell","Thanks Elyse.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks Elyse.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs, Please proceed with your question.","Yaron Kinar","Hi, good afternoon everybody. First question is around the EBITDAC \u2013 adjusted EBITDAC margin in the brokerage business up quite a bit year-over-year and even seasonally seems to be quite strong here. And then, as I recall, I think Doug you had said in the past that second half of the year has a little bit of a weakness just because of the salary increases or compensation increases that come in. I'm looking now at three years in a row where the third quarter is actually quite seasonally strong. Is there any change in how you were thinking about seasonality here? Any driver for a particularly strong result here?","Doug Howell","I think the biggest answer is that the team did a really nice job, we provided kind of put the clamps on hiring and when you're hiring 350 people a month, you can kind of control your competition a little bit by just putting the brakes on a little bit.","Coming into the end of the year we didn't want to get too aggressive on our hiring, that's probably delivering most of it in the quarter, which is a little different than typically we don't do that in the fourth quarter. So I think the team just got ahead of it a little bit.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. And do you think there's a timing issue here? I would just think there is firming markets and opportunities, maybe the hiring will still commence?","Doug Howell","Yes. We're always out there looking for producers. We're always doing that. I think that you're really seeing some of the economies of scale coming through. We did do a rift, if you recall some of that, \u2013 I wouldn't call 300 people a rift and 34,000, but we did a tightening of the belt in June and July. So that's part of it. ","But also we're just getting good results by utilization of our off-shore centers of excellence. We're getting good results with our technology lifts, it's just you get these economies of scale as you get in as the business grows.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. And with that in mind and as we look forward, do these \u2013 I think in the past you'd said, anything about above 4% growth should achieve. was it 30 basis points of margin improvement or 40 basis points of margin improvement, 5% organic growth we'd get a little more than that. So \u2013 exciting acceleration of that given the economy scale.","Doug Howell","Here's two things that we'll look at. We'll look really hard. The team's having a terrific year. So we'll look at how the bonus expense looks in the fourth quarter. I think that, we still feel comfortable if we're posting over 5%, we'll get 50 basis points of margin expansion.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. Second question, if I may contingent commissions, if the industry is raising rates in a rational way basically to address inadequate returns, I would think, should one expect that decrease in contingent commissions over the next 12 months.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Well from numerically contingent commissions, you could have a little flatten in the growth of contingent commissions. If you think about us, we've got hundreds and hundreds of contingent commission contracts out there all around the world that sell a business that's loss ratio sensitive, let's call it $50 million of annualized earnings.","If it flattens out, you'd probably get paid back for that in the base commission and fee line as you get some rate left and some exposure left. So overall all in Organic shouldn't suffer too terribly much based on what we're seeing in the loss ratio environment right now.","Yaron Kinar","Got it. Thanks so much.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Yaron.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Meyer Shields","Great. Two quick questions if I can, I want to follow up on Yaron\u2019s question and ask whether the deteriorating casualty environment that we were hitting a little bit about this quarter is translating into more claims, more liability claims handling within risk management.","Doug Howell","Of course, there's no doubt. We're seeing \u2013 first of all, we are seeing tort inflation in this path. We're seeing tort inflation across our book of business, in particular areas like transportation, sexual misconduct and D&O places like that. Our liability book and severity, in the liability book at Gallagher Bassett, it's both up in terms of numbers of claims as well as the settlement amounts that are being paid to close. It\u2019s clearly important for inflation.","Meyer Shields","Okay. And that sounds like it would be good for risk management revenues.","J. Patrick Gallagher","It should be, because a big part of what we're trying to improve in the marketplace and realize we're getting to a size now as the risk management claims provider that many of our own trading partners don't handle the number of claims Gallagher Bassett does. So we're trying to point to the fact to carriers, to captives and to risk management clients, if they select Gallagher Bassett, their results will actually be better. ","We will have a better claim outcome than they're used to in the general market. And we do believe we can stand up to that. So, yes, I mean, as people start to feel the squeeze and as the settlement costs go up, more of a reason to listen to our story.","Meyer Shields","Okay. Excellent. And second question, I guess if you look back I'm interested in how accurate past surveys of client growth have been in terms of predicting how the economy actually pans out.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Really, really good. Our people are on the street. And this is not a survey of a bunch of economists that are sitting in Washington, D C. These are people sitting across from customers right now planning for 2020 and they're not going to be pie-in-the-sky because the fact is when you tell us your payrolls and your other exposure units sales are going up, you're going to have a higher deposit on your insurance premium.","So that\u2019s a natural tendency to lowball. And if you lowball you\u2019ll get a free loan from the insurance company. So no, no, no, these guys really have their ear to the ground.","Meyer Shields","Okay. That's fantastic. Thank you.","Doug Howell","Thanks, Meyer. ","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks, Meyer. ","Operator","Our final question comes from line of Mark Hughes with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Hughes","Yes, thank you. Good afternoon, Doug, the $1.5 billion in capacity for next year, could you refresh us on how much of that you had anticipated just to be free cash and then how much you would borrow and then what's your capital cost would you imagine on that the piece that you would be borrowing? ","Doug Howell","Half would free cash, half would be borrowing. And what's our cost of borrowing, 4%, 4.25% or something like that. ","Mark Hughes","And then just to be clear, in the CFO commentary, your estimate for revenue contribution that is entirely inclusive of all the deals you've done heretofore, including I think you said $90 million in the acquired revenue in October. Is that correct? ","Doug Howell","Through yesterday, yes. ","Mark Hughes","Through yesterday, okay. Great. Thank you very much. ","Doug Howell","Thanks Mark. ","J. Patrick Gallagher","Thanks Mark. Any other stuff?","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","J. Patrick Gallagher","Great. Then let me just make one quick comment to wrap it up. Thank you again for being with us this afternoon. I'm extremely proud of what the team has accomplished so far this year and I believe we're poised to deliver a strong finish to the year. So thanks everybody for being with us today. We appreciate it.","Operator","This does conclude today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day."]}}
