[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mr. Chip Merritt, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for S&P Global. Sir, you may begin.","Chip Merritt","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to S&P Global\u2019s third quarter earnings call. Presenting on this morning\u2019s call are Doug Peterson, President and CEO and Ewout Steenbergen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","This morning, we issued a news release with our third quarter 2019 results. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at investor.spglobal.com. In today\u2019s earnings release and during the conference call, we are providing adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the corporation\u2019s operating performance between periods, and to view the corporation\u2019s business from the same perspective as management\u2019s. The earnings release contains exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measures and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.","Before we begin, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements. Except for historical information, the matters discussed in the teleconference may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates and descriptions of future events. Any such statements are based on current expectations and current economic conditions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. In this regard, we direct listeners to our cautionary statements contained in our Form 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and other periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.","I would also like to call your attention to a European regulation. Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of S&P Global should give me a call to better understand the impact of this legislation on the investor and potentially the company. We are aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Jason Feuchtwanger at 212-438-1247.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?","Doug Peterson","Thank you, Chip. Good morning and welcome to today\u2019s earnings call. We are pleased to report very strong third quarter financial results with all four divisions delivering revenue growth. We continue to generate significant margin improvement due to top line growth in the ongoing execution of our productivity programs, and this margin improvement is occurring despite the increase in investment spending. During the third quarter, we delivered a 16% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. Based on this performance and our expectations for the rest of the year, we are raising our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance, which Ewout will discuss in a moment. Share repurchases are an important component of capital return, and we recently completed our $500 million ASR initiated in August. And of course, we\u2019re always excited to talk about our new products. We recently launched unique technology innovations, including textual data analytics, Kensho\u2019s Scribe and several ESG-related offerings. I\u2019ll cover these in more detail in a moment.","To recap the financial results for the third quarter, revenue increased 9% to almost $1.7 billion. Organic revenue excluding revenue from the divestment of SPIAS and RigData increased 10%. Our adjusted operating profit increased 14%, and our adjusted operating profit margin increased 230 basis points to 51.9%. As you know, we measure and track adjusted margin on a trailing 4-quarter basis, which increased 200 basis points to 50.1%. In addition, we reduced shares outstanding by 3%, which contributed to the 16% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. Each quarter, we highlight the key drivers to our business and important projects under way. This quarter, let\u2019s start with ratings issuance trends.","During the third quarter, global bond issuance increased 12% with mixed performance in various geographies and asset classes. We also include bank loan ratings volume total global issuance increased 14%. U.S. bond issuances in aggregate increased 16% as investment grade increased 33%, high-yield vaulted 43%, public finance increased 15%, while structured finance decreased 11% with a large decline in CLOs, partially offset by gains in RMBS and ABS. Investors frequently assume that lower interest rates drive increased issuance. That certainly was not the case in Europe this quarter. Despite historically low rates, European bond issuance decreased 7% as investment grade decreased 10%. High-yield soared 61% and structured finance decreased 20% due to declines in CLOs, covered bonds, and RMBS, partially offset by gains in ABS and CMBS. In Asia, bond issuance increased 24% overall. On the fourth quarter 2018 earnings call, we introduced this chart to track debt issuance and global cash balances of the 50 companies with the most overseas cash at the end of 2017.","As you see on this slide, the cash balances of these companies had stabilized, while bond issuance among these companies is rebounding compared to an anemic 2018. There have been 15 unique issuers that have come to market this year so far. Even Apple returned to the market, issuing $7 billion of bonds in September. Our latest global bond issuance forecast includes an update for 2019 and the initial 2020 forecast. Excluding international public finance, which has minimal impact on our financial results, we now forecast 2019 issuance increased 9%. This is up from our previous forecast of 1% increase. This change was driven primarily by an increase in corporate issuance. On that same basis, 2020 issuance is expected to increase 5% with growth in each issuance category. After year-over-year declines in bank loan rating activity in the first half of 2019, bank loan rating revenue increased in the third quarter to $80 million from $73 million in the third quarter of 2018. We are frequently asked by investors if maturities have lengthened as corporate treasurers seek to stretch low interest rates further into the future.","This chart depicts average U.S. bond maturities for the past 19 years. While investment grade maturities have lengthened slightly in the past year, both investment grade and high-yield average maturities have been virtually unchanged since 2010. During our 2018 Investor Day, we introduced the framework powering the markets in the future, including six foundational capabilities. We use this framework to set our goals and allocate resources. I am pleased to share great progress on a number of the new initiatives in our areas of global customer orientation, innovation, and technology. Kensho has created a new product called Scribe. It\u2019s a speech recognition solution that transcribes earnings conference calls. Using deep learning techniques, Scribe parsed thousands of hours of audio files for Market Intelligence archives to develop its capabilities. It essentially teaches itself to become more accurate. Scribe\u2019s capabilities enabled complexities like enumeration, capitalization, and identification of sensors. Market Intelligence produces approximately 33,000 conference call transcripts each year. We recently put Scribe into production. It produced more than 2,000 calls in the third quarter and we are ramping it up to transform our transcription business.","Scribe is capable of handling 100 concurrent conference calls without any degradation in quality. There are several benefits described. First is productivity, with an average time savings of 1.25 hours per call. Second is improved accuracy, Scribe is considerably more accurate than the leading transcription services that we have tested. And third is reduction in turnaround time of approximately 15 minutes per 1 hour call. This means that the complete conference call is available to our Market Intelligence clients sooner, 83 minutes versus 97 minutes. While investors have used earnings call transcripts as a reference for many years, Market Intelligence has launched a new product to glean additional insights from conference calls. The product is called Textual Data Analytics or TDA. We published two papers, which provide empirical evidence that the stock price of companies, whose executives exhibited the most positive sentiment or provided the most transparency during their earnings calls, outperform the broad U.S. equity market by at least 2% per year between 2010 and 2017.","Our analysis shows that the Textual Analytics derived from earnings call, such as positive versus negative words, language complexity, analysts selected for Q&A etc., provide additional stock selection power. TDA provides intraday delivery, covering more than 9,000 companies with 40 different metrics on each call. These include an example of Textual Data analytics for major U.S. bank versus its peers on the third quarter earnings call held earlier this month. This slide depicts the scores for five of the 40 metrics. Net positivity calculates the difference between positive and negative words. Here, the bank scored worse than its peers. Numerical transparency evaluates the proportion of numbers versus words. The bank provided a higher level of transparency by using more numbers than its peers to show rather than use words to tell. Language complexity was lower for the bank. Conference calls with more complex language are generally associated with either poor results or other negative issues. Analyst favoritism assesses which analysts had buy, hold or sell ratings and which were selected to ask questions. The bank here showed less favoritism than its peers by including more analysts who were bearish. Sentiment differential analyzes the difference between the net positivity score in the prepared remarks versus the Q&A session. Here, the bank\u2019s sentiment differential was more negative during the Q&A responses relative to the prepared remarks than its peers.","There are several other interesting new product launches under way. Over the past 5 years, Platts has seen significant expansion of our coverage of seaborne freight rates. The team covers tanker, dry bulk, and container freight markets, which are used in physical contracts and is a settlement basis for forward freight agreement derivative contracts. The latest addition is the Cape T4 Index for dry freight rates. The Platts Cape T4 Index is based on trade flow volume and captures the movement of widely consumed commodities, such as iron ore and coal, to highlight physical spot market trading activity.","Next, in advance of the implementation of the 0.5% sulfur cap by the International Maritime Organization or IMO in January 2020, the ICE and CME exchanges launched a total of more than a dozen new marine fuel 0.5% futures contracts that settle against price assessments recently launched by Platts. Trucost has launched climate and physical risk analytics. A combination of voluntary initiatives such as TCFD and regulations in certain countries are driving investor demand for increasingly sophisticated portfolio-level climate analytics, covering all asset classes. Climate Risk Analytics adds new scenario analysis around two principal areas. The first is carbon, where Trucost data helps evaluate the earnings at risk from future carbon pricing scenario. The second is a two-degree alignment assessment. Since portfolios are not homogenously exposed to carbon price risk, it\u2019s necessary to better understand the individual portfolio variations from a two-degree scenario. In addition, Trucost climate change physical risk dataset helps companies and investors understand their exposure to physical risks and report in line with TCFD recommendations. Our coverage extends to more than 15,000 companies and includes six climate change physical risk indicators including heat waves, cold waves, droughts, hurricanes, wildfires, and river and coastal flooding. And last is the upcoming launch of E-mini S&P 500 ESG futures at CME. We highlighted the creation of this index on our first quarter earnings call. It\u2019s great to see that so soon after its introduction, a new futures contract is already being launched utilizing the S&P 500 ESG Index as its benchmark.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who is going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and our outlook. Ewout?","Ewout Steenbergen","Thank you, Doug and good morning to all of you on the call. Let me start with our third quarter financial results. Doug covered the highlights of strong revenue and adjusted earnings per share growth. I will take a moment to cover a few other items. While reported revenue increased 9%, organic revenue increased 10%. Adjusted operating profit margin improved 230 basis points based on strong revenue growth and ongoing productivity programs partially offset by the impact of increased investment in growth initiatives. Interest expense decreased 16% due to a reduction of FIN 48 interest accruals associated with tax audits and increased foreign interest income. Share repurchases continue to be an important element of our capital return program. These actions resulted in a 3% decline in our diluted weighted average shares outstanding.","We recently completed our August $500 million ASR. And in October, we have been repurchasing shares in the open market through a 10b5-1 program. We expect to continue to repurchase shares through this 10b5-1 during the fourth quarter. Stock options associated with 125,000 shares were exercised during the third quarter. This resulted in a stock-based compensation tax benefit on EPS of $0.02. Year-to-date, stock option activity is running well ahead of last year. However, as the number of employee stock options continues to decline, we expect a reduction in the tax benefit generated by stock option exercises. During the quarter, changes in foreign exchange rates had a negligible impact on adjusted EPS. The only meaningful impact was on ratings revenue, primarily due to the weakening of the euro and the British pounds. There were three non-GAAP adjustments this quarter that collectively generated a pre-tax gain, $49 million from gains on divestments of RigData and SPIAS, $6 million in Kensho retention-related expenses, and $29 million in deal-related amortization.","This is a slide that we shared at our Investor Day in May 2018. It depicts a framework that we outlined to show the areas where we most impact shareholder value. The first two require investments. We need to continue to invest to fuel revenue momentum with product innovations, new technology, new datasets, and outreach to new customers in new geographies. We have made great progress delivering EBITDA enhancement, and we continue to fund new organic opportunities to drive additional productivity gains. Driving financial leverage involves optimizing interest cost, reducing shares outstanding, and optimizing the tax rate.","And finally, we want to return capital to shareholders while maintaining flexible debt capacity. We are committed to returning at least 75% of annual free cash flow to shareholders each year. This quarter, all four deficients delivered revenue growth with ratings and indices delivering double-digit gains. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, adjusted operating profit margin increased for all four divisions. However, during the third quarter, Market Intelligence did not improve this metric with investment spending increasing year-over-year as planned. I will provide color on the individual business results in a moment.","Now, turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents increased slightly to $2 billion versus the end of 2018. Our adjusted growth leverage to adjusted EBITDA was 1.9x remaining within our targeted range of 1.75x to 2.25x. On an unadjusted basis, our gross debt to EBITDA leverage multiple decreased to 1.1x based on EBITDA growth in the first 9 months of 2019. Free cash flow excluding certain items increased $243 million to $1.647 billion in the first 9 months of this year. Share repurchases totaled $500 million in the third quarter through an ASR that was initiated in August. In addition, $140 million of dividends were paid during the quarter.","Now, let\u2019s turn to the deficient results starting with ratings. Ratings revenue increased 13% and excluding the impact of ForEx, was up 14%; consistent with the increase in issuance that Doug already discussed. Adjusted expenses increased 4%, resulting in a 19% increase in adjusted segment operating profit and a 340 basis point increase in adjusted segment operating profit margin. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 80 basis points to 56.7%. Non-transaction revenue increased 2% primarily due to fees associated with surveillance and new entity ratings, partially offset by Rating Evaluation Service and changes in foreign exchange rates. Excluding the impact of ForEx, non-transaction revenue grew 3%. Transaction revenue increased 25% due to very strong debt rating activity, particularly in high-yield and increased bank loan rating activity.","This slide depicts Ratings revenue by its end-markets. The largest contributor to the increase in Ratings revenue was the 22% increase in Corporates. In addition, Financial Services revenue was unchanged, Structured Finance declined 8%, governments increased 25%, and the CRISIL and other category increased 5%. This includes an increase in inter-segment royalties for Market Intelligence, and an increase in CRISIL\u2019s dollar denominated revenue. In addition, we have added a new disclosure this quarter with a revenue breakdown of the individual products within Structured. SC stands for structured credit and is primarily made up of CLOs. ABS and Structured Credit are the largest revenue categories.","Turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices, the segment delivered 14% revenue growth with gains in each category. In the third quarter, we reported 5% adjusted expense growth, 19% adjusted segment operating profit growth, and an adjusted segment operating profit margin of 70.1%, an increase of 280 basis points. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 160 basis points to 69.1%. Revenue in the various categories was up during the quarter. Asset-linked fees increased 17% due primarily to AUM growth in ETFs and strong growth in mutual funds, as well as the purchase of certain intellectual property rights. Exchange-Traded Derivative revenue increased 12% on an increase in exchange-traded derivative activity. Data & Custom Subscriptions increased 9%, but recall that a year ago, we reported a catch-up in real-time reporting that cost a difficult comparison. For our indices division, over the past year, ETF net inflows were $47 billion and market appreciation was $3 billion. This resulted in quarter-ending ETF AUM of $1.55 trillion, which is 3% higher compared to one year ago.","I want to make a clear distinction between average AUM and quarter-ending AUM. Our revenue is based on average AUM, which increased 5% year-over-year. We disclose quarter-ending figures because flows and market gains and losses are best depicted using quarter-end figures, as shown in the waterfall chart on the right. Sequentially versus the second quarter of 2019, ETF net inflows associated with our indices totaled $23 billion, while market appreciation totaled $12 billion. Industry inflows into exchange-traded funds were $106 billion in the third quarter with the majority going into fixed income and global equity products. Flows into U.S. equity funds were $34 billion.","This was an excellent quarter for exchange-traded derivative volume with key indicators generally exhibiting large increases in volume. S&P 500 Index options activity increased 6%, VIX futures & options activity increased 22%, and activity at the CME equity complex increased 47%. Market Intelligence delivered 5% revenue growth, both on a reported and organic basis, as the revenue impact from the divestment of SPIAS was not material. Also, I want to call your attention to some recent success at Panjiva. We have recently signed several new customers among the largest new sales transactions since Panjiva was founded. We are creating value for our customers by adding Panjiva\u2019s unique datasets to a commercial operation with a much larger footprint in an environment where global trade data is increasingly important.","Adjusted expenses increased 7% due to increased investment spending. Adjusted segment operating profit declined slightly and the adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 160 basis points to 34.3%. More importantly, on the trailing 4-quarter basis, the deficient delivered a solid adjusted segment operating profit margin increase of 250 basis points to 35.2%. We have noted on the past few earnings calls that we planned on increasing investment spending in Market Intelligence in the second half of the year to support their expansion efforts in China, data marketplace, SME, ESG, and Cloud. This increase in investment spending has impacted operating profit margins throughout 2019.","Desktop revenue grew 5% excluding acquisitions and divestments, while active desktop users grew 11%. While an improvement over last quarter, growth in this category has been slowing for the past few quarters due to several industry trends; lower industry growth in the desktop category, a continued competitive environment, and evolving customer preferences for desktop and data feeds. Data Management Solutions continue to exhibit strong growth with a gain of 8%. Credit Risk Solutions grew 5%, facing a difficult comparison as the prior year period included a timing benefit associated with a contract renewal that we noted on the third quarter conference call last year.","And now turning to Platts, the revenue growth continued at Platts increasing 4%. On an organic basis, adjusting for the sale of RigData in July, organic revenue increased 5%. Platts delivered a 4% increase in Core subscriptions and a 16% increase in Global Trading Services with increased trading volumes of fuel oil, gas oil, LNG, and Iron ore. U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela have had a modest impact on Platts\u2019 revenue to date. Adjusted expenses increased 3%, leading to an adjusted segment operating profit margin of 50.7%, an improvement of 40 basis points. The trailing 4-quarter adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 160 basis points to 49.6%. Power and gas delivered the largest rate of growth, at 11%, primarily the result of increased adoption of our LNG Benchmark, the JKM marker. Petrochemicals grew 8% due mostly to growth in subscriptions. Metals & Ag grew 7%, thanks to increased iron ore derivative trading activity. Petroleum revenue increased 3%.","Now, lastly I would like to discuss our 2019 guidance. This slide depicts our GAAP guidance. Those items that changed are highlighted. Please keep in mind that our guidance reflects current spot market ForEx rates. Now, let me review the changes to our adjusted guidance. While we are not changing our revenue guidance of a mid single-digit increase, we are expecting higher revenue. Corporate and allocated expense has been reduced by $10 million due to a reduction in professional fees. Operating profit margin has been increased by 50 basis points due to slightly higher revenue and better-than-anticipated expenses. The tax rate has been reduced by 0.5% points with higher levels of stock option activity than initially anticipated. These items result in a $0.15 to $0.20 increase to our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range. Our expectations for free cash flow are approximately $2.3 billion, which is at the high end of the previous range. We continue to execute upon our enterprise initiatives, including our stepped up investments in growth opportunities and our $100 million cost reduction program. An update will be provided on all of these programs during our fourth quarter earnings call. In conclusion, we expect 2019 to be another very successful year for the company as we continue to deliver excellent near-term results while simultaneously building for the future.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions.","Chip Merritt","Thank you, Ewout. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we now take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. This question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. You may ask your question.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. My first question is just broadly around issuance, obviously, the 5% forecast for the next year\u2019s good, but I was hoping you could address a little bit the recent press around inflated bond ratings and maybe, the question is around your expectations for default rates and so forth next year?","Doug Peterson","Great. Thanks, Manav. This is Doug. Well, first of all, just to talk a second about ratings issuance in the last quarter, there was \u2013 it was incredibly volatile across different asset classes as you might have seen in the numbers we prepared. You can see that the Corporates in the U.S. was up 66%, but Financial Services was down 2.3%. Financial Services in Europe was down 17%. Structured Finance was mixed also around the globe. You had \u2013 like ABS was up 6.6%, while Structured Credit was down 4.6%. So, some of those trends as we look into 2020, as you see we have estimated about the issuances going to be up about 4.7%, 4.8%. That\u2019s being driven by a combination of factors, including the pipeline of maturities that\u2019s coming out, so we see that there\u2019s going to be a maturity schedule of debt, we always look carefully at that; zero interest rates overall; economic growth, we\u2019re looking at to see how that\u2019s going to factor in. We are also seeing that there are lot of M&A activity that\u2019s going to be coming through. There has been Structured Credit, which is going to get refinanced etcetera. So, we have put all of those into place to analyze where we\u2019re going to look at for 2020 issuance.","But let me address some of the concerns that you raised as well, about the debt markets overall. First of all, let me just say that we stand behind our credit ratings. We have been making changes since 2010, 2011. We have become regulated around the world. There is actually 24 different jurisdictions were regulated and that includes one of those jurisdictions covers 28 countries, soon to be 27. And it\u2019s a very robust regulatory system around the globe. It\u2019s based on a set of principles that eliminate conflict of interest, minimize conflict of interest, their segregation of duties. We have independent oversight. We have independent boards around the world overseeing, working with us to ensure that we are meeting the requirements of the different regulatory areas. There is also inspections, enforcement actions. So, we have seen a very robust regulatory system put in place around the world. And since the financial crisis, at S&P, we\u2019ve systematically reviewed and tested all of our criteria and we have updated many of those, including financial institutions, structured finance, corporates. Most of those have increased levels of the amount of collateral or the approach to how we think about the coverage ratios and things like that. And so throughout that period, we have done a lot of a very, very heavy lifting along with the regulators themselves to ensure that the ratings system overall globally is very robust and has really strong independent oversight.","But let me talk a little bit about the current situation of the global debt markets. I would say that we are concerned, but not alarmed. I don\u2019t know if that distinction makes sense to you. We now have a decade of very low interest rates and in Europe, even zero interest rates with expectations that demographics and other factors are going to keep interest rates very low for a long time. And so, that\u2019s led to a lot of issuance of debt around the world. So, the debt levels have actually increased and you can see that in the \u2013 from the evidence of some of our ratings themselves. There is fewer AAA sovereigns around the world. There\u2019s only two corporate AAAs left. The overall distribution of ratings across the entire rating scale, the distribution is changed a lot. There is a much, much higher percentage of BBB ratings than there were in the past. In fact, almost about 40% of the Corporate ratings are now BBB as opposed to a center of gravity that used to be a little bit more toward the A level. In addition, there has been a lot of increase in the B-minus rating category, which as you know, that\u2019s a very speculative grade and there has been a very large increase in that. In fact, a number of single B-minus credits is back up to the same level around 2009. So, as I said, we\u2019re seeing a lot of issues that we would consider to create what I\u2019d call some concern in the markets, and we\u2019ve been raising those concerns through research we have been publishing. Last year, at the end of the year, we published a paper about when the credit cycle turns BBB downgrade risks may be overstated. It\u2019s a very thorough review of the overall BBB market. Again, in May, we looked at a whole new study of the BBB market that was on May 29. And then recently, we looked at what are the \u2013 why are companies moving to the BBB level. Was that something that management decided themselves or was this spurred by the downgrades themselves? And it\u2019s interesting because about two-thirds of people that moved from the A range to the BBB range actually management actions themselves, whether it\u2019s an M&A transaction or it\u2019s some kind of a reason that management is going to take on additional debt for investment and lower their overall debt levels. Anyway, we are watching this very carefully. We are aware that there is a lot of discussion going on in the markets around the ratings industry and we are very confident that we have put in place an excellent system of controls across the company, high-quality criteria, high-quality people and we are also watching very carefully as the credit markets start seeing changes.","Manav Patnaik","Got it. That\u2019s super helpful. And then just for my second question, Ewout, for the moderating desktop growth, I think you called out one of the reasons as the preference of desktop plus data feeds and I was hoping you could just elaborate a little bit on that in terms of if anything has markedly changed or is the competitive environment just more challenging there?","Ewout Steenbergen","Good morning, Manav. If we look at our desktop, we are still looking at our growth as the fastest growth overall in the desktop industry. We said to you last quarter that we expect mid single-digit growth in the desktop for Market Intelligence and that\u2019s still what is our best expectation at this point in time. And then you see that active users of our desktop products are still increased period over period by low-teens kind of levels. So, why do we see this kind of level of growth in the desktop? I think that has to do with a couple of reasons. It has always been a competitive environment. So, to some extent, that\u2019s not so much different than what we have seen in the past. But certainly, there are changes in customer preferences in terms of the delivery mechanism of data. So, we see more and more customers that want to have certain specific data sets through data feeds, which we can take in to their data science groups, combine it with their own data sets, and then deliver certain insights and take certain decisions out of that. So, for us, it doesn\u2019t matter so much in which form customers would like to receive our data. In the end, the desktop is just, in the end, a delivery mechanism. And we see our data feeds business growing in a very rapid way. So therefore, if we look at our data feeds business, our best expectation of growth in the future will be high single-digit to low-teens for most of the quarters.","Manav Patnaik","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Chip Merritt","Thanks, Manav.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Cho with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","Michael Cho","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to stay on the Market Intelligence segment for a minute. I think I appreciate the color on the ongoing investment in margin, puts and takes there. Maybe, it\u2019s a good time to \u2013 maybe you can provide a reminder comment about how you think about incremental margins in that segment?","Ewout Steenbergen","Yes, Michael. Good morning. At the beginning of this year, during our first quarter earnings call, we said that margin expectations for Market Intelligence should be more or less at the level of the reported margins in the first quarter going forward. And that has to do with two offsetting developments. On the one hand, the growth of the business to operating leverage which will drive the margins naturally up by itself and then offset by very specific investments, investment programs and some of those initiatives that we expect to help future growth of the company. And when we speak about the $100 million investment program overall, about half of those investments are going to Market Intelligence. So, that is obviously depressing a bit margins at the same time. So, the two factors are offsetting and therefore, we said that expect margins to stay more or less at that level of the first quarter and that is also basically what you have seen during the second and the third quarter. So going forward, we would say that probably the same expectations should continue; margins in Market Intelligence to stay more or less at this level, maybe slightly creeping up. I don\u2019t want to be too much ahead of ourselves and be too premature with respect to our 2020 guidance. But overall, we expect that we will have several initiatives where it makes sense to put new investments behind because, again, these investments make sense for future growth and value creation for our shareholders. So therefore, a similar trend of what you have seen so far this year is probably the best expectation for Market Intelligence in the near future.","Michael Cho","Okay, understood. Thanks. And just on \u2013 staying with Market Intelligence, you talked about the Desktop business and kind of mid-single-digit growth in the medium term, and I think I heard you referenced the desktop as a delivery mechanism of data a couple of times now. But if I think about the mid single-digit growth, I mean how should we frame or think about the components of that mid single-digit?","Ewout Steenbergen","Yes I think the components is a bit tricky to give you all the details because we have never been speaking so much about that so far. But let me help you with a couple of pieces of information that is hopefully useful for you. So, when you look at our overall strategy for Market Intelligence and the Desktop, our strategy is focused about delivering better content, more data, high-quality data, alternative data, better linking, a better search engine. And then we have our enterprise approach, which is the enterprise-wide contracts, where we want to stimulate as much users to go on our platform. So, there is a fixed price per customer and they can have as many users on the platform as they want. They are foreseeing more active users, and therefore, we see that going up as we reported this quarter 11%, but this has been more or less in the low double-digit for the last multiple quarters. So, if you take that into account, we get a better product period after the period and the combination of that strategy, if you look at the annualized contract value of our customers, we see a healthy growth. And that gives us the confidence that we will be able to grow our Desktop revenue in the future at the mid-single-digit level. The other point that I would like to highlight is our aspirational margin guidance for Market Intelligence. We have said that is mid-to-high 30s. So, that is the guidance that we want to provide over time, where we think the margins will go for Market Intelligence.","Michael Cho","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Toni Kaplan","Thank you. Good morning. Could you talk a little bit more about the strong ratings margin expansion in the quarter? Was it driven by a greater mix of higher-margin products or did you take more price than normal and how sustainable is the level of margin going forward in ratings, would you consider raising your medium-term ratings margin target from the high FFDs?","Ewout Steenbergen","Good morning, Tony. This is Ewout. Thank you for recognizing the strong results in ratings. Obviously, we are also very pleased with the progress we are making. The improvement in margins in ratings has been basically a continued trend over the last periods and you have, in fact, seen that in periods where the debt issuance market was a bit weaker at the end of last year, at the beginning of this year, our margins were still developing in a favorable way. And now, we can continue on that also when the issuance markets look more favorable. Overall ratings margins on a trailing 4-quarter basis were at the level of 56.7%. So, according to our standards, we are not really at the level of our aspirational margin targets of high 50s. So, I have a bit of room still there to grow. And how do we expect that growth to happen in the future? Continued revenue growth, which is a combination of new issuance, refinancings, of course commercial contract changes, new initiatives that we put in place in ratings, think about ESG Evaluations, think about our launch of rate activities in other countries around the world. And then, there is also continued work around making the ratings organization more effective, taking complexity out, taking layers of the organization out, and making it more an effective organization. So, overall expenses going up 4% this quarter and the top line going up 13%, I think is clearly a very good combination, and that is helping margins, but you should expect basically the same trends, the same activities, the same management actions to continue in the future.","Toni Kaplan","Great. And then international index revenue is very strong in the quarter, I guess, what are the largest drivers there, and can you provide any additional color on the international opportunity and the potential to make some inroads versus your largest competitor in that market? Thank you.","Ewout Steenbergen","Sorry, Toni, which \u2013 I missed which segment were you referring to.","Toni Kaplan","In index, but specifically with regard to international.","Ewout Steenbergen","The international strategy for Index is not so much changed of what we have said in the past. As you know, our business is largely tailored around U.S. equities where we hold some of the largest benchmarks. But then we are growing our international business in many different ways, mostly through relationships with exchanges around the world and there are several of those in Canada, in Australia, and in many other markets. That\u2019s the way how we\u2019re trying to grow our international business. And so, there is nothing particularly here to call out with respect to what was the drive for it; this is the same strategy that we have been applying over the last period.","Toni Kaplan","Thank you.","Chip Merritt","Thanks, Toni.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is now open.","Alex Kramm","Hey, good morning everyone. Just coming back to the issuance forecast for 2020, thanks for including that again. I know it\u2019s an early look, but two quick ones here. One, can you actually break it down by buckets what the different growth rates are for Corporate versus Structured etc.? I don\u2019t think you mentioned that. And then more importantly, if I look at mid-single-digit or 5% growth for next year in issuance, considering some of the pricing that you typically pick up, that would probably push Ratings revenue growth in the high-single digits. I know this is not a guidance call and you usually don\u2019t talk about ratings guidance specifically, but anything where that may not be the case that plays out? What would be the other factors to think about?","Doug Peterson","Yes. So, the second part of your question, we are going to address in our next earnings call. So, the full year, fourth quarter call, we are going to talk about give some outlook for 2020. But going back to the first part of your question, which relates to our issuance, let me give you some of the numbers then. So, for 2019, I will give you 2019 and 2020. So, for Corporates, we see that \u2013 by the end of the year, that Corporate issuance should have gone up by about 17% and then in 2020, up 6%. Financial Services, up 6% this year and our forecast for 2020 is up 3.5%. Structured Finance will end this year at about 2% up and next year, we\u2019re looking at 5% up and then U.S. public finance is 6.2% for this year and 2% for next year. And that gives you total numbers of about 9.4% for 2019 and 4.7% for 2020. And as I said before, this is based on a deep review and research by our credit research team in ratings that look across many different factors. They look at all the different markets, they look at interest rates, they look at maturities coming up, they look at the M&A market, they look at what\u2019s out in bridge loans, etc, etc. So, this is right now their best forecast at this point in time.","Alex Kramm","Alright, fair enough. And then just secondly, quick one, you were pretty quiet on China in your prepared remarks in terms of the domestic opportunity. I think last time you talked about how active you were over the summer engaging with potential new Corporates to get a listing. I guess I would have expected a little bit more action heading into the fall, so just curious what\u2019s been happening over there?","Doug Peterson","Yes. So, China is still a super high priority for us. Very exciting. We still have a lot of people visiting and our launch has been going very, very well and \u2013 but because \u2013 building a market like this from scratch, it\u2019s going to take time and as you\u2019ve heard us say in the past calls, this is a three-to-five-to-10-year kind of initiative. We are in this for the long run. And so, since last quarter, we\u2019ve been holding hundreds of meetings educating market participants. We\u2019ve been calling on all types of market participants to discuss ratings or methodologies or criteria and we do see a very active pipeline building. In addition to that, we\u2019ve also launched our market intelligence business and we\u2019ve added full coverage of the Chinese public and private bond issuers with profiles and financials. This market has actually noticed that we\u2019ve begun to add new customers in China for Credit Solutions. And so, we\u2019re very pleased with the overall results. In addition to that, one of the factors which I personally watch very carefully is that how are we doing hiring the right people. And we now have in place a new Chief Financial Officer for our Chinese operations at CTO. We\u2019ve got ahead of people, and so we\u2019ve got the infrastructure in place now with really highly qualified people who are helping us build out the team and make sure we have the right kind of functionality in place. So, more to come on China. We\u2019ll obviously keep reporting on it as it progresses, but the progress in the third quarter was excellent and I am really, really pleased with the team we\u2019ve built on ground and the market response that we\u2019ve been getting.","Alex Kramm","Fair enough. Thank you.","Chip Merritt","Thanks.","Operator","Next question comes from Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. You may ask your question.","Andrew Nicholas","Hi guys. Good morning. It looks like Data Management Solutions slowed a bit. I think you called out a one-time item in the year-ago period, but is there any additional color you can provide there? And then, sticking with Data Management Solutions, could you deconstruct the growth in this segment over the past couple of quarters? How much is coming from selling new data feeds to existing clients; how much is coming from existing clients, maybe, interested in data feeds for the first time? And then I guess that would lead, how much is coming from new clients altogether?","Ewout Steenbergen","Good morning, Andrew. When we look at Data Management Solutions, there is nothing particular to call out with respect to the growth this quarter. There was 8% growth, as you have seen. This is always dancing around a little bit quarter-by-quarter based on specific transactions and deals that happened during the quarter itself, but we would look at this as normal volatility. As I said before, the expectation should be for the data feeds business growth over the next period high-single-digits to low-teens during most quarters. With respect to customers, there is a whole mix of new customers, existing customers, new data feeds who are putting more and more data on our Xpressfeeds platform. You have seen some of that. For example, with respect to our transcript business, which used to be a static product and has become now a datafeeds products where it\u2019s in machine-readable format. It has the links there. It has been tagged to certain keywords; for example, the analysts and then the analyst models or key individuals that are speaking to the call. There have been [indiscernible] data on our feeds business, the SNL data on our feeds business. Doug was speaking in his prepared remarks about the sentiments course around this. So, we\u2019re adding more and more content on our data feeds business and that is ultimately driving growth both from existing customers and new customers.","Andrew Nicholas","Great, thank you. And then sticking in Market Intelligence, international revenue has been growing quite fast and faster than U.S. revenue and I think that dynamic was a bit pronounced this quarter. So, I was hoping you could speak to what\u2019s driving that and then maybe which region you\u2019re seeing the strongest growth in?","Ewout Steenbergen","Yes, that\u2019s a correct observation. We are growing internationally. We are doing that by growing our sales force around the world and we see particularly growth in the EMEA region, being very healthy, as well as in Asia. That\u2019s, by the way, not only a trend for Market Intelligence; we see, for example, the same for our Platts business. And we are very pleased with that because that\u2019s a result of a very explicit strategy we have as a company to grow faster outside of the U,S. and be able to take our fair share in terms of market position around the world. So, Yes, this is the result of very specific strategic actions we have taken in our businesses.","Andrew Nicholas","Great, thank you.","Chip Merritt","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","The next question comes from Christian Bolu with Autonomous. Your line is now open.","Christian Bolu","Good morning, guys. I just wanted to dig into monetization and customer demand for your ESG services. I guess now that you have done a number of ESG assessments, could you give a bit more color on sort of monetization? How are you charging for an assessment, what is the fee-based on, and then any sort of color on sort of pipeline or target number of assessments you want to achieve over the next sort of 12 to 24 months?","Doug Peterson","Thank you, Christian. This is Doug. Well, first of all, ESG products across the company are quite varied. As you know, we put in place a framework, where last year, I put in place a design team for ESG cutting across all of the divisions, so that we could take advantage of this really big opportunity. By the way, just anecdotally, I was in the IMF meetings in Washington a couple of weeks ago and every single meeting that I had, we talked about ESG. So just \u2013 I know that\u2019s anecdotal, but it\u2019s a really booming area. And so across the company, we have various ESG products. Today, I talked about a few of those that we have with Trucost, which is part of Market Intelligence. I also talked about one of the specific ESG indices we have with the S&P 500 ESG Index that we now are going to be launching \u2013 CME is going to be launching a futures contract traded on that. So, across the board, we\u2019re seeing a lot of growth in this and we will give some more information about the overall outlook on our earnings call next quarter. But within the ratings product, the one you\u2019re specifically talking about, we\u2019ve had three ratings \u2013 ESG evaluations from the Ratings business, which have been published and made public. The introductory pricing there is one that we\u2019re using as pilots with the clients that we\u2019ve been meeting with and we\u2019re going to be rolling out a different pricing schedule over time. But again, as I mentioned with our China discussion earlier, this is really a great opportunity for us to be rolling out new products and services, which are in demand by the market with a long-term view. We\u2019re not just rushing into this in the next quarter or the next two quarters. This is a 2 to 3 to 5-year initiative. We want to do it in the right way and we\u2019re very, very pleased with the response that we\u2019ve been getting and the hundreds of customers that we are meeting with that are asking for follow-up phone calls to learn more about the engagement. So, more to come on this, but we\u2019re off to what we think is a very good start and we are very enthusiastic about what we see.","Christian Bolu","Great, great. Thanks very helpful color. For my follow-up, Europe, you mentioned issuance trends remain weak in Europe despite low interest rates. Maybe some color on what you think is going on there and then more importantly, as we look into sort of 2020 and beyond, kind of how do you think trends evolve there?","Doug Peterson","Yes. The European markets, there is a couple of big trends going on. One of them, obviously, is very, very low interest rates. In fact, the rates there are now so low that even Greece had some negative rates in the last quarter, where you had the entire yield curve for a few markets, the German market and the French market, a few weeks ago, the entire yield curve from overnight to 30 years was negative. And so, there is a lot of questions about growth in Europe. There is a change going on in the ECB between Mario Draghi and coming in with Christine Lagarde. There has been some discussions that Christine Lagarde, although she is in ECB, is somebody that\u2019s trying to talk about more stimulative fiscal policies and structural reform, which would potentially help drive some new growth in the markets. So, I think that there is a combination of questions about how long interest rates are going to stay that low; you\u2019ve got questions about some new policies that are going to be coming to market; you also have the Brexit, which has created some uncertainty. So, when we speak with participants of the market, these are the sorts of factors which they will cite as to why issuance has been a little bit weak in Europe. But overall though, it\u2019s still a critical market for us. We\u2019re well prepared to respond, no matter what direction it goes. And we\u2019ve also positioned ourselves for Brexit so that we\u2019re able to serve the markets, no matter what direction Brexit goes, by having opened a Ratings headquarters in Dublin. So, overall, we\u2019re very well prepared to respond, whatever the direction goes. But there is definitely a lot of issues in Europe, which have created some caution in the markets there.","Christian Bolu","Great, thank you.","Chip Merritt","Thanks, Christian.","Operator","Next question comes from Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. You may now ask your question.","Bill Warmington","Good morning, everyone. So, first question for you, Platts, the 5% growth as expected. The question I have is a couple of years ago, it was a high-single digit, low-double digit type grower and the non-petroleum markets are actually growing at that level. You mentioned several new product launches under way. And I wanted to ask whether you thought there had been structural changes to the business or the end markets that are going to keep the business at the mid-single digits, or whether there is a possibility with the new product launches and changes in the market that you could see an acceleration of that growth back to the upper single-digit, low double-digit range.","Ewout Steenbergen","Good morning, Bill. You are right that Platts is a very steady grower at the mid single-digit level at this point in time. You see the core subscription business. The price reporting business being very steady, growing every year at that level that\u2019s, of course, the majority of the business and historically, also very much focused around oil, petrochemicals, gas, and all related products. But we are expanding very rapidly to new commodity categories and we\u2019re very pleased with that. Metals, agriculture, we have been speaking about LNG, and also renewables is of course a very important element, they are also around the ESG theme. So, we\u2019re clearly expanding around new commodities, which will help with future growth in Platts. And then, we are very pleased with the growth in Global Trading Services. These are the products that are being developed with some of the exchanges around the world; think about Singapore Exchange, think about ICE; and with the product developments, they are really having some traction and therefore, good growth in Global Trading Services. One key element that we believe is very relevant with respect to future growth of Platts as well is the fact that commodity trading desk in some of the large investment banks have been reduced heavily over the last few years. So, when we will see more of those global trading desks around commodities coming back in some of the investment banking organizations, then we would expect to see a pickup in growth of Platts in the future. But the best expectation for the near future is probably very steady, predictable mid-single-digit level growth for Platts.","Bill Warmington","Okay. And then for my second question on Market Intelligence, in the past, you have talked about that business by end market and I think about half of it was non-Wall Street buy side, sell side related. So, historically, that\u2019s helped Market Intelligence buffer some \u2013 buffer itself from some of the secular pressures on the sell side and buy side and I just wanted to ask if you can give a little color in terms of how those two segments the buy side, sell side versus the non-Wall Street side did or\/and are doing?","Ewout Steenbergen","We continue to be very pleased that we have such a well-diversified customer base in Market Intelligence and in fact, that\u2019s one of the reasons why we believe that we can continue to grow a bit above the industry kind of levels. So, we have buy sites, we have sell sites in Investment Banking. We have a large customer group in Corporate Banking and Insurance. We have general Corporates, we have the academic world. So, we are seeing still a very well-diversified group of customers. So, we expect that to continue, and overall, therefore, we feel we\u2019re relatively well insulated against some of the specific trends, particularly on the buy side, as you have highlighted.","Bill Warmington","And then a parting comment for Chip, I\u2019m just am looking forward to how you guys optimize your earnings calls going forward using the Kensho TDA technology.","Doug Peterson","That\u2019s a very good question.","Chip Merritt","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Next question comes from Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your question.","Drew Kootman","Hi, this is Drew Kootman on for Joe. I know you mentioned Scribe and TDA. I was just wondering if you could talk about some other areas where Kensho is contributing?","Ewout Steenbergen","Absolutely. We continue to be extremely excited about Kensho. Actually, we feel this year we have found a good operating mode, a good groove, so to say, and the collaboration between the businesses and Kensho and our many initiatives that are going on and overall, with a lot of enthusiasm within the organization. So, just to mention a few, we have an initiative about completely revamping the Market on Close process in Platts, which is being done with help of Kensho. We have the continued work that\u2019s going on about data extraction and entity linking. There is work continuing around Omnisearch and improving of Omnisearch on the Market Intelligence platform. We have a product that is called Codecs, which is able to analyze very large sets of written materials, documents, and being able to pull out the most important elements to analysts, which could be analyst in any industry and in any kind of job profile. We have work that\u2019s going on about what is called Data Operations at a surface, more fundamental data architectural work that is happening within the company and there are many other examples as well. So, we feel there is good progress with Kensho and at the end of this year, during our fourth quarter earnings call, we will give you an update particularly with respect to the value creation around Kensho, as we did also a year ago.","Drew Kootman","Great. And then, just curious how the M&A pipeline looks?","Ewout Steenbergen","Well, we are always looking at M&A. As you know, that is an additional opportunity to grow our topline and we are always very busy looking at many opportunities in the markets. But you know, we have a very clear framework. We first look at those areas that we have pre-defined as strategically important for the company. So, we\u2019re not looking at everything that\u2019s under the sun or that is brought forward by a banker. And then secondly, we have a very clear framework with respect to our capital approach and valuation metrics. So, there is always multiple projects going on at the same time. This quarter, we had two very small acquisitions in Platts, which was the Live Rice Index and a Canadian energy business, but we will continue to look at opportunities. But of course, you may expect us to continue to be very disciplined both on the strategic angle as well as from the financial angle.","Drew Kootman","Perfect. Thank you.","Chip Merritt","Thanks Drew.","Operator","The next question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. You may now ask your question.","Craig Huber","Yes, good morning. Two questions. The first one, can you just sort of bridge for us the strong 25% transaction ratings revenue growth you had versus, I think you said 12% or so debt issuance growth globally. Just about the gap, there is obviously more than just 3% to 4% price index issues, etcetera, if you could talk about that, will follow-up? Thank you.","Ewout Steenbergen","Hi, Craig. The main reason here was that in high-yield, we saw very large growth. Most of those issuers in high-yield are not on frequent issuer programs, and that is driving the transaction revenue more up than the overall issuance levels in the market. So, that is the main reason why you see discrepancy at this particular item.","Doug Peterson","Just to add one thing, high-yield overall globally was up almost 70%.","Craig Huber","And then secondly, just staying with the Ratings area, obviously, for a number of years, you guys have been very, very tight with costs there. This quarter, I think it\u2019s only about 4%, maybe up low-single digits through the nine months here, versus obviously a 12% or so revenue growth. Can you just talk about what you\u2019re able to do there on the cost front that\u2019s able to drive the margins so much here, and how much more is this sustainable going forward? Obviously, I guess, IT is a good chunk of it. Maybe just touch on that. Thank you.","Ewout Steenbergen","John Berisford and his team are continuing to look at opportunities to simplify the organization, make it more effective, introduce new technology tools to make sure that our credit rating analysts have to spend less time on data aggregation, updating their models and spreadsheets, and look more at highest value-added part of their job. So, more to judgmental parts that is part of the credit risk assessment. So, that is helping the Ratings business. At the same time, if you look at the expense growth this quarter versus last year third quarter, it was up $20 million, mostly related to small movements here and there. Particularly, incentive compensation was a bit higher this quarter based on the strong performance. And then there were several elements that went in different directions, so nothing else particularly to pull out. So, we will just continue with the progress we are making, the same strategy, the same approach, and taking benefit of the operating leverage we have in our Ratings business.","Craig Huber","Thank you.","Chip Merritt","Thanks, Craig.","Operator","The next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. You may now ask your question.","George Tong","Hi, thanks. Good morning. I am going to ask a question on your Ratings business to follow up on the prior question. Your Ratings revenue increased 13%, which was relatively in line with broader issuance volume growth. Can you discuss why Ratings revenue didn\u2019t outperform broader issuance volumes given the benefits from pricing high-yield and infrequent issuers at S&P?","Ewout Steenbergen","George, that\u2019s a bit of the opposite question that was just asked, because again you have to look at the differential between transaction and non-transaction revenue. And non-transaction revenue contains the surveillance fees. These are the issuers that are on frequent issuer programs, these are new entity ratings, this is some of the CRISIL and other category, this is Rating Evaluation service. So, this is a very steady part of the overall ratings revenue and you saw that going up 2% points in this particular period. And then if you look at the transaction revenue, which is really driven by transactions that are happening in the market, there we saw this very healthy growth of 25% and that was, in fact, higher then the issuance in the market and that was driven by what I just explained; that most of the high-yield issuers are not on frequent issuer programs. So, you have to go one or two layers deeper in terms of granularity to really look at the underlying dynamics and drivers and see what are all the different components of our Ratings revenue.","George Tong","Got it. The operating margins in the Index business are continuing to go higher on a year-over-year basis. Given the high flow-through of pricing the margins, can you discuss the pricing and competitive environment here, and if you see any changes to your long-term view or targets on margins for the Index business?","Doug Peterson","George, I will take this question. First of all, in the competitive landscape, you have seen a lot of big developments that we are watching very closely right now as we think about our strategic plan for the long run. You have seen a couple of companies have come out on the retail sector to eliminate fees for stock trading. One of the effects of that is it seems there is a lot more of volumes going into ETFs and when things go into ETFs and they go into passive structures, a lot of times we benefit from that. So, we look structurally at the market overall and we see some big shifts continuing to go on in pricing overall, all the way from the retail level to the institutional level. And the big flow overall of assets into passive is something that we\u2019re benefiting from.","Now, to get a little bit more specifically to your question, we don\u2019t see any specific pressure on our fees ourselves directly. We have very long-term contracts with the people that we deal with. We work with them in a way that we know, in the long run, what our pricing is probably going to be and how it\u2019s going to end up. And so, we continue to see a similar structure to our own revenues and expense base that we\u2019ve had in the past. We saw a very large increase in overall volume this quarter. You saw that Ewout talked earlier in his section about this. And so, from that increase across the board of our revenue from indices, it flowed through to improve our margin. But we don\u2019t see any overall change in the structure of the market or our own business model that we\u2019re going to see any significant change in the index margins. We will provide more update on that at the next earnings call.","George Tong","Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.","Chip Merritt","Thanks, George.","Operator","Next question comes from Henry Chen from BMO Capital Markets. You may now ask your question.","Henry Chen","Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks. I had a follow-up question on some of the new products that you mentioned, including Kensho and some of the ones in Platts. Just in context of, I guess, some of the pressures in, I guess, on the sell-side and in the energy space, I\u2019m curious if you could add some color on like what\u2019s driving the product demand, where\u2019s the sort of value created or sort of needs being met for some of these new products? Thanks.","Doug Peterson","Yes. So, overall across the entire company, we spend as much time as possible listening to customers to understand what are going to be the biggest trends that are driving the need for new analytical and benchmarks from S&P Global. When we listen to the markets, there is a lot of change going on in technology, thus driving feed products and what we\u2019ve been calling the marketplace in the Market Intelligence business. When we talk to people, they are looking at major changes in regulation, which for the last few years in the Banking sector helped with a lot of the growth in risk services at Market Intelligence. It\u2019s our business at CRISIL. And specifically, with the energy transition that\u2019s going on related to climate change, there is an increasing interest in a combination of ESG products as well as products like the 0.5% IMO sulfur product, which is now moving to the CME and ICE exchanges as futures. And so we try to look out in forward what are the things, the biggest trends, that are going to be impacting people\u2019s needs to make financial decisions and market decisions and how can we serve those. And some of the products that we\u2019ve talked about many, many years ago start showing up over time in our revenues. As an example, in Platts, we\u2019ve been responding to the market changes that are going on in the structure of the energy industries and one of the products that we featured frequently over many years was the JKM Marker, which was the Japan, Korea marker for LNG in Japan, which has now become the Asia price, which is now on exchanges as a futures contract. So, we like to give you updates. These are \u2013 Some of these products started out small, but they helped show what do we think are the biggest trends in the markets and how are we going to be addressing those trends and as I said, their technology, their risk management, their ESG trends that are changing people\u2019s needs to have more and more data about markets and so we\u2019re trying to show you how we\u2019re addressing those going forward. And I appreciate your question.","Henry Chen","Got it. Okay, that\u2019s super helpful. Thank you.","Chip Merritt","Thanks, Henry.","Operator","The next question is from Gary Bisbee from Bank of America Securities. You may ask your question.","Gary Bisbee","Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in this morning. I guess just one question. Given the margin strength that you\u2019ve delivered in recent quarters and certainly over the last several years, how do you think about weighing stepped-up \u2013 potential for stepped-up investments to drive the top line versus letting so much of the incremental profitability of your businesses flow to the bottom line? Are there opportunities in some of the businesses to accelerate the pace of investment, or are you comfortable, the level you\u2019re investing is the appropriate level that the organization can handle? Thank you.","Ewout Steenbergen","Gary, that\u2019s a great question and we have, as you understand, a lot of management discussions around this topic because our philosophy is that topline growth, in the end, generates the highest level of value creation for our shareholders, particularly at the levels of margins that we can report at this point in time. So, that\u2019s why we have very explicit investment programs in place. That\u2019s the $100 million investment program that we have been talking about in the past. And what we are seeing today is that we expect those investments programs to continue because we will identify new opportunities to invest in the future, and those will help with future growth of the company, which we think is the most attractive for us going forward. At the same time, the benefit is that we still have a lot of efficiency and productivity opportunities as well, as a company. So, we are able to self-fund some of those investments programs at this moment and we believe that there are still new efficiency opportunities as well going forward. So, therefore \u2013 In fact, if you look at our expense growth year-to-date, the expenses are up just under 2% year-to-date. And that means that we have been able to absorb acquisitions like Panjiva, RateWatch, Kensho; have been able to make new investments in those large initiatives at that $100 million level that we expect still for the full year this year and just growing the expenses under 2%. So, that is showing how we are working on both sides here in order to make very explicit divestments, but also be able to self-fund. And I would expect that to continue and that we can do still both at the same time in the future as well.","Gary Bisbee","Thank you.","Chip Merritt","Thanks, Gary.","Operator","The next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel Nicolaus. You may now ask your question.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hi, thanks for squeezing me in under the wire. Doug, can you talk a little bit about just the Market Intelligence with enterprise-wide contracts? Are you seeing any major displacements of competitors because of that in terms of your ability to offer more so that they don\u2019t need to run so many systems or do you think that the head count growth that you are seeing is somewhat duplicative as they are handling multiple systems?","Doug Peterson","Shlomo, thanks for the question. I can\u2019t tell you specifically if we are displacing people, I know that sometimes I hear that anecdotally. But what I do hear and what I do see is that when we move people on to the enterprise contract, that users go up and it\u2019s a combination of people before that were not necessarily users because they were guarding the number of seats pretty jealously as to who would actually have access to the per-seat pricing. And so there is people that in the past wanted to use it or needed to use it, they now get access to it and then there is other people who have become more light users. And so you see a huge advantage as it starts getting built into the workflow of an institution, because you have people that are not the hardcore power users; they\u2019re light users who are helping print out reports, they\u2019re helping download information, and they\u2019re helping look at new researches coming out. And that actually helps us embed the overall MI platform across the entire architecture of a firm. So, does that then end up displacing other people? We think it does, but I don\u2019t want to give you anecdotes; I\u2019d rather come back at some time in the future and give you more facts around that.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay, thank you. And then just one other follow-up, how is the SNL Cap IQ integration going from the product side and your ability to migrate the clients to platform? It just seems that when you are able to get that done, there probably is an opportunity to improve the growth rate in Market intelligence on the Desktop side?","Ewout Steenbergen","What is our strategy with respect to the migration of the platforms? As you probably know, the whole SNL platform has already migrated to the new Market Intelligence platform. And then the next phase, and that is a phase that will take quite some time, will be the movement of the Cap IQ customers to the new platform. We expect next year that we will create a situation with dual access for almost all of our customers, so that the Cap IQ customers will get some familiarity with the Market Intelligence platform. And then slowly, step by step, with a lot of hand-holding, we will move customers over. And that will probably be a process that will take quite some time, so mostly will go beyond 2020. And that\u2019s important because we can\u2019t lose customers along the way. Customers have embedded some of those desktops in their workflows have embedded it in their models with automatic links. We have to make sure that all the data is available, all the features are available. So, there is a lot of hand-holding that is needed in order to make sure that customers are comfortable to move over. So, we\u2019re continuing to make progress there. We have very specific actions planned for the next period and particularly, to make sure that all of our customers have access to both platforms, when they are today only on Cap IQ, is going to be an important step for next year.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Thank you.","Chip Merritt","Thanks, Shlomo.","Operator","We will now take our final question from Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy from Raymond James. You may ask your question.","Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy","Hey, good morning. And just one question from me, so there is obviously a renewed effort underway to verify the rating indices. To what extent is there concern on your part that the SEC might feel pressure to reexamine the issuer pace model, or otherwise take steps to mitigate perceived conflicts of interest?","Doug Peterson","Patrick, this is Doug. Clearly, we are on top of this. We are watching this very closely to see what kind of initiatives could be under way. The SEC already has been doing work for the last few years looking at different business models. They\u2019ve got a couple of different groups that have been formed to take a look at the Ratings industry. But very importantly, inside of the SEC is a group called the CRA. It\u2019s a credit rating agency group that has been \u2013 has now had almost 10 years of work overseeing the Rating Agency industry. They\u2019ve got the data, they have the facts. And we\u2019re engaging very closely across the board with the regulating \u2013 with the regulators with the SEC itself with the CRA Group. Anybody who would like to talk to us, we have no problem sharing all the data we have about how we run the business. As I said earlier, we stand by our ratings, we stand by our processes and our procedures, the controls we put in place, the quality of our ratings, the quality of our processes, etc. So, as you know, this is something that we will be watching very, very closely. We\u2019ll be actively participating in any dialog that comes up around the business model for rating agencies, and we\u2019re ready to have a very professional dialog about this. Appreciate your question.","Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy","Thank you, Doug.","Chip Merritt","Thanks.","Doug Peterson","Let me just wrap up and tell you again that we\u2019re very pleased with the results that we had today and we were able to talk about all four divisions and our significant margin improvement in the productivity programs. It\u2019s also encouraging that, as a company, we have the capacity and ability to invest in some of the new products that we featured today. But very importantly, we appreciate all the interest from the analysts to ask questions today and we always appreciate your questions, the easy ones and the tough ones. So, keep them coming. Thanks a lot.","Operator","That concludes this morning\u2019s call. A PDF version of the presenters\u2019 slides is available now for downloading from investor.spglobal.com.

Thank you for joining us for S&P Global's Earnings Call. Presenting on this morning's call are Doug Peterson, President and CEO; and Ewout Steenbergen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","This morning, we issued a news release with our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results.

Doug?","Doug Peterson","Good morning. Thank you, Chip. Welcome everyone to the call. I'd also like welcome our new CFO Ewout Steenbergen. Ewout joined us in November and is participating in his first earnings conference call with us. You'll hear more from him shortly.","2016 was a memorable year with market uncertainty surrounding pivotable outcomes from Brexit, the US election and the long-awaited increase in US interest rate. Despite this uncertainty, spreads tightened, issuance was strong, equity markets ended up the year and S&P Global delivered another solid performance.","Let me begin with 2016 highlights. We finished the year with strong fourth quarter results. We delivered another year of impressive financial performance with mid single-digit revenue growth and mid teen\u2019s adjusted EPS growth.","We re-branded the company's S&P Global with the new ticker SPGI. We reshape the portfolio with a number of divestitures and acquisitions. The most significant divestiture being J.D. Power.","We successfully completed our 2014 to 2016 $140 million cost reduction initiative. We made substantial progress on our SNL integration synergy. We generated nearly $1.5 billion in free cash flow and we returned $1.5 billion through share repurchases and dividends.","We also delivered excellent financial results. The company reported 7% revenue growth of this growth 89% was pull-through to adjusted operating profit. This is a direct result of our continued focus on productivity.","On an organic basis, revenue grew 6% and the pull-through to adjusted operating profit was also high. These achievements led to a 300 basis point improvement in adjusted operating profit margin, and continued a string of annual improvements in adjusted operating profit margin of more than 275 basis points for the third year in a row.","While ForEx had a $24 million unfavorable impact on revenue, it had a $43 million favorable impact on adjusted operating margin - operating profit with market intelligence realizing the majority of the game.","I'm very pleased that we were able to leverage 7% revenue growth into 14% adjusted EPS growth through a combination of productivity improvement and share repurchase activity.","2016 was not an isolated year. Our revenue growth was consistent with the 7% annual growth over the past four years and our 300 basis point margin improvement capped 1000 basis points of margin improvement over the past four years. Our focus on growth and performance has material changed the earnings power of the company.","This earnings powers translated into a substantial increase in adjusted earnings per share. In 2016 we almost doubled our 2012 EPS, delivering 18% compounded annual growth rate over the last four years.","During 2016, we continue to add capabilities and reshape S&P Global. In Platts, we are building a world-class supply demand capability. With FinTech and Eclipse [ph] already in place providing US and European natural gas analytics, we purchased PIRA Energy Group, RigData and Commodity Flow, adding a wealth of expertise in global energy market analysis, US rig activity and waterborne analytics.","With our deep history of providing benchmark commodity prices, we believe providing the supply demand analytics around these prices will be a great value to our customers.","S&P Dow Jones Indices purchased Trucost, a leader in carbon and environmental data and risk analysis. Not only will this acquisition enable the creation of unique new indices, but our rating business will leverage Trucost capabilities, and new creation, new ESG products, such as green bond evaluation.","Ratings added to its international capabilities with the acquisition of a 49% stake in TRIS highlight [ph] including credit rating agency. Thailand is Asean's second-largest economy and third-largest bond market.","We reshaped our portfolio with the divestitures of J.D. Power, our pricing businesses, and our equity and fund research business and Quant House [ph] in January 2017. These result moves left us with a stronger, more cohesive set of businesses.","Now I want to turn to our outlook for 2017 and discuss key scenes that are shaping 2017 and beyond. These are topics I discussed with our board, as well as the division president as we look to the next year and the next 3 to 5 years. We look forward to discussing these themes with you this quarter and during the year.","Global GDP though increasing this year is running much lower than the past. Interest rates that have been declining since 1981 could continue to rise. Geopolitical considerations like Brexit, populist changes to government and threats to established trade deals create new risks.","Regulations become an unparalleled force for change. We count 22 ratings regulators worldwide today with the majority less than five years old. All of you have witnessed the rise of compliance within your own firm. Our customers have changing expectations, are feeling competitive pressures and facing changing business model.","Technology continues to disrupt every industry, including ours. According to Citibank, there's been a tenfold increase in FinTech companies in the past five years. It took 75 years for the telephone to reach 50 million users, radio 38 years, TV 13, Internet 4 years and Pokemon Go 19 days.","Sustainability is becoming ubiquitous among companies and investors, climate change conferences, ESG investable funds point to significant changes in behavior. We need to stay ahead of these trends and create products that address the changing needs of our clients and markets, things like green bond evaluation, ESG Indices, new credit tool and new product platforms or opportunities that we are pursuing.","Our economists expect global GDP to grow 3.5% in 2017. The chart depicts their view for the next two years in which all world areas except Europe will experience accelerated GDP growth.","In the US low unemployment and increased consumer spending will underpin GDP growth. In Europe, recovery is on track and showing resilience, but not enough to boost GDP.","In Asia, we expect reasonable growth and little inflation with India being a bright spot. And in Latin America, we expect improvement driven by continued recovery in commodity prices and stabilizing domestic command.","Last week ratings issued its annual global refinancing study, this yearly study shows debt maturities for the upcoming five years. The chart on the left illustrates data from the 2016 and 2017 studies. The five-year period in the 2017 study shows a $100 billion increase in total debt maturing versus the 2016study.","We use this study along with other market-based data to forecast issuance.","Taking a closer look at data from the study reveals an important trend in high-yield maturity. Over the next five years, the level of high-yield debt maturing significantly increases each year, which is a potential source of revenue in the coming years.","Last week ratings also publish their latest issuance forecast. Looking ahead to 2017, we expect an overall increase in global issuance of 3%, positive global trends for issuance include the European Central Bank's quantitative easing program, continued strong issuance out of China and expectations for slightly stronger GDP growth in the US. Global issuance is still likely, however to face headwinds from global political uncertainty and a continued evaluation of most currencies relative to the US dollar.","One item that seems very clear is that interest rates will continue to rise in the US. Rising rates have been an investor concern for several years now as the belief is that rising rates will impair debt issuance. Our fixed come analytical team \u2013 our fixed income analytical team has explored this topic and published report called recent policy proposal potential impact on US corporate bond issuance. You can see it on RatingsDirect.","This charges US corporate issuance in GDP since 1996. Both GDP and issuance increased over the period. We find a statistically significant relationship between US corporate issuance and GDP.","This next chart shows US corporate issuance and the 10 year treasury yield since 1996. Our statisticians ran a number of tests, including the Granger causality test, a statistical test used to determine whether one time series is useful in forecasting another time series. Their conclusion was there is a weak negative correlation between interest rates in issuance.","We've seen a number of tax proposals since the recent election and we've been studying them, people from our tax, finance, economics and public policy team have been evaluating potential changes. The proposals remain in a state of flux and it\u2019s difficult to draw definitive conclusion.","Nevertheless, I want to review our current thinking on the most commonly discussed potential tax changes. First, on a lower corporate tax rate, as the company with a relatively high tax rate, this would be very positive for the company.","On repatriation, a one-time repatriation of that would likely reduce issuance, but would be unlikely to have major impact on long-term capital structure. In addition, much of the cash held overseas is by large technology companies like Apple and Oracle that have very little debt.","For our company specifically, we would reevaluate our investment strategies and that could lead to repatriating much our overseas cash. We believe that the removal interest expense deduction could reduce the attractiveness of debt, particularly for high yield issuers and likely reduce issuance.","However, lower tax rates would provide greater borrowing capacity for companies, which could be positive. As for S&P Global, this would be a negative as we currently at $3.6 billion of long-term debt.","The removal of the municipal bond tax exemption would reduce the attractiveness in muni bonds to investors requiring alternative funding of local projects. Therefore, it likely hurt municipal bond issuance, but infrastructure issuance could potentially increase to partially offset this. Order adjustment could benefit our companies in next export. Please note our 2017 guidance does not consider any of these potential tax law changes.","Let me finish by sharing some of the most important initiative in 2017. As always, delivering financial performance is at the top of the list. We are introducing organic revenue guidance of mid-single-digit growth, adjusted diluted EPS guidance of $5.90 to $6.15 and free cash flow guidance of approximately $1.6 billion. Ewout will provide more color to the guidance in a moment.","Throughout the company, I'm stressing the need to build excellent into all that we do, to be competitive, nothing less is acceptable. Some of the more visible areas includes, launching a beta version of the new market intelligence platform in the fall, leveraging recent acquisitions create world-class supply demand analytics for Platts customers, continuing index innovation and international partnerships and advancing ratings commercial discipline, analytical quality and IT driven productivity.","We continue to track and execute on our SNL synergy program and fund additional productivity initiatives and process improvement and we remain committed to compliance control and risk management across the company. We're pleased with our progress, but we're working to make this company even better.","With that, let me turn the call over to Ewout. Thank you.","Ewout Steenbergen","Thank you, Doug. And good morning to everyone on the call. This morning I would like to discuss the fourth quarter results and then provide guidance for 2017.","Let's starts with the consolidated fourth quarter income statement. Reported revenue increased 2%. However, organic revenue increased a 11%. This was the strongest quarterly organic revenue growth of the year.","Adjusted operating profit increased 17% and adjusted operating margin increased 530 basis points. The adjusted operating margin improved, primarily due to revenue growth, continued progress on productivity initiatives and the sale of lower margin businesses.","The adjusted effective tax rate increased 500 basis points, primarily because the fourth quarter 2015 tax rate was unusually low largely due to favorable tax benefits from the resolution of prior yield tax audits.","In addition, the fourth quarter 2016 rate included the impact from dividends we received from foreign subsidiaries and a slight increase in the US state income tax rate.","Adjusted diluted EPS increased 14% and we decreased our average diluted shares outstanding by 4%. Both our fourth quarter and full-year results were impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates.","In the fourth quarter of 2016 the two main impacts were a $2 million unfavorable impact on the ratings, adjusted operating profit, primarily due to the weaker British pound and a $9 million favorable impact in markets and commodities intelligence adjusted operating profit, primarily due to the weaker British pound and a weaker Indian rupee.","Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. Pretax adjustments to earnings totaled to a gain of $272 million in the quarter and included a $347 million net gain on recent divestitures, predominantly from the sale of the rising businesses and this also includes a $31 million expense associated with disposition of Quant House, a 54 million expense associated with an increase in financial crisis, legal reserves and a $21 million expense related to the early retirement of our 2017 debt.","In the fourth quarter every business segment contributed to gains in organic revenue and adjusted operating profit, while this line shows an 11% decline in reported revenue at market and commodities intelligence. Excluding the impact of asset sales, organic revenue increased to 8%.","Adjusted operating margins improved significantly in ratings and market and commodities intelligence, but declined in S&P Dow Jones Indices. I will discuss these changes within each segment discussion.","Let me now turn to the individual segments performance. Ratings had a strong quarter, leading the company in both revenue and operating profit growth. Revenue increased 14%, including a 1% unfavorable impact from ForEx.","Considering normal seasonality in the fourth quarter US-bond issuance was robust, despite US selection uncertainty, which only constrained bond market activity for a few days.","Adjusted operating margin increased 360 basis points due to strong revenue growth, reduced legal and outside services spending, partially offset by increased incentives. While not shown on the slide, full-year adjusted operating profit margin reached 49.8%, an increase of 240 basis points aided by a modest boost from ForEx.","Strong transaction revenue underscores ratings fourth quarter revenue growth. Non-transaction revenue increased 5% from growth in surveillance fees, increased inter-segment royalty's for market intelligence, and growth at CRISIL.","Transaction revenue increased 26%, as a result of improved contract terms, growth in structure, US public finance and corporate issuance, as well as increased bank loan ratings.","This slide is a new quarterly disclosure that illustrates ratings revenue by its various markets. First, note the corporate and financial make up the majority of revenue. Second, US public finance is the largest component of government. In the fourth quarter there were broad gains in every market with the exception of financials, which was negatively impacted by concerns about US election and an interest rate increase.","If you look more closely at the largest markets, fourth quarter issuance in US was up 14% with investment grade decreasing 2%, high-yield climbing 12%, public finance growing 19% and structured finance soaring 45% due primarily to a 143% increase in CLOs and advance of the implementation of risk retention regulations, which took place on December 24 and a 40% increase in ADS.","In Europe, issuance decreased a 11% with investment grade declining 18%, high-yield decreasing 1% and structured finance increasing 5%. In Asia, issuance increased 1%. However, excluding issuance, that we do not rate, notably domestic China issuance, Asian issuance increased 8%.","Let me now turn to market and commodities intelligence. This segment includes S&P Global market intelligence and S&P Global Platts. In the fourth quarter reported revenue declined a 11% due to recent divestitures.","Excluding these divestitures, organic revenue increased 8%. Despite disposing of businesses that contributed more than $100 million of quarterly revenue, adjusted operating profit increased 8%. This puts into perspective the enormous improvement that has taken place in the segment.","Adjusted operating margin improved 600 basis points, primarily due to SNL integration synergies, Platts expense control, the divestiture of lower margin businesses and ForEx.","Let me add a bit more color on the fourth quarter revenue growth in market intelligence. The most significant items in the quarter were the divestitures of the SPSE and CMA rising businesses, and equity and fund research. In addition, in January we divested Quant House.","Due to the fourth quarter divestitures, revenue remained unchanged. However, organic revenue increased 10% with growth at four major products. Another highlight was the progress we made in the $100 million synergy target, as illustrated on this slide.","Successful integration of SNL and delivery of synergies was a full priority for the company in 2016. We made tremendous progress as evidenced in the margin improvement and remained committed to achieving our integration synergy targets and delivering on our expected return on investment in SNL.","We estimate that two thirds of the $100 million synergy target was achieved at year-end 2016 on a run rate basis. We estimate that approximately one half of the $100 million is reflected in our full year 2016 results.","We are particularly pleased to have achieve about $10 million in run rate revenue synergies, about one half of the revenue synergies came from utilizing Capital IQ relationships to sell the SNL global financial institutions product, about one quarter from using SNL relationships to sell the Capital IQ Desktop and one quarter from new business combining Cap IQ risk scorecards with SNL banks data.","If you look at the markets within market intelligence more closely within financial data and analytics, S&P Capital IQ Desktop and Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 7% with high single-digit growth in S&P Capital IQ Desktop.","In addition, SNL revenue increased 14% over the fourth quarter of 2015, SNL and S&P Capital IQ Desktop experienced year-over-year user percentage growth of 11% and 8%, respectively. Risk services revenue increased 10% led by growth in RatingsXpress.","Platts delivered solid organic revenue growth in an improving commodity environment. Oil prices rallied around the OPEC agreement to cut production. PIRA forecasts 2017 oil prices in the range of $60 to 70 a barrel if OPEC members comply with the agreement.","While the OPEC agreement provide support for the oil prices, RigData has reported that the weekly US rig count reached 782 in January and that\u2019s the highest level in over a year, rating downward pressure on pricing.","Nevertheless, the outlook for many of our customers is better now than at the start of 2016. Fourth quarter revenue increased 12%. However, excluding revenue from recent acquisitions, organic revenue increased 5%, due to growth in subscriptions and double-digit growth in global trading services.","The core subscription business delivered mid single digit revenue growth, led by the petroleum and petrochemical sectors. Global trading services double-digit revenue increase was primarily due to strong volumes.","Now let me turn to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 13%, mostly due to ETF assets under management growth and increased data subscriptions. Adjusted operating profit increased 10%, primarily as a result of increased revenue.","Adjusted operating margin declined 200 basis points to 61.6%, due primarily to the Trucost acquisition. Investments in a third data center, increased marketing costs, and higher cost of sales from growth in OTC derivatives activity.","The highlight of the quarter was ETF AUM tied to our indices, booking $1 trillion in December. We celebrated a $500 billion mark in 2013 and three years later we doubled that milestone, clearly to trend from active to passive investing has been an advantage for the index business.","Asset linked fee revenue increased 10% during the quarter. The exchange traded fund industry recorded enormous inflows for the second straight quarter, amassing $133 billion in the fourth quarter, driving yearly inflows of $380 billion, a new annual record.","Average ETF AUM associated with our indices increased 19% year-over-year. As mentioned 2016, ending ETF AUM associated with our indices reached a new record of $1 trillion, increasing 25% over year-end 2015, with inflows of 15% and market appreciation 10%.","Transaction revenue from exchange traded derivatives increased primarily due to an 8% increase in average daily volume of products based on our indices S&P 500 index options, that grow with a 22% increase in volume to VIX Options and Futures, and CME Equity complex contracts increased mid single-digit.","Subscription revenue, which consists primarily of data subscriptions and custom indices increased 24% due to growth in data subscription revenue and the timing of subscription revenue. During the quarter the company launched 88 new indices and our partners launched new 23 new ETFs based on our indices.","Our capital position is strong, as we look at the net debt of the company, we ended the year with $2.4 billion of cash, of which approximately $1.7 billion was held outside the US and $3.6 billion of long-term debt. Our debt coverage improved year-over-year as measured by gross debt to adjusted EBITDA from 1.6 times to 1.4 times.","Free cash flow during the year was approximately $1.2 billion. However, to get a better sense of our underlying cash generation from operations, it is important to exclude activity associated with divestitures and related tax expenses and the after-tax impact of legal and regulatory settlements and related insurance recoveries. On that basis, free cash flow in 2016 was nearly $1.5 billion.","As for return of capital, the company returned $1.5 billion to shareholders in 2016, $1.1 billion through share repurchases, as we completed our $750 million accelerated share repurchase plan in December and $380 million in dividends.","Now, lastly, I will review our 2017 guidance. Based upon modestly improving global GDP and issuance growth, we introduced 2017 adjusted guidance as follows, mid single-digit organic revenue growth, the contributions by every business segment, unallocated expense $145 million to $150 million, a modest increase over 2016, due to investments in Asia and upfront investments in office consolidations, deal-related amortization of about $100 million, operating margin increase of roughly 100 basis points, interest expense of approximately $155 million, a tax rate of about 30% to 31%, diluted EPS which excludes deal-related amortization of $5.90 to $6.15.","The range is wider than prior years due to recent that would be vast new guidance for accounting or stop payments to employees, which we estimate would increased EPS by $0.10 to $0.15 depending on SPGI's share price development and option exercise activity.","Capital expenditures is a range of $125 million to $140 million, as we anticipate increased investments in technology, data and efficient real estate solutions. Free cash flow, excluding after tax, legal settlements and insurance recoveries of $1.6 billion and we expect an annual dividend of $1.64 per share.","Our guidance does not take into consideration any potential policy changes from the new US administration. Overall, this guidance reflects our expectation that 2017 will be another strong year for the company.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions.","Chip Merritt","Thank you, Ewout. Just a couple instructions for our phone participants. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we'll now take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. This question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS. You may now ask your question.","Alex Kramm","Yes. Good morning, everyone. First of all, thanks for the Pokemon Go, that made a highlight of my day, so I nicely done. Secondly, in terms of the business, just wanted to come into the ratings guidance a little bit more, what you are expecting there?","If I look at your business \u2013 the mid single digit growth for the whole company, and I looked like \u2013 I look at what index is running right now in terms of the run rate, and I look at where now market intelligence has probably growing consistently. It seems like it's a little bit conservative or light on the rating side. In particular, if you are telling us 3% growth in India in issuance.","So either you are little bit less more conservative on pricing or you just conservative in general, but what are you expecting in terms of ratings revenue here?","Doug Peterson","Alex, this is Doug. Well, thank you for the - joining the call, and for your comments. On issuance, we've incorporated various factors into our issuance forecast. As you know, in the slides we gave you before, we showed you the expectations for issuance coming up.","We've always talked before about the relationship between GDP growth and issuance being a stronger one than interest rate. As you know January had very strong issuance. The issuance in January was a record, it was a $532 billion. It was up 13.6% from the prior years.","A lot of that issuance was in the US. The US was up 93%. We've incorporated that into the year. Our expectation is that the first half of the year should be fairly strong, given the overall investment profile that we expect of the economy and we've looked at more uncertainty in the second and half of the year, as we don't know exactly what the impact is going to be of the new administration aspects that are going to be rolling out, whether it's tax reform, regulatory reform, infrastructure investment, et cetera.","In addition, we've incorporated some uncertainty into the second half the year related to Brexit and other geopolitical of aspects. But overall we're - we believe that 3% forecast which was prepared by our fixed income analytics team is the is strong, its based off of the combination of refinancing which we already aware of and we're expecting that most of that will come through. And then what we see in pipelines from meeting with investment banks and rating issuance advisors to build our forecast.","But it still off of the base, as you know of those different factors and we're comfortable today that that\u2019s \u2013 what we're including in our guidance.","Alex Kramm","All right. Fair enough. Thank you. And then just secondly, quickly, maybe on the market intelligence side a little bit here. When we talk to customers, it sounds like you are increasingly bundling all these different products, which obviously you've put under one roof now.","So maybe you can talk a little bit more about, there seems like there's more of a move to enter price pricing and it seems like you are able to maybe you know, gain a little bit of more pricing power in the process.","So maybe just talk about what's going on there and how that could be impacting revenue, maybe more than what we've seen in the last couple of years?","Doug Peterson","We've made great progress on the integration of SNL and Cap IQ to turn it into market intelligence. As you know, we've been reporting on our synergies throughout that time and how we've done with the different expense synergies and revenue synergies.","On our expense synergies, as you\u2019ve seen we've made excellent progress. This is allowed us to have an intensive focus on our commercial activities, on our operational activities and be able to address customer needs in a way that's more comprehensive and integrated across the Cap IQ and SNL platforms.","As I mentioned in my remarks, we are developing and will be launching later this year, a pilot program market intelligence window which will allow us on the desktop through mobile platforms, et cetera to be able to address the needs of our customers. And what that's leading to from a commercial point of view, what your question is more specifically about, is that we can provide enterprise licenses which take into account the usage and the breadth of need of a firm and provide them with a more simple contract that allows in many cases, more users or more access to the system, which on the one hand, might as a per user basis end up maybe being less expensive to them, but they're using a lot more data and many more users in it which is very beneficial to us.","So this like many of our different products and services across the company, these truly are a customer by customer basis in terms of how we deal with them and the sales process its a long professional sales market, sales process. We've restructured our sales team. So they are unified and they've been rolling out a comprehensive approach to our different markets, whether it's by regions or it\u2019s by different types of industries and segment.","And as you pointed out that is our approach this year would be to rolling out, almost everywhere, but especially where it makes sense enterprise wide pricing for market intelligence.","Alex Kramm","Excellent. Thanks for the color.","Doug Peterson","Thanks, Alex.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Manav Patnaik of Barclays. You may ask your question.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen and congratulations and welcome to Ewout to the call. May be just on the ratings question, in the other way to ask that question is, you're 3% issuance volume forecast for 2017. If you were to back out sovereign ratings, which I think you guys don\u2019t make much money on and then China domestic you said you don't do, what would that 3% number look like from a volume perspective?","Doug Peterson","If you just give me one second, I've got that calculated here. So let me just give you some of the numbers, more specifically the breakdown with and without those, I don't know if I have the aggregate number in front of me, but the - when you look at non-financial, it's going to be in a range of approximately 2% to 6%, financial institutions from about 1.5 to 4, structured is right now one of the areas that I am least certain about, its more in kind of the 0% to 6% range.","And even though you look at the public finance potentially dropping a lot this year, given the headwinds and what we saw a very strong issuance last couple of year. So public finance could be down 5% to 10%.","So overall issuance about 3% and excluding sovereigns in domestic China is also about 3%, once you take the positive upside in non-financial, what you've seen like in this first of month of the year. And then you subtract some of the downsides. We still in up with about 3%, excluding sovereign.","Manav Patnaik","Okay. Got it. And then in the market intelligence side, I think you said two thirds of the $100 million was realized so far on a run rate basis and you are targeting three fourth by the end 2017. So is that being conservative or is that you know, factoring in I guess your new platform launch that probably requires a bunch of investments. I just wanted some color there in terms of the - how we should think about the progress?","Ewout Steenbergen","Good morning, Manav. This is Ewout. We would certainly not consider that guidance as conservative. What you obviously might see when you do an integration is that you first take care of the low hanging fruits. That's why there's always a large acceleration of the benefits at the beginning and then the remaining of the integration synergy benefits from later during the year and take more time to achieve that.","And so this is really the best guidance we have, we expect that the remaining of the gains will be more backend loaded, because it is the harder part of the synergies, especially related to bringing our products to a one platform, that is really the main outstanding where the remainder of the synergies will be achieved.","Manav Patnaik","Got it, Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Ms. Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Toni Kaplan","Hi, good morning.","Doug Peterson","Morning.","Ewout Steenbergen","Morning.","Toni Kaplan","Could you give us a rough breakdown of what drove the margin expansion within market intelligence this quarter on an apples-to-apples basis? Basically just trying to get at how much of the expansion was driven by legacy Cap IQ, Platts and from the SNL synergies?","Doug Peterson","Let me first of all just tell you what's some of the elements are, I don\u2019t know if I can give you a precise basis point by basis point approach to that. But as you remember we have a combination of the three different businesses within market intelligence which you\u2019ve seen the desktop, the enterprise business, the SNL businesses and the new risk services.","We have Platt, we've taken out J.D. Power, we've taken out what was our pricing businesses, J.D. Power had generally a lower margin than the new average margin, the pricing businesses have higher-margin, than the actual businesses. But I don't have the actual numbers and I am going to look to Ewout to see if he has a chart with those actual numbers. But those are the elements that are incorporated into that margin.","Ewout Steenbergen","Yes. And Toni, what I specifically would like to point out, is that the total margin change for market and commodities intelligence for the full year 2016 was 410 basis points. The FX element in that were 140 basis points.","So that gives you the breakdown of how much was really underlying performance improvements, over the difference area versus the amount that came from FX and then as Doug said, there is the different elements of the businesses that are having different levels of margins. But we probably need to come back to you later on with more specifics on that.","Toni Kaplan","Okay. And are you providing updated targets for I guess market intelligence margin, now that the segment includes Platts?","Doug Peterson","Well, let me let me just tell you little bit about margins generally, if you don\u2019t mind, I'll give you some broader aspect to it. We don't have any guidance specifically about our margins, but we do have what I may call aspirations.","As you know in the last few years we've had an intensive focus on margins, that\u2019s a combination of improving commercial activities, growing the top line, as well as maintaining productivity and being very disciplined around investment.","In ratings, we aspire to be with a \u2013 to have a five handle, its beginning of our margin where we've been there over quarters, but we aspire to be in the low 50s and this we help - we believe we could get there through the continued commercial discipline in some of our productivity programs.","In the market commodity intelligence segment, we aspire to the mid to high 30s. We think that as we complete our synergy programs over the next couple years, as well as ongoing productivity program and commercial programs that we've be aspiring towards that.","In index, we do not have a target. We are very comfortable with the level of margin that we have now in the 66 - in the last years or so it\u2019s between 60 and 66. We know that there's kind of \u2013 it popped around a little bit. But we don't have any target that\u2019s different than what we have there and which should be in the low 60s. But those are the - up for the three segments. Those are the - our aspiration of our margin.","Toni Kaplan","Terrific. Thanks, congrats of the quarter.","Doug Peterson","Thank you.","Ewout Steenbergen","Thanks, Toni.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie Research. You may ask your question.","Hamzah Mazari","Good morning. Thank you. The first question is just - if you could just give us an update on European bank disintermediation and whether Europe's mix, how does that stack up to the US in terms of loans and bonds?","Doug Peterson","Yes. So that is a \u2013 that\u2019s been something that's been really interesting, as we continue to watch the development of the European market. It almost kind of goes and fits and start between when do you see issuance that\u2019s starting off in the European markets and you get some very strong orders of European issuance and then you get some very weak orders in issuance.","The main factor which is inhibiting that is really the ECB liquidity program. The ECB liquidity programs has continued to provide a lot of liquidity in the European banks and it's basically between the strength of their capital which is been improving in European liquidity programs that are in-place.","It\u2019s allowing the banks to continue to be strong lenders, but there is a general shift overall towards more and more issuance in the market. Just as an example, in this year - during the year that was in January you saw the issuance go up in Europe in financial institution, in the industrial it was down a little bit, you've also seen more in sovereign. So total Europe was up about 13% in January.","Over the last couple years, it's been up and down, it goes from being up to flat, et cetera. But I do think it\u2019s the most important aspect or is really combination of what we see happening with the LTRO programs, the ECB liquidity programs and the overall bank behavior that they're holding more and more credit on their balance sheet.","Now the other final point I'd make is that the ECB itself has a very high demand for the purchase of assets. They continue as quantitative easing program and assets they want to buy or investment grade debt security and ECB itself has been talking about promoting the development of capital markets.","In addition, there is a program based out of Brussels called the Capital Markets Union. The Brussels financial - the financial regulators are all in favor of having a more cohesive and more European wide approached capital market. So we are very close to those initiatives.","We have people in Brussels. We visit Brussels a lot. We visit all of the major financial capital and we believe that this will continue to be a positive over the long run, but it might be going in fits and starts.","Hamzah Mazari","Great. And just a follow-up, within the Indices business, are you concerned that all around fee pressure with given how concentrated the ETF market is, I know back in 2012 you had a \u2013 we had a Vanguard change the way that they looked at their customer base.","I know there were more retail versus institutional. But you know, any color around how you're thinking about fee pressure in the Indices business or is that just not a concern?","Doug Peterson","It is a concern to the extent that we're going through a lot of change in the industry and if I told you otherwise, I probably would be telling you something we spend a lot of time thinking about. We do have though a few factors which we think position us incredibly well.","One is that we have benchmarks that are must have benchmarks, like the S&P and Dow Jones and other branded benchmarks that we have that are really necessary for whether it's the actual ETFs or other investment products or for the data that\u2019s required by investment managers to be able to benchmark their portfolios in their performance. So we think that we have one advantages in terms of the types of brands and the kinds of products we have.","The second is maybe a little bit, if you go back to microeconomics and remember those curves of elasticity of demand and some of the products which we believe are going to see price cut, the price cut might be offset by the volume growth. And I don't want to say that that's always going to sort of work out that way.","But if you look at the overall growth of volume in this industry and the recent DOL [ph] of ruling which looks like it might be reversed, was going to probably benefit ETF and passive investment.","We probably see some sort of passive investment benefit from a lot of these trends that will also benefit us. So even if some of the fees do go down and there is some fee pressure, we should be seeing some advantage of that from volume.","Just as an example, we mentioned it in our call, but it was just three years ago that we were across the $500 billion line for ETF AUMs and we now crossed a $1 trillion at the end of the year last year, even only a year ago we were $815 billion.","So the growth in these - it's a combination of new flows into the asset classes, as well as obviously increasing the value of the indices themselves that we see that from, but we do - we are very aware of the cost pressure.","We are working closely with ETF providers and others and it\u2019s something that we are ensuring that we can maintain a leadership position in the quality of our benchmark, the positioning that they have. But pricing pressure is something that we're aware of and we're trying to actively manage towards it.","Hamzah Mazari","All right. Thank you, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Jeff Silber","Thanks so much. I wanted to go back to some of the debt issuance trends you were talking about earlier, you mentioned January was a real strong month, specifically in the US.","Do you think any of your US clients might be front running some potential policy changes and will get a bit inflow early on in the year that will paper as the year progresses?","Doug Peterson","It\u2019s really hard for me to project. I've been doing this for now almost 6 years and every quarter there is a different mix of what has been attractive in the markets, it depends on investment, on growth, on GDP growth, on what the interest rate environment is going to be, what Janet Yellen might do with interest rates, what the net exchange rates is going to be for people have global operation.","I \u2013 its possible if there's some pull forward that\u2019s taken place in January, it's also possible there were some pull forward into the fourth quarter, but there is a very healthy refinancing pipeline that we look at, some of the issuance that was done in January was issuance by companies that have - already have incredible amounts of cash on their balance sheet, like Microsoft and IBM and AT&T and Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo and BoA.","And so the largest issuers in January weren't necessarily those that needed the cash, they also were all corporation and have massive amounts of cash offshore. So I don't know, I can't really answer your question about this pull forward or not.","But we do in our forecast, if you look at the forecast that we prepared, we do have a more robust first half of the year than the second half year in the forecast that we've prepared, which was the 3% growth in issuance for 2017.","Jeff Silber","All right. That\u2019s helpful. And then if I could just switch over to margin, you were kind of enough to give us some of your long-term target by segment. I know you don\u2019t usually guide by specific segment for the year.","But I'm just wondering directionally what you're incorporating for margins by segment to get to your target for the company overall? Thanks.","Ewout Steenbergen","We don't give specific by segments. But as we said in the prepared remarks that we expect margin expansion for each of our businesses.","Jeff Silber","Okay. great. I'll follow up offline. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Peter Appert of Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question.","Peter Appert","Thanks. Good morning. So Doug the strength in the fourth quarter ratings revenue performance is very impressive. I am wondering if it's possible to give us any granularity in terms of the drivers of the revenue performance, in terms of market share or pricing and just overall market growth?","Ewout Steenbergen","Let me give you some of the components here. And so I'm looking here at the revenue components, if you make a breakdown between transaction and non-transaction, transaction was up 26%, non-transaction was up 5%.","If you look at a breakdown by region, US saw the largest growth of close to 17%. The EMEA region was around 6%, Asia, ex-Japan was around 8% and Japan itself was 13% and then the rest of were other small numbers. I have to note that Canada had as quite large increase of 63%.","If you look at another breakdown of revenue, corporates we so up by 18%, financial services down 9%, infrastructure up 40%, US public 37%, sovereigns 10% and structure 11%. So overall I could say revenue was up very strong across the board.","We saw expenses up $30 million quarter-over-quarter. That has mostly to do with incentive compensation and catch up, given the strong results for the quarter itself. So if you look at the combination of strong revenue growth across the board, in almost all regions and issuer types, as well as really good expense control with the one change an increase related to incentive compensation, we saw those margins in the ratings went up in a very healthy way.","Doug Peterson","Peter, let me add that if you go back to the slides that Ewout presented, there is a new slide which shows the revenue mix across broad categories. We thought it was helpful for you to see a little bit further breakdown on that and I don't remember the actual slide number. We can pull that that up.","But it shows where we've got the growth across the different business segments and is an example in financials there was a drop in the fourth quarter, in financial issuance from 115 to 104, that\u2019s our revenue mix. In corporates they went up 20% from 283 to 340.","We think that that should also help to give you some kind of the direction as to what the - what issuance trends are, as well as the revenue that we're seeing from those and you can get a view across the board how we think we're doing those different groups. And all of them are a combination of all the different factors which Ewout mentioned.","Peter Appert","Got it. Thank you. And then\u2026","Doug Peterson","At slide 29, sorry.","Peter Appert","Okay, great. Thank you. Do you have any preliminary thoughts on how potential changes in Dodd-Frank might impact the business?","Doug Peterson","Not really, we have looked at Dodd Frank, there's really two aspects to it that I could mention, but this is \u2013 think of this little bit more speculation as because we don\u2019t have a lot of facts as to where this might go.","On the - on ourselves, we believe that the overall Dodd Frank rules that is coming in place are similar to the other 21, I guess jurisdictions around the world, where we're also rated. So even if Dodd Frank changes it\u2019s not going to change our operating model very much because we're regulated as similarly or even more heavily in other jurisdictions like it by ASMA [ph] in Europe.","So there might be changes to Dodd Frank, they can have some small benefits to us in the US, but they're not necessary they're going have that much of an impact if we have to continue to comply with a similar or the exact same kind of provisions everywhere else in the world.","On the actual markets themselves, to the extent that there are Dodd Frank provisions which improve market liquidity or investor issuer access or clarify some of the things around, for instance of Volcker rules we see.","Thanks for getting back into more proprietary trading and a higher liquidity in issuance in the markets or if there was a change to the of risk retention rule that allowed CLOs and CMBS issuance to explode if there \u2013 it has been that much of an impact from the risk retention rule, I can't quite tell, but it looks like it might be a slight impact.","But those are the things that could be more market impact. They don't have anything to do with us directly. But if they end up providing an environment where there is growth in the market, in particular growth in financial markets, higher liquidity, higher issuance, we would potentially benefit from that.","Peter Appert","Thank you, Doug.","Doug Peterson","Thanks, Peter.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Tim McHugh of William Blair. You may ask your question.","Tim McHugh","Yes, thanks. Just following a little bit on that question. I guess, I think it was getting some of your initiatives to improve pricing and I guess the strength in bank loans. How much \u2013 were there any kind of big incremental changes in the fourth quarter and I guess how much more room is there to run with trying to drive \u2013 I guess, your improvement even relative to whatever the market does?","Doug Peterson","Well, I don't know if I call it relative to what the market does, but relative to ourselves, we've had a, what I would call a multiyear program to bolster our of commercial activities in the rating agency, a result of our own changes in Dodd Frank we have hired a world-class team of commercial people in our rating agency.","They are now out building relationships with customers, anticipating their needs for capital markets activities by looking at their own exposures around the globe and by being closer in a relationship, having this relationship model, its allowed us to also demonstrate what is the value that we bring and have a one-off, as I call them kind of individual conversation and negotiations with customers around the globe.","And we've started seeing the benefit of that from higher contract realization and we expect that that will continue to flow through in 2017. We saw the benefit of that in last year, some of that into the fourth quarter. But it is part of our top line growth strategy is to have these one-off relationship conversation with the issuers, to ensure that they understand the value and we can see some of that value through improved pricing in contractual terms.","Tim McHugh","Okay. Thanks. And then SNL the growth rate improved there versus a little bit of resources. What you guys have been talking about it, I know you listened a couple of different areas of that business that did well.","But was there anything in particular that changed, I guess in terms of the performance or got much better that drove the acceleration?","Doug Peterson","Yes, if you look you know, for the last I guess, 12 years or so, we've grown over 12% per year, you just bounce in the low teens from quarter-to-quarter, I think with this kind of noise quarter-to-quarter whether there 10% or 14%.","With indices nice strength in the internationals big product, which is one of new things we're launching and conversely we don't see much strength in metals and mining work, this difficult environment.","So those were two kind of newest areas that we've been focusing on. Overall together its kind of better than our model, but it just kind of bounces quarter-to-quarter, are difficult to explain that.","Tim McHugh","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.","Bill Warmington","So good morning, everyone. Congratulations on the strong quarter and also welcome to Ewout. So first question I wanted to ask about the Platts organic revenue growth. It has been trending down for the past three quarters, and this quarter it showed an improvement up to 5%.","And so I wanted to ask whether you're seeing an inflection point in renewals and how those are going, whether you think the stabilization in oil price is helping and if you're seeing any differences there you know, US clients versus international clients?","Doug Peterson","Thank you for that question. On Platts, on our top line growth, it clearly is the combination of all the factors that you discussed. As you remember a few years ago and going back to the question about Dodd Frank, there was - one of the provisions of Dodd Frank ended up that all of the major financial institutions exited the commodities businesses, and now it had been a major drag on our top line growth and on our revenue level is all of the major global financial institutions exited commodities - trading and commodities businesses.","A few of those have a tiny trading desk left, but most of them sold their commodities businesses to other trading organization, who are already our customers and we saw some loss of revenue there, that had been a headwind.","There was also a headwind when you saw the oil price, which had been in the $100 range drop into the 20s and 30s and it put a lot of pressure on our major customers that are producers on the upstream side, who are getting squeezed by their - on their profit margins and they were in tough negotiations to see what kind of renewal levels we get, what kind of increase in pricing. So there were some headwinds there.","Obviously on the other hand, some of the users, power plants and airlines and others saw a big benefit from the lower oil prices and low energy prices and we had some potential upside there.","But I think we're getting into a normalized position with the oil prices in the 40s, 50s and 60s. There still are some organizations but that's not the right level that they can be very profitable in. But we do think that we will look carefully at the overall market positioning. We felt that the increase in more maybe more stable oil market benefits us.","And as you know, one of our revenue streams that we talk about is the market services area. So it\u2019s not just the - we saw a strong growth in that area which is one of the other areas.","So we're not only just a subscription business, but we do have a small amount of our revenue coming from market and trading services and that area did benefit from the volatility as the market moves back up from the lower price to the middle price.","So every factor you mentioned are things that we watched. We think that we're in a more stable environment. We don't think that there's going to be anybody getting in and out of this business and we'll be negotiating throughout this year ongoing long-term contract.","Bill Warmington","And probably second question, just a housekeeping question. The 590 to 615 EPS guidance, does that include or assume a $0.10 to $0.15 benefit from the stock-based comp in that or would that stock-based comp be incremental to that 590 to 615?","Ewout Steenbergen","That includes the $0.10 to $0.15 from the accounting change for Texas-based payments.","Bill Warmington","Great. All right, thank you very much and congratulations again.","Doug Peterson","Thank you.","Ewout Steenbergen","Thanks, Bill. And Bill I don\u2019t want to thank any of them, I want to clarify this right now, the pronunciation is Ewout, the W is capital to V, so it\u2019s Ewout for everybody.","Bill Warmington","Ewout. Thank you very much.","Ewout Steenbergen","No problem, Bill.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from James Friedman of Susquehanna Financial Group. You may ask your question.","James Friedman","Hi. I wanted to \u2013 just ask my two upfront. Ewout, I was wondering if you could repeat what you said if anything about what assumptions are embedded with regard to repurchase, I heard the stock-based comp, but the repurchase?","And then Doug, if I could ask, just because we get this one a lot too deep into the pool, but with regard to the border adjustability tax, if you could just give us the cliff notes from your view at least, is the \u2013 do you think of the company as an exporter, and you know, maybe if you can give us some qualitative observations about that, that will be helpful?. Thank you.","Ewout Steenbergen","Let me start James, good morning. Regarding the assumptions underneath our EPS guidance with respect to buyback activities, at this moment cannot specifically comment on the size and timing for obvious reasons. But what I can say is the following, we will continue with buyback activities also in 2017, following the strong track record of the company.","We believe it's a good use of the strong cash position we have and also the strong future cash generation we predict and we believe our stock today is attractive at current levels. We will be of course be disciplined and focused on the way how we really can create value enhancement for shareholders.","So definitely there is an assumption with respect to buyback, but it cannot give you the specifics, but I hope that gives you a flavor for the underlying philosophy, and especially the disciplines, capital management we will apply as a company.","Doug Peterson","And let me pick up the question the border adjustability, as you know that the tax code was updated 30 years ago in 1986 and at the time our economy and the tax code is still very much skewed towards agriculture and manufacturing, especially with preferences and special exemptions for lot of industries. And it's been a long time that we needed an update of our tax system.","We also have the \u2013as you know, and one of the highest tax - corporate tax rate in industrialized world with us ourselves paying over 30% rate, which is been very high. Now specifically related to border adjustability, this is one of those - one of those areas that is probably quite controversial because the way it impacts different types of organization.","As you know because we have such a high tax rate any lowering of rate would benefit us and then specifically in border adjustability, we're an intellectual property firm that is been around for long time and our intellectual property is principally registered in the US and in fact, even in New York.","And when we sell and we have customers that are paying us from offshore to use our ratings or our indices or market intelligence or re Platts data and that is being purchased overseas, that would be considered to be an export of services and we would benefit from a lower tax rate or from the border adjustability where we would not be having to pay a tax on that export of services.","I don't have a specific dimension yet that I could tell you exactly what the benefit could be because we don't have enough of the proposal. But I would tell you that we would be a major beneficiary of that border adjustability and it's something that as that is developed we have our tax team, our economic team, our are public affairs team, et cetera are working closely with other advocacy groups and organizations in Washington to understand all these proposals and what the impact might be. But this is one that for us could be a major benefit.","James Friedman","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Craig Huber of Huber Research. You may ask your question.","Craig Huber","Yes, good morning. My first question I guess, has to do with interest expense deductibility this whole issue, if it will or will not be included in the potential tax plan later this year, if it is included in there, and I guess depending on how it may be structured if someone like Germany were going to deduct that interest expense at about 30% of EBITDA or of its 100% eliminated.","What is your \u2013 on those two different scenarios, German one versus getting at a 100%, what is your general thought again with further what it would to the corporate finance debt issuance once it gets up and rolling in 2018 or something\u2026","Doug Peterson","Yes, and Craig, as you can imagine from my prior answer, where this is also on our list with the same teams that we're looking out with advocacy groups and our tax accounting, finance, public affairs groups, et cetera.","This is one of those proposals that we think would have a - also but tends to have a negative impact on issuance. Clearly, it's a proposal that is linked with a pay for to other sorts of changes in the tax code. For example, accelerated, depreciation would be paid for with elimination of the interest rate deductibility.","So we see it, typically in combination with other types of - other types of benefits which then need to get paid for it and they were paid for by this interest rate deductibility. In all of the work that we've done looking at the different systems, we think that the major impact is going to be on high yield issuers.","And as you know, if you go back to what's the typical deal thesis of leveraged buyout or of many sponsor deal, there is a - the high-yield debt not only provide them access to capital and improves in ROE, it also provides a tax shield and the interest rate expense itself is part of the deal calculation as to what's sort of tax shield you get from the interest rate. And so this is the part of the yield curve and the credit card where we think they will be the biggest impact and potentially issuance could get hit there.","When we look at the higher quality end of the rating scale. So, blue-chip companies, investment grade companies, even without the deduction, we think that would still be more attractive to companies in issuing equity.","I don't think companies are going to be wanting to flood the market with equity, do their financing. There might be a boon to investment bankers to structure hybrid or other sorts of instruments that could be a debt like or maybe equity like, but not considered to be a common equity.","We do rate a lot of those types of instruments. So preferred shares and in anything with kind of fixed coupon, we do - we do rate those kind of equities or things like that. But we do think that overall elimination of interest rate deductibility would probably be a net negative to issuance and that we're operating on right now.","But we're trying to look very closely at the market and what the actual proposal is since we don\u2019t really know what the proposal is and what it\u2019s going to.","So we're going to have to watch this. We do know that over the long-term in issuance levels are much more related to GDP growth. But this discussion about interest rate deductibility and tax law changes, does throw some new elements into our planning and our thinking that we've got to be very close to.","Craig Huber","And then I had a question please on your S&P ratings business, up 14% revenue growth, just to want to in a quarter, I want to better understand - this better contract terms of roughly last year you guys changed your contract terms with your customers the help you put on them, that on pricing side for you guys.","Do you have a sense of how much that 14 percentage points of growth came from better contract pricing and then also as you think out to 2017, is there much left to do, I realize its generally analyzed from what you can change you to help boost revenue growth in 2017, and help quantify that, was that a few 100 basis points are not event that?","Ewout Steenbergen","We don't quantify the amount of the contract changes Greg, so we can't help you with that portion of the question. What was the other part of your question, I apologize.","Craig Huber","Is there a much left to go with a set of\u2026","Ewout Steenbergen","And as Doug mentioned earlier, so we think we made some nice progress in 2016. We think there's more progress that can be made 2017. And I would say in those two years that will be probably the bulk of the progress on these programs we're working on. It could be a little tail after that, but most of it would be in '16 and '17.","Craig Huber","Okay. Thank you.","Ewout Steenbergen","Thanks, Craig.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your question.","Mike Reid","Hi, guys. This is Mike Reid on for Joe. Thanks for taking our call. Can you give a little color on just on the continued prospects for indices outside of equities? I guess including fixed income, all the way through the custom indices. And also do you see the custom indices helping you gain market share?","Doug Peterson","Well, first of all on index as you know we have been diversifying our business in various ways. One of them is through different sorts of indices, as you mentioned fixed income indices, right now that is a very, very new industry, so to speak. Its just recently have the index of large index complexes started moving into organization to see them on a professional index managed approach to building up ETF products, et cetera.","We think that that space is still wide open and one that there's not a lot of ETF volume and should be growing and we're hoping to pay much larger position t here. Custom indices and factor indices are getting very popular, specially with family offices, sovereign wealth fund and investors that need some sort of benchmark to manage specific against risk or asset liability matching in their portfolio. We continue to see that is an area where we're investing and growing.","We also have two other areas I want to mention, one in the ESG. We've bought Trucost and Trucost is an organization that provides a very precise and high quality climate and water and other sorts of environmental facts, environmental data. We're able to use that to build environmental or climate or other ESG type fund.","We see a very high demand for data and analytics and now increasingly also helpful for fund that has incorporate ESG or sustainability or long-term growth type factors, especially coming from sovereign wealth funds and from pensions and endowments in northern Europe and some places around Europe and United States. So that's another area of growth.","And then generally across the business, we're looking to see how we can capitalize off of the value of our data more and more and see that is one of our growth areas and not just the traditional ways that we've had with AUMs and a fund approach in using our benchmarks into the fund area.","So data and data and analytics is an area that we are looking at and that's where some of the other aspects to how the data is used, how we look at market et cetera, we're thinking that there should be some opportunities there as well.","Mike Reid","Thanks. Thank you for the color on that.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Andre Benjamin of Goldman Sachs. You may now ask your question.","Andre Benjamin","Thanks. Good morning. So my question is back to tax reform, I was wondering if you are talking to any of the larger CFO, how they think about their balance sheet and EPS impact. I was just wondering is there any indication that people are putting more weight on the impact of funding costs versus the bottoms up impact on EPS, I am just trying to some inside into how CFOs are actually weighing those offsetting factors?","Doug Peterson","Andre, I don't have enough of base of discussions yet to give you - to give you like a scientific answer, I can just tell you anecdotally, this every CEO and every CFO that we've been meeting with are studying the tax reform proposals the same way we are.","There is then \u2013 if you met with the largest organization's, the largest global organizations and if you look at the repatriation topic which we haven't touched on, repatriation is one that also has a very large impact on companies and could have as I mentioned in my comments a shorter-term impact on issuance if people brought back a lot of cash and don't need to go to market. We don\u2019t we'll have a long-term impact.","But there's a lot of corporations that have literally - there is a couple trillion dollars $2.5 trillion we believe in overseas cash that could also going into that equation. And I don't - as I said, I only have anecdotal evidence, I do not have anything that\u2019s scientific yet.","Each company is impacted differently, if you went in that with retailers that import a lot of their products from offshore, if it's - weather clothing, apparel, toys, electronics, et cetera, this the approach towards the border adjustability has a very negative impact on them. If you speak with large exporters, like GE and Boeing and Caterpillar, order adjustability is a very positive impact on them.","A lot of the CFOs of the more highly rated companies, the combination of a much lower tax rate and interest deductibility are kind of a wash. And so they would say that it's not going to - the interest rate deductibility is not going to have any impact whatsoever on their issuance programs because net-net, the net after tax cost as even can be lower because the interest rate is lowered so much.","So again, I can only be anecdotal. I would hope that as we go throughout the years and we get more specific proposals that I could give you better answers then I just did. But those are the kinds of factors that are being looked at in the kinds of conversations we've been having. But right now it's all anecdotal.","Andre Benjamin","All right. That\u2019s helpful. And I guess just one homework question, model keeping, from as the combined market intelligence Platts business going forward, as we combine those segments in our model, should we assume that we'll continue to get the individual revenue from market intelligence and Platts going forward?","Doug Peterson","Yes. We will disclose that\u2019s going forward as well. So you should see the breakdown in the future.","Andre Benjamin","All right. Thank you.","Doug Peterson","Thanks, Andre.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our final question from Ansh Singh from Credit Suisse. You may now ask your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning, guys. My first question on the revenue synergies inside of market intelligence related to the integration that\u2019s going on. I realize you spoke to some left from synergies in the quarter, but hoping for some more color on how that's going, is it going along with your expectations, slightly better, slightly weaker. Just wanted to get your perspective on how customers are responding to your early cross-selling integration efforts?","Doug Peterson","It\u2019s better than expectation. They had a target, and we cannot necessarily share with you folks, on what they would accomplish at this point in time, and the $10 million target has exceeded - or the number has exceeded at target. So they were very pleased with that.","But once again this is still early days because its a lot of piloting going on as you know, Cap IQ reps are going to Cap IQ customers and saying hey, look our arsenal product, let me show you what we do this.","But to me the biggest move really can't take place until you have one integrated platform, right. That\u2019s when you can really begin to shape customers behavior were meaningfully and that\u2019s not going to be for a while.","Ewout Steenbergen","They are going to start to beta testing that in the third quarter with a very limited number of customers, but we expect that that will really be more of a fourth-quarter event when the market intelligence 1.0 platform is potentially ready for rolling out more - on a more broader basis.","But just as slight a different answer to your question. We're very pleased with the integration of SNL. Its been something that we made some of very tough management decisions when we brought on board, in terms of how we're going to manage the organization, putting these businesses together, which was not necessarily something was very natural for this organization and it's paid off by making those tough decisions right up front and having an excellent management team from SNL that came on board and incorporated some of the best management from the company that was already here.","And generally speaking, we've been ahead of our targets and we've been able to execute in a way that we've had a very good financial performance, principally from expense management, we're now focusing more and more on revenues and we have a few really good early wins.","But I don't want to promise that we can get the same kind of speed of execution on the revenue synergies that we did on expense energy. But it's something we're tracking, we're watching and I'm hopeful that we will. But it\u2019s a lot harder than getting the expense synergy.","Unidentified Analyst","Understood. That\u2019s helpful. And then one last one for me, as it relates to your mid single-digit guidance on revenue, would it be fair to say you're incorporating the most conservatism on your ratings business versus the other ones, hoping for some color on factors that drive you to lower end versus upper end, given that a lot of the potential changes impacting issuance aren\u2019t really getting factored into your outlook at this stage? Thanks.","Ewout Steenbergen","Ansh, how you should see our guidance is really middle of the road, it\u2019s neither conservative nor aggressive. That is the philosophy we apply. We think the guidance we have provided for 2017 is strong guidance form all aspects, high growth, margin expansion, EPS growth, excluding the accounting change. So we're in a range of 8.5% to 12%.","So we think this is a very strong guidance we have provided. There is no particular conservatism in this, its really considered middle of the road.","Doug Peterson","And I'll just \u2013 just one methodic add, and this is not of intent to point - your view is probably similar to other folks out there. January was a great month, if January was a horrible month, maybe that question would even come in, but we can't concern ourselves with one month out of 12 because we know that once every single year it\u2019s choppy for month-to-month. So we can't be swayed by one particular month, as we think about our annual guidance.","Unidentified Analyst","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Chip Merritt","Well, thank everyone for joining the call this morning. As you see we had a very memorable year in 2016. There was a lot of uncertainty in the markets, a lot of change going on with things like the Brexit and US elections, many of those uncertainties continue into 2017, some of the topics we just talked about on issuance trends, tax changes, Dodd-Frank, regulatory changes, et cetera.","We have people all over those and gene4rally speaking we've got our entire organization focused on growth and excellence and we are very excited about the prospects of taking this reshaped, very cohesive portfolio of companies forward.","We appreciate your interest for all the shareholders on the line, we thank you for being shareholders in the company and we are excited about the prospects, despite some of the uncertainty in the markets and we are very pleased you joined the call this morning. And thank you very much.","Operator","That concludes this morning\u2019s call. A PDF version of the presenter slides is available now for downloading from investor.spglobal.com.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce Mr. Chip Merritt, Vice President of Investor Relations in S&P Global. Sir, you may begin.","Robert Merritt","Thank you. Good morning and thanks for joining us for S&P Global Earnings Call. Presenting on this morning's call are Doug Peterson, President and CEO; and Jack Callahan, Chief Financial Officer. This morning we issued a news release with our second quarter 2016 results. If you need a copy of this release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at investor.spglobal.com.","In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we'll provide an adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparison of the corporation's operating performance between periods and to view the corporation's business from the same perspective as managements. The earnings release contains exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measure and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.","Before we begin, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements.

And we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Jason Feuchtwanger in our New York office at (212) 438-1247 subsequent to this call.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?","Doug Peterson","Thank you, Chip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the call. This morning Jack and I will review our second quarter results. We're very pleased with the progress the company is making creating growth in a macroeconomic environment has challenged many of our customers.","Let me begin with the highlights of the second quarter. Every segment delivered revenue growth, this is a testament to the quality of our products and the creativity and execution of the employee to develop and deliver them. In addition to creating growth, driving performance is a key thing in managing the company and margin improvement is an important yardstick by which our progress is measured. This quarter the company delivered 210 basis points expansion in the adjusted operating profit margin. The top priority for 2016 is the integration of SNL. We continue to make progress on SNL integrations and synergy targets, and I'll share few examples with you in a few moments.","Financial performance was excellent with an increase in adjusted diluted EPS of 17% over the most difficult quarter comparison in 2015. As a result of our share repurchases, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding debt by 3% year-over-year. Last week, we received final regulatory approvals for the sale of J.D. Power. Our year-to-date free cash flow was $513 million, and we increased the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range reflecting strong second quarter results.","Before I get to the results in more detail, I want to take a moment to discuss the British exit from the European Union. First and foremost, Brexit has no immediate implications for European operations, it's business as usual for S&P Global. While the media has reported that a number of companies plan on moving operations out of London, we have no such plans. We expect that because of the uncertainty it creates, however, Brexit could hamper issuance, particularly in Europe. So far the impact has been muted but markets never like uncertainty; it will take time to resolve all of the various regulatory changes that companies and markets will face.","Our company will seek to work with a relevant UK and EU legal and regulatory authorities to navigate the path forward, a process that will likely take years. S&P Global Ratings has written extensively on the impact that Brexit will have on the markets and our views can be found on the S&P Global Ratings website at the URL listed on this slide.","Now, let's take a closer look at the second quarter results. While reported revenue grew 10%, organic revenue on a constant currency basis increased 5%. In most recent quarters, the Company's revenue has been hit by Forex with little impact to operating profit, primarily due to the weak British pound however, this quarter was different. In the second quarter Forex had a negligible impact on the revenue, yet contributed approximately three percentage points to adjusted operating profit and approximately 100 basis points for the adjusted operating profit margin. Most of this benefit was realized in S&P Global Ratings.","So overall, the company delivered 210 basis points of adjusted operating profit margin improvement as a result of forex, S&P Global Ratings margin improvement, and the progress made on SNL integration synergy targets. Together revenue growth, margin improvement and share repurchases combined led to 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. In the second quarter, every division recorded top line growth and improvement in adjusted operating profit. The two standout performers were S&P Global Ratings and S&P Global Market Intelligence with adjusted operating profit margin gains of 400 basis points and 370 basis points respectively.","Now let me turn to the business and I'll start with S&P Global Ratings. During the quarter revenue increased 4% with a negligible impact from Forex. Adjusted operating profit increased 12% and the adjusted operating margin increased 400 basis points to 54.1%. Improved market conditions after a weak 2016 start resulted in a modest year-over-year issuance increase. For the first time in six quarters, international revenue outperformed domestic. Forex had a favorable impact as 3 percentage points in adjusted operating profit and approximately 150 basis points on the adjusted operating margin, due primarily to the weakness in the British pound. Excluding Forex, adjusted expenses decreased 3 percentage points, mainly due to reduced outside services.","Another highlight of the quarter was the purchase of 49% stake in TRIS Rating. This increased commitment to TRIS and an exciting step forward in our longstanding relationship. By working together more closely, we'll be in a better position to serve our customers and investors in Thailand and other Asian markets.","Non-transaction revenue increased 3% from growth in surveillance, CRISIL, commercial paper activity and royalties from the services. Transaction revenue increased 5% as a result of improved contract terms, increased bank loan rating, and growth in debt issuance in Asia. If we look more closely at the largest markets, second quarter issuance in U.S. was down 11% with investment grade decreasing 6%, high yield down 9%, public finance up 4%, and structured finance declining 37% with drops in every class. In Europe, investment grade is unchanged, high yield is down 5%, while structured finance increased 4% with strength in RMBS and CLL [ph]. And in Asia, investment grade issuance surged 60% and structured finance increased 20% due to ABS and RMBS.","Let's take a further look at issuance. The 3% increase in global issuance break the four quarter streak of year-on-year decline in global issuance that had pressured S&P Global Ratings revenue. During the quarter only Asia reported an increase in issuance with a 55% gain. Excluding domestic Chinese issuance which we don't rate, issuance in Asia still increased 35%. One factor driving this was offshore Chinese issuance. During the quarter investment grade was generally had unlimited access to debt capital markets while spec-grade issuers had very limited access with windows of opportunity that opened for short periods and then were disrupted by external events.","Despite the year-over-year declines in the U.S. and Europe, there were periods of extreme strength during the quarter, in fact May set a monthly record for U.S. investment grade issuance. June started out with a very strong issuance but then came to standstill in the week leading upto the Brexit vote. Last week S&P Global Ratings released its latest global issuance forecast. We now expect global issuance to decline 3.8% in 2016. This compares to the April forecast which anticipated decline of approximately 2%. The biggest difference is only corporate and structured issuance which had been lower due to Brexit and international public issuance which is an increase as first half issuance already exceeds all of 2015.","Now let S&P Global Market Intelligence. In the second quarter revenue increased 29%, primarily due to addition of SNL. Excluding SNL revenue, organic growth was 8%. Adjusted operating profit increased 48%, and the adjusted operating margin advanced 370 basis points to 28.4%. The adjusted segment operating margin includes the benefit from Forex of approximately 100 basis points. Excluding Forex, this figure is comparable to the first quarter adjusted segment operating margin. We had a favorable impact of 5 percentage points on adjusted operating profit, primarily due to weakness in the Indian rupee and British pound.","In 2016, successful integration of SNL is the top priority for the company. We made a substantial investment with the acquisition of SNL, and we recognize that we must achieve our integration synergy targets in order to deliver a return on that investment. We are well on our way to achieving cross-sell synergy targets from 2016. Last quarter we reviewed some of the organizational changes that took place. Today in order to help you get a better sense of our efforts, I'm going to share several examples of integration synergies progressed during the quarter.","We reconfigure our risk services scorecard product for analyzing commercial banks to include SNL bank data. We received great feedback and early sales success from the market. We integrated our equity ownership and earnings estimate data onto the SNL platform. We made tremendous progress on these trading SNL sector-specific fundamental data into our Xpressfeed delivery platform. Now in beta testing, SNL content will be available this fall enabling more seamless cross-selling to our existing feed clients. We completed significant design work on our next generation consolidated product platform to encompass mobile, web and excel delivery. Reduced cost by replacing third-party data with internal solutions, we completed our office consolidations in Denver, New York and Singapore with other cities still in the works. We've been making great progress.","Let me add a bit more color on second quarter revenue growth in S&P Global Market Intelligence which delivered double-digit user growth in both S&P Capital IQ desktop and SNL. In financial data and analytics, S&P Capital IQ desktop and enterprise solutions revenue increased 8% with high single-digit growth in both products. In addition, SNL revenue reported a 9% increase compared to the second quarter 2015. Prior to our acquisition of SNL however, excluding a purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment, revenue grew 10%. With that progress that we continue to make integrating SNL into S&P Global Market Intelligence will become increasingly difficult to separate SNL results from the total. Therefore this is likely the last quarter we'll provide separate revenue figures for SNL.","With services revenue increased 10% led by double-digit Ratings Xpress growth. In the smallest category, research and advisory, revenue decreased 12% due to declines in equity research services.","Now let's turn to S&P Dow Jones Indices; revenue increased 4%, adjusted operating profit increased 4%, and adjusted operating margin improved slightly to 66%. Market volatility has created large swings in AUM from months to months as well as volatility in the number of exchange for a derivative contract traded each month. During the second quarter, revenue increased primarily due to steady data license growth, strength in exchange traded derivative activity due to market volatility, and ETF related revenue is up slightly.","If we turn to three types of revenue; transactional revenue from exchange traded derivatives increased primarily to 24% increase in average daily volume of products based on S&P DJI's Indices. In particularly, E-mini S&P 500 Futures, CBOE Volatility Index, VIX, and CME Equity complex contracts, all increased more than 20%. Asset linked fees revenue, mostly from exchange rated funds was up slightly. The exchange credit product industry recorded further $46 billion in the second quarter with fixed income products receiving the largest inflows. Average AUM associated with our indices increased 3% year-over-year with inflows of 7% offset by asset value declines of 4%.","The quarter ended on a high note recording an ETF, AUM associated with our indices reaching a new record of $855 billion as U.S. equity markets rebounded. This creates a great starting point for the third quarter. Subscription revenue which consists primarily of data subscriptions and customer indices increased due to continued steady growth in data subscription revenues.","During the quarter the Company launched 90 new indices and our partners launched new ETFs based on our indices. We added two in the environment social government space that I'd like to highlight. JPX\/S&P CAPEX & Human Capital Index is designed to measure performance of Japanese companies that are proactively and effectively making investments in physical and human capital based on various metrics including the RobecoSAM Human Capital scores. In the S&P ESG Index Series, designed to measure the performance of companies with a rating scale based on an ESG factor score derived from RobecoSAM's annual corporate sustainability assessments. This launch brings together for the first time smart data and sustainability into a global index family that treats environmental social governance of ESG on a standalone performance factors. With the addition of these two indices we now have 130 ESG indices.","This quarter we celebrated the 120th anniversary of the Dow Jones Industrial Average launched in 1896 by Charles Dow and Edward Jones. On its first day, May 16, 1896, the Dow closed at 40.94. Today the Dow Jones Industrial Average is the iconic symbol of the U.S. stock markets.","Now onto S&P Global Platts which currently includes J.D. Power. Organic revenue increased 4% adjusted for the NADA Used Car Guide, Petromedia, and RigData, acquisitions. Adjusted operating profit increased 7% and adjusted operating margin declined 70 basis points to 38.4%. Platts delivered 7% revenue growth driven by strength in subscriptions in the global trading services. J.D. Power had a decline in organic revenue due to lower consulting revenue in China. With all of the regulatory requirements completed, we continue to expect closing sale of J.D. Power this quarter.","Turning to Platts, global trading services led the growth during the quarter with double-digit revenue gains primarily due to the timing of license fees and strong license revenue from the Singapore and ICE Exchanges. The core subscription business delivered mid-single digit revenue growth led by the Petroleum sector with particular strength in Asia. Metals, Agriculture & Petrochemicals revenue grew at high-single digit, primarily due to the strength in Singapore Exchange-listed PSI iron ore contracts and metal market data subscriptions. While rig counts are up since the beginning of May, many of our customers remained under pressure from low oil prices; therefore we continue to expect growth from moderate slightly in the remainder of 2016 as these customers continue to face difficulty.","Finally, the CME Group that reduced the new Aluminum A380 Alloy, our futures contract that settles against our price assessment, there has been growing need for North American aluminum alloy risk management tool. This contract will provide market participants with an effective solution for hedging aluminum alloy price risk. On the business development front, we have several new items; a June reacquired RigData, a leading provider of daily information on rig activity for the natural gas and oil markets across North America. We've discussed our desire to add our own supply demand data offerings, and this extends our energy analytic capabilities in North America natural gas with oil offerings.","Founded in 1986, RigData provides over 5,500 cost to customers with daily electronic reports on drilling permits, activity and rig locations in United States, Gulf of Mexico and Canada. We launched five domestic oil product assessments in Japan. Platts now assesses prices for important refined oil products for domestic waterborne deliveries in Japan from locations in Tokyo Bay, Chikyo [ph]. These waterborne assessments reflect prices for gasoline gas oil kerosene, low for fuel oil and high fuel oil. These assessments will follow Platts market on closed principal.","And finally we launched the LNG U.S. Gulf Coast marker. The natural gas infrastructure that connects the United States, Mexico and Canada is the world's largest and most integrated natural gas market. By 2020, the Americas are expected to be the world's third largest producer of LNG behind Australia and Qatar. This new price reflects the daily export value as LNG traded free onboard from the U.S. Gulf Coast.","In summary, all segments delivered revenue growth. Bond issuance recovered from a weak start to the year, margin improvement continues to be a key focus. Integration of SNL remains a top priority for the company's meaningful progress to-date. We expect Brexit to have no immediate implication through the Company. And we are increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.05 to a range of $5.05 to $5.20. Our guidance has been updated to now include dilution from the pending sale of J.D. Power.","With that I want to thank you all for joining the call this morning. But before I turn the call over to Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer, I wanted to say a few words about him. As you know, Jack has accepted new position at Yale, not only is he an active Yale Alumni, he grew up at New Haven, Connecticut, so Jack's going home. We're thankful for the time he spent with us after joining the company in November 2010 he is instrumental in engineering the transformation to S&P Global, a faster growing, more focused and profitable company. He also assembled an outstanding organization and we're grateful for all he has done for the company's shareholders. Early next month, Jack will begin his role of Senior Vice President of Operations at Yale. We wish Jack and his family all the best.","Rob Mackay, our current Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller, has been named interim CFO as we continue the search process for Jack's replacement. Thank you, Jack, and now I'll turn the call over to you.","John Callahan","Thanks, Doug, and I appreciate those kind words, and good morning to everyone on the call. This morning, I will recap key financial results. I also want to discuss the impact from adjustments to earnings. Then I'll update you on the balance sheet, free cash flow and return of capital. In wrapping up, I will provide some color on our updated guidance. Let's start with the consolidated second quarter income statement. There are just a couple of items I want to highlight. As you have just heard from Doug, all of our segments delivered top line growth. Collectively, that led to an increase in reported revenue of 10% with organic growth up 5%, the difference is largely due to the SNL acquisition.","Our adjusted operating margin increased 210 basis points, approximately 100 basis points was due to Forex. The balance is primarily due to outstanding profit growth and margin improvement at S&P Global Ratings and S&P Global Market Intelligence, both businesses have delivered margin improvements year-to-date. Interest expense was up over $26 million due to our highly successful bond offerings last year, partially in support of the SNL acquisition. This steps up the level of interest expense, will continue to create a difficult year-over-year comparison until the fourth quarter. Share repurchases over the past year have resulted in more than a 3% decline in average diluted shares outstanding. So overall, sustained top line growth, margin improvement and share account reductions delivered a 17% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share over the most profitable quarter in 2015.","Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. Pre-tax adjustments to earnings totaled to a gain of $22 million in the quarter. The first item is a net gain from insurance recoveries. The second item includes net disposition costs primarily related to the pending sale of J.D. Power to the XIO Group, and our CMA pricing business to ICE. The last item is the restructuring charge in S&P Global Ratings as business continues to focus on sustained productivity. Again, as we discussed last quarter, our adjusted results now exclude deal related amortization of $23 million. All adjustments are detailed on Exhibit 5 of today's earnings release.","Now, let's turn to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately 95% was held outside of the United States. We also had $3.5 billion of long-term debt and $309 million of short-term debt in commercial paper and from a draw down on our credit facility. Since the end of the first quarter, we have reduced short-term debt by $163 million. Going forward, our level of short-term debt will likely fluctuate a bit as we periodically tap into the short-term debt market to fund our share repurchase program and meet other corporate needs.","Our first half free cash flow was $478 million. However, to get a better sense of our underlying cash generation from operations, it is important to exclude the after-tax impact of legal and regulatory settlements and related insurance recoveries. On that basis, first half free cash flow was $513 million and is on-track to reach our 2016 guidance of approximately $1.3 billion.","Now I want to review our return of capital. During the quarter, the company bought approximately 1.4 million shares. These purchases combined with our dividend totaled to approximately $242 million of cash returned to shareholders just in this quarter. Year-to-date, the Company has returned $538 million to shareholders. The volume weighted average price that shares repurchased so far this year is approximately $98. The share repurchases program remains an important component of the Company's overall capital allocation. In addition, we anticipate stepping up share repurchases to help mitigate some of the dilution from the pending sales of J.D. Power subject to market conditions.","Now let me provide some additional perspective on our 2016 guidance. There are three items that have been updated. Our previous guidance included the results of J.D. Power for the full year. We now assume that the sale of J.D. Power will be completed during the third quarter and have removed J.D. Power results for the balance of the year. This will have an impact on revenue, and our guidance moves from mid to high single digits to new guidance of mid-single digit growth. Year-to-date margins has benefited by approximately 100 basis points from Forex. Therefore we have increased our adjusted operating profit margin improvement from approximately 50 basis points to a new guidance of approximately 150 basis points.","Despite the inherent dilution from removing several months of J.D. Power results, we are increasing our 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.05 due to the strong first half results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. The new range is $5.05 to $5.20. We are keeping a wide range as there remains considerable macroeconomic uncertainty that could impact the markets and our customers.","So in summary, the second quarter was a strong quarter for the company. Each of our segments is performing well, and we are well positioned to continue to provide the essential benchmarks in data and analytics that our customers require.","As Doug mentioned earlier, today is my last earnings conference call. It has been a pleasure and an honor to be the Chief Financial Officer of initially the McGraw Hill Company, the McGraw Hill Financial, and now S&P Global. I want to thank our shareholders and the analyst community for your interest and support as we have transformed the company. And finally, I want to thank you over 20,000 S&P Global associates for your hard work and commitment in building a stronger organization for the future. I wish you all well and I remain optimistic on the continued success of S&P Global going forward.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions.","Robert Merritt","Thanks, Jack, just a couple of instructions for our phone participants. I would kindly ask that you limit yourself to two questions; that's two questions each, in order to allow time for other callers during today's Q&A session. Operator, we'll now take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. This question comes from Ashish Rao, Credit Suisse. You may now ask your question.","Ashish Rao","Good morning. I guess first question just on market intelligence. Can you please give us an update on the selling environment, I was particularly curious on how efforts to broaden SNL's geographic presence into Europe? And also how pricing consolidation are going so far as you integrate SNL and Capital IQ?","Doug Peterson","Thank you and welcome. Welcome to the call, I think this is your first time on our call. And so first of all, the market intelligence business is advancing quite well as you heard from some of the statistics that I provided and some of the examples. Related specifically to your question about selling environment, I'll just be clear that we continue to progress faster on cost synergies than we do on sale synergies. But we are finding some early wins -- we're finding more wins in Asia right now that we are necessarily in Europe. I mean this is where we're able to either sell SNL products into Asia customers who are using the former Cap IQ salesforce. Or we're funding opportunities where we've integrated the services together between Cap IQ and SNL and also delivering them into Asia.","The selling environment is mixed as you know, there still are a lot of financial institutions that is one large part of our customer interface that are reducing headcount, they are reducing some of their -- specifically, trading and front office people. On the other hand on the back office and areas like compliance, controlled risk management, and also some more traditional consumer banking and commercial banking activities, there continue to be increase in headcount. So the environment is mixed with some consolidation and shrinking happening, and on the other hand increase in demand for risk management, for other sorts of tool. So we're seeing a mixed market but we are continuing to have a very, very strong sales effort. Our sales team has integrated excellent in a big way that's very well integrated, and they've got a new commercial approach like reaching out to clients in a much more consolidated organized way, and we're starting to see a top line growth coming out of the synergies as well.","Ashish Rao","Great. And maybe a question for Jack, on the pending sale of the pricing business; so I'm curious if you could give us the EPS contribution this quarter and also any sense of the timeline for the sale?","John Callahan","In terms of its contribution, it's a couple of pennies per quarter. We're still waiting on the final approvals to close that transaction. Our current assumption is that we've looked for a close towards the end of the year. Our current estimate assumes -- sometime in the fourth quarter, and so we believe the net dilution impact within 2016 is going to be quite minimum.","Ashish Rao","Okay, thank you. These were my questions. And Jack, I wish you well.","John Callahan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm, UBS. Your line is open.","Alex Kramm","Good morning, everyone. First of all, let me echo what Doug said, thanks for all the help Jack over the years and obviously all the best for the new endeavors. With that, maybe on the ratings business, I'm not sure how easy this is to enter but as you know, your primary competitor is already reported a few days ago and what certainly stood out as your much awaited growth year-over-year, and particularly on the transactional side. So from what you can tell would be helpful as you could maybe decide for where you might be winning; what businesses you might have done a little bit better or what the mix contributed to that for the outperformance?","Doug Peterson","This is Doug, thanks for the comments. And to start off with -- as you know, we've been engaging in a commercial approach to running our business with hiring of Krik Hoise [ph] for the last year to lead our commercial activities. We've approached our clients in a way that gives us a broad relationship oriented approach where we're looking at ways to broaden our coverage, including products like loans, ratings, RES etcetera. So we're looking across that as well as looking at our contract terms. One of the areas where we also had very strong in this quarter was in Asia. Just to give you a color on the issuance in Asia, it was up in across the board in every category. In fact, total issuance in Asia this quarter was greater than total issuance in United States if you include sovereign issuers; sovereign issuers are not necessarily an area that there is a lot of profitability on but even so the total issuance in Asia for the first time outgrew the total issuance in the U.S.","In the U.S. as you know, the issuance was down overall, in corporate 7%, financial institutions is down, while in Asia the corporates who have 32% and financial institutions were up 84%. So it was a combination of our sales approach, our relationship management approach, more penetration and looking at how we're working on contracts and then very importantly, the volume in Asia.","Alex Kramm","Great. And then maybe just for Jack on the GMI margin; and hopefully my numbers are correct here but it looks like the margin actually came down a little bit quarter-over-quarter. I think last quarter you had said expect kind of like a flattish for the remainder of the year. I noticed it can be bouncing around but just given that you've taken cost out and I think folks are hoping for that margin to actually go higher. Just maybe some commentary of what do you expect for the remainder of the year and whether maybe it was down a little bit quarter-over-quarter despite the benefit? Thanks.","John Callahan","I'll only give a little bit more detail as Doug added some comments on it earlier. The primary difference between the first and second quarter is the Forex benefit, there was just relatively more Forex benefit in Q1 than it was in Q2. So there was about two points benefit in Q1 and less than one in this quarter. So once you equalize for that you're pretty much in that same range around 28%. And we're quite pleased with that step versus the year ago and reducing this is an opportunity we can continue to get some steady improvement overtime.","Alex Kramm","Very good, thanks.","John Callahan","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Your line is open.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen, and firstly, congratulations Jack as well as thank you for your help. My first question on the Ratings business, if you could just elaborate on -- I guess you had in your press release and you just mentioned in terms of the commentary around improved contract terms. Can you just help understand if there is -- some of those pricing initiatives you guys have talked about or we've been talking about the last year or so or what basically are you referring with that language?","Doug Peterson","That language refers to the types of engagements that we have with our customers. We have many, many different pricing approaches across the globe where one of the biggest things you're going to hear from us, from our ratings business over and over this term simplify, we have projects to simplify our workflow, we've been investing in technology simplifier workflow that also brings with a combination of better control, better process management; and then also in many cases lower expenses. So on that side we're having a lot of focus and on the top line we're also looking at ways to simplify our pricing model to revisit our contracts that we've had with customers for very long time that provided relationship pricing that we want to recalibrate to markets so there is much larger issuance. So it's a combination of factors but the top line growth, some of that has been driven by approach to how we look at our pricing and even though we're simplifying it, it has had some benefits and also going up.","Manav Patnaik","Got it. And then just -- bigger picture, obviously a lot of things are going good for the Company and you've done a lot of tuck-ins here; just thinking about the appetite for M&A going forward, obviously there seemed to be some assets up for sale in the sea side of things in fixed income. So just curious on how we could think about your plans in that area?","Doug Peterson","I guess what I'd say -- first of all, our number one and number two priorities are; number one is to continue with the integration of SNL, that is something that's critical for us; as you know, we've made a very large investment in that. And even though we've had -- we're off to a great start it doesn't mean we're going to take our eye off the ball on that one. And number two is to smoothly complete the exit of J.D. Power which has been going well but we want to make sure that we complete in a way that's very organized and executed well everything we started. Putting those two aside though, you mentioned tuck-ins there, we continue to look at opportunities, we're not going to shut things out but if we believe that there would be opportunities that might have incremental value to our Company by adding capabilities or products or sales or operations or geographies that might enhance our ability to create value, we might look at those but we're always going to look at those in combination with what the financial returns are and how that looks for the long run. And then also do we have the capacity and management skills and capabilities to absorb and take over those businesses. So we have our eyes open, and you know our normal philosophy about our capital waterfall, and so we do look at things but nothing to report on.","Manav Patnaik","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Next question comes from Toni Kaplan, Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Toni Kaplan","Good morning. You mentioned that SNL grew about 10% in the quarter while I think last year it might have been closer to about 13%. So anything to call out there and are you still looking for low to mid-teens for that business, longer term?","Doug Peterson","Let me start and see if Jack has anything to add. We're still looking for long term, we have looked at this business, it's a very attractive growth machine for us. We expect that over the long run it's going to be growing in low double-digit range, it's something we're looking for. This last quarter there were combination of factors that potentially growth came down a little bit, again, it has to do with the overall financial institutions market with some of the downsizing that firms had done inside of the organization. And we're looking continue to see how we can drive that growth and the main factor over the last quarter just related to the slowdown in some of the headcount and financial institutions.","Toni Kaplan","Okay, great. And then in Platts, it looked like revenue grew nicely but margins declined a little bit year-over-year. Is that just a result of mix or what caused that and can you assure money of any initiatives you might have going on in terms of Platts margin extension?","Doug Peterson","I think the impact on the margins in the quarter was largely driven by more J.D. Power than Platts, it's from some expense timing at J.D. Power. So that was actually a bigger driver than anything really at Platts. And in couple of quarters J.D. Power will be out in numbers and it will be -- we'll have a clear view of the quarter-to-quarter performance in Platts.","Toni Kaplan","Got it, thanks a lot. Good luck, Jack.","John Callahan","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Huber of Huber Research Partners. You may ask your question.","Craig Huber","Good morning. Congratulations as well Jack, and thanks for all your help. Let's talk margins if we could on the market intelligence area here. With margins in the very high 20s right now including SNL, when you guys think out long-term here -- I mean do you think it's possible to get these margins inside the high 30s including SNL, long-term, since the market holds together?","Doug Peterson","Craig, I think from a longer term point of view, from the benchmarking we've done relative to other similar companies, I think I'll be reluctant to put out a target of high 30s. I do think though with growth, with scale, with realization of incremental synergies that has been identified for 2017 and 2018, we do see a path to margin extension but I think from a longer term point of view, we'd more in sort of a mid-30's range versus a high 30s.","Craig Huber","Okay. And then also on the Ratings business -- you did a great job on Platts again in the first half, down to 5% or so. Despite FX, what's driving that -- in-house sustainable or cost efforts you guys are doing?","Doug Peterson","Yes, there is a couple of things driving it in addition to FX. One of them is, if you recall about year and a half ago, we had undertaken a couple of programs to rebalance our sales force, as well as rebalance our analytical force globally. We also had some programs where we slowed down some hiring, so some of that's just coming through from straight headcount and straight changes to the way that we are managing the business, so those continue to go through. But one of the major areas, if you recall last year in the first half of the year we had the final resolution of some of the disputes and losses we had the U.S. government in 20 states, as well as some private litigation. There had been some residual expenses related to that and then we also have been engaged in the full blown implementation of the Dodd-Frank rules which kicked-in in June 2015. And in order to implement that we had engaged some outside help from some consultant firms and risk management experts, etcetera.","So those are the legal fees related to -- those have tapered off in the second quarter, and then some of those external consulting fees and other advisory fees, those are gone. And so we think that we're approaching a more sustainable level of expenses going forward, although I would point out that with some of our programs we do continue to invest in technology, that's critical for us. And as we simplify the business, we will be investing technology; and here and there we are going to invest in talented people so -- but we do think that some of those extraordinary expenses such as clinge [ph] now clear through.","Craig Huber","All right, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Appert, Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question.","Peter Appert","So keeping on margins in the Platts business for a second, they had tremendous progress here in the last years. So I'm wondering if you're comments Doug are meant to imply that figure, thinking that margins have approached the appropriate level or whether you think there is more upside from here?","Doug Peterson","The way I think about it is -- there is necessarily an appropriate level. We have a commitment as well as an operating philosophy across the entire company that we're going to always look for continuous improvement and continuous upside. One of the biggest determinants of our margins are going to also be top line growth. That's one of the reasons that we also have a big focus across the entire company and also in ratings on commercial activities which are the things I'd mentioned before on needs they're selling relationship approach to selling deeper penetration, broadening customer product coverage, looking at contracts pricing etcetera. So it is a combination of how well we do on growing the top line that is going to have an impact on it. And if we can have some of that incremental sales drop to the bottom line, taking advantage of our scale. I guess long answer to the question but we continue to be committed to driving growth in our margin through continuous improvement, both from top line activities, as well as finding ways to continue being more efficient on our cost basis.","John Callahan","I just want to add one thing, that if you think about the second quarter, if you look at last three years or so, the second quarter has been our highest margin quarter for the rating business because of the larger levels of issuance during the quarter. So -- it can't predict the future but we would not expect necessarily to have those kind of margins each quarter in the third and fourth quarter.","Peter Appert","Understood. And then when you talked earlier Doug, about simplified pricing in the Ratings business, does that suggest more transaction based versus relationship pricing? And therefore higher price utilizations because of that specifically?","Doug Peterson","What it implies is that we had some of contract have been basically become stale or become quite old and we needed to go back and just look at the level of compensation we had been receiving for the type of activities that we were providing and the benefits we're providing for the issuance. I'd also say that another aspect has to do with how do we look at these long-term relationship contracts in the context of the size of issuance that had been undertaken originally when these contracts were put out versus what kind of issuance we see today. So there have been opportunities, this is something that we're going to continue to look at but it's based off of generally speaking, better coverage and better relationship management, those go hand-in-hand.","Peter Appert","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim McHugh of William Blair. You may now ask your question.","Unidentified Analyst","It's Steven Shulman [ph] for Tim, I appreciate you take my questions. First, I wanted to ask what you're seeing on the CMBS side. Now that you're back in the market, I think you talked last quarter about seeing the strong pipeline of deal, so I was wondering if some of those came through in the quarter and then how the pipeline is looking out, just any detail there.","Doug Peterson","The CMBS pipeline has actually been quite weak. The CMBS issuance is down over 60% in the second quarter. There were 10 transactions that were completed, we were on one of them and we continued to crawl our way back into that market. The pipeline now -- right now is actually quite weak, it's a trend that started off in the first quarter, I mean the first and second quarters continued in CMBS. So we do -- we have hired and great team, we tooled our approach to the business over the last couple of years, and it's our hope that we get included on more and more deals on the CMBS market overtime. We do continue to rate many of the single borrower transactions but those also have been quite weak during the quarter.","Unidentified Analyst","That's helpful. And then second, could you talk about the slowdown in Platts growth in the quarter, the growth rate is still solid overall given your pressure in that market but it sounds like core revenue growth decelerated in a little bit. Was there anything specific that led to that slowdown?","Doug Peterson","I pointed two things. One, compared to Q1 -- Q1 was normally terrific growth quarter for our global trading services. It was up quite considerably in the first quarter, we still had very nice growth in that area, it's only 10% in the mix. But we saw very nice growth in the second quarter but it just wasn't quite stacked [ph] as what we saw in Q1. So it wasn't as accretive as we saw previously. It's still a challenging market out there in terms of the profit -- the profit pressure is not enough on the commodity space. We're still going growth but it may be constant to point or two.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","William Warmington","Good morning, everyone and congratulations to Jack on the new position.","John Callahan","William Warmington","First question for you to go back to the incremental margins on the Ratings business, with revenue up 24% and the adjusted operating is at 39%. It looks like -- I mean to assume a 100% incremental margin would be about $15 million coming from a cost cut, is that a fair way of looking at that? And Doug, what I want to go on the question is how should we think about the incremental margins on that business going forward and your minimum revenue growth on organic basis to achieve that kind of incremental margin?","John Callahan","I think that -- I mean, I assume the way you're asking the question is you're looking at more on a sequential basis from first to second quarter?","William Warmington","Yes.","John Callahan","I think some of the expense difference between the first and the second, and that general range that you mentioned had to do with the drop off -- what Doug mentioned in terms of some of the outside professional fees that we were paying either to lawyers or more significantly some of the work goes underway and risk the compliance area to ensure that compliance from the Dodd-Frank requirements which we had to do last year. So that money has been spent, we do have that risk and compliance investment now in run rate, so that benefit is from the expenses quarter-to-quarter. On a go forward basis, it's not like we expect minimal revenue, I mean we have to kind of -- to Doug's point, we're trying to be more commercially oriented going forward, we are going to be influenced by what's going on with the issuance trends. I mean I just would say that our forward outlook is not assuming robust activity that we saw clearly here in the second quarter.","Doug Peterson","Let me just give you a little bit about -- nobody's asked this question yet but since I'm prepared for it, I'll say a couple of factors that are beyond assets related to the overall issuance markets going forward, as you know from what we just gave you, we do see that there is going to be a reduction in the overall issuance for 2016 but if you look forward further, I mean you look at the 2016 -- looking out for to 2020 or so, there are two factors we're looking at. One of them is total debt markets, including bank loans which we don't necessarily rate. The market is large with independent growth by trillions of dollars, in fact it could stand over the next five years to $73 trillion market including a large increase in China. We do think that there is an increase in the combination of refinancing as well as new financing going into that. We are targeting through all of our business in market intelligence, couple of businesses there and then also in rating; more and more penetration of loan markets and through models and things like that. So we look at the size of the markets and how they're growing longer term and just the next quarter.","Over the rest of the year though we do think that there is large amount of debt maturing between now and 2021, the issuance -- the maturations over the rest of the year are actually not that strong, that's why we see the full year down about 3.8%. We're concerned about the Brexit, what kind of impact that might have on issuance. U.S. interest rates and global interest rate outlooks have been quite volatile and they're changing all the time. So in the short run we usually expect possible volatility as you've seen, as you track this business; quarterly issuance can go up and down but with a very long run five year view we see some very large numbers, $73 trillion overall corporate debt market which includes bank loans. And then through 2021, $10.3 trillion in debt maturity, that's actually publicly issued debt. So we do see that there is a lot of activity, we're trying to build our business around this and trying to expand it beyond just being a single leading approach to the market, looking at bank loan rating, RES, different types of loan evaluation services, etcetera. So this is a big area for us to focus our strategy going forward.","William Warmington","If I could on Platts, just wanted to ask what has happened on the client side for us to anniversary the slower growth and see the return to the double-digit growth. Not that I'm complaining about 7% organic in that market, I think that's very strong but just traditionally it's been more into double-digit side. And yet in terms of the timing and whether it's operating expense on the client side or capital expense or rig count or what you think would be the leading indicator of that for us?","Doug Peterson","I think the leading indicators could be higher oil prices. It's probably -- I'm giving you an unscientific answer but if I were going to look at what are -- what's one of the most important correlations to overall volume as well as activity, it has to do with the price of oil. As you know, as we dropped into a very low oil price certainly this year even though it's recovered somewhat, there were lot of -- people at the industry -- you had a large increase in the falls from bankruptcies in the U.S. in particularly, in different types of oil businesses. So probably getting a higher price of oil would be the largest factor that could bump up growth to the double-digit range if that was still possible. We have still been growing quite steadily in the mid-single, mid to high single digit range despite this because it's still such a demand of information and for our prices embedded in different kinds of contracts but double-digit range would require more than just -- would require lot of work for us but in particular for the price of oil to be a lot higher.","John Callahan","Bill, I'd add to that. Just keep in mind, we're trying to grow off an ever increasing day, so double-digits of $700 million will be different in double-digits of $0.5 billion. So reality is the business is working hard to extend its product line so we have been investing to expand out the product line beyond the oil, on that note in terms of the business. And we're also looking to do more than just price assessment than we're investing to do more in the area of supply demand analytics. So I think we also -- in the longer term point of view need to kind of build out the product line and increase our offering.","William Warmington","Excellent. Thank you for the insight and Jack, it's been a great run.","John Callahan","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andre Benjamin of Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Doug Peterson","Andre? Operator, I guess he is not there.","Operator","Next question comes from Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your question.","Joseph Foresi","I was wondering, I think you talked in your remarks about keeping the range wide on the guidance side just to take into account some potential volatility on the macro front. I was wondering, could you just have -- give us some idea of what would put you at the top end of guidance versus the low end at this point?","Doug Peterson","It's just sort of -- primary driver would be first this level of overall debt issuance because that's probably the first and the second most important driver. There could be a little bit of impact from what goes on with fund flow relative to U.S. equity markets that could impact our indices business. But now we have pretty good revenue visibility outside of debt issuance because so much of our business today is recurring revenue subscription base.","John Callahan","The only thing I'd add to that is, as you know in our indices business we do have certain, as you know we've changed the way we characterize our revenue. If AUMs continue on a very steady increase that would also be a benefit that revenue tends to drop almost all straight to the bottom line, so that could be another factor that would put us up towards the higher end of the range. And that's as per the funds flow and overall end market level.","Joseph Foresi","Got it. Okay, and then the Ratings business seems to be a little bit tricky in the sense that you had a very good quarter this quarter but then of course Platts is out there and then you have your annual outlook and then you have the outlook with obviously the debt levels rising there. How do you handle the staffing where the challenges in that business? Do you prepare for a pick up? Do you change staffing levels at all? I'm just wondering how the resourcing of that business is handled with so many different variables that's out there?","Doug Peterson","We have a resource model that takes everything you just mentioned in terms of our forecasting. We are able to manage the staffing level through attrition if we needed to and we're also able to manage it through our bonus pool, our bonus accruals, if that was something we needed to look at to ensure that we're accruing according to the kind of level of staffing we have, as well as level of activity. So those are two of the most important levers. But we've built a way that we've got some flexibility as well by having analysts that are spread around the globe, they're not all concentrated in London and New York. Despite the Brexit being a concern for us, we do have significant staffing and other European cities including Frankfurt and Paris and Madrid. We also get support from our partner CRISIL in India, they are part of the overall flows, some of the aspect to work for process of crunching numbers etcetera. So we have various variables we use to manage that and that's part of what John Burris Curtis [ph] is doing great job at.","Joseph Foresi","Thanks. Good luck, Jack.","John Callahan","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Hung, Autonomous. Your line is now open.","Vincent Hung","On the improvement in contract service, have you take all the low hanging fruits, whether some left from the second quarter?","Doug Peterson","This is an interim process that could take a while. There was no low hanging fruit. This is something that's not -- it's very important for us to proceed from a relationship point of view and we hope that there is continues steady penetration of more products, more services to our customers as I mentioned. There is now league table for loan ratings and this is another area that we're trying to do more and more of it. We think also around the globe as most markets are more bank markets as oppose to loan markets. We're trying to penetrate with more services in that area as well. So this is something that we hope we can see continuous improvement in growth on the top line from many, many different factors, it's not just the contract terms.","Vincent Hung","And do you get much push back from customers on this?","Doug Peterson","We have good relationships with our customers and as you can imagine anytime when you want to renegotiate contract terms, it's never, it's not always easy.","Vincent Hung","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our last question from Warren Gardiner of Evercore ISI. You may state your question.","Warren Gardiner","I just wanted to -- I was wondering if you guys could just give us a quick update on the fixed income index business? And then also sort of as you look out there, how you're thinking about growing that as you move forward? Thanks.","Doug Peterson","Yes, that's an area that we've been spending a lot of time on, structurally, as well as strategically. The industry itself is going through a massive amount of change with Barclays having changed hands with I7 bought IDC, with what's happening in Europe with the exchange transaction going on there and the interest of fixed income investments from the world. As well as all of the main asset managers, large globe assets managers looking at so much change in volatility in the shape of the fixed markets, especially with pricing and liquidity concerns creeping in. We think it's an area that it will continue to develop, we think there will be more and more ETF products and target day products, we retirement products, etcetera that are developed over the years. We would like to play in that.","We're off to a good start with our dialogue with the asset managers and with ultimate distributors about these types of products and services. We have a core set of indices around the S&P 500, as well as some other fixed income indices. We have $40 billion right now in AUM in the fixed income index space. We are looking at all different ways to grow the business, whether it would be continuing to grow and penetrate with what we already have and what we're developing, as well as looking at the different properties that pop up for sale and whether or not they could be valuable to be added to our portfolio at the price is attractive, as well as if the capabilities are being attractive. So it continues to be an important potential growth area for us. And we do have dedicated resources to seeing how we can grow in this area.","Warren Gardiner","Great, thanks a lot.","Okay, thank you very much everyone. With that let me conclude the call. I'm pleased that we had another strong quarter. The financial performance is excellent, ending up with an EPS growth of 17% and year-to-date cash flow of $530 million, etcetera is all something that we're very pleased that we've been able to achieve. But let me end the call again by thanking Jack Callahan. He has been a great partner and he is heading off to Yale University and they are going to get the benefit of his experience and expertise. So thank you, Jack. We wish you all the best. Thanks everyone.","Operator","That concludes this morning's call.

[Operator Instructions].","I would now like to introduce Mr. Chip Merritt, Vice President of Investor Relations for S&P Global. Sir, you may begin.","Chip Merritt","Good morning and thank you for joining us on S&P Global\u2019s Earnings Call. Presenting on this morning\u2019s call are Doug Peterson, President and CEO; and Ewout Steenbergen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","This morning, we issued a news release with our first quarter 2017 results. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at investor.spglobal.com.","In today\u2019s earnings release and during the conference call, we\u2019ll provide an adjusted financial information.

And we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Jason Feuchtwanger at 212-438-1247.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?","Douglas Peterson","Good morning. Thank you, Chip. Welcome everyone to the call. With a surge of bond issuance healthy stock markets recovering commodity markets and improving global GDP, we\u2019re off to a great start in 2017.","Let me begin with the first quarter highlights. We attained strong organic revenue growth in every segment. Ratings results were truly outstanding and with a highlight of the first quarter. We continue to improve margins and delivered 630 basis points of margin improvement and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 35%.","We generated $306 million of free cash flow, it was typically our weakest cash quarter due to payment of annual incentives. We returned $307 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and we increased our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a range of $6 to $6.20.","Looking more closely at the financial results, the company reported 8% revenue growth and on an organic basis grew 18%. We frequently talk about the pull-through of revenue to adjusted operating profit being quite high. It\u2019s rather striking this quarter that the adjusted operating profit exceeded revenue growth. This can be primarily attributed to the markets in commodity segment, where divestitures drove, revenue declined to $68 million, we had adjusted operating profit only declined $7 million.","The company achieved a 630 basis point improvement in adjusted operating profit margin due to the sale of lower margin businesses, strong organic revenue growth, and productivity initiatives. ForEx had an $8 million unfavorable impact on revenue, with a $6 million in favorable impact on adjusted operating profit. Ratings realized the majority of the impact.","The progress we\u2019re making to build a cohesive set of high-value assets is paying off. We were able to turn 18% organic revenue growth into 35% adjusted EPS growth through a combination of productivity improvements, share repurchases, and the inherent scalable nature of our businesses. In a moment, Ewout is going to discuss the results of each of our businesses in more detail.","What I\u2019d like to do is provide a bit more color on some of the current and future drivers of our businesses. And let me start with credit conditions. While GDP is the fundamental long-term driver of issuance, spreads can influence timing. This is clearly evident in the first quarter. High-yield spreads contracted 400 basis points over the past year, making attractive entry point for issuers. And during this same timeframe, investment credit spreads contracted 74 basis points.","We saw a strong bank loan actively in the first quarter, partially as a result of the rate and spread environment. Bank loan rating revenues become an important part of our rating business over the past few years. This chart depicts the growth. First quarter 2017 bank loan rating revenue was particularly strong, increasing over 140% versus the first quarter of 2016.","Bank loan ratings are primarily issued on leverage loans typically rated BB+ or lower. But the volume of leverage loans and the percent of leverage loans rated by S&P have increased over the past few years. Leverage loan growth has been supported by strong investor demand with record inflows into retail loan funds and recovery in issuance of CLO since the financial crisis.","In the first quarter, leverage loan volumes were very strong driven by tight spreads driving borrowers to refinance their outstanding loans. We estimate that 40%, 47% of the global volume in the first quarter was for refinancing. In addition, the percentage of leverage loans rated by S&P surpassed 93% in the U.S. and 78% in Europe. While many of you track issuance, we always try to point out where issuance takes place? Which type of issuance and the size of issuance of deals make a big difference in the revenue we realize? This was abundantly clear in the first quarter.","Global issuance in the first quarter, excluding sovereign debt increased 4%, yet high-yield debt increased by over $1 billion, or a 172% because very few high-yield issuers are part of our frequent issuer programs. This provided a tremendous amount of incremental revenue to the ratings business. Geographically, issuance in the U.S. increased 23%, with investment grade increasing 15%, high-yield soaring 115%, public finance decreasing a 11%, and structured finance increasing 57%, due primarily to strengthen CLOs, ABS and RMBS.","In Europe, issuance increased 3%, with investment grade declining 1%, high-yield rocketing 181%, and structured finance decreasing 21%, with weakness in covered bonds and RMBS. In Asia, issuance decreased 18%. However, the vast majority of Asian issuance is made up of local China debt that we don\u2019t rate.","Ratings published its latest issuance forecast. For 2017, we expect an overall decrease in global issuance of 1%. This compares to the forecast of the 3% increase that we issued about three months ago. The most significant changes in international public finance, which had been forecasted increased 5% and is now forecasting to decrease 40%. It now appears the 2016 issuance in international public finance was an aberration and that issuance will revert to historical norms.","Importantly, this is not a category that generates much revenue for ratings business. When you look at the chart, you can see that the categories that are most impactful to our revenue, namely non-financial services, structured news public finance are collectively forecast to increase in 2017.","Turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices, in February, we celebrated the 60th anniversary of the S&P 500. We often talk about the importance of benchmarks and the time it takes to build one. None is more iconic than the S&P 500, but originally known as the Standard 500 is introduced at a luncheon for the press on February 27, 1957 at the Lawyers Club in New York, with a turnout of 35 top financial writers.","The initial 500 included 425 industrials, 25 railroads, and 50 utilities that were deemed most representative of the overall market. These 500 stocks accounted for 90% of the total U.S. market value. The 500 is groundbreaking not only for its breath, but also because it could be calculated and distributed on an hourly basis. Today, the S&P 500 is the world\u2019s most followed stock market index being calculated continuously.","S&P Dow Jones Indices continue to build its business and several examples are listed in the slide. I\u2019m only going to touch on the first item. S&P Green Bond Select Index was created for market participants seeking to monitor developments in the critical areas of green finance. This pioneering index maintain stringent standards in order to include only those bonds whose proceeds are used to finance environmentally friendly projects.","Platts is also actively expanding its business opportunities and two examples are listed here. We believe the U.S. Gulf Coast is poised to become a key anchor for liquefied natural gas prices. And our customers required that the new flexible supply from the U.S. is underpinned by both price transparency and the means to hedge.","In response to the growing U.S. LNG exports, ICE will launch LNG derivative contract. These will be cash settled against the Platts LNG Gulf Coast market price assessment and these Platts-derived forward curves for daily settlement. The first OTC swap contract for Black Sea Wheat traded with the Black \u2013 Platts Black Sea Wheat price assessment as the settlement price.","This transaction is a significant step towards the emergence of a new regional futures market for Black Sea Wheat. The Black Sea region is a major global wheat trading hub. But in spite of its size, this major trading hub has not had dedicated derivatives market, reflecting its own supply and demand dynamics.","Turning to Market Intelligence. [I had the] [ph] instruction to provide a breakdown of the business by customer type. With investor concerns about the impact of the continued movement of assets from active to passive could have on market intelligence revenue, you can see that investment management makes up only about 25% of our customers annualized contract value. In addition, our move to more enterprise-wide contracts should result in less customer volatility.","As we look to the remainder of 2017, geopolitical risk in Central Bank actions may create volatility in the second-half. There are number of positive trends that we have identified, including expectations for slightly stronger GDP growth in the U.S., European GDP looking promising, ECB continues to have a quantitative easing program, strong global equity market so far in 2017, and a steady shift from active to passive investing.","There is cause for caution, however, with a number of risks, including potential for U.S. fed reserves to initiate more frequent interest rate increases and begin on winding its balance sheet from a Brexit negotiation and upcoming elections in Europe and continued devaluation of most currencies against the U.S. dollar.","Finally, I want to share with you some significant changes, plans for a Board of Directors. Sir Win Bischoff and Hilda Ochoa-Brillembourg two longstanding Directors will provide a wise count full oversight over many years of retiring. In the meantime, four new Directors have been added in the past six months who bring a wealth of business acumen and experience to our Board.","With that, let me turn the call over to Ewout.","Ewout Steenbergen","Thank you, Doug, and good morning to everyone on the call. This morning, I would like to discuss the first quarter results and then provide updated guidance for 2017. Doug already discussed the changes in revenue, organic revenue and adjusted operating margin for the company. I would like to point out that the tax rate of 30.3% is below the anticipated full-year run rate of 31%, due primarily to the discrete tax benefit from stock option exercises through March.","In addition, our ongoing share repurchase program led to a $6.4 million decrease, or 2% in average diluted shares outstanding. I would like to echo Doug\u2019s comments that with a 35% increase in adjusted diluted EPS were off to a great start to 2017.","Net of hedges, foreign exchange rates had a modest negative impact on the company\u2019s revenue and adjusted operating profits in the first quarter. The bulk of the impact was in the Rating segment, with a $6 million unfavorable impact on revenue and an $8 million unfavorable impact on adjusted operating profits, due to weakness year-over-year in the British pound and euro.","Now, let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. Pre-tax adjustments to earnings totaled to a loss of $41 million in the quarter and included $15 million of acquisition and divestiture-related adjustments, a $2 million expense associated with an increase in financial crisis, legal reserves, and $24 million in deal-related amortization.","In the first quarter, every business segment contributed the gains in organic revenue, but the gains in ratings were particularly note worthy. Reported revenue declined in Market and Commodities Intelligence was due to several divestitures. The adjusted operating profit growth varied by segments was 50% at ratings and 14% at S&P Dow Jones Indices.","Once again, the impact from divestitures affected results with Market and Commodities Intelligence, adjusted operating profit declining 3% due to the sale of several businesses. Organic growth and synergies were able to make up much of this loss. Both Ratings and Market and Commodities Intelligence delivered remarkable adjusted operating margin improvement.","Let me now turn to the individual segments performance. As Doug discussed earlier, tight spreads drove high-yield issuance and bank loan volume. And this resulted in a surge in high-yield and bank loan ratings and propel results for the Rating segments.","Revenue increased 29%, including a 1% unfavorable impact from FoRex, 79% of the incremental revenue flowed through adjusted operating profits, highlighting the scalable nature of the ratings business. Adjusted operating margin increased substantially with 53.1%, due to strong revenue growth, largely offset by increased headcount and incentive compensation.","Very strong transaction revenue fueled ratings first quarter revenue growth. Loan transaction revenue increased 4% from growth in surveillance fees, entity fees, intersegment royalties from Market Intelligence and CRISIL. Transaction revenue increased 65%, primarily from a substantial increase in high-yield bonds and bank loan ratings, as well as improved contract terms.","If you look at ratings revenue by its various markets, you can see that while all of these categories reported growth, the growth in corporates was exceptional. And this is the category, where the high-yield bonds and bank loans are reported.","Let me now turn to Market and Commodities Intelligence. This segment includes S&P Global Market Intelligence and S&P Global Platts. In the first quarter, reported revenue declined 10% due to recent divestitures. Excluding these divestitures, organic revenue increased 7%. Adjusted operating profit was down due to the divestiture of several businesses. Despite these divestitures, adjusted operating profit only decreased by $7 million, as organic growth and synergies were able to make up much of this loss. Adjusted operating margin improved 270 basis points, primarily due to the sale of lower margin businesses, strong organic revenue growth, and SNL integration synergies.","Let me add a bit more color on the first quarter. Recent divestitures masked solid organic growth of 9%. This was due in part to a 9% increase in the number of SNL, S&P Capital IQ, and ratings direct desktop users. One of the important milestones in the quarter was the launch of a unified S&P Capital IQ and SNL commercial organization. This is a critical step in harmonizing our product offering into cohesive enterprise commercial agreements and ultimately one product platform.","During the quarter, we also expanded our content quality reward program to include most of the Capital IQ content. Some of you may be familiar with this program, as it awards $50 to those who finds an error in our data. And the final highlight of the quarter was the beginning of a strategic relationship with Kensho Technologies. If you are not familiar with Kensho, you should check them out. Kensho provides next-generation analytics, machine learning, and data visualization systems to Wall Street\u2019s premier global banks and investment institutions. We have agreed to a long-term commercial relationship, which will do so in product and data collaboration.","We have introduced a new disclosure here depicting market intelligence revenue by three components. Risk services delivered the strongest growth in market intelligence.Thanks to mid-teens growth of ratings express and high single-digit growth of ratings direct. Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 7%, as demand for data feeds continued to be robust.","And finally, our Desktop products grew 8%, as the growth of the former SNL and S&P Capital IQ Desktop products continues to roll out as a one commercial offering. Finally note, data was $38 million of revenue in the first quarter of 2016 from businesses that were divested.","Platts delivered reasonable organic revenue growth, as commodity markets recover. The OPEC production cuts have been very successful in increasing oil prices. Tensions remain as higher prices have increased new shale investments. According to RigData, North American rig counts have doubled since the low in May of 2016.","First quarter revenue increased 10%. However, excluding revenue from recent acquisitions, organic revenue increased 4% due to modest growth in both subscriptions and global trading services. The core subscription business delivered mid single-digit revenue growth, with similar gains across all commodity groups. Global trading services low single-digit revenue increase was primarily due to the timing of revenue and strong trading volumes in petroleum, partially offset by weakness in metals.","Of particular importance during the quarter was the announced inclusion of Norway\u2019s Troll as the latest addition of crude grade in the Brent basket beginning January 2018. The makeup of the Brent oil benchmark as we force over time as production changes path occurs. This latest change follows the addition of Forties and Oseberg in 2002 and Ekofisk in 2007.","Here again, we had a new disclosure breaking out Platts revenue by four primary markets. You can see that petroleum and power and gas make up the majority of the business. The growth rates of each markets are depicted on the slides. During the first quarter, Platts delivered revenue growth in all of the metals and agriculture markets due to lower metals revenues and global trading services. Please note that about a $11 million of revenue in the first quarter of 2017 from recent acquisitions.","Now, let\u2019s turn to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 14%, mostly due to a surge in ETF assets under management. Adjusted operating profit increased 14%, primarily as a result of increased revenue. Adjusted operating margin increased 20 basis points to 67.9%, as revenue gains were partially offset by increased headcount in commercial and operations to support future growth.","Asset linked fees experienced the greatest growth in the first quarter, rising 26%, driven by a 39% increase in average ETF AUM. Subscription revenue increased modestly due to growth in data subscriptions and exchange traded derivatives revenue declined 8%. The trend of assets moving into passive investments was very strong in the first quarter. The exchange traded products industry reached inflows of $189 billion, a new record by a first quarter and it was 2.5 times larger than the previous first quarter record.","The quarter ending ETF AUM tied to our indices growth of $1,116 billion, up 35% versus the first quarter of 2016. As the chart shows, this was the result of $162 billion of inflows and $126 billion of market gains over the last 12 months. The $1,116 billion was a new record, surpassing the previous quarterly record of $1,023 billion set on December 31, 2016. The first quarter average AUM associated with our indices increased 39% year-over-year, and this is a better proxy for revenue changes than the quarter end figures.","Exchange traded derivatives faced a tough comparison to the first quarter of 2016, when market volatility was much higher. Transaction revenue from exchange traded derivatives declined due to a 10% decrease in average daily volume of products, based on S&PDJI\u2019s indices largely as a result of declines at the CME Equity complex.","Now, turning to our capital position. There was a little change from the end of the fourth quarter. We continued to have $2.4 billion of cash and $3.6 billion of long-term debt, $1.8 billion of this cash was held outside the United States at the end of the first quarter.","Our debt coverage, as measured by gross debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.3 times versus 1.4 times at the end of the fourth quarter. Free cash flow during the quarter was $306 million. However, to get a better sense of our underlying cash generation from operations, it is important to exclude activity associated with divestitures and the after-tax impact of legal settlements.","In the first quarter, there was little difference, as free cash flow on debt basis was $307 million. As for return of capital, the company returns $307 million to shareholders in the first quarter, $201 million through repurchasing 1.5 million shares and $106 million in dividends.","Now, I will review our updated 2017 guidance. Based upon a strong first quarter and our expectations for the remainder of 2017, we have made several changes to our original 2017 guidance. This slide depicts our GAAP guidance and the changes that we have made Please keep in mind that our guidance reflects current spot market ForEx rates. This slide shows our updated adjusted guidance. The changes are highlighted on this slide.","I\u2019m going to discuss the changes to our adjusted guidance, which were as follows. We have increased our organic revenue growth from mid single digits to mid to high single digits growth, with contributions by every business segments. We have lowered our unallocated expense from a range of $145 million to $150 million, down to a range of $130 million to $140 million.","Corporate unallocated is expected to be lower, driven by continued cost discipline. We have changed our operating profit margin guidance, which had been for an increase of roughly 100 basis points to a range of 44.5% to 45.5%. And we hope that providing the margin percentage is more clear than merrily providing the change in basis points. We have increased diluted EPS, which excludes deal-related amortization from a prior range of $5.90 to $6.15 to a new range of $6 to $6.20. And free cash flow, excluding after-tax legal settlements and insurance recoveries was $1.6 billion and now is greater than $1.6 billion. Our guidance does not take into consideration any potential policy changes from the new U.S. administration. Overall, this guidance reflects our expectation that 2017 will be another strong year for the company.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","A - Chip Merritt","Thank you, Ewout. Just a couple of instructions for our phone participants. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we will now take our first question.","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Peter Appert of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Peter Appert","Thanks. Good morning. Doug, the first quarter results are obviously very impressive. I\u2019m wondering about your thought process and guidance. It seems to imply that maybe some of the strength in the first quarter you\u2019re looking at is just pull-forward. Can you talk to that issue?","Douglas Peterson","Yes, first of all, thank you Peter for the comments. As we looked at guidance, we wanted to take into account this very robust first quarter issuance, and taken a look at the rest of the year what we forecasted and what we budgeted. If you look at a report that we issued called credit trends in global issuance for 2017, as you can see, we looked at different categories.","In my comments, I mentioned that, international public finance was going to be dropping and that was driving the overall 1% decrease. But for the entire year, we\u2019re looking at industrials being up for about 5% issuance overall, financial services about a 3% range, structured finance about a 4%, and then U.S. public finance down about 6% to 7%. That\u2019s \u2013 those were kind of the underlying conditions we used for issuance for the rest of the year.","I don\u2019t \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call it pull-forward, but it was a very robust year. We also wanted to highlight this quarter, bank loan ratings. We have never really given the kind of disclosure we gave before on the bank loan rating product. As you can see, results are very strong in the first quarter, partially driven by the rate environment, the spreads have come down considerably, as well as what I\u2019d call a much more positive consumer outlook as well as corporate outlook for growth in the U.S. economy.","As we\u2019ve always said, growth is huge. GDP growth is the number one determinant of issuance, spreads are also part of that. But we\u2019re expecting the quarter as well as the rest of year to play out, and that\u2019s what we used to build our guidance.","Peter Appert","Understood. Thank you, Doug. And then secondly, and this might be for Ewout. The margin progress likewise has been very impressive. I\u2019m just wondering how you think about where you are in that process? How far along we are and how much more there is to come on the margin front beyond the guidance for this year?","Douglas Peterson","Yes, Peter, thank you again for the complement on the margin improvement. I think what you have seen is, indeed margin improvement for each of the businesses on an organic basis if you take out the acquisitions and divestitures. If you look at the improvements of Market Intelligence, Market and Commodities Intelligence, what you clearly can see is, there are the growth of the business as well as the impact of the SNL synergies. This was in line with what we provided to you in terms of guidance for 2017 with respect to the achievements in synergies and the run rate improvement should \u2013 we should see during 2017.","Clearly, the margin improvements in ratings was a result of the better top line growth and modest expense increase. So it shows the scalable nature of the ratings business. Obviously, this is not the level of margins we expect going forward as the new standards, but it\u2019s clearly a good improvement in terms of direction of the Ratings margins going forward.","And then lastly, with respect to the Indices business, margins as you know are already in the mid 60% range. This is a range where we are probably comfortable with respect to margins going forwards. It\u2019s a very scalable business, the marginal expenses are relatively limited if we are able to add additional revenues to that business, so that\u2019s why we are confident that margins should stay in that range going forward as well.","Douglas Peterson","Peter, I want to add something. First of all, I think you know that we\u2019re committed to efficiency and improvement of our margins. The best way of improve them is through revenue growth, but in addition to that we\u2019re looking at other sorts of discipline on how we invest, where we invest our expenses, how we allocate. But the overall aspirations are to get to a sustainable low 50% range in the ratings business and then the MCI including Platts, aspiring to the mid-to-high 30% range. And then in Indexes, as Ewout just said, we don\u2019t have any specific targets, because we\u2019re already at such an attractive level and we do want to keep investing in that business for growth.","Peter Appert","Great, thanks very much.","Douglas Peterson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","Mike Reid","Hello, hi this is Mike Reid on for Joe. Thanks for taking our call. I was wondering if \u2013 could you give us a little color on some of the progressing from the Index business outside of equities, including the custom indices and maybe an update on the Trucost and the ESG indices?","Douglas Peterson","Yes, let me take that. First of all, as you know over time we\u2019ve been looking at growing our index business in different types of asset classes. We have investments around the globe that we\u2019ve made with international exchanges to help them professionalize their index markets, as well as have distribution of U.S. indices and other international indices we have into those market, so that\u2019s one of our diversification strategies.","Another one has been on different types of asset classes that are smart beta or different ways to weight indices. And one of the most important growth factors that we have is ESG. We\u2019re seeing very high demand on environmental, social and governance factors used by investors around the globe. It\u2019s, asset owners are increasingly demanding more and more information, as well as benchmarking to EST factors. That\u2019s one of the reasons we bought Trucost.","Trucost comes with a phenomenal set of data and analytics, but more importantly a really high quality team. We\u2019ve integrated them very quickly into our business and one of the beauty of Trucost isn\u2019t just that we\u2019re able to develop new funds and launch of funds, we\u2019re up over 100 ESG refund already, but that Trucost also benefits all of our divisions across the company.","We\u2019ve got \u2013 we didn\u2019t highlighted that we\u2019ve been launching some green bond assessments, as well as ESG products in the Ratings business and we\u2019re looking at ways that we can incorporate more ESG factors and climate factors into market intelligence data as well, so the Trucost has been a fantastic acquisition for us. We see a lot of synergies across the entire group for that acquisition.","Mike Reid","Okay, great. And do you have any more commentary on outlook of possible tax reform and impact to issuance, because it\u2019s still too uncertain to really give anymore color on that?","Douglas Peterson","Last quarter we gave you a view of what we saw at the time, there hasn\u2019t been enough of a change yet for us to update any of our thinking around that, but as the new tax proposal evolve, we will provide more guidance on that and more of our views as it more comes out.","Mike Reid","Great. Thanks, guys.","Douglas Peterson","Thank you.","Ewout Steenbergen","Thanks Mike.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of James Friedman of Susquehanna Financial Group. Your line is now open.","James Friedman","Doug, in your prepared remarks you called out some of the opportunities in the high-yield market and that \u2013 and how that may have helped propel the quarter? I thought you also mentioned about your mind share and market share, if you could elaborate on that opportunity going forward that would be helpful.","Douglas Peterson","Yes, first of all, as I mentioned, the high-yield market has been one that that we\u2019ve been able to benefit from. I\u2019ve always talked every quarter, we always talk about the importance of understanding the mix of issuance and this quarter the mix including a large component of leverage loan refinancing, as well as high-yield bond financing was something that benefits us on the top line because of the \u2013 because they are the types of organizations and companies we don\u2019t have frequent issuer programs with.","But at the same time, while we benefited from that type of issuance overall, if you went back to Slide 10 in our materials, what you\u2019d see is that we\u2019ve also been able to increase our market share of the leverage loan issuers over the last few years. What we see is that investors demand the opinions in the valuation, the opinions and evaluations from S&P Global Ratings when they look at loans and we\u2019ve been able to benefit from that and a robust market and because of our increasing market share we benefited with the increase in volume.","James Friedman","Okay, thanks for that and then my follow-up. Ewout, I think you called out some headcount growth in Indices. Doug, I realize you\u2019re trying to discipline the margin there, but I saw quietly, I think you said that was commercial related, you know what \u2013 how should we be thinking about the revenue growth relative to the headcount growth?","Ewout Steenbergen","Thank you for that question, James, I think overall if you look at the expense development in the Indices business relative to the revenue growth, what you see is a couple of step up expenses that we are incurring compared to a year ago that should stay more or less flat going forward again. So to give you a little bit more details on that, we had the inclusion of Trucost. Doug, already just gave you some further explanation of the importance strategically of Trucost and how it is benefiting the whole company from an ESG capability perspective. So that is a step up cost that we didn\u2019t incur a year ago and that you see in the expense base of the Indices business.","We had also the launch of a third datacenter during 2016, so that is another step up cost that we are incurring now in the first quarter of 2017 that you don\u2019t see in a comparable period of last year. And then we had some people on capability investments, which we think is important because we further want to expand this business, it\u2019s a business as you are very much aware of that has really a great perspective given the changes in the asset management world and the very large shift from active to passive management. So we look at this expense as more a step up expenses and the margin increase and expense increase from here should not be too much affected by those expenses going forward again.","James Friedman","Got it. Thank you for taking my question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Warren Gardiner of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Warren Gardiner","Great, thanks. So there were some headlines during the quarter and some potential M&A in the Index business, I would just be curious to hear your thoughts on that and then maybe also give us a sense about how you guys are thinking about M&A? What qualitative and quantitative hurdles kind of need to be met maybe beyond one year accretion and being a benchmark type asset?","Douglas Peterson","Well, first of all, as you know we wouldn\u2019t comment at all on any kind of market speculation and market rumors, but we do evaluate obviously opportunities in the marketplace, as you saw that we announced this quarter that we have set up a strategic relationship and alliance with Kensho, it\u2019s not an acquisition, but just in terms of the sorts of evaluations that we\u2019re always doing in the market looking for financial as well as strategic fit. And we\u2019re always looking to improve our portfolio in the parameters and bounds of what we\u2019ve defined as the markets oriented data ratings benchmark organization. But let me hand it off to Ewout to give you some thoughts about the second part of your question.","Ewout Steenbergen","What I would like to say is that, as a company, we are disciplined in every way how we utilize our capital. If it\u2019s organic, inorganic, as well as other ways we can use capital, for example, the most optimal way to return capital to shareholders. With respect to using capital for M&A, we are looking at a couple of key metrics, accretion of EPS is an important element; discount of cash flow methodology is a second important element; and the third important metric we are looking at and actually I\u2019m a very big believer of the importance of this is return invested capital. So we are very much measuring if M&A is ultimately hitting our hurdle rates and cost of capital over a couple of years in the future.","Of course, you have to also take into consideration the strategic importance of acquisitions over time. But those are in terms of framework to ways how we measure and assess M&A opportunities in the market.","Warren Gardiner","Great. Thank you. That\u2019s really helpful. I guess, my one another question there. Obviously, a really nice quarter in the ratings business. How much of that 29% year-over-year gain would you kind of attribute to improving contract \u2013 improve contract terms? And where are you guys in terms of what inning you\u2019re kind of in terms of capturing that opportunity?","Douglas Peterson","Well, in general terms, we don\u2019t give that breakdown. So we cannot give you a specific answer. Directionally, what we can say is that a largest part of debt was volume driven and contract terms is only a smaller part of the contribution of the 29% increase in revenues.","Ewout Steenbergen","And the other thing I \u2013 we can add is that, as we think about the inning of where we\u2019re at with this contract work, we probably got about half in 2016. We\u2019ll probably get about the other half in 2017, maybe it\u2019ll trickle forward after that, but really largely in 2016 and 2017.","Warren Gardiner","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Vincent Hung of Autonomous. Your line is now open.","Vincent Hung","Hi. So you recently invested in Kensho. Could you talk about what this investment gives you not such, but more broadly on how you\u2019re thinking about the changing technological landscape impact in your business?","Douglas Peterson","Yes, first of all, we have been looking at ways to enhance our analytical capabilities that move into new areas like machine learning and artificial intelligence and cognitive learning programs. Obviously, we try to do some of that on our own and there are ways that we can task force, or special labs, or initiatives, as well as embedding things into our work workspace.","But in addition, there are companies like Kensho, which are on the cutting-edge that we felt like it was valuable for us to build this connection with them to get access to people who are building new products and services that we hope can enhance what we do that we can learn from them as well as build products and services together. This was definitely done with that in mind to the kernel of your question, which is that, as the world changes, we believe we need to get on with it and move ahead with it, and that we need a combination of internal, as well as external sources for that kind of innovation.","Ewout Steenbergen","And I guess, it had just couple of things. We will be providing them with some data and they in turn will be providing us with some of their capabilities and will be offered our Market Intelligence platforms.","Vincent Hung","Thanks. And the next question is, could you give us an update on where we are on the project simplify initiative innovating relatively?","Douglas Peterson","Let me give you a quick update on that. First of all, for those of you that don\u2019t know a project simplify is, we have a \u2013 over the last five or six years, we have put in place a whole set of new policies and procedures and processes around improving our control in implementing new approaches to criteria, how we deal with documentation in our organization, and ensuring that we are operating at the highest quality and control standard for best practices, as well as to comply with the regulations that have been implemented around the globe, especially in Europe overseen by Esmond in the U.S. overseen by the SEC.","So as we put in place all those different approaches to managing and controlling our business, we added on a lot of layers of activities and processes. And projects simplified for those of you that don\u2019t know, then is an approach to take a step back and reengineer and reformulate our processes with many more of them being automated, as well as eliminating duplication et cetera.","We\u2019re probably, as Chip\u2019s using baseball analogy this morning, we\u2019re probably in the third inning. We have a ways to go where we\u2019re just moving from the design phase into the piloting phase. The project is going very well. I\u2019m pleased with the progress. I know that it\u2019s going to require some change. But net-net, we think it will continue to allow us to move improvement in our margins and decrease some of our expenses. But more importantly, it will improve our work flow and our quality and allow us to invest also for other grow.","Vincent Hung","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Goldstein","Good morning. This is actually Jeff Goldstein on for Toni. You had mentioned that part of the benefit that you received from high-yield issuance strength, because not many high-yield issuer is on the frequent issuer program. So can you just talk a little bit about your target in mix and ratings between transactional on recurring revenue? So are you just comfortable with your roughly 55 to 45 subscription to transactional mix, or would you look to alter that mix based on your insurance outlook at any given point in time?","Ewout Steenbergen","We don\u2019t target a \u2013 the right kind of a mix. But if I went back a few years, what I would tell you is that, we needed to look at a program, where we were ensuring that we\u2019re getting the right kind of contract realization from our frequent issuer program. If there has been any major change over the last few years, it\u2019s that we started looking at ways to ensure that we are having the right approach toward discounting policies on the frequent issuer programs. But we don\u2019t have a target mix. We obviously want to grow the non-transactional revenue, it\u2019s a valuable to have a more stable subscription like approach to our business. And in addition to surveillance fees, entity fees the royalties we get and then the basic frequent issuer program.","The non-transaction revenue having that in our overall program is, it\u2019s a good base to have, but we don\u2019t have a specific target overall for that. Just to remind everybody on Slide 25, for this quarter, we did have a 65% increase in transaction revenue. It was and it was principally driven by the high-yield bond and bank loan ratings, as well as some of the improved contract terms, and we had a 4% increase in non-transaction revenue.","Jeffrey Goldstein","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just at the time of the SNL acquisition, you had provided some interesting data on the margin differential between established businesses that were in kind of the 30%-plus range and still some unprofitable both businesses like metals and mining and financial institution software. So I was just hoping, you could provide an update on some of these developing businesses, and if you expect them to contribute profit this year?","Douglas Peterson","I\u2019m a little bit scratching my head, because I don\u2019t have that data in front of me. I\u2019m looking around if we have the specific answer to your question. But what I can tell you is that, philosophically, we have continued to manage all of our businesses for a combination of growth. We do have \u2013 this is, Ewout, laid out to you a few minutes ago.","We do have programs where we like to invest and we like to manage our investments and track them, that\u2019s one of the nice disciplines that the SNL team brought as well as their approach towards opening new businesses and managing them for growth and investment. But I don\u2019t have the specific margins. But Chip has some \u2013 [has familiar with it] [ph]\u2026","Chip Merritt","Yes, we\u2019re not going to share the margins. But one of the things we said at the time, the new businesses we\u2019re looking in the metals and mining space and the international big product, there were losing money, because they were just playing new. We can say that the international big product is probably ahead of our plans or projections, and the metals and mining is behind our projection from a revenue perspective, and that\u2019s really going to lead your margin, because we\u2019re just talking about incremental margins on the revenue.","So I hope, I believe that\u2019s helpful that once and look better, but we work together, we will be a little better than our models, as expected.","Jeffrey Goldstein","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Alex Kramm of UBS. Your line is now open.","Alex Kramm","Yes. hey, good morning, everyone. I want to start with something a little bit bigger picture on the stock and the valuation. I mean, obviously, stock has been strong this year. But if you look at the valuation on fee or EBITDA, it\u2019s still below, at least, on my numbers your primary ratings PR. But more importantly, when you look at some of the other businesses and look at the comps, they are like the index businesses, some of the data businesses that are out there. It seems like the stock is trading at a pretty big discount.","So just wondering how you and the Board thinks about this? Is there something missing, or I know you\u2019ve talked about the business mix and how committed you\u2019re to the different business? But do you feel like there\u2019s actually the opportunity if these businesses weren\u2019t together, it\u2019s really a realized \u2013 the value here. So just wondering how you and the Board think about the value that may be left on the table here, maybe because people are not understanding the businesses?","Ewout Steenbergen","Well, first of all, thank you for the question. We don\u2019t comment about the market and market price and valuation. But we do obviously look at it. It\u2019s something that we pay attention to and look at. And what we can control is the quality of our businesses, the quality of our execution, the top line growth, the improvement in margins over time, and that\u2019s how we value our performance and that\u2019s also how we get paid. It\u2019s important that people like you are helping understand the business and communicating to the market the quality of the businesses and how we\u2019re performing.","But as to the actual stock price itself and the valuation in multiples, it\u2019s not something that I can comment on. That\u2019s something the street actually has to comment on.","Alex Kramm","All right, fair enough. And then just secondly, some small here on the index side. I don\u2019t think you commented on the subscription side of the business. I know it was up 3%. But if you think about that number relative to pricing power, like, it seems a little bit softer than we would have expected. I mean, is there \u2013 it was whether there\u2019s some one timers maybe in the fourth quarter, also is the end market maybe a little bit tougher, given what\u2019s going in the active management space. Just seems like some of your peers are doing better there, so maybe a little bit more color on the subscription side of the index?","Ewout Steenbergen","Alex, this is Ewout. First of all, I think, if you look at that line that will fluctuate a bit quarter-to-quarter. There\u2019s some custom kind of products that you see there that are fluctuating over periods, as well as we had a $2 million correction during the quarter in that line a one-time item of $2 million that should not recur during the next quarters again. So I think those are the main drivers why you saw a slight weakness in the line of the data subscriptions in the indices for this quarter.","Alex Kramm","All right, very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie Research. Your line is now open.","Hamzah Mazari","Good morning. Thank you. The first question is just on how many of your customers right now are on enterprise-wide contracts? And any future impact you can share around the SNL and Cap IQ commercial organization? And is that in your synergy numbers already, is that upside? Thank you.","Douglas Peterson","I don\u2019t have the actual detail on the custom on what \u2013 how people move to enterprise-wide contracts. But it is the direction we\u2019re going. So think of it this way that, the SNL contracts were principally on enterprise-wide contracts Cap IQ, we\u2019re principally on per se contracts, and we\u2019ve been steadily moving the Cap IQ into enterprise-wide contracts. But that\u2019s actually the goal of our new and recent sales force reengineering and launch of a whole new approach to how we\u2019re managing the integrated sales force.","One of the things that we\u2019ve done and we had a brief comment about it in the prepared remarks was to put in place a unified sales force for market intelligence, which is, as you know, the Cap IQ and SNL sales forces. It\u2019s built in a way that we have a combination of relationship managers who are managing relationships for the long-term. They\u2019re identifying opportunities. We have a sales force.","We have an excellent high-quality sales services, organization and post sales support group. And that\u2019s where we\u2019re now launching and leveraging the compatibility and the quality of both platforms to build out this sales approach. And what we\u2019re doing there is also moving more and more of our contracts to enterprise-wide pricing, as part of that process. And our salespeople have incentive to up-sell, to get deeper penetration, as well as to move to \u2013 and to move to enterprise-wide contracts.","Hamzah Mazari","Great. That\u2019s very helpful. And just a follow-up question just on issuance. I\u2019m just curious if you guys view issuance as less cyclical relative to past cycles either, because they are secular drivers around European bank disintermediation, or maybe refinancing is a bigger piece. Just curious how you think about cyclicality of issuance relative to past cycles if anything has changed? Thanks.","Ewout Steenbergen","If you look over a long period like, let\u2019s say, 15 years, and we have a chart, which we typically have in our investor materials, not necessarily in quarter material. You can see over the last 15 years, there has been a very steady year-by-year increase in total issuance with the exception of 2008 when there was a significant drop in particular in structured finance issuance. And that structured finance issuance has never actually recovered from the bubble that it reached in 2006 and 2007.","If you look at corporate issuance and sovereign issuance, financial institutions issuance, it\u2019s been also very steady underlying growth with the only year that it dropped us 2008, which was the global recession. So we look at it overall. It\u2019s a steady growth, that\u2019s where we plan around it. That doesn\u2019t mean that quarter-by-quarter, month by-month that mix and issuance is going to be the same, but we need to look at overall GDP growth.","As I mentioned in my remarks, just some of the factors with U.S. economy growing at higher levels than we thought with the EU starting to recover with emerging markets like Brazil that\u2019s coming off of a very deep recession into mild growth in other countries in Latin American improving. China\u2019s growth is a little bit more robust than we expected. Those are all very good factors for us to look at shorter-term issuance. But longer-term issuance, we look at kind of on a steady path tied to overall GDP growth, as well as capital markets development around the globe.","Hamzah Mazari","Thank you.","Douglas Peterson","Thanks, Hamzah.","Ewout Steenbergen","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tim McHugh of William Blair. Your line is now open.","Timothy McHugh","Yes, thanks. I understand the strong revenue obviously probably helped your ratings margins this quarter. But market intelligence is there. I guess, is there any reason why this isn\u2019t a level that should be sustainable, and I guess, how? If so I think it\u2019s at the higher-end of kind of the medium-term targets you\u2019ve set for that segment?","Ewout Steenbergen","I would say, this is Ewout talking. Good morning, Tim. I would say that, if you look at the margin in market intelligence, there were no particular items this quarter that jump out, as well as get margin higher or lower than what you should expect directionally in the future, you have seen a significant step up of 270 basis points compared to the previous period of last year.","We are seeing the benefit of some of the divestitures and those were businesses with lower margin. We see the benefit of the organic revenue improvements and we\u2019re very pleased to see that this business is doing very well. Just want to point out one data point, again, 9% increase in desktop users compared to a year ago, 9%, which is, of course, a very good result to see that the top line is growing so fast.","And then we see the benefit of the SNL synergies coming in. We gave you guidance on that and insight on that last quarter. We will give you an update later this year, but the SNL synergies, of course, helping the margin improvement as well. So ending up at 37.6% margin for the first quarter, that\u2019s indeed in line with our longer-term guidance relates to higher 30% range for this business.","Timothy McHugh","Okay, thanks. And then just the total margin guidance that you changed from kind of given us a basis point increase to a absolute number. Just \u2013 is that a increase in your guidance, or your expectation for the year, or is it because of change in kind of the format?. Just want to understand whether you kept your assumptions the same or increased them?","Ewout Steenbergen","Yes, that was an increase from our previous guidance. Let me explain that to you a bit. The previous guidance was 100 basis points improvement of the margin during 2017, and that was measured from the base margin during 2016. That margin was 42.9%, so at 100 basis points, or at 43.9%. The new guidance is 44.5% to 45.5% to 60 to 160 basis points higher than the prior guidance we have given to you in terms of margin.","So what you should read out of that is clearly a high-level of comfort that we\u2019re on the right path with respect to the performance of the business. We are having a \u2013 of course, a great start of 2017, and therefore, we have raised our margin guidance for this year compared to the prior guidance.","Timothy McHugh","Okay, great. Thank you.","Douglas Peterson","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Manav Patnaik","Yes, good morning, gentlemen. Congratulations on the quarter. My first question is just on the guidance. I mean, I think you said that all areas of your business \u2013 all your businesses were contributing to the increased guidance. The range still seems wide and still probably conservative. Is it fair to say that most of that is just at the ratings conservative, you guys typically assume early in the year?","Douglas Peterson","I would say, we are very confident by the first quarter results. We are not providing quarterly guidance, this is yearly guidance. We have raised the bottom end of the EPS range by $0.10 and the top end by $0.05. What you should read out of that is a good start of the year. Again, we are not providing quarterly guidance. And from our perspective, this is the most reasonable middle of the road guidance we can provide you, it\u2019s neither conservative nor aggressive.","Manav Patnaik","Okay. And then, just your earlier comments around capital allocation and ROIC and so forth. So I mean, that disciplines sounds really good. And so, if it\u2019s not M&A, the balance sheet still is really underutilized in our view. You\u2019ve talked about how your ratings business obviously benefit from people trying to take advantage of spreads and ahead of rates and so forth. So the buybacks felt a little light this quarter too. So just curious on, should we be expecting action one way or the other in the next quarter or two?","Douglas Peterson","Manav, let me say it in the following way. We believe that there is an opportunity to provide more specifics in terms of our capital management targets and capital allocation targets for the company. Today, we don\u2019t have very specific targets. There is a limit, particularly on the debt level. There is a limit, we want to stay in the investment grade space. But where exactly in the spectrum of investment grade, we haven\u2019t specified.","What we expect is that, later this year, we will be able to come back to you with more specific and concrete targets with respect to our capital management strategy. It\u2019s a little bit too early now. So I cannot give you more specifics at this point in time. But later this year, we will come back with more specifics on that.","Manav Patnaik","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks a lot, guys.","Douglas Peterson","Thank you.","Ewout Steenbergen","Thanks, Manav.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Silber","Thanks so much. I know, it\u2019s late. I\u2019m not sure if anybody asked the pricing pressure question that you typically \u2013 you got on each quarter\u2019s call. So if they haven\u2019t, if you could answer that for me?","Ewout Steenbergen","Pricing pressure in a particular category or\u2026?","Jeffrey Silber","I guess, both in market and commodities and then maybe feed pressures on the industry side?","Douglas Peterson","Let me take that question. On the market intelligence, as you know, our shift to a enterprise-wide model allows us to model very carefully, or the value that we provide to our customers, and the kind of service that we\u2019re delivering, it allows us to have a very good conversation about price. And it\u2019s not necessarily tied to a price per user. As you know, we\u2019ve had sometimes in the past with Cap IQ.","So we look at that very carefully. It\u2019s a value-driven approach to how we deliver that value, and then the kind of contract that we\u2019re able to sign. So I wouldn\u2019t say, there\u2019s necessarily pressure there, because we\u2019re able to negotiate that well.","When it comes to the fee structures in indices, we wouldn\u2019t necessarily talk about specific customer pricing actions. But we do have excellent margins and we\u2019re very \u2013 looking very carefully at penetration at new products, new services, et cetera, as a way to grow our top line growth, and we\u2019re very pleased with where we are in that business.","Jeffrey Silber","Okay, great. And then on the diluted EPS guidance for the year of $6 to $6.20, what share count is embedded in that guidance?","Douglas Peterson","We cannot give you those specifics, because then we would implicitly tell you what is the level of share buybacks we\u2019re aiming for during this year. I can just say that share buybacks, the company has a track record. We are a believer in buybacks that it is a good and value and handsome way to return capital to shareholders. So you may expect the company to continue with our track record going forward.","Jeffrey Silber","Thanks.","Ewout Steenbergen","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Craig Huber of Huber Research. Your line is now open.","Craig Huber","Yes, thank you. The other question for you here. This whole interest expense deductibility issue in Washing DC, you\u2019re Paul Ryan\u2019s tax plan. Are you aware of any country around the world of any significance that\u2019s gone from allowing full interest expense deductibility to none in sell-through, I\u2019m not, are you?","Douglas Peterson","No, we\u2019re not. There\u2019s Spain, Germany, the UK, they have different aspects of how it\u2019s implemented. But I don\u2019t know of any place, where they\u2019ve actually implemented in one sell-through.","Craig Huber","I mean, do you sort of think then, Doug, along those lines and be a middle ground, like a Germany, as you say, would it allow only interest expense deductibility up to about 30% of EBITDA, is that sort of the middle ground maybe here? And maybe you also said\u2026?","Douglas Peterson","I don\u2019t know there has been some interesting research and advocacy that\u2019s been coming out recently on what the impact could be on beyond just the real estate industry on other industry that is dead, in particular, community banks are very worried about what the impact would be if their borrowers on SME type activities are not able to, or not able to deduct interest. And what that means both for SMEs, as well as for the small community banks that provide that kind of debt.","There\u2019s a lot of different angles coming out as this is being discussed more thoroughly and we\u2019re watching very carefully what all the different arguments are. I don\u2019t want to predict where it will end up, but I do know that there\u2019s going to be a lot of arguments are going to be surfacing on this.","Craig Huber","And to my other unrelated question, please, Doug. On average, what should investors expect for pricing increases this year across your portfolio? And is there any wide disparity between the segments?","Douglas Peterson","No, we never give any kind of specific pricing guideline, and it\u2019s especially for future pricing. We\u2019re \u2013 it\u2019s something that we would \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t be able to give you at this point in time.","Craig Huber","Thank you.","Ewout Steenbergen","Thanks, Craig.","Douglas Peterson","Thank you.","Douglas Peterson","As everybody closes and we hang up on the call, I do want to thank everyone for your questions, and very importantly, I want to thank the team at S&P Global for excellent performance in the first quarter. We do know that we\u2019ve had a great momentum from how we started the year, and there are some potential upsides, as well as some potential clouds out there. But we\u2019re very, very pleased with how we\u2019ve begun the year across the Board. Thank you very much everybody for joining the call this morning.","Operator","That concludes this morning\u2019s call.

We apologize for the technical difficulties, we'll try this again. Thanks for joining us for S&P Global Earnings Call. Presenting on this morning's call are Doug Peterson, President and CEO; and Rob MacKay, Interim Chief Financial Officer.","This morning, we issued a news release for our third quarter 2016 results. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at investor.spglobal.com.","In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we'll provide an adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparison of the corporation's operating performance between periods and to view the corporation's business from the same perspective as managements. The earnings release contains Exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measures and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.","Before we begin, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements.

We're aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors. And we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Jason Feuchtwanger at (212) 438-1247.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?","Doug Peterson","Good morning. Thank you, Chip. Welcome everyone to the call. This morning Rob Mackay, our Interim CFO, has joined us to cover the financial portion of our third quarter results and you will hear from him shortly.","But let me begin with the highlights. We completed several business divestitures with the sales of J.D. Power, our two pricing businesses SPSE and CMA, and the equity research business. This leaves us with a more focused interrelated portfolio of market-leading businesses.","Two tuck-in acquisitions were added during the quarter, PIRA Energy Group within Platts and Trucost within S&P Dow Jones indices.","Several key management additions were announced. We completed the three-year $140 million cost reduction initiative that was announced during our Investor Day in 2014. We demonstrated continued revenue growth and productivity progress which led to an adjusted profit margin improvement of 320 basis points, with every segment delivering organic revenue growth. As a result of our share repurchases, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 3% year-over-year.","Our bottom-line result was excellent with a 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS over the third quarter last year. We delivered year-to-date free cash flow of over $1 billion and we increased our 2016 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a range of $5.15 to $5.25 which Rob will cover shortly.","Before we turn to the results, I want to note three new appointees to our management team. Steve Kemps joined us from our Quanta Services as EVP of General Counsel. Martin Fraenkel has been promoted to President, SVP Global Platts. Martin previously led the Global Editorial Team at Platts. And Ewout Steenbergen will join us from Voya Financial as EVP and Chief Financial Officer effective November 14.","I'm pleased we avoided any disruptions to our businesses as we put in place an excellent leadership team.","Now let's take a closer look at the third quarter results. Reported revenue grew 9% and organic revenue on a constant currency basis increased 8%. In the third quarter ForEx reduced revenue by $5 million yet contributed approximately $8 million to adjusted operating profit and approximately 60 basis points in the adjusted operating profit margin.","Most of this benefit was realized in the Platts segment which benefited from a weaker British pound. The company delivered a 320 basis point improvement in adjusted operating profit margin. Together, revenue growth, margin improvement, and share repurchases led to a 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS of $1.43 per share.","In the third quarter, every division recorded organic top-line growth. Profit growth however was most pronounced at ratings and market intelligence with adjusted operating profit margin gains of 330 and 480 basis points respectively.","Let me turn to the businesses and I'll start with S&P Global ratings. Despite initial uncertainty from the Brexit vote, third quarter issuance was strong, particularly in non-financial Global Corporate and U.S. public finance markets. This resulted in a 9% increase in revenue with a 1% unfavorable impact from ForEx. Adjusted operating profit increased 17% due to strong revenue growth and cost containment particularly with reduced legal and outside services spending. Adjusted operating margin increased 330 basis points to 51.3%. ForEx had a negligible impact on adjusted operating profit.","Non-transaction revenue was unchanged with growth in surveillance fees, offset by lower rating evaluation services fees. Transaction revenue increased 23% as a result of improved contract term, growth in debt issuance, and a 21% increase in bank loan ratings revenue.","I also want to note that as we work to re-enter the U.S. conduit\/fusion CMBS market there are 13 transactions in the quarter and we re-rated two of them.","If we look more closely at the largest markets, third quarter issuance in U.S. was up 7% with investment grade decreasing 3%, high-yield soaring 49%, public finance up 16% and structured finance increasing 11% due to 44% increase in ABS transactions driven especially by credit card ABS.","In Europe, issuance increased 14%, with investment grade climbing 42% driven by large M&A transactions, high-yield rising 37%, and structured finance decreasing 46% primarily due to 59% decline in covered bonds.","In Asia, issuance more than doubled. However excluding domestic China issuance which we do not rate, Asia issuance increased 64%. Investment grade surged a 166%. However excluding domestic China it increased 67%. Japan was country with the largest increase due to the Bank of Japan's negative interest-rate policy. Finally, structured finance increased 2%.","Two weeks ago, S&P Global ratings released its latest global issuance forecast. In the three months since the Brexit vote, debt markets have reacted very positively with unexpected levels of new issuance, especially in the non-financial corporate financial sectors and international public finance sectors. We now expect global issuance to increase 24% in 2016. This compares to the July forecast issued on the heels of the Brexit vote which anticipated a decline of approximately 4%. If we remove sovereign issuance from the forecast however, we anticipate issuance 2016 to increase approximately 10%.","Looking ahead to 2017, we expect an overall issuance increase -- we expect an overall increase in global issuance of 5% driven by the ECB extending its quantitative easing policies longer than currently anticipated and further growth out of China. Excluding sovereign issuance, we anticipate issuance 2017 to increase 3% to 6%.","Now let me turn to S&P Global Market Intelligence. In the third quarter, revenue increased 21% primarily due to the addition of SNL. Excluding SNL organic revenue growth was 7%. Adjusted operating profit increased 43% and the adjusted operating margin advanced 480 basis points to 31.4%. This improvement was due to progress on SNL integration synergies, operating leverage from strong organic revenue growth, and continued efficiency gains. ForEx had a negligible impact on revenue and adjusted operating profit in the quarter.","As we have stated before in 2016, successful integration of SNL and delivery of synergies is a top priority for the company. We have made tremendous progress as evidenced in the margin improvement and remain committed to achieving our integration synergy targets and deliver on our expected return on investment in SNL.","Let me add a bit more color on third quarter revenue growth and market intelligence. In financial data and analytics, S&P Capital IQ desktop and Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 6% with high-single-digit growth in S&P Capital IQ desktop. In addition, on a comparable basis, which includes revenue prior to our acquisition, SNL revenue increased 12% over the third quarter 2015. SNL and S&P Capital IQ desktop experienced year-over-year user percentage growth in the low-teens and high-single-digits respectively.","Risk services revenue increased 10% led by double-digit Ratings Xpress growth. In the smallest category, research and advisory, revenue decreased 8% due to declines in equity research. With the sale of equity research, the only remaining asset in this category is investment advisory. Therefore, in the future, we will report investment advisory as part of financial data and analytics.","Now let's turn to S&P Dow Jones indices. Revenue increased 6%, adjusted operating profit increased 1%, and adjusted operating margin declined 320 basis points to 66.2%. This is a sizable decline into third quarter of 2015 benefited from a sharp increase in exchange traded derivative volumes that did not repeat this quarter. I also want to point out that the adjusted margin this quarter is comparable to the 66% figure we reported last quarter.","During the third quarter, revenue increased primarily due to mutual fund and ETF licensees and steady data license growth. Operating costs increased to support revenue growth and business initiatives as well as increased costs for purchase data.","One notable example is connectivity expenses as we recently started up a third data center to provide additional backup capabilities.","Often on our earnings call, I say new products that we have launched. Last quarter, I highlighted the launch of the JPX\/S&P CAPEX & Human Capital Index in Japan. The new ETF that was launched based on this index has turned out to be one of the fastest growing new ETF this year. It already has over $700 million in AUM.","Asset like linked fee revenue increased 10% during the quarter.","The exchange traded products industry recorded massive inflows of $126 billion in the third quarter almost tripled the inflows in the second quarter. Of the $126 billion of industry inflows, $58 billion went into the U.S. equity products with S&P Dow Jones indices capturing about 60% of those inflows.","Average ETF AUM associated with our indices increased 15% year-over-year with inflows of 10% and the remainder from market appreciation. The quarter ending ETF AUM associated with our indices reached a new record of $914 billion.","Transaction revenue from exchange traded derivatives decreased primarily due to a 14% decrease in average daily volume of products based on our indices. The E-mini S&P 500 Futures, CBOE Volatility Index options and futures VIX, and CME Equity complex contracts all decreased 10% to 25% compared to the volatile third quarter of 2015.","Subscription revenue, which consists primarily of data subscriptions and custom indices increased due to growth in data subscription revenue and the timing of subscription revenue.","During the quarter, the company launched 161 new indices and our partners launched 11 new ETF based on our indices.","Now on to the S&P Global Platt segment, which included J.D. Power results for July and August. Because this quarter has one less month of J.D. Power revenue than the third quarter of 2015, segment revenue declined 8%. Segment organic revenue though increased 4%, adjusted operating profit increased 4% reflecting one less month of J.D. Power, and adjusted operating margin increased 170 basis points to 40.9%. Organic revenue increased 4% due to growth in subscriptions, partially offset by decline in global trading services.","The core subscription business delivered mid-single-digit revenue growth led by the petroleum sector. The global trading services double-digit revenue decrease is primarily due to the timing of license fees. Gas and power revenue was flat with modest gains in subscriptions offset by lower GTS service revenue. Metals, agriculture, and petrochemicals revenue declined low-single-digits, primarily due to lower revenue from SGX's listed TSI iron ore contract.","We continue to expect modest growth in the remainder of 2016 as many customers continue to face pressure from low oil prices.","On the business development front, we are building a world-class capability in energy, supply, and demand information. The acquisition of PIRA Energy Group, and the added capabilities of Commodity Flow and RigData, which we acquired earlier this year. PIRA is a leader in the worldwide energy market analysis and a great complement to our existing benchmarks. PIRA offers research and analysis in oil, gas, power, natural gas liquids, biofuel, coal, environmental, and agricultural markets. They also provide data tools to help customers analyze prices, supply, demand, trade flows, product balances and refining activities.","And I'm pleased that Executive Chairman and Founder of PIRA, Dr. Gary Ross has joined our team and is already generating new product ideas.","In addition, Platts worked with CME to launch a new futures contract, Alumina FOB Australia futures will be a 100 metric ton contract will be financially settled each month against a daily price index published for Alumina FOB Australia by S&P Global Platt. Alumina is aluminum oxide, a white granular material a little finer than table salt is transformed into aluminum metal in the smelting process. This new futures contract is an addition to the three existing CME aluminum futures contracts based on Platt benchmarks.","And finally, Brazil CETIP Latin America's largest depository of private fixed income securities in Brazil's largest private-asset clearinghouse is going to make Platt's benchmark price assessments available with settlement mechanisms for the development of domestic derivative contracts. Historically, Brazil's only hedging tools tend to be similar, but not necessarily matching commodity indices or they were international rather than domestic contracts.","Investors are increasingly seeking new insights into environmental, social, and governance factors, and both our index and ratings businesses are taking action to address these need.","First our S&P Dow Jones indices acquired Trucost. Trucost has become a leading brand in ESG information sector. They provide the gold standard carbon and natural capital investment metrics that financial institutions need to assess the risks and opportunities presented by climate change and capitalize on the transition to a low-carbon resource efficient economy.","The complementary nature of our two businesses, allow us to combine Trucost, industry leading environmental impact data, with our world-class benchmarking capabilities develop new ESG solutions.","Second, Ratings is developing a Green Bond Evaluation tool to provide an analysis and estimate of the environmental impact of projects financed by bond proceeds. Our proposed approach would address mitigation such as reducing negative environmental impact and adaptation to look at resiliency to the impact of climate change. The output of the Green Bond Evaluation would include scores from the categories listed here amalgamated into an overall financial green -- final Green Bond Evaluation. I'm encouraged by the innovative thinking underway in the company to help tackle increased ESG needs of investors.","Before I conclude, I need to point out a reporting change. Beginning in the fourth quarter we will report our results under three segments: rating, indices, and marketing commodities intelligence. We are doing this to be consistent with how we manage our businesses.","In summary, we completed sales of J.D. Power, two pricing businesses, and equity research. We had consistent results with all segments delivering organic revenue growth. Bond issuance is robust in the third quarter despite the Brexit vote. Our focus on revenue growth and productivity performance led to continued margin improvement. Integration of SNL is progressing well and remains a top priority in 2016. And our adjusted diluted EPS guidance is increased to a range of $5.15 to $5.25 and includes dilution from the sale of J.D. Power, the pricing businesses, and equity research.","With that, let me turn the call over to Rob.","Rob MacKay","Thank you, Doug, and good morning to everybody on the call. This morning, I will recap key financial results, discuss the impact from adjustments to earnings, then I'll update you on the balance sheet, free cash flow, and return of capital. Next I will discuss the completion of our $140 million productivity program. The financial impact of our recent divestitures and update our 2016 guidance. Before wrapping up, I will explain the new segment reporting that will be effective beginning in the fourth quarter and the data we will provide.","Let's start with the consolidated third quarter income statement. There are just a couple of items, I want to highlight. As you've just heard from Doug, all of our segments delivered top-line organic growth. Collectively that led to an increase in reported revenue of 9% with organic growth on a constant currency basis of 8%. The difference is largely due to the SNL acquisition. Foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by $5 million and had a favorable impact of $8 million on operating profit.","Adjusted operating margin increased 320 basis points. Approximately 60 basis points was due to ForEx, the balance was primarily due to outstanding top-line growth and margin improvement at S&P Global Ratings and S&P Global Market Intelligence.","The adjusted tax rate in the third quarter was 31.3%, an increase of 220 basis points over the third quarter of 2015 due to one-time benefits recorded in the prior period.","Share repurchases over the past year have resulted in a 3% decline in average diluted shares outstanding. Taken together, top-line growth, margin improvement, and share count reduction combined to deliver a 17% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share.","Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. Pre-tax adjustments to earnings totaled to a gain of $732 million in the quarter. The largest item is a gain on the sale of J.D. Power. The next item is a net gain from insurance proceed recoveries. And the last item includes net acquisition and disposition related costs, primarily related to the sale of our SPSE and CMA pricing businesses to ICE and J.D. Power to the XIO Group.","And as we discussed earlier this year, our adjusted results now exclude deal-related amortization, which totaled $23 million during the quarter. All adjustments are detailed on Exhibit 5 of today's earnings release.","Now let's turn to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents of which approximately $1.6 billion was held outside of the United States. We also had $3.6 billion of long-term debt and $400 million of short-term debt. The short-term debt is the value of the 2017 notes that were redeemed in October.","One other item that I want to point out is that the cash proceeds from the sale of J.D. Power were reported in the quarter. However, the tax on the gain will not be paid until later in the fourth quarter.","Free cash flow during the first nine months was approximately $1 billion. However to get a better sense of our underlying cash generation from operations, it is important to exclude the after-tax impact of legal and regulatory settlements and related insurance recoveries. On that basis, free cash flow from the first nine months was approximately $1.1 billion.","Now I'll review our return of capital. During the quarter the company initiated a $750 million accelerated share repurchase plan. This resulted in the repurchase of 5.3 million shares during the quarter. However, the final share count reduction will not be determined until the ASR is completed. In addition, the company paid a dividend of $95 million during the quarter.","Year-to-date the company has returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","In March of 2014, we initiated a productivity target of greater than $100 million in cost reduction initiatives during 2014 to 2016. We subsequently increased the target to $140 million. Today we are pleased to announce the successful completion of this program. We delivered slightly more than $140 million in savings.","You look at the chart on the right; you can see that our adjusted operating margin has increased by 900 basis points since 2013. The successful achievement of this $140 million productivity target was a key contributor to this improvement.","While we are pleased with our recent divestitures; we want to make sure all of you understand the loss of revenue and profitability associated with these transactions.","J.D. Power, SPSE and CMA pricing businesses, and equity research combines to generate $310 million of revenue, $108 million of pro forma adjusted EBITDA, and approximately $0.25 of pro forma adjusted diluted EPS to our 2016 results before they were sold. This equates to approximately $100 million of revenue and $0.08 of adjusted diluted EPS that will be forgone each quarter. The recently announced ASR should help offset some of this dilution. We estimate that the ASR will increase diluted adjusted earnings per share by about $0.10 over the next year. We hope these figures will help you with your modeling of our future results.","Based upon our strong results year-to-date and the expectation that debt issuance remained strong for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.15 to $5.25.","We've also made changes to other components of guidance as follows: adjusted and allocate expense is reduced to $135 million due primarily to reduced professional fees. The adjusted operating margin increase over 2015 is now expected to be approximately 200 basis points. This is largely due to the excellent performance in ratings and market Intelligence. The adjusted tax rate is increased to approximately 31.5% primarily due to the timing and size of past years tax settlements. Free cash flow, excluding the after-tax, legal and regulatory settlements and insurance recoveries is increased to $1.4 billion to the strong financial results. Overall, this guidance reflects our expectation that 2016 will be another strong year for the company.","Final item I want to discuss is the upcoming change to our reporting segments. Beginning in the fourth quarter, S&P Global Market Intelligence and S&P Global Platts will be included in a new segment called Market and Commodities Intelligence. Both fourth quarter results and full-year 2016 results of both businesses will be reported in this new segment. To facilitate analysis in the next few weeks, we will provide a pro forma schedule with results of this new segment for all quarters of 2015 and 2016 as if it had existed this way. This should help investors model 2017 appropriately.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions.","Chip Merritt","Thanks, Rob. Just a couple instructions for our phone participants. [Operator Instructions]. I would kindly ask you to limit yourself to two questions that's two questions per call, in order to allow time for other callers during today's Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, we'll now take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. First question comes from Ashley Michael Rao from Credit Suisse. You may now ask your question.","Ashley Michael Rao","Good morning. First question is when you think about the integration of the consolidation of segments of Platts into Market Intelligence and you consider recent divestitures, does this change to mid 30% margin target discussed on the last call for that segment?","Doug Peterson","Yes, good morning. Thanks, Ashley. So as we were looking at the sale of J.D. Power and then how we were going to manage the company, it was clear that one of the largest opportunities for the Platts business is in the data and analytics space where we've made recent acquisitions and see a lot of opportunity for growth in that area. ","So by putting these businesses working together between Market Intelligence and having them both report to Mike Chinn, we feel there is opportunities for us there. We do, we will send out further information in the next couple of weeks about how these -- how this segment is going to look when we put these businesses together, but we will be targeting blended margin that's in the high 30s range.","Ashley Michael Rao","Okay. Thanks for that. And then as you continue to shape the company's portfolio and also execute on it as an integration, can you just talk about the types of assets you find attractive on the M&A front. Should we just expect more tuck-ins in ESG or in energy and just also some thoughts on how you're thinking about using M&A as a tool to drive growth in the fixed income indexing arena today?","Doug Peterson","Well you should consider that we have a disciplined approach to our capital allocation, which starts with investing in our businesses in organic growth. We are obviously going through our year-end review and our 2017 to 2018 strategic planning process where we're evaluating ways that we can invest in the business. So investing in organic growth, which could be expansion of regional areas of new products, of technology investments, et cetera is very important for us. Following that obviously would be ways that we can accelerate growth or expand into new regions or new capabilities through M&A. Then obviously finally come our approach to dividends and share repurchase.","But when it comes to your question around M&A, we would be looking at many ideas and many options coming in, tuck-ins could be attractive for us, but it's something that we would do business by business, opportunity by opportunity, look at them separately as they arise. We have seen, as you know, tuck-in acquisitions have been a way for us to grow our portfolio of products in Platts. It's given us opportunities with different areas and services in Market Intelligence.","Last quarter we had purchased a very small rating agency in Thailand S&P Global Ratings area. So we would continue to look selectively at areas but they need to -- we need to ensure that they also meet our parameters for growth and return.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. You may now ask your question.","Manav Patnaik","Yes, hi good morning gentlemen. So the decision to roll Platts into Market Intelligence I think that makes sense. I guess what I'm curious about is I think when we have asked this question over the last couple of months it seems like the answer was there would be more work done over the next couple of years. So I was just curious if there was any change there were you guys being conservative or is this just -- just tuck-in Platts away into that division?","Doug Peterson","Manav, can you clarify the question, what do you mean by more work being done, I'm not sure what the question is about?","Manav Patnaik","Has been what changed? Because I guess my understanding was based on your response that, yes, it could be an opportunity but it would be like two to three years down the road but it sounds like as things are changing much quicker than that.","Rob MacKay","Are you talking about the opportunity for SNL and Platts to work together?","Manav Patnaik","Yes, correct.","Doug Peterson","Okay, thanks. I didn't understand that. Yes, so when we look at areas that we have the largest opportunities in this company, we try to find areas where there are still large needs in the markets or areas that are unfulfilled and there is we see that the customers have made an avalanche of data, they need to make somehow they can make decisions around it.","One of the areas that is a very fragmented business and there is high growth that relates to data and analytics are on the energy markets and SNL has a small energy business and Platts obviously is a very large energy business and we wanted to accelerate the integration of those two businesses. But more importantly take advantage of the expertise that we have in the Market Intelligence data machine and how they can work together with platform building out that data analytics business. So this was not something that I really felt we should wait. I felt that wasn't something we should wait for a couple of years for that we needed to move now but opportunities are going to start cropping up and we wanted to be positioned to take advantage of it as quickly as possible.","Rob MacKay","But clearly it took second place after the initial integration. So the number one priority for 2016 was getting SNL and Market Intelligence integration. And so this is, if you will kind of step two but perhaps it's done quicker than you might have thought.","Manav Patnaik","Okay. All right. And then may be just asking the ratings business, your subscription growth was flat. Just some color there, I know you had some constant valuation services comps may be but curious on how we should think about modeling that piece of the business?","Doug Peterson","Yes, that was one of the areas that we had a little bit of a flat growth. It was on the subscription side. Rating evaluation service was not growing during the quarter that was -- that was one of the areas in addition to the how we're managing the business now looking at the way that we manage our contracts. So non-transaction business was flat at $343 million during the quarter. It usually grows around 3% to 4% over time but as you can see, it was offset by transaction revenue growth of $55 million from $244 million to $299 million. So there was a very robust growth in the transaction side. But we do continue to value highly this non-transaction side but the main factor was related to lower rating evaluation services fees.","Manav Patnaik","Okay, got it. Thanks for the color and congrats on the solid quarter.","Doug Peterson","Thank you.","Rob Mackay","Thanks, Manav.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Toni Kaplan","I wanted to ask about the Index business. Doug, I think you mentioned increased cost of purchasing data there. Is that exchange data or data from other providers and basically, how much of an impact does this have and are you expecting this trend to continue?","Doug Peterson","It was -- it was a very minor repurchase of data, the external data, it was one of the very small factors. But the main factor which drove the drop in the margin was the lower volumes of exchange traded derivatives on the CPOE and with CME the VIX and S&P 500 E-mini that was where the main factor was that drove the margin difference.","We also put in place a third data, a backup center for to run our data center. So there was a small investment in data and operations that we think provides us with a more stable market approach. We want to get that redundancy in how we run our operations. So it's really a combination of a couple of things that rose, expenses rose, but these were kind of step functions none of these are going to have -- the cost isn't something it's going to be increasing going forward, it was a one-time approach.","Toni Kaplan","Okay, terrific. And then just on thinking about index gross in general, it sort of stepped down a little bit from low-double-digits in a number of years past to now mid-single. It could be a mix shift I know especially, just related to what you just mentioned in terms of these derivatives. But just trying to think about longer-term, how you think about the growth in the index business, can you sort of get back to a double-digit range there and what would be sort of the primary drivers that we should be thinking about in terms of long-term index growth?","Doug Peterson","Yes. So there is obviously a few components to the revenue. One of them we just mentioned has been very strong in the last few quarters here and which is the volatility aspect of our revenue, which relates to the exchange traded derivative trading volume that goes through. So there is that aspect to it.","There is another aspect is, which is the core businesses that relate to AUM growth and AUM growth, which could be a combination of the fees that we get for the actual underlying components of a fund or an ETF or the actual growth in AUMs over time. So that's, that's a very important factor for us. And then we have our data feeds and data business.","Generally, we're seeing growth in all of those. I think that the drop of the exchange traded derivative income is what impacted this quarter and also had very positively impacted the third quarter last year. So that's a little bit about that, about the -- that what you see there in the difference between last year and this year.","But let me just give you a couple of data points about the growth in the AUM. So if I go way back I go back almost five, six years ago. If you go back into the end of 2013 there was a -- the overall AUMs was only $585 billion. It's now $914 billion as of the end of this quarter.","And through that time there's been a combination of factors that have driven that growth. One is the increase in market value. So as the market themselves and the indices themselves go up that is a positive for our revenue. And the other is flows into the funds and you saw that last week in The Wall Street Journal, there was a series, the entire week about the shifting needs of investors and the changes in the investment management industry, which have been benefiting -- have been benefiting firms like ours that are in the passive index field. So we're not giving you any specific projections today. We will provide guidance for 2017 at our next earnings call, but we do continue to see the trend for this industry to be very positive.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is now open.","Alex Kramm","Yes hi good morning everyone. Just wanted to get back to the guidance, which I believe nobody has asked about but when I look at the mid-point here at 112 for the quarter, it doesn't really flip with the lot of the things that you've said, for example, you would expect the debt issuance environment to remain good. I know you also gave some of the impact from the businesses that you're divesting but I think it's like $0.04, $0.05 may be. So you're still arriving at a EPS for the fourth quarter that's basically below around the first quarter, which I think we all would agree it was a pretty tough environment. So can you flush this out a little bit more? What am I missing here? Why you're just being very conservative and so sorry, one more thing, you have raised your guidance like $0.05 each quarter, is there any sort of technicalities in how you approach guidance or what's going on there? Thanks. Sorry for the long question.","Doug Peterson","I'm going to start and then hand it over to Rob. From the point of view of the factors you actually gave most of the factors which were included in our calculation or understanding of our guidance, which has to do with what could be a very difficult environment.","On the one hand, we've seen a very strong third quarter in issuance. It was almost unprecedented the strength that we saw after the Brexit. And we do project based off of the M&A pipeline and what we see for being some pull forward of issuance. And what we see looking at the investment banking calendar and the debt capital markets of depth of the big banks. We do see a strong issuance in the fourth quarter.","On the other hand, as you saw with the Brexit that happened last quarter, this could turn on a dime. You could see there is still lot of volatility, there is still lot of factors, which we are very cautious about, you've got the interest rate discussions in the United States, you still have Brexit, you have the elections in United States, which have been quite volatile. So there is still a lot of factors out there that are impacting our external view and that external view has been driving our approach to where we ended up with guidance, but let me hand it over to Rob.","Rob MacKay","Alex, your math is similar to ours, where there's about a nickel going away from what you'd expect because of the divestitures, offset by the ASR. But we did take the bottom up $0.10 and the top up $0.05. So we're heading now closer but yes the nickel going away for divestitures and we're cautiously optimistic of what's going to happen in the fourth quarter.","Doug Peterson","Alex, I will point out one other thing, if you look at the last two years, you can see the first quarter and fourth quarter both in 2014 and 2015 were considerably lower on EPS than our second and third quarters. So it's kind of a consistent pattern that you see each year. I can't guarantee it's going to repeat but at least that we see in the past.","Alex Kramm","All right, that's helpful, thanks for the color. And then just coming back to the point of the restatements of the combining GMI and Platts, first of all, I think if you ask the investors they would ask -- they would argue that you are now bearing one of the best businesses you have in one of the businesses that people do not give a lot of think there is a lot of quality but maybe you disagree. And I guess that is really my question. If you look at the new combined segment now, how much of the business in terms of revenue or EBITDA, do you think is really businesses that are Platts like and may be have gotten lost before like things that are must have very sticky good pricing power there's things like the CUSIP database ratings reselling versus may be similar things that are more discretionary, easier to cut like the desktop businesses. Thank you.","Doug Peterson","So this is, this is a question about for us what we looked at was partially your question and then beyond that was what are the needs of customers and where do we see the opportunities for further penetration of data and analytics services with different types of client basis. And then going into the backend behind that, how do you run those to be able to deliver the fastest, the best way, and take advantage of our expertise across the company.","So within the segment, obviously you're going to have the must-have products of SNL, you've got the must have products of things like CUSIP, in our risk services area, we have products which have become very important for risk management tools that we see as people are doing CCAR modeling and liquidity planning and living well, so there is an advantage to having all of those types of products together.","In addition, then you got the Platts part of the business. So you've got a combination. I don't know the numbers off the top of my head that would be better if we talked about that after we put together the new segment information and we send it out. But there is a lot of must have data in there.","And then remember that the traditional Cap IQ and SNL desktops have been growing very well. They're growing in somewhere in the high-single digit level for the Cap IQ desktop and over double-digits for the SNL. So even though they might have some sort of discretionary component to them they're still growing at a very good clip and in many cases substituting for other products which might be similar that are much more expensive.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie. Your line is now open. ","Kevin McVeigh","Okay. Hi, this is Kevin McVeigh stepping in for Hamzah. I have a question for you guys around margin improvement related to the rating business. There's probably some low-hanging fruits behind on the legal cost coming off, but do you guys see any pricing opportunity remaining still?","Doug Peterson","Well, if we take a look at the margin in ratings in September 2015 it was about 48% and we improved to 51.3% this quarter. Every quarter for the last year we've been -- we've been driving towards improvement. Last quarter, at the end of June, we had a 54.1% margin. As you've heard us say before, our goal was to remove all of the first areas of things like legal expense of ensuring that we had the right approach to managing our business when it came to compliance and control, embedding new technology tools to have more automation. We have a project going on right now called project simplify, which has the benefits of better control, of better workflow, and eventually it will also bring lower cost with it as well, as you have more streamlined operation.","So think about our approach towards margin is continuous improvement. We will keep striving to improve our margins. I'm not going to give you a target necessarily today, but we do have a commitment to strive to keep improving our margin and that would come with a combination of better penetration into the markets where sales force through looking at how we can manage our contracts and our mix on pricing as well as discounting policies. And then on the cost side, through projects like simplify and other ways to manage the business more efficiently and more effectively.","So you can see over the last few years, we have had a continuous improvement in our margins, and that's a commitment that we still have.","Kevin McVeigh","All right, thanks for that. One other quick question could you give us an update on where you see the upsides in SNL synergies over, next two-year period. You guys spoken about $100 million number before any sense of that.","Doug Peterson","Yes, we had given you a number and I believe it was at the beginning of the year, it was may be updated which was originally $70 million. We then increased it to a $100 million with a approach where we gave guidance as said that we get approximately half of the $70 million, which was the cost side during this year. We will update you on that, on how we are against those targets at our next call.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Vincent Hung from Autonomous. Your line is now open.","Vincent Hung","Hi, good morning. So on evaluation services fees, sounds like weakness that it due --","Doug Peterson","Vincent, can you speak a little louder?","Vincent Hung","Yes, so on the evaluation service fees sounds like most of the weakness that is due to the contract reviews, how much revenue do you usually get from that?","Doug Peterson","I can't give you -- your question -- can you -- your revenue was how much revenue do we get from where. It can range from 5% to 10% of raised revenue ballpark.","Vincent Hung","Okay. And on desktop and enterprise and market intelligence looks like the growth has slowed compared to last few quarters, if there anything to highlight there?","Doug Peterson","No, nothing to highlight there, we continue to see a very good penetration, a good acceptance to the market in that area, so nothing that I'd highlight at this time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Warren Gardiner of Evercore. Your line is now open.","Warren Gardiner","Great, thanks. I was just wondering if you could give us an update on how you're progressing in terms of regaining some market share in CMBS, kind of feels like that market is starting to pick up a bit. So just wondering how we should kind of expect you guys to participate there?","Doug Peterson","So during the last quarter, there were 13 CMBS deals of which we were engaged on two of them. So that was a beginning to maybe I could say get our toe in the water. We do continue to rate a large number of the single issuer CMBS transactions. And so we are back engaged in the market, we are engaging with investors and with issuers and continue to be out there showing what we can do. So let's -- let's hope that we keep getting more deals.","Warren Gardiner","Okay. And then strong growth in SNL I think you guys noted some of that came from -- a lot of that came from new user growth. I mean can you guys just give us some color where that's coming from may be just however you want to kind of slice it may be also how much of that may be came from price increases if any?","Doug Peterson","What we talked about user growth that is coming directly from users. Some of the uptick is also coming from pricing. As you might know, we have an approach towards pricing which is more of an enterprise model. We have decided to work with the sales force where we've merged the sales forces of the old SNL and the old Cap IQ businesses and what we're doing right now is working on an approach to highlight selectively enterprise-wide pricing for Cap IQ and you seen a little bit of it but we're actually rolling it out and phasing it out in 2017. So up until now, what we've seen continues to be mostly based on our prior approach to sales of the two products that with their own sales forces. But more to come on that and this will be another area we will provide more information on it in the next quarter call.","Warren Gardiner","Great, understood.","Rob MacKay","I apologize of creating confusion by talking about the 12% growth in use of the SNL. We're at the Doug's point. We don't charge on a per user basis to SNL. So it's necessarily direct correlation between user growth and revenue growth. But clearly they do charge based on usage and new users is a part of usage so that kind of feeds into that.","And also on the early answer I gave on the 5% to 10% of ratings revenue from TRIS closer to 5%.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","Joseph Foresi","Hi good morning. Sorry if I missed this but any thoughts on renewing of the overall productivity initiatives for the full company and may be what's on -- what's next on the agenda there?","Rob Mackay","Thanks, Joseph, this is Rob. So we're continuing to really execute against the SNL targets that we set out and just continuous improvement in all of the divisions as we work through our plan. So no overall announcement on a single program, we're just going to continue looking for productivity in each division as well as flawlessly execute the SNL productivity and synergy targets.","Joseph Foresi","Okay. Do you expect that you may announce something as you go through your five-year plan or is that still, I guess being discussed? I know obviously each individual unit you have done well in increasing the productivity there. But I'm just wondering if there is going to be an overall initiative?","Doug Peterson","It's possible with our new CFO starting and going to the planning process into next year that's possible.","Joseph Foresi","Okay. I'm going to sneak one more in here on issuance can we get any early thoughts on the ratings business for next year. I know you talked about issuance expectations for 2017. But just wondering what the underlying economic assumptions are there. Thanks.","Chip Merritt","Joseph sorry about that, we keep it to two questions per person.","Joseph Foresi","Okay, no problem.","Chip Merritt","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is coming from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. Your line is now open.","Craig Huber","Yes, hi, Doug. First question on the rating side roughly the last year, you've talked about try to move away from some of the contract annual pricing contracts more to transaction based prices. Just want to hear a little bit further about how that's going, how far you think you are into that? How long you think that migration might take here?","Doug Peterson","What's most important for us is that we are -- we are re-engaging with the market in an approach towards commercial relationships and relationship management that allows us to have individualized discussions with our customers about the most effective way for them to tap the market, it allows us to show the benefits of having a rating. How much you people save by having a rating on their issuance costs and because of that we can have a new dialogue about our contract valuation.","So it's hard for me to answer your question in a broad way because net-net, most of our discussions with our customers are one-offs, they're individual. But we are trying to approach the market in a way to get better contract realization overall but it's -- but it's again, it's a relationship management approach professional sales really market by market, customer by customer.","Craig Huber","Then also just a quick question for 2017 for pricing across the overall portfolio at S&P, should we assume more the same of 3% to 4% on average?","Doug Peterson","Craig, we never signal future pricing. We're happy to talk what we've done in the past which you're exactly right. Historically, we're kind of down about 3% to 4% across the businesses per year but we never want to signal future pricing.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Peter Appert","Thanks, good morning. So Doug there has been some discussion of fee pressure on the index providers and I'm wondering what you're seeing in terms of any flow through to your business because of that.","Doug Peterson","Well there we see that this is going to be an important topic in the industry. It's a complicated topic, because most of the pressure, well a lot of pressure is coming at the higher end, full service active management funds that seems to be where lot of pressure is starting and some of that is going into the lower cost mutual funds in ETF providers.","One of the things that you saw in the last quarter was that BlackRock cut some of it, its ETF pricing. And that one directly could have a small impact on our business because of the way that our pricing is embedded into those -- into those that fee structure at BlackRock. The flip side is if this leads to higher AUM fees, higher AUM, we could actually benefit from this, if the AUMs go up, and we see much higher volume but this is something that we're watching very carefully.","But it is something for the industry to see what will be the evolution of the structure. We believe that our costs generally are very low part of the total cost of managing an ETF or managing a fund. But we are aware that this is an important issue for our customers and we're listening to them and hoping that we can be a part of the solution as they look at how they're going to manage their fee structure.","Rob MacKay","And Peter the only thing I would like to add is that, it is really nothing new. I mean this kind of pressure on fee structures has been going on for a number of years. Unfortunately the growth in AUM, as Doug said, earlier just 500 billion AUMs over 900 last few years it more than offset that kind of pressure.","Peter Appert","Understood. And then Doug just quickly on the Platts business growth has slowed a little bit obviously this year for reasons which I think everyone can understand. Do some of these new product initiatives, the acquisitions et cetera potentially got to drive a re-acceleration in the growth next year, even if the oil environment remains challenging?","Doug Peterson","I don't know for sure if they will be an allowance to really improve our growth dramatically but what we're targeting with the data and analytics business is to find a new source of growth for the business. So think about it in that sense. We think it's an area that it's fragmented. There are a lot of different players out there, we have the right and we have the opportunity to start bringing in new services, new products. So we look at it as a source of growth, we look at it as source of new area which we already have a good grounding in.","And you're right to point out that it is a difficult environment in the oil patch. There are prices are down, if you look at some of the major oil industry clients, their revenues are down by 50% over the last few years. And so they, there is obviously pressure coming from the customer side but we're looking at, if you want to think of it in two ways the diversification of our expertise into some other product areas. And also we hope and believe it could be a source of additional growth.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Andre Benjamin","Hi, good morning. Thanks for getting me in here. I guess on Capital IQ, I was just wondering if you can maybe help frame for us how much revenue comes from data fees. I know that's a growing area that some of your competitors have spoken positively about and any push that you're making to specifically grow that stream relative to the desktop business.","Doug Peterson","Yes. So the data feeds business, we talk about the CapEx you desktop being roughly a $400 million business, but the enterprise feed is another about a $400 million business, a lot of it does same data only sold to uses really their computers, to back offices, someone does wasn't to key in the stock prices at the end of everyday to value the portfolio. So our mainframe feeds their mainframe. So but yes that's been a, it's historically been part of Cap IQ, as we've evolved the name of that segment over time but that's the relative size and it's kind of been a decent grower nothing extraordinary for us over that timeframe.","Andre Benjamin","Got it. And then as you get SNL fully integrated and that's no longer that the main focus I guess if you look about growing the business going forward, is there any potential that you could look to expand your reaching capabilities beyond the traditional banking and research analysts the use of deep data, I know some of your other competitors are looking do that?","Rob MacKay","Let me start then Doug, but just about a premise today if you look at Market Intelligence there is 30% of the business or so comes from outside of Wall Street. So we're talking about corporations, we're talking about consulting firms, talking about accounting firms, talking about governments, universities, so good 30% is already outside of Wall Street. I mean you should want to add any, Doug, there?","Doug Peterson","Yes, I would say that looking at questions slightly from the total business point of view not just SNL Cap IQ the Market Intelligence business. We see that there are -- there is need for more and more Market Intelligence. And as we call it the Central Intelligence for different types of people to make decisions in various ways that require interpretation of market information. So think about all of our businesses that we have now are related to market activities, whether it's fixed income, its equities, its commodities, its loans.","We are a business that has the data and the information around market activities and we provide the benchmarks, the pricing, the data tools et cetera. So that's the way we are thinking about our business and we're trying to drive it by going out into the world to see what's changing when it comes to do with our customer needs, with technology, with FinTech, with how we see the regulatory environment is evolving what's actually happening also in growth and political and economic factors, things like the Brexit.","And so we take all of those external factors and then, hope that we can interpret them appropriately to grow our business because we're delivering the kinds of products, prices, benchmark data etcetera that's the customers actually need to run their businesses.","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. The next question comes from Tim McHugh of William Blair. Your line is now open.","Trevor Romeo","Hi, good morning. This is actually Trevor Romeo in for Tim today. I just have one for you here. Just a follow-up on the high 30s margin target you set for the markets and commodities intelligent segment, the new combined segment. What are some of the incremental changes that you guys will need to make in order to achieve that and do you have a specific timeframe in mind?","Doug Peterson","What I would like to say is that, take that as our first indication, but give us a couple of weeks to send out the more detailed information about the segments and how they, how it's going to be put together. We will provide more on that and I'd prefer to also discuss this after you've seen that information and then on our next call.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Bill Warmington","Good morning everyone and congratulations on a solid quarter and welcome to S&P for Rob.","Rob MacKay","Thank you.","Bill Warmington","First question for you on the index piece of the business. The big asset owners today typically pay fee to the asset manager that includes the fee for the management but then also fee for the index. And I've heard the talk about potentially unbundling that fee meaning that, if you could choose any index and you might be more likely to choose a lower price index. I just curious if that's a realistic risk or is it a risk to the pricing.","Doug Peterson","Today we're seeing a lot of different models that have started cropping up in this industry. But one of the areas which we believe helps our business a lot is that we hold the benchmark, most important global benchmarks the S&P 500, the Dow Jones entire complex of the S&P family of funds and family of indices gives us an important, important set of indices, which end up being part of almost any fund complex or investment complex that anybody ever have.","So we think that there is kind of a -- because of the size and scale of what we have, we end up being part of that discussion no matter what angle you come from. We wouldn't be surprised though given the combination of the Department of Labor fiduciary ruling that came out and some other industry factors, low interest rates, and the low growth environment is another impact the shifting funds that are going into retirement and pensions, et cetera. We won't be surprised if there is a active dialogue that goes on from the industry about fee structures and things like that and we would like to be an active part of that.","Bill Warmington","And so for my second question on the Market Intelligence piece. Capital IQ, I think offers a pretty strong lower priced alternative versus Factset and Bloomberg. And over the past few months, we've been hearing a lot of discussion about cost sensitivity or increased cost sensitivity on the buy side to sell side and just overall Corporate America and I'm just curious if that value proposition is part of what's driving the strong growth within Capital IQ desktops?","Doug Peterson","Partially we have great respect for Factset and Bloomberg. They're great companies and they deliver high value themselves but we also compete with them sometimes head-to-head and sometimes there is substitute product that many times we're delivering to customers that don't even need or even have a Bloomberg or Factset.","So there is a different sorts of customers that we delivered to and what our approach is to show the value of being able to harness the power of so much data and so much analytics in one desktop especially for people that don't need the trading capabilities, it's people that are analysts, risk managers, bankers, investment bankers, regulators, academics, et cetera that need the power of the data, don't necessarily need the instantaneous low latency information that might come with some of the other platforms but that's the way we sell it.","Doug Peterson","So first of all, let me make a couple of closing remarks. I want to thank Rob McKay for having been an absolutely fabulous partners as Interim CFO. He is our Controller, so he doesn't get off the hook, he still has to hang around and sign off on the book. And we're looking forward to welcoming Ewout Steenbergen to our Company in about a week and half and we're pleased that we were able to speak with all of you today. If you have further questions, please follow-up with Chip and we will provide more of some of the answers, which you asked. We will be able to answer, when we issue our information about the new segment and then we look forward to speaking with you again on our next earnings call.

Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of S&P Global should give me a call to better understand the impact of this legislation on the investor and potentially the company. We are aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Jason Feuchtwanger at 212-438-1247.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?","Douglas Peterson","Good morning. Thank you, Chip. Welcome everyone to the call today. Building on the first quarter of 2017, I\u2019m pleased to report another solid quarter of revenue and earnings growth at S&P Global. Our benchmarks, data analytics and essential intelligence continue to be critical components of the global financial landscape.","Let me begin with the second quarter highlights. We obtained strong organic revenue and adjusted operating profit growth in every segment. S&P Dow Jones Indices achieved outstanding revenue growth of 20%. We delivered 330 basis points of adjusted profit margin improvement and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 19%. As a result of our year-to-date performance and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we\u2019re increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a range of $6.15 to $6.30.","We returned $251 million through share repurchases and dividends. We\u2019re introducing a more in-depth disclosure of our capital management philosophy, which Ewout will discuss in a moment. And we intend to launch a $500 million ASR in the next few days that will be completed by the end of October. We continue to believe that reinvesting in our stock represents a great investment and a good use of our cash.","Looking more closely at the financial results. The company reported 2% revenue growth and on an organic basis grew 10%. With a $27 million increase in revenue, we were able to increase adjusted operating profit by $63 million. This can be primarily attributed to the Market and Commodity segment where divestitures drove revenue down by $65 million, yet adjusted operating profit increased $11 million.","The company achieved a 330 basis point improvement in adjusted operating profit margin due to the sale of lower-margin businesses, strong organic revenue growth and productivity initiatives. ForEx had an $8 million unfavorable impact on revenue and a $2 million favorable impact on adjusted operating profit.","The strength of our business model continues to be reflected in our results. We were able to turn 10% organic revenue growth into 19% adjusted EPS growth through the inherent scalable nature of our businesses, productivity improvements and share repurchases.","In a moment, Ewout is going to discuss the results of each of our businesses in more detail. What I\u2019d like to do is provide a bit more color on some of the current and future drivers of our businesses.","Now let me start with bank loan ratings, which have been a growing part of the Ratings business over the past few years, particularly in U.S., but also more recently in Europe. Bank loan ratings are primarily issued on leveraged loans typically rated BB+ or lower.","Both the volume of leveraged loans and the percent of leveraged loans rated by S&P have increased over the past few years. During the second quarter, bank loan revenue of approximately $100 million was a key factor in the revenue growth of the Ratings segment.","As you see from the chart, the longer-term trend for loan ratings has been positive but volatile. This is due to opportunistic loan activity and refinancing driven by attractive spreads for speculative-grade credits. I would encourage all of you who track issuance data not to overlook bank loan rating activity. Otherwise, you\u2019ll have to \u2013 an incomplete picture of a key revenue component of the Ratings business.","When tracking issuance data, we always try to point out that where issuance takes place, which type of issuance and the size of deals makes a difference in the revenue we realize. Global issuance in the second quarter, excluding sovereign debt, decreased 2%.","In the U.S. and Europe, our two most important markets, however, issuance remained flat or grew as a result of sharp increase in structured finance. Geographically, issuance in the U.S. increased 1% in the second quarter with investment-grade decreasing 6%, high-yield declining 20%, public finance down 17% and structured finance increasing 59% due primarily to the strength in CLOs, RMBS and CMBS.","In Europe, issuance decreased 2% in the second quarter with investment-grade declining 10%, high-yield increasing 23% and structured finance increasing 32%, with strength in RMBS, CLOs and covered bonds. In Asia, issue decreased 10%. However, the vast majority of Asian issuance is made up of local China debt that we don\u2019t rate.","Ratings recently published its latest issuance forecast. For 2017, we expect an overall decrease in global issuance of 5%. This compares to the forecast of a 1% decrease that we issued about three months ago. Some of the key changes include industrials and financial services issuance have been reduced primarily due to the expectations for lower Chinese issuance, which is largely unrated.","And structured finance issuance has been increased given year-to-year date strength. Most importantly, you can see that the categories most impactful to our revenue, namely, non-financials, financial services, structured finance and U.S. public finance, are collectively forecast to increase in 2017.","Here\u2019s a new chart that we think you\u2019ll find very informative. It depicts 20 years of outstanding U.S. debt as a percentage of U.S. GDP. Debt is defined as both bonds and bank loans. The light blue represents nonfinancial corporations and the dark blue represents financial corporations.","For the past 20 years, total corporate debt is amounted to roughly 40% of GDP. That means for every $1 of GDP, corporations raise about $0.40 of debt. This ratio is remarkably consistent. The ratio of financial corporate debt to GDP increased rapidly to a peak of about 70% in 2008.","Since that time, financial corporations have reined in their debt levels. And for the past five years, the ratio of debt to GDP has been approximately 40%. We think this chart supports our long-time contention that GDP growth is the fundamental factor correlated with debt levels, and thus issuance.","Turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. At the end of June, we released the annual survey of assets. This chart depicts the highlights of that survey. Most importantly, there are $11.7 trillion in assets globally that track indices managed by S&P Dow Jones Indices. This includes 7.5 trillion in active money that is benchmarked against our indices and 4.2 trillion in passive money that is invested in products indexed to our indices. Numerous indices support the 4.2 trillion.","I\u2019d like to highlight three important categories that should be of interest. Clearly, S&P 500 is the largest of all products with 3 trillion in assets. These assets increased 38% in the past calendar year. Smart Beta, which had 184 billion in assets, is up 26%. And fixed income with 41 billion in assets is up 34%.","Next, I\u2019d like to share with you several new products. The first is the launch of the Ivy ProShares S&P 500 Bond Index fund. This fund is designed to track the index of corporate bonds issued by S&P 500 companies. Ivy ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index Fund was also launched. This fund invested S&P 500 companies with at least 25 years of consecutive dividend growth.","We also published the S&P Dow Jones Indices Carbon Scorecard. This scorecard assesses the carbon efficiency and energy mix alignment of a 2% centigrade climate scenario for major S&P DJI equity benchmarks around the world. The scorecard comes at a turning point in the integration of climate risk and investment opportunities. As countries limit the rise in global temperatures, market participants are looking for benchmarks most suited to the future economy.","And last, we launched the Dow Jones\/BM&F Commodity Index. It\u2019s the first index designed to be a broad measure of the Brazilian commodity futures market. This launch, in conjunction with B3, is part of our development strategy for the commodity derivatives market in Brazil. As you can see, we\u2019re actively pursuing our indices growth objectives in fixed income, ESG and global products.","This quarter, Platts celebrated the 10th anniversary of eWindow. eWindow is an online data entry and communications tool that brings greater speed, transparency and efficiency to Platts\u2019 price assessment. eWindow was constructed by combining Platts\u2019 market-on-close methodology with exchange technology licensed from the Intercontinental Exchange. Today, eWindow operates in more than 100 markets across oil, refined products, petrochemicals and agriculture involving more than 2,000 traders.","Last quarter, we highlighted our efforts in Black Sea wheat. Adding to our growing presence in wheat, today I want to share with you the launch early this week of Australian wheat futures by CME. These contracts will be cash-settled without physical delivery and priced in relation to Platts\u2019 daily assessment of Australian Premium White wheat.","Market Intelligence is also expanding its capabilities. In May, we formed a strategic data agreement to provide transcripts to users of Thomson Reuters desktop platforms. The transcript service includes earnings calls, guidance calls, investor days and annual shareholder meetings. This extends our industry-leading transcript coverage and allows us to better scale this product.","In addition, we launched Portfolio Analytics, a new tool for the small to mid-sized investment management market. This product integrates S&P Global Market Intelligence\u2019s point-in-time data with clients\u2019 own proprietary content. Clients can design custom reports that measure how their selection decisions impact performance compared to benchmarks.","Clients can quickly assess and compare their performance relative to peer funds, exchange-traded funds and indices. And we expanded risk and credit analytics on RatingsDirect to enhance portfolio monitoring and added nonrated entity credit analytics and scores to Xpressfeed.","With that color, let me turn the call over to Ewout, who\u2019ll provide specifics on our business results during the quarter.","Ewout Steenbergen","Thank you, Doug, and good morning to everyone on the call. This morning, I would like to discuss the second quarter results, introduce our updated capital management philosophy and then provide specifics on our increased 2017 guidance.","Doug already discussed the changes in revenue, organic revenue and adjusted operating margin for the company. I would like to point out that the tax rate of 28.9% is below the anticipated full year run rate of 30% to 31%, due primarily to the resolution of tax audits and the discrete tax benefit from stock option exercises. In addition, our ongoing share repurchase program led to a 6.8 million decrease or 3% decline in average diluted shares outstanding.","Net of hedges, foreign exchange rates, had a modest negative impact on the company\u2019s revenue and adjusted operating profit in the second quarter. The bulk of the impact was in the Ratings segment with a $6 million unfavorable impact on revenue. There was hardly any impact to adjusted operating profit from weakness year-over-year in the British pound and euro.","Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. Pre-tax adjustments to earnings totaled to a loss of $13 million in the quarter and included $8 million from write-offs of a PIRA office lease and certain Platts software that was discontinued and replaced using Market Intelligence technology; $5 million of employee severance costs in Market and Commodities Intelligence related to synergy realization. Together, these actions will result in annual savings of approximately $9 million for the next two years and then $7 million per year thereafter. In addition, we excluded $25 million in deal-related amortization expense.","There is another item that I would like to discuss that is not likely to have an impact on our financial statements, but in the spirit of transparency we would like to bring to your attention now and it will also be included in our 10-Q. As you would expect, we are continuously subject to tax examinations in various jurisdictions.","In May 2017, the IRS issued a 30-day letter proposing to increase the company\u2019s federal income tax for the 2015 tax year by approximately $242 million. The proposed increase relates primarily to the IRS-proposed disallowance of claims tax deductions for certain amounts paid in 2015 to settle lawsuits by 19 states and the District of Columbia.","We vigorously disagree with the proposed adjustment and have filed a formal protest with the IRS to contest the matter before the IRS Appeals Office. This development does not materially change our initial assessment of the deductibility of our settlement payments. And since we believe that the likelihood is remote that we will have to make this adjustment, we have not recorded a tax accrual for the state settlements as a result of this matter \u2013 of this letter.","In the second quarter, every business segment contributed to gains in organic revenue. However, the gains in indices were outstanding. The reported revenue decline in Market and Commodities Intelligence was due to several divestitures. Each business segment reported gains in adjusted operating profit growth.","I find it very impressive that despite a loss of earnings associated with asset divestitures, Market and Commodities Intelligence reported a 5% gain in adjusted operating profit as organic growth and synergies more than made up for the lost profitability associated with the divestitures. While Market and Commodities Intelligence delivered remarkable adjusted operating margin improvement, we recorded declines in Ratings and Indices. Declines in operating margin are not something that we take lightly.","The primary reason for the decline is the timing of incentive compensation accruals. Due to our outsized financial performance in the first half of the year, our incentive accruals were much higher than in the second quarter of 2017 than in the second quarter of 2016. In 2016, incentive accruals were weighted more towards the back half of the year. Excluding this difference in the second quarter accruals, the adjusted operating margin of both Ratings and Indices would have increased.","Let me now turn to the individual segment\u2019s performance and start with S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 20%, mostly as ETF, assets under management continued to surge. Adjusted operating profit increased 18% as a result of increased revenue. Adjusted operating margin decreased 90 basis points to 65.1%, as revenue gains were partially offset by increased headcount in commercial and operations to support future growth and the timing of incentive accruals I just discussed.","Asset-linked fees, which are principally derived from ETFs, mutual funds and certain OTC derivatives, experienced the greatest growth in the second quarter, rising 24%, driven by a 34% increase in average ETF AUM. Subscription revenue increased 16% due to growth in data subscriptions, custom indices and the addition of Trucost. Exchange-traded derivative revenue rose 12% with gains in S&P 500 Index options and fixed futures and options activity and mix.","The trend of assets moving into passive investments was again very strong in the second quarter with the exchange-traded products industry reaching net inflows of $148 billion. Year-to-date, these industry net inflows are almost triple the net inflows in the first half of 2016.","The quarter-ending ETF AUM tied to our indices totaled $1,156 billion, up 35% versus the second quarter of 2016. As the chart shows, this was the result of $175 billion of net inflows and $126 billion of market gains over the last 12 months. The $1,156 billion was a new record, surpassing the previous quarterly record of $1,116 billion set on March 31, 2017. The second quarter average AUM associated with our indices increased 34% year-over-year, and this is a better proxy for revenue changes than the quarter-end figures.","Transaction revenue from exchange-traded derivatives improved 12% with increased S&P 500 Index options and fixed futures and options activity and favorable mix more than offsetting declines in activity at the CME equity complex.","Let me now turn to Market and Commodities Intelligence. This segment includes S&P Global Market Intelligence and S&P Global Platts. In the second quarter, reported revenue declined 10% due to recent divestitures. Excluding these divestitures, organic revenue increased 8%.","Despite the loss of earnings associated with divestitures, adjusted operating profit improved 5% due to organic growth and synergies realization. Adjusted operating margin improved 530 basis points, primarily due to the sale of lower-margin businesses, strong organic revenue growth, and SNL integration synergies.","Turning to Market Intelligence. Recent divestitures cloud solid organic revenue growth of 9%. This growth was due in part to an 11% increase in the number of SNL, S&P Capital IQ and RatingsDirect desktop users. As evidenced by continued adjusted margin improvement, we are on track to achieve more than $75 million in run rate synergies by year-end.","In addition to strong financial results, we made great progress on product enhancements as well. Some examples include; advanced towards a beta release of the new Market Intelligence desktop to the Investment Banking sector this fall, added SNL asset-level data to Xpressfeed to complement SNL fundamental data, added private company data for 77,000 Japanese and 2,000 Chinese companies.","Looking more deeply at Market Intelligence revenue, all three components delivered strong revenue growth. Desktop products grew 11% as the growth of the former SNL and S&P Capital IQ desktop products continues to rollout as one commercial offering.","Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 9% as demand for data feeds continues to be robust. Risk Services grew 7%, thanks to low-teens growth of RatingsXpress and high single-digit growth of RatingsDirect. And finally, note that there was $37 million of revenue in the second quarter of 2016 from businesses that were divested.","Platts delivered reasonable organic revenue growth despite difficult commodity markets. Second quarter revenue increased 10%. However, excluding revenue from recent acquisitions, organic revenue increased 4% due to modest growth in subscriptions, bolstered by strong growth in Global Trading Services.","The core subscription business delivered low single-digit revenue growth with gains in petroleum. Global Trading Services mid-teens revenue increase was primarily due to the timing of revenue and strong trading volumes in petroleum, partially offset by weakness in metals.","If you look at Platts\u2019 revenue by its four primary markets, you can see that petroleum and power and gas make up the majority of the business. Platts\u2019 growth this quarter came from petroleum, which benefited from strong global trading activity.","In addition, petrochemicals contributed 6% growth, while both power and gas and metals and agriculture declined 1%. However, gains in agriculture revenue were offset by declines in metals. Please note that there was $11 million of revenue in the second quarter of 2017 from recent acquisitions.","Turning to Ratings. Revenue increased 10% against the toughest quarterly comparison in 2016, including a 1% unfavorable impact from ForEx. Adjusted operating profit increased 8%, while the adjusted operating margin declined 80 basis points to 53.3% due to increased headcount, incentive compensation and investments in productivity. As we have said in the past, we managed the Ratings business on a rolling four quarters basis, and you can see on that basis the adjusted operating margin increased 320 basis points.","Strong transaction revenue led Ratings second quarter revenue growth. Loan transaction revenue increased to 4% from growth in surveillance fees, entity fees, intersegment royalties from Market Intelligence and CRISIL. Transaction revenue increased 15%, primarily from gains in corporate bonds, robust bank loan ratings activity and structured products.","If you look at the Ratings\u2019 revenue by its various markets, you can see the greatest gains were in corporates and structured finance. Bank loan ratings are part of corporates and boosted results in this market. The only market that declined was government due to the 17% decline in U.S. public issuance that Doug mentioned.","Now turning to our capital position. There was little change from the end of the fourth quarter. We continue to have $2.4 billion of cash and $3.6 billion of long-term debt. $1.6 billion of this cash was held outside the United States at the end of the second quarter. Our debt coverage, as measured by adjusted growth leverage to adjusted EBITDA, was 2.0x versus 2.1x at the end of 2016. This is a new metric that I will discuss in a moment.","Year-to-date, free cash flow was $564 million. However, to get a better sense of our underlying cash generation from operations, it is important to exclude the activity associated with divestitures and the after-tax impact of legal settlements. On that basis, year-to-date free cash flow was $635 million. As for return of capital, the company returned $251 million to shareholders in the second quarter, $145 million through repurchasing 1.1 million shares and $106 million in dividends.","At this time, I would like to outline our new capital management philosophy. Let me start with a few broad points. We are continuously analyzing a wide range of internal investments and acquisitions, allocating capital to the highest-returning projects and holding our management team accountable. We\u2019ll continue to return excess capital to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends while maintaining a strong balance sheet.","Internally, we need to focus on the following key points. Ensure that we are responsible stewards of shareholder capital; maintain a rigorous capital allocation framework; demand business line accountability; perpetuate a culture where businesses compete for capital to optimize our portfolio; and continue maximizing organic growth prospects; maintain a capital-light, cash flow-generative business model; and utilize our experience to continue to be disciplined acquirers.","As we think about our capital allocation framework more specifically, we routinely explore and analyze internal and inorganic growth opportunities in order to deliver upon our strategic goals and enhance our competitive positioning. Management conducts an in-depth review of each potential opportunity within a consistent framework. Strategic fit is paramount to all decisions.","This framework includes the following key financial metrics; NPV, cash ROIC, IRR and earnings contribution. Afterwards, each project is followed up with a rigorous post-acquisition review process. We expect our normal course business capital expenditures to be approximately $125 million annually.","For long-term capital return guidance, we expect total payout to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends to be at least 75% of annual free cash flow, excluding certain items. We intend to continue our 44-year track record of steady annual dividend growth and repurchase shares in a disciplined manner. It is important to us that we maintain a prudent financial profile.","To that end, I want to share three key points. We are committed to remain investment-grade rated. We target an average minimum U.S. cash balance of $200 million. Within our current business mix, we target an adjusted growth leverage to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.75 to 2.25. Adjusted growth leverage includes debt, the unfunded portion of pension liabilities, the S&P DJI put option and the expected NPV of operating leases. We are moving to this new metric to be consistent with the way that our primary rating agency evaluates our leverage.","Finally, I want to review our acquisition philosophy. From a strategic priorities perspective, we\u2019ll continue to pursue both skill-driven and tuck-in acquisitions. We\u2019re interested in opportunities that augment our benchmark, proprietary data and tools and analytics capabilities, provide geographic diversification, bolster recurring revenues and\/or provide synergies.","Potential areas of strategic interest by division include; in Ratings, non-U.S. opportunities; in Market Intelligence, expense, risk services and new technologies; in Platts, supply-demand analytics and additional commodity capabilities; and in Index, fixed income, ESG and international indices.","Our specific financial criteria includes; cash ROIC in excess of hurdle rate upon full synergy realization, desire to become EPS-accretive within a reasonable timeframe. And in the event that adjusted leverage exceeds 2.25x, we would expect to return to our stated range within 18 to 24 months.","Now I will review our updated 2017 guidance. Based upon a strong first half and our expectations for the remainder of 2017, we have made several changes to our 2017 guidance. This slide depicts our GAAP guidance and the changes that we have made. Please keep in mind that our guidance reflects current spot market ForEx rates.","This slide shows our updated adjusted guidance. The changes are highlighted on this slide. I\u2019m going to discuss the changes to our adjusted guidance which were as follows. We have increased our organic revenue growth from mid to high single-digit growth to high single-digit growth, with contributions by every business segment.","We have lowered our unallocated expense from a range of $130 million to $140 million down to a range of $130 million to $135 million, driven by continued cost discipline and our ability to tighten the range as the year has progressed. We have increased our operating profit margin guidance from a range of 44.5% to 45.5% to a range of 45% to 46%.","We have lowered interest expense by $5 million to $150 million and we have increased diluted EPS, which excludes deal-related amortization from a prior range of $6 to $6.20 to a new range of $6.15 to $6.30. Overall, this guidance reflects our expectation that 2017 will be another strong year for the company.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions.","Chip Merritt","Thanks, Ewout. Just a couple of instructions for our phone participants. Please press Star 1 to indicate that you wish to enter the queue to ask a question. To cancel or withdraw your question, simply press Star 2. I would kindly ask that you limit yourself to two questions, that\u2019s two questions, in order to allow time for other callers during today\u2019s Q&A session.","If you\u2019ve been listening through a speaker phone but would like to now ask a question, we ask that you lift your handset prior to pressing Star 1 and remain on the handset until your question has been answered. This will ensure better sound quality.","Operator, we\u2019ll now take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. This question comes from Manav Patnaik. Sir, you may now ask your question.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. The first question is just around the Ratings margins again. You mentioned three points; incentive comp, increased headcount and productivity. I was just wondering, on the incentive comp, like, was this an odd quarter compared to prior years, because I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever called that out as an impact? And then on the headcount side of things, where are you increasing the headcount, because it sounds like your competitors are reducing them? So maybe just some color there would be helpful.","Ewout Steenbergen","Good morning, Manav. This is Ewout. Let me give you a little bit more perspective on that development. If you look at incentive compensation accrual in the first half of 2016, the accrual was much lower at a level compared to the first half of this year, and that was directly correlated with the business and the profitability levels in 2016, which was at a lower level, as you will recall, compared to 2017.","So the majority of the difference in expenses and therefore the impact on margins for Ratings year-over-year is driven by that increased level of incentive compensation accrual year-over-year. We expect that to normalize in the second half of this year. So this should correct itself in the second half of 2017, but we see this more as really a timing effect than that it is an effect of absolute expense increase.","With respect to headcount, I would consider that more a smaller part of the increase that has more to do with growth of the business, investments in efficiency, technology. You know that we are investing in Project Simplify, which would help the workflow and efficiency of the Ratings business going forward. But overall, that\u2019s a smaller part of the overall expense increase and had a smaller impact on the margin this quarter.","Manav Patnaik","Okay, got it. That\u2019s helpful. And by the way, thank you very much for the capital allocation details and so forth. I guess, maybe we were expecting it later in the year than now. But maybe for you and Doug, does that \u2013 and you obviously have the 500 million ASR you put out in the press release. Does that mean your pipeline maybe for the larger deals is not as active, or should I be reading anything into that other than maybe just timing?","Douglas Peterson","No, you shouldn\u2019t be reading anything other into that. As we gave you in the outline of the capital allocation framework, we have a set of criteria that we look at for our businesses to continue to grow and invest. We\u2019re making excellent progress on our performance objectives that we have of growth and excellence across all of the businesses, as you can see, playing out from our product innovation and business innovation as well as financial results. So you shouldn\u2019t read anything into that.","We\u2019re always taking a look at what would be ways that we could enhance our growth, whether it\u2019s organic or acquisitions. What you should really read into it is that when Ewout came onboard, we had a goal to refine our capital allocation philosophy. It was something that was taken into account by our management. Ewout\u2019s done a great job getting that done as well as with our Board of Directors to ensure that we\u2019re all aligned on how we want to invest for growth in the future.","Manav Patnaik","Got it. Thanks a lot, guys.","Douglas Peterson","Thank you.","Ewout Steenbergen","Thanks, Manav.","Operator","Thank you, Manav. The next question comes from Peter Appert of Piper Jaffray. Sir, you may ask your question.","Peter Appert","Thank you. Good morning. Doug, I\u2019m just wondering, in the context of margins being down slightly in the Ratings and indices business, does that suggest that perhaps we\u2019re getting to the point where margins have been optimized? Really asking in terms of \u2013 just trying to understand if there\u2019s much more upside to come.","Douglas Peterson","Let me answer it from the point of view that we felt that, over time the best driver of our margin improvement has been our growth of our top line. We are still looking towards growth across all of the businesses. We obviously have views about what will happen in the markets related to the European situation, global economic factors. We\u2019re looking at what we think will be the impact of the Federal Reserve and ECB changes to interest rate policy. So top line growth is always going to be one of the most important drivers of that.","But let me assure you that we remain committed to looking at how we can run the business more efficiently. There are ways that we can still drive improvement in productivity in our businesses directly. And as Ewout mentioned, we\u2019re doing a lot more at the unallocated expense and the corporate center to see how we can also deliver a more effective approach to managing the companies and how we allocate central expenses. So let me reassure you that we\u2019re committed to continued productivity across all of the businesses.","Peter Appert","Thanks, Doug. And then relevant to one part of your comments there, your assessment please of the Ratings outlook for the second half?","Douglas Peterson","Yes. Ratings outlook for the second half, well, first of all, in the first half, it was actually a very choppy quarter. It was one where, despite looking at kind of the smooth averages across the board in the U.S.; industrials, financial services, public finance were all down. In Europe, the only sector that was up were corporates. Financial services were down. Asia was down. But what really came through was structured finance. Structured finance was very strong in the quarter, in particular loans and CMBS. And there was also resurgence of activity in Europe of CMBS and ABS. So you saw a real offset on the corporate side, which was weak, offset by structured finance.","And then part of what you saw \u2013 one of the first slides I presented was the loan slide because loans were a really important story of the first half of the year. The second half of the year, we\u2019ve seen a pretty decent start to the second quarter, especially in loans. Again, loans could be slowing down. And then across the board, we\u2019ve been seeing activity. You know that July and August are always slow months. But talking to the investment banks, looking at what the issuance could be coming, we still look at the second half. And based on the guidance that we gave today, we\u2019ve built in our outlook for the second half on what we think would be a moderately active second half of the year.","Peter Appert","Great. Thanks, Doug.","Douglas Peterson","Thanks, Peter.","Operator","Thank you, Peter. The next question comes from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Ma\u2019am, your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","[Audio Gap] so 2Q margin within Market and Commodities Intelligence was similar to the margin last quarter at about 37.5%. How should we be thinking about the progression from here to your stated target of mid to high 30s in that segment? Is it mainly from SNL synergies? Will there be core expansion as well? And then, I guess based on that, is there upside to your current target?","Ewout Steenbergen","Well, let me give you a couple of perspectives what we see happening in the segments. First of all, indeed, we expect to continue with realizing the SNL synergies. We are on track to achieve the 75 million of run-rate synergies by the end of this year. And as you know, we have a total commitment of 100 million of synergies, so another 25 million of synergies to be achieved then post 2017. So we\u2019re very well on track and we think those will help to continue to deliver the margins.","Secondly, if you look at Market Intelligence, the business is seeing very favorable growth. I particularly like the 11% growth in desktop users. That\u2019s a very impressive number. It\u2019s very clear that there is a high demand for our desktop products. It\u2019s an attractive product priced at an attractive level, so it\u2019s doing very well in the markets. So a combination of the top line growth plus efficiency and synergies, we believe, overall that should help this particular segment. If you look at the margin improvement of 530 basis points year-over-year, we think that\u2019s overall a very impressive result.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then just on the index business, I want to know relative to the average fee rate you\u2019re charging across S&P-linked funds, if you\u2019re starting to see any pressure there and maybe if you could ballpark a magnitude. And then just how do you think about the potential offset between increasing flows but a potentially declining fee rate?","Douglas Peterson","So as we\u2019ve said in the past that there\u2019s always downward pressure in this marketplace, but because of the elasticity involved and the massive surge of flows that takes place, you really don\u2019t see it apparent in our numbers. And we think that will continue.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Douglas Peterson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie Research. You may now ask your question.","Hamzah Mazari","Good morning. The first question is just if you could remind us how much of the overall business currently is subscription? Is that still 60%? And as you look long term, should that number get bigger towards like a 75% range? Just help us think about the portfolio evolving to more of a subscription model as the businesses that are not Ratings start to grow.","Ewout Steenbergen","This is Ewout. Let me give you some numbers. I\u2019ll give you some perspective on this. You know that in Ratings, we have not really a distinction between subscription and non-subscription. We more look at a distinction between transaction and non-transaction. Transaction was a little bit more than 50% this quarter. That was due to the high issuance levels and the bank loans. So if you look at transaction, it was 394 million of revenue versus 353 million for non-transaction.","If you look at Market Intelligence, there as you know the majority of our revenue is subscription-based, so almost 90% is subscription-based versus non-subscription-based. And the same applies for Platts. It\u2019s almost 90% subscription versus 10% is non-subscription. Moving to the S&P Dow Jones Indices. There the subscription is approximately 20% of the overall revenue base. So in other words, it depends a bit segment by segment.","Douglas Peterson","Let me add though that in S&P Dow Jones Indices that about 60% of our revenue is AUM-based. We think \u2013 we don\u2019t think of that necessarily as subscription revenue and clearly it is subject to volumes and could be subject to changes in market levels as well as flows into and out of ETFs and funds. But that\u2019s also \u2013 AUM-based is different than transaction-based revenue. Once you\u2019ve locked in a contract, those contracts could go on for a long time. So even though that might be categorized as transaction revenue, we think of it \u2013 of its own category, AUM-based revenue.","Hamzah Mazari","That\u2019s very helpful. And then second question just on capital allocation philosophy, which you gave a lot of detail on. Is it fair to say that you do not mind not being investment-grade to do a larger deal and then bring leverage down 18 to 24 months, or do you have to be investment-grade even when doing a larger deal? Thank you.","Ewout Steenbergen","Hamzah, the answer on your question is no. We would like to stay investment-grade as we have stated in the prepared remarks. We are today rated BBB+. We have given a specific range in terms of the adjusted leverage ratio of 1.75 to 2.25. We think where we are today is an efficient place to play within the overall leverage curve. So no, there is no intention with respect to going to below investment-grade as a company. On the contrary, we have made an explicit commitment in this capital philosophy to say we would like to remain investment-grade.","What we have said is that it could be for a larger acquisition where we will use our balance sheet that we could increase our leverage to be higher than the 2.25 level for a certain period of time, but that we then would be committed to bring our self back into the range in a period of 18 to 24 months. That is usually an approach that is acceptable by the ratings agencies so you don\u2019t get penalized for that as long as you have that explicit commitment to bring yourself back into your range in the period of 18 to 24 months. So that particular situation should not create a situation that we would be downgraded to below investment-grade as a company.","Hamzah Mazari","Understood, very helpful. Thanks so much.","Ewout Steenbergen","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS. You may ask your question.","Alex Kramm","Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to continue on the capital allocation here for a second. I guess a two-part question. One, if you look at the ASR that you just announced and you look at the cash on hand and the minimums that you want in the U.S., it seems like maybe you\u2019re raising a little bit of debt for that and you might be pushing up to the high end of the I guess leverage range. So maybe just talk about that.","And then related to that, if you think about the 75% of I guess free cash flow that you want to return in dividends and share repurchases, is that a hard number? Meaning if you do a big deal, will you still be basically doing those buybacks or could you actually get rid of that buyback for a year or so for a big deal, or will you always return that cash in buybacks?","Ewout Steenbergen","Good morning, Alex. Two excellent questions. The first question with respect to the ASR, indeed, if you look at the available cash at the end of the second quarter, we said there\u2019s 500 million of cash in the U.S. and 1.9 outside of the U.S. We\u2019re announcing an ASR of 500 million, but we don\u2019t need to add any leverage to do so.","And the reason is, as you have seen, our free cash flow generation in the first half of this year was just over 600 million. We have a total free cash flow generation guidance for this year of 1.6 or more than 1.6, so we expect to generate over 1 billion of free cash flow in the second half of this year. So just the normal cash flow generation over the next period will be sufficient to keep us above the minimum U.S. cash balance. So in other words, there is not a need to add some leverage in order to fund this ASR of 500 million.","With respect to your second question, we would say in normal course of business where we do tuck-in acquisitions, smaller inorganic deals, we believe that we should be able to do that with the 25% of free cash flow that has so far not been earmarked as return to shareholders. Plus we have some room between where we are today with respect to our leverage and the 2.25. So we have sufficient room to maneuver with respect to tuck-in or smaller, smaller deals.","If we speak about larger transformational deals, as we have said, then we are willing to exceed the 2.25 range and bring ourselves back into that range over a period of 18 to 24 months. In that case, it could be that we need to move away from that 75% free cash flow return target. But then for a period of 18 to 24 months, we bring ourselves back in line with our leverage range.","So I would say, normal course of business, 75% \u2013 at least 75% of free cash flow commitment to return to shareholders should be absolutely a commitment that we should be able to achieve. Only at very large kinds of deals where we exceed our leverage range, in that case there could be a possibility that for 18 to 24 months, we have to move away from this particular objective.","Alex Kramm","Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then second topic real quick on the Market Intelligence side. Now that you break out the components a little bit more, the risk services is something that I continue to look at. And I would say one thing. When you look at your primary competitor, that business continues to be much smaller than what they disclosed and there might be differences of course. But their growth rate also continues to outpace yours. So just wondering what you\u2019re doing there, if that\u2019s a big focus, if you could do anything better there because it seems like that should be an area of upside.","Douglas Peterson","It is an area of upside. Thank you for the question. We\u2019re putting a major focus on that area. We think that it fits well with what is the global landscape of a changing regulatory environment, the kind of risk environment that\u2019s out there as well as the intensity coming from regulators, from shareholders, et cetera, on looking at better tools for managing risk. Our business is substantially different. We have a very different business.","We have a \u2013 our largest component of that business is the redistribution of Ratings intellectual property and we also have businesses that were developing models and risk metrics as well as some credit estimates, et cetera. We look at this as an area of growth. But from the point of view of a comparison to one of the competitors I assume you\u2019re talking about, it\u2019s a very, very different business mix.","Alex Kramm","All right, fair enough. Thank you.","Douglas Peterson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. You may now ask you question.","Mike Reid","Hi, guys. This is Mike Reid on for Joe. I appreciate you taking the question. Do you believe there\u2019s any pull forward into the period in Ratings or there could be any more pull forward from 2018 into \u2013 possible into 2017?","Douglas Peterson","Thanks, Mike. Thanks for the question. There\u2019s always potentially some pull forward, but at the same time once issue \u2013 once an issue has been issued, the debt that\u2019s out there becomes outstanding debt. The closest proxy I could give you to a pull forward is discussed in our global refinancing study that was just issued. We looked at the total amount of debt which is outstanding that\u2019s going to be maturing in the next 5.5 years, between now and the end of 2022.","The total amount has actually increased. It\u2019s gone up by about 3% since a year ago when we issued this study. The amount of debt which is maturing in 2018 has gone down a little bit, about 3%. So that\u2019s about as close as I could get to of what you could maybe categorize as pull-through or pull forward, which is \u2013 it\u2019s maybe there\u2019s a decrease a little bit in 2018 debt.","Beyond that, we always see debt maturing depending on different schedules that come in place. We see people making refinancing decisions or new financing decisions based on what\u2019s happening in the markets. I don\u2019t want to go on too long, but let me just mention that our contention has always been that the two most important drivers to issuance are GDP growth. And then also, obviously issuance is driven by spreads.","Spreads have been very attractive. The high-yield spreads were at 431 at the end of the second quarter. Our investment-grade is at 162. And both of those came down substantially from a year, year and a half ago when in high yield they\u2019re even as high 836 basis points is the spread. Anyway, so we look at this very carefully.","We think that even if there was a pull forward, it gets \u2013 it remains in the system. It\u2019s debt that could always be refinanced again at some point. And the only indicator I\u2019ve got \u2013 and I would recommend that you speak with Chip if you want to look at that study on the global refinancing study. There\u2019s a slight decrease in maturities in 2018. That\u2019s about as close as I could get to a statistic that could see if there\u2019s any pull forward.","Mike Reid","Got it. And then just a quick one on the margins. On the Ratings business, without the incentive accrual, you said it would be up. Did you estimate how many basis points and what kind of expansion it would have been without the incentive accrual?","Ewout Steenbergen","We are not quantifying that but we can reconfirm that indeed excluding the change in incentive compensation, margins would have gone up in Ratings year-over-year.","Chip Merritt","As well as in the indices business, same thing applies. If we eliminate that year-over-year increase in incentive comp, that margins would have been up in indices year-over-year as well for the quarter.","Mike Reid","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Douglas Peterson","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Craig Huber of Huber Research. Sir, you may ask your question.","Craig Huber","Yes. My first question, for roughly last year and a half, you\u2019ve been moving away from subscription or non-transaction revenues within your Ratings business more to transaction-oriented and had some success with them. I\u2019m just kind of wondering how much more is left on that endeavor.","Douglas Peterson","Thanks, Craig. So we have been moving towards that. But the flipside is that we see a very critical part of our business model are those longer-run, long-term relationships. It\u2019s valuable for us to have an approach where some of our fees and transactions are coming in through more stable, long-term relationship approach. But we feel that we\u2019ve built excellent relationships with our customer base.","We\u2019re showing how we can deliver long-term value to them. And that overall we think that the mix and the change of how we\u2019re going, we think that there \u2013 we could be achieving at some point a stability in the mix. But when it comes to what we deliver, it\u2019s critical that we show our customers the kind of value that we\u2019re creating, the kind of value that we\u2019re delivering.","Craig Huber","And also could you talk a little bit further about your outlook in the second half for both corporate finance as well as structured finance ratings, your outlook there for the second half of the year? Anything materially different we should be aware of in your mind?","Douglas Peterson","Yes. So as you saw in the first half of the year, there was a lot of \u2013 there was some really big shifts in the mix. We do see pretty active pipelines for structured finance products given the rates, given the spreads. There\u2019s a lot of liquidity. You still have quantitative easing in Europe that is sucking up a lot of assets. So we see a strong pipeline for structured finance.","Auto loans have slowed down a little bit. There have been some slowness there, but credit cards are picking up as well as CMBS activities. So on the structured side, on the traditional ABS side, we see strong pipeline, CMBS as well. RMBS, as you know, had a big uptick in the quarter but from such a tiny base that any uptick was going to look like a large percentage. We don\u2019t see in the long run a lot of activity in RMBS until there is a stronger approach to GSE reform.","On the corporate and financial institutions side, corporates we\u2019ve seen less activity in the second \u2013 first and second quarter than we had seen last year. There is some interest in the U.S. in the \u2013 in a couple of sectors. Oil and gas, we\u2019ve seen some pickup there. Financial institutions are going to depend very importantly globally on capital rules and the shift to TLAC. In the long term, the banks are going to have to continue to increase their capital buffers.","But there is a slight shift in the financial institutions market in the U.S. towards capital return. So as we see the large financial institutions here move towards capital return, that might temper somewhat issuance of the financial institution sector. Finally, on public finance, our outlook for public finance is pretty muted for the second half of the year. There is no major maturities that are coming up and we don\u2019t see any of the major jurisdictions running out and doing issuance.","Craig Huber","Sorry, high-yield and investment-grade, talk a little bit further about that, if you would, in the second half, your outlook there.","Douglas Peterson","Yes. For the \u2013 what we saw in the first half of the year in terms of investment-grade, investment-grade was down in the U.S. It was down in Europe. It was down in Asia. And high yield was also down in the U.S., but it was up pretty dramatically in Europe, over 20%. We\u2019re expecting that high yield will \u2013 if I look at \u2013 I don\u2019t necessarily have a good pipeline call on high yield, but if I look at the rates, rates are still very attractive.","The base rate is attractive. Base rate is \u2013 even though it\u2019s up over a year ago at around 230, the 10-year yield, the spread is down over 150, 200 basis points, which means that the all-in cost on high yield is very attractive. So if I look at the rate scenario and I look at kind of the growth that\u2019s taking place in the economy, high yield could be an attractive area this year, but so far \u2013 I mean, the second half of the year. But so far this year, with the exception of Europe, high yield has not really been that strong.","Chip Merritt","Thanks, Craig.","Craig Huber","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Craig. We will now take our final question from Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo Securities. Sir, you may ask your question.","William Warmington","Good morning, everyone. So my question for you is on SNL and Capital IQ. What kind of reception are you getting from clients on the bundled enterprise pricing strategy? And are you seeing any competitive response from the other industry players?","Douglas Peterson","Well, first of all, let me mention that one of the things that we find has become very compelling about the business model and the combination of SNL and Cap IQ is it allows us to approach a very diverse set of users. We\u2019re able to provide value and bring very interesting analytics and data to financial institutions, to insurance companies, to regulators, to corporates. So we have a very wide group, buy side, sell side, et cetera.","We also have a very different type of value proposition for different users. We have risk managers, portfolio managers, bankers, sales people, et cetera. And that kind of diversification across different types of users from a pure user point of view as well as different types of industries has given us the kind of growth that you\u2019ve seen.","The reception to our new approach has been very positive. There are organizations which see a lot of value being delivered through our enterprise-wide pricing. We\u2019re still going through an approach to rolling that out. And very importantly, as we mentioned, we have a new Market Intelligence platform, which, during this quarter was previewed with our own internal users.","And during the third quarter into the fourth quarter, we\u2019re going to be getting a beta version out to be delivering it early next year. We think that that will also allow us to see the full value of the integration of SNL and Cap IQ. But given the diversification of our client base, diversification of users, the value proposition that we\u2019re delivering, we\u2019re very pleased with the progress.","William Warmington","Okay. And then for my second question, just wanted to ask about index M&A opportunities. It seems you\u2019ve got a nice mega trend there with the move to passive, really strong margins. It seems like if you could find something, the cost synergies would be significant. Are there opportunities out there in the index field?","Douglas Peterson","Let me take that. There are a few here and there. Obviously, you should assume that if there\u2019s something out there, we\u2019re looking at it. And we gave you some of the themes that we would be interested in looking at or adding to our value, whether it\u2019s fixed income, it\u2019s ESG, it has to do with global expansion. So those are the types of themes that we\u2019d be interested in adding to our portfolio.","William Warmington","Got it. Well, thank you very much.","Douglas Peterson","Thanks, Bill.","Chip Merritt","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Thank you. We have three more questions on queue. And the next question comes from Tim McHugh of William Blair. Sir, you may ask your question.","Stephen Sheldon","Hi. It\u2019s Stephen Sheldon on for Tim this morning. Thanks for taking our questions. First, for Platts, you talked about low single-digit growth in the subscription portion. Can you provide some color on what trends you\u2019re seeing recently within subscriptions and the impact that prior contract renewals may be having?","Douglas Peterson","Yes. Stephen, this is Doug. On Platts, we feel like our 4% growth has actually been good compared to the underlying market dynamics. As you know, the price of oil has been generally low, a lot lower than what people had originally forecast a few years ago, settling right now around $50 a barrel for Brent. We think that compared to what we\u2019ve seen in some of our competitors and other parts of the information market, 4% growth has been good. It\u2019s a combination of new penetration as well as what you\u2019ve seen with renewals.","We do obviously always understand that when we provide \u2013 when we go into renewal discussions that our customers are going through sometimes tough times and they need to look at how they\u2019re going to manage their costs effectively. And so we have a value proposition that we deliver. We work with our customers very carefully to ensure that they understand that value proposition, provide potentially new products and services, new approach to pricing. But those discussions and negotiations have been going quite well and that\u2019s also reflected in the growth rates that we showed today.","Stephen Sheldon","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then I guess second within indices, the expense base has been a little volatile over the last few quarters. And you talked some about the impact of incentive accruals this quarter. But can you talk about how we should think about that expense base as we look into the second half of the year? Thanks.","Ewout Steenbergen","If we look at the expense base of indices compared to a year ago, there are a couple of elements that drive the difference. First of all, this year we have the inclusion of Trucost. You know that we did that acquisition of Trucost last year, so that is an addition that you have to take into account. Secondly, there is that difference in incentive compensation, which we believe is a timing matter and should self-correct in the second half of this year.","And then thirdly, as you will recall, last year \u2013 in the second half of last year, we added a third data center, so that is a step-up cost that is not in the comparable period in 2016. So again, in the second half of this year, there should not be a difference anymore because that is a onetime step-up cost and that will be in the same period on a comparable basis. So those are the main differences year-over-year. If you look at the business-as-usual expenses, those are going up at a relatively low percentage. So that is what you should normally expect going forward again from the indices expense base.","Stephen Sheldon","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Sir, you may ask your questions.","Henry Chien","Good morning. Thanks for squeezing us in. It\u2019s Henry Chien calling for Jeff. Just a question on the Market Intelligence. The really strong growth in enterprise and desktop, I was wondering if you could share just some color on what\u2019s driving that, whether it\u2019s any improvement in your end markets or clients or anything internally that you\u2019re doing or new sales or any sort of color to understand the trend there. Thanks.","Douglas Peterson","Good morning, Henry. It\u2019s a combination of factors. I touched on a couple of them before. It\u2019s the diversification of our user base. It\u2019s also the ongoing shift to a pricing model which provides an enterprise-wide view. The enterprise-wide view allows us to have a much wider user base as opposed to a per-seat type of a pricing model. And through that, we can determine and show the kind of value that we\u2019re delivering. And organizations understand the kind of value we\u2019re delivering. So we feel that it\u2019s a combination of all of those factors and we\u2019re pleased with the progress and look forward to reporting more as we go through the rest of the year.","Henry Chien","Got it, okay. That\u2019s helpful. And really appreciate the capital allocation framework. Just wanted to touch a little bit on the transformative or larger acquisitions. I was wondering if you can share any thoughts on what kind of situation that would likely be or any thoughts of what would \u2013 what kind of criteria would lead to a transformative or a very large acquisition? Thanks.","Ewout Steenbergen","Henry, good morning. This is Ewout. Obviously, I cannot speculate on a scenario like that. But what you should see in terms of essence of our capital philosophy is the following. On the one hand, very significant commitment to returning capital to our shareholders from our ongoing free cash flow generation, so at least 75%. It could be more if we don\u2019t need the remaining 25% for certain growth opportunities.","But then to have a prudent balance sheet and a balance sheet that has flexibility in case of a large transformation kind of M&A situation. But of course, we are not predicting that. That is just a prudent balance sheet we think is the right approach for the company. So we have tried to strike a balance in our management \u2013 capital management philosophy, and I think that\u2019s the key takeaway you should see from what we have presented to you today.","Henry Chien","Okay. Thanks so much.","Ewout Steenbergen","Thanks, Henry.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our final question from Vincent Hung of Autonomous. Sir, you may ask your question.","Vincent Hung","Hi. Just on leverage again. If you were to do an acquisition, how far could you go beyond 2.25x?","Ewout Steenbergen","Well, I\u2019m not going to provide you with a specific number on that, Vincent, as you understand. But I think you can understand if we speak about 18 to 24 months of cash generation, the commitment of dividends that we will, of course, not back away from, how much of that in cash is available to bring ourselves back into that leverage range and how much that would mean. So I think you have all the components to calculate that particular number.","Vincent Hung","Okay. And just lastly, you\u2019ve called out data feeds as a strong driver of growth in recent quarters. Could you just give us some color here on the drivers of demand, the new customers? And how much of that is kind of pricing?","Douglas Peterson","Can you repeat the question? In which particular area --","Chip Merritt","Data feeds in Market Intelligence. He\u2019s asking why data feeds in Market Intelligence had been strong, new clients and that sort of thing.","Douglas Peterson","I don\u2019t have the numbers to give you. I\u2019d ask you to go back to Chip later to see if we can get you any further details on it. But I can tell you from the point of view of what\u2019s attractive about the data feeds, it\u2019s that there\u2019s definitely a move across our broader customer base towards more automated tools, towards ways to build systems that take advantage of direct data feeds into systems. So think about it as machine-to-machine delivery, where we can provide data feeds that go right into other systems.","It\u2019s an area that is growing. We think that it\u2019s an area that the kind of added value that we bring, it\u2019s beyond just \u2013 one of the reasons data feeds \u2013 I think the better word is it\u2019s highly value-added data that we\u2019re feeding. It\u2019s not raw data. It\u2019s not commoditized data. The kinds of things that we\u2019re providing bring a lot of value that get embedded in the workflow. And data feeds are actually a really, really critical part of our business model because the more things get embedded, the more sticky they become.","Chip Merritt","And one other thing I\u2019d like to add is that SNL, with all the fabulous capabilities they had, they didn\u2019t have a data feed business. So we mentioned earlier in the call, in the brief prepared remarks, we\u2019re just now beginning to launch some of SNL\u2019s capabilities through our data feeds business within Market Intelligence, which is kind of exciting for our customers.","Vincent Hung","Thanks.","Douglas Peterson","Well, thank you very much. Let me just close with a couple of comments. First of all, thank you everyone for joining the call and for all of your questions. We\u2019re very pleased with our strong start to the year, but clearly there\u2019s more to do. We look forward to delivering on our growth in innovation and growth in excellent commitments. We obviously want to continue to drive forwards on productivity and continuous improvement initiatives.","And I\u2019m very pleased that Ewout has been able to put in place a capital allocation framework and we will see during the year how we\u2019re going to be talking to you more about that capital allocation framework when it\u2019s live. So we look forward to seeing you next quarter.","Operator","That concludes this morning\u2019s call. A PDF version of the presented slides is available now for downloading from investor.spglobal.com.

We will open the conference to questions-and-answers after the presentation, and instructions will follow at that time. To access the webcast and slides, go to investor.spglobal.com. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce Mr. Chip Merritt, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for S&P Global. Sir you may begin","Chip Merritt","Good morning. Thanks for joining S&P Global's earnings call. Presenting on this morning's call are Doug Peterson, President and CEO; and Ewout Steenbergen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This morning, we issued a news release with our first quarter 2019 results. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules they can be downloaded at investor.spglobal.com.","In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we're providing adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the corporation's operating performance between periods and to view the corporation's business from the same perspective as management's. The earnings release contains exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measures and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.","Before we begin, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements. Except for historical information, the matters discussed in the teleconference may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 including projections, estimates and descriptions of future events.","Any such statements are based on current expectations and current economic conditions, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements.","In this regard, we direct listeners to the cautionary statements contained in our Form 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and other periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.","I would also like to call your attention to a European Regulation. Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of S&P Global should give me a call to better understand the impact of this legislation on the investor and potentially the company.","We're aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask the questions from the media be directed to Jason Feuchtwanger at 212-438-1247.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?","Doug Peterson","Thank you, Chip. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. 2019 began on shaky footing on the heels of the volatility uncertainty in the first quarter. The markets have come a long way since the depths of December. The main development in the past quarter has been the recovery of both equity and debt markets. In the meantime, our baseline forecast is slower, but healthy growth for 2019 remains intact.","But the most notable change has been a coordinated stand down by major central banks and across the board shift in monetary policy bias from gradual tightening to neutral. Markets have responded very positively, although risks related to politics and trade still linger.","Our subscription businesses, Market Intelligence and Platts led revenue growth in the first quarter as it took several weeks in January for markets, and more importantly ETF AUM and debt issuance to recover.","Let me review some of the highlights from the quarter. Market Intelligence led all segments with 8% organic revenue growth. We achieved a 40 basis point improvement in adjusted operating profit margin, and as I will show in a few moments an even larger increase in our trailing four quarter figure. We continued the long track record of reducing average diluted shares outstanding, with the decline of six million shares. Based primarily on a lower tax rate and a lower share count, we delivered 5% adjusted diluted EPS growth.","In a period when markets weren't ideal, we were pleased to still be able to grow adjusted diluted EPS. We generated approximately $306 million in free cash flow excluding certain items in a seasonally low cash flow quarter. We're reaffirming 2019 adjusted guidance. And finally, we launched two landmark ESG offerings that I'll review in a few minutes.","Revenue is largely unchanged versus the prior period as the decline in Ratings revenue is offset by growth in the other three segments. Our adjusted operating profit increased 1%, and adjusted operating profit margin increased 40 basis points to 47.3%. But please recall, we measure and track adjusted margins on a trailing four-quarter basis, which increased 230 basis points. In addition, we continued to reduce shares outstanding, which contributed to the 5% increase in adjusted diluted EPS.","Each quarter, we take an opportunity to highlight key drivers to our business and important projects underway. This quarter, let's start with the data feeds business within Market Intelligence. When most investors think about Market Intelligence, they think about the Capital IQ or Market Intelligence desktop. Data management solutions and rating express, however, offer products that are ingested by our customers as data feeds. This data feed business has grown about 11% annually for the last two years and is on track to deliver revenue of more than $600 million this year. Historically, data feeds have primarily been made up of RatingsXpress which is the reselling of ratings information Compustat and CUSIP along with other offerings including GICS, cross-reference services and earnings estimates.","In the past year, we have had a 40% increase in the number of data packages available through our data feeds. These have included alternative data such as machine-readable transcripts, Panjiva shipping data and SNL asset-level data. We expect that Trucost ESG data, transcript sentiment scores and other unique data sets in the near future. The key is to deliver unique data to our customers in the form of which they need it.","Now turning to Ratings. During the first, quarter global bond issuance decreased 3% with mixed performance in various geographies and asset classes. If we also include all bank loan ratings volume, total global issuance declined 13%. In the U.S., bond issuance declined 7% as investment grade decreased 8%, high yield increased 6%, public finance improved 17% and structured finance declined 20% with drops in CLOs, ABS and CMBS partially offset by gains in RMBS.","In Europe, bond issuance decreased 9% as investment grade decreased 13%, high yield declined 26% and structured finance increased 10%, due to strength in covered bonds, a category where we have very little presence. In Asia, bond issuance increased 12%.","Last quarter, we introduced this chart to attempt to track debt issuance and global cash balances of those companies with the most overseas cash at the end of 2017. We're pleased that the cash balances of these companies continued to decline and that the issuance among these companies is showing signs of recovery after an anemic 2018.","The latest 2019 global issuance forecast is largely unchanged from the previous forecast. Excluding international public finance, which has minimal impact on our financial results, issuance is expected to decrease less than 1%. Leverage loan activity has become an important source of revenue as these loans are increasingly rated. This chart depicts new leverage loan volume for the past six years and excludes repricing and amend-to-extend volume. First quarter volume is down 26%, primarily due to less M&A activity as well as a dramatic reduction in leveraged loan fund assets.","This chart shows that for the past 23 weeks, U.S. leverage loan funds have experienced significant outflows. In fact, since peaking at $109 billion in October 2018, loan funds have had net outflows totaling over $25 billion. Investing in leverage loans is more appealing when rates were rising because loans have variable rates.","Now that expectations for rate increase have subsided, high-yield debt looks relatively more attractive. Remember when doing your analysis, leverage loan activity is not included in bond issuance data. And so our bank loan ratings revenue decreased in the first quarter to $67 million versus $99 million in the first quarter of 2018.","During Investor Day, we introduced the framework Powering the Markets of the Future, including six foundational capabilities. We use this framework to set our goals and allocate resources. During our fourth quarter call, I shared projects underway in each of these categories with particular emphasis on global with our Ratings opportunity in China.","Let me start there and then highlight some new opportunities under innovation and customer orientation. After receiving approval to enter the domestic Chinese bond market in January, our official launch has then took place on March 26. We hosted a half-day seminar in Beijing with 170 participants from issuing companies, fixed income investors, banks and other participants in China's financial markets. This was an opportunity to showcase our new team as well as our strong commitment to bring more transparency and insights to China's financial markets, also outlining a vision that goes beyond our Ratings business and across all of our divisions.","ESG is a major focus in the areas of customer orientation and innovation. Our ESG efforts at S&P Global span every business segment. In 2019, we anticipate ESG revenue will approach $50 million. We recognize that different clients have different needs and are trying to tailor products specific to those needs. To that end, we have created the ESG data factory to centralize the data collected across the company which can be used in any of our ESG offerings. This ensures consistency of inputs across the various products as well as scale.","We're expanding on our ESG heritage in S&P Dow Jones Indices. 20 years ago, we launched the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices, arguably the best known ESG indices in the market. We're now introducing an enhanced ESG scoring methodology designed for the new S&P 500 ESG Index and the upcoming country-specific and regional ESG indices. The scores are used as inputs to evaluate companies in the indices.","The S&P DJI ESG scores are available to the market as a stand-alone product and can be used as a tool for a broad range of research, indexing and investment purposes. The first of the new ESG indices to launch is the S&P 500 ESG Index. An increasing number of investors require indices that are aligned not only with their investment goals, but also their individual and institutional values. The S&P 500 ESG Index is constructed with both of these in mind.","The S&P 500 ESG Index targets 75% of the traditional S&P 500's market capitalization at the industry level based on their GICS code. The index offers diversification and a profile that is close in line with that of the U.S. large cap market. UBS is the first firm to license this product for ETFs that launched last month on several European exchanges.","S&P Global Ratings launched ESG Evaluations to serve issuers and fixed income investors. Our ESG Evaluation is a cross-sector relative analysis of an entity's ability to operate successfully in the future and optimize long-term stakeholder value in light of its natural and social environment and the quality of its governance. In addition to leveraging the ESG data factory, the engagement that our ratings analyst have with client company management coupled with the judgment of our analysts add unique insights to this product.","Delivering innovative new products and updating existing products is an important emphasis at S&P Global. Our indices business recently launched the Global SmallCap Select Indices. This series of new indices is designed to improve long-term risk-adjusted performance of small caps by excluding companies without a consistent track record of positive earnings.","In addition, Platts launched assessments of low sulphur marine fuel in response to International Maritime Organization's 0.5% sulphur cap on marine fuel that begins in January 2020. Our new assessments are for daily cargo and barge prices of marine fuel 0.5%, reflecting global pricing of IMO 2020 compliant residual marine fuels.","Based on these new assessments, ICE launched six marine fuel 0.5% futures contracts on February 19th, which traded 84 lots equaling over 500,000 barrels on the first day. In March, S&P Dow Jones Indices benchmarks including the iconic S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average became the first benchmarks to be endorsed under the EU Benchmark Regulation and included in the ESMA register enabling supervised entity in EU to continue to use them.","And finally, Platts recently announced to change to the Dated Brent benchmark. The proposal move to a CIF, C-I-F Rotterdam basis, which means it will be a landed cost. With FOB supply in the North Sea gradually falling, this proposal ensure ample liquidity of grades in the Dated Brent basket for the foreseeable future.","And last, I'd like to share the early success of two new price assessments that we featured in previous earnings calls. These charts depicted the volume of options and futures contracts that are based on Platts' JKM marker and Black Sea wheat. As you can see in these charts, both price assessments are gaining great adoption in the marketplace.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, our CFO, who'll provide additional insights into our capital plans and financial performance. Ewout?","Ewout Steenbergen","Thank you, Doug, and good morning to all of you on the call. Let me start with our first quarter financial results. Doug covered the highlights, I will take a moment to cover a few other line items. Adjusted corporate unallocated improved by 30%, primarily because the $20 million contribution to the S&P Global Foundation in the prior period did not recur. This was partially offset by the addition of Kensho.","Total adjusted expenses decreased 1%. This is notable considering that the acquisitions of Pragmatix, Panjiva, RateWatch and Kensho have added to our cost structure. The adjusted effective tax rate of 20.9%, 80 basis points lower than a year ago, and less than our full year guidance of 22.5% to 23.5%. This was primarily due to a larger-than-normal level of stock option exercises that occurred during the first quarter. We have actively been returning capital to shareholders over the past year. These actions resulted in a 2% decline in our diluted weighted average shares outstanding.","Stock options associated with 600,000 shares were exercised during the first quarter. This resulted in a stock-based compensation tax benefit on EPS of $0.07. As the number of employee stock options continues to decline, we expect the stock-based compensation tax benefit to decline as well. However, because of the volume of options exercised in the first quarter, we're increasing our estimate of the 2019 EPS impact by $0.05 to a range of $0.10 to $0.15.","Changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact on revenue in the Ratings and Market Intelligence businesses and a negligible impact on adjusted operating profit for the company. Our revenue was negatively impacted primarily by the weakening of the euro and the British pound. Weakness in both of these currencies along with weakness in the Indian rupee also reduced expenses resulting in a minimal impact from ForEx on adjusted EPS.","There were three non-GAAP adjustments this quarter: a $113 million pretax non-cash charge associated with our frozen U.S. defined benefit pension plan. This was the result of transferring a portion of our pension funding obligation to an insurance company; $7 million in Kensho retention-related expenses; and we had $32 million in deal-related amortization.","This is a slide that we shared at our Investor Day in May 2018. It depicts a framework that we outlined to show the areas where we can most impact shareholder value. The first two require investments. We need to continue to invest to fuel revenue momentum by improving our products, introducing new technology, adding new data sets and entering new geographies. We have made great progress delivering EBITDA enhancement and we must continue to fund new organic opportunities to drive additional productivity gains.","Driving financial leverage, enforce optimizing interest costs, reducing shares outstanding and optimizing the tax rate. And finally, we want to return capital to shareholders while maintaining flexible debt capacity. We're committed to returning at least 75% of annual free cash flow to shareholders each year.","This quarter our subscription businesses, Market Intelligence and Platts delivered the strongest revenue growth. As we have said many times, we managed adjusted operating margins on a trailing four quarter basis. So while there were declines in quarterly figures versus the first quarter of 2018 all four businesses delivered margin gains on a trailing four quarter basis.","Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents declined versus the end of 2018, principally due to $644 million of share repurchases during the first quarter. Our adjusted growth leverage to adjusted EBITDA declined to 1.8 times remaining within our targeted range of 1.75 to 2.25 times. Free cash flow excluding certain items increased 3% to $306 million. This is a seasonally low free cash flow quarter with incentive compensation payments each year in the first quarter.","During the quarter we returned $785 million to shareholders through a combination of dividends, open market purchases and an ASR. In addition, during the quarter, we received 3.4 million shares 0.8 million shares from open market purchases, 0.4 million shares from the true-up of the old ASR and 2.2 million shares -- initial shares from the current ASR.","Now let's turn to the segment results starting with Market Intelligence. Market Intelligence delivered a strong quarter with revenue increasing 10%, 8% on an organic basis and active desktop user growth of 13%. I need to point out two changes that both became effective on January 1. First, we are now including Kensho revenue in Market Intelligence rather than reporting it as a corporate item as we did in 2018.","Second, in both periods Trucost has been transferred from Indices to Market Intelligence. With the ESG efforts underway at Market Intelligence, we believe the business is better suited to be included here. Adjusted expenses increased 2%, adjusted segment operating profit increased 27% and the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 460 basis points to 33.8%, despite increased investments in the business. More importantly, on a trailing four quarter basis, the business delivered an exceptional adjusted segment operating profit margin increase of 350 basis points to 35.2%.","Also in March, we announced the sale of the Standard & Poor's Investment Advisory Services business to Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2019. Desktop the largest category grew 6% excluding acquisitions. Data Management Solutions realized 11% revenue growth, once again benefiting from expansion of the data feeds business that Doug highlighted earlier.","Risk Services has been renamed Credit Risk Solutions and grew 11% with RatingsXpress providing the greatest level of growth as we continue to expand the data feeds portion of Credit Risk Solutions. While bank loan volume and bond issuance activity declined 13%, Ratings revenue only declined 7%. This decline was partially mitigated by a 2% decline in adjusted expenses, resulting in an 11% reduction in adjusted segment operating profit and a 240 basis points decline in adjusted segment operating profit margin. On a trailing four-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 140 basis points to 55.4%.","Non-transaction revenue decreased, primarily due to a $9 million impact from changes in foreign exchange. In addition, lower Rating Evaluation Services activity CRISIL and slightly lower new entity ratings contributed to the decline. Inter-segment royalties from Market Intelligence, partially offset these declines.","Transaction revenue decreased due to lower bank loan rating activity and to a lesser extent fewer bonds ratings. Non-transaction revenue has been a steady source of growth. This is because the majority of the revenue is subscription-like. However, there are some volatility at certain components namely; Rating Evaluation Services, ebb and flow with M&A activity and changes in foreign exchange rates can always have an impact.","This slide depicts Ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributor to the decline in Ratings revenue was the 8% decline in corporates, primarily due to less bank loan rating activity. In addition, financial services revenue decreased 2%, structured finance declined 19%, government increased 6%, and CRISIL and other category decreased 5%. This includes an increase in inter-segment royalties from Market Intelligence, offset by decline in CRISIL's dollar-denominated revenue.","Turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices, the segment delivered 2% revenue growth, 6% adjusted expense growth, 1% adjusted segment operating profit growth, and an adjusted segment operating profit margin of 69.5% a decline of 100 basis points. This margin decline was primarily the result of a revenue mix with a lower proportion of exchange-traded derivative from revenue than in the prior period.","On a trailing four-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 80 basis points to 67.7%. Revenue was mixed during the quarter. Asset-linked fees increased 9%, primarily due to an improvement in the timing of customer reporting, purchase of certain intellectual property rights, and mutual funds AUM growth. ","Exchange-traded derivative revenue declined 32% from an incredibly strong quarter a year ago. Data and custom subscriptions increased 28% due to a catch-up in real-time reporting that we first discussed in the second quarter of last year as well as from organic growth.","For our Indices business, ETF net inflows were $2 billion in the first quarter and the average ETF AUM in the first quarter increased 2% year-over-year. I want to make a clear distinction between average AUM and quarter ending AUM. Our contracts are based on average AUM. We disclose quarter ending figures, because flows and market gains and losses are best depicted using quarter end figures as shown in the waterfall chart on the right.","While average AUM increased modestly, quarter ending AUM increased 11% versus the end of the first quarter of 2018. A year ago, there was $1.327 trillion in ETF AUM linked to our indices. At the end of the first quarter this year, there was $1.473 trillion. Since March 31, 2018, there has been $95 billion of inflows and $51 billion in stock market appreciation.","Industry inflows into exchange-traded funds were $97 billion in the first quarter with the majority going into fixed income and global equity products. Flows into U.S. equity funds were only $7 billion.","These charts are from a report S&P Dow Jones Indices recently published and titled Sector Effects in the S&P 500: The Role of Sectors in Risk Pricing and Active Returns. Tradable sector-based investment tools are not new. Products such as exchange-traded funds based on sector indices have existed since at least the late 1990s. However, interest in these products has recently grown materially.","These charts show that the assets, open interest, trading volume, associated with certain index-based sector products have more than doubled in the past five years. In addition, in February 2019, CBOE launched options on 11 of our select sector indices. These products make it easier for investors to use sectors to express views and manage sectoral exposures. Key indicators for our exchange-traded derivatives volume decreased from a volatile first quarter of 2018. S&P 500 index options activity decreased 23% VIX futures and options activity decreased 48% and activity at the CME equity complex decreased 23%.","And now turning to the last business segment, Platts revenue increased to 5% as a result of a 5% increase in core subscriptions and a 7% increase in Global Trading Services. Adjusted expenses increased 6%, leading to adjusted segment operating profit margin of 47.4%, a decrease of 60 basis points. The trailing four-quarter adjusted segment operating profit margin was exceptional, increasing 260 basis points to 48.9%.","Platts revenue increased in the quarter, as all four commodity groups reported growth. Petroleum, the largest category, delivered the most growth at 6%. Last quarter we shared a slide on the right with you, depicting a stepped-up level of investment to fuel future organic growth. However, we thought that as you try to model our results, it will be important for you to understand the level of investment in each of the segments. As you can see from the chart on the left, Market Intelligence is investing half of the total. In addition this spending is expected to build as the year progresses.","Now, lastly, I would like to discuss our 2019 guidance. This slide depicts our GAAP guidance. Please keep in mind that our guidance reflects current spot market ForEx rates. Because of the $113 million pretax non-cash charge associated with a partial risk transfer of the frozen U.S. defined benefit pension plan that I noted earlier, we are decreasing our 2019 GAAP guidance, diluted EPS guidance. However, because this item is not part of our adjusted results, it does not necessitate any changes to our adjusted guidance. In fact, we are not making changes to our adjusted guidance because we are optimistic about our current outlook for markets, our competitive strength and the initiatives we have underway. In addition we continue to expect year-over-year growth as quarterly comparisons get easier as the year progresses.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions.","Chip Merritt","Thank you. Just a couple of instructions for our phone participants. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we'll now take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. This question comes from Ms. Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.","Toni Michele","Thank you. Good morning.","Doug Peterson","Good morning.","Toni Michele","My first question is on Ratings' margins. Understandably the weakness in issuance led to the lower Ratings growth in the quarter but I think margins were just a little bit lighter than what we were expecting. So I just wanted to ask, at what level do you start getting operating leverage in the Ratings segment? Do you need sort of like a mid-single-digit growth to get that leverage there? And just, I guess, just some additional color on what drove the margins down in the quarter would be helpful. Thank you.","Ewout Steenbergen ","Good morning, Toni. This is Ewout. If you look at the margin development in the first quarter of Ratings, we are overall satisfied with the results we are seeing. And the reason is that, we are also seeing at the same time the benefits of our productivity plans. We see expenses coming down by 2% or in dollar terms $7 million. And we think that is overall showing good expense discipline within the Ratings business. But in general terms, we see that expense discipline across the enterprise in totality.","Clearly, if you look more to the outlook of Ratings in margins, although we don't really guide and provide specifics with respect to margin outlooks by segment, I do want to say that if we look at the remainder of the year, our expectation is that margins should look better compared to the respective quarters a year ago. So, overall, we still expect Ratings margins to expand year-over-year 2019 compared to 2018.","Toni Michele","Great. And my second question I wanted to ask about Market Intelligence. You mentioned that change with Kensho being included in there. I guess on a like-for-like basis with last quarter, was the organic growth up sequentially? I imagine that Kensho is probably pretty small so the 8% looked like a pretty good number, and your user growth of 13%, really strong much faster than the market. And so I just wanted to understand what you attribute the really strong growth rate in the Market Intelligence business too. And international Market Intelligence was really strong too, so just any colors on growth there? Thank you.","Ewout Steenbergen","Toni if you look at the inorganic revenue in the Market Intelligence segment during this quarter, it was in total $8 million. That was driven by a couple of acquisitions by Market Intelligence. Think about Panjiva, think about RateWatch as well as some contribution of revenues from Kensho but that was only a part of that $8 million improvement in revenues on the acquisition line. So overall it's not a large change. As you will recall, we acquired Kensho in the second quarter of 2018. So next quarter basically this is not going to show up in the inorganic category anymore. It's becoming part of normal business as usual.","Toni Kaplan","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Alex Kramm of UBS.","Alex Kramm","Yeah, hey good morning, everyone. I may be splitting hairs here with my question a little bit, but I think when you talked about the taxes and the stock-based impact there I think you're now basically saying you have a $0.05 higher bottom line contribution. At the same time you left your EPS guidance unchanged.","Again I think it's less like than 0.5% of EPS. But just wondering you sound very positive on the outlook but clearly you're not changing anything despite that help. So maybe just a little discussion on the puts and takes there to leave it unchanged.","Ewout Steenbergen","Good morning, Alex. This is Ewout. If you look at the improved impact that we are now expecting from stock-based compensation, if you are looking at the guidance we have provided with respect to the effective tax rate for the full year, which is 22.5% to 23.5% we're still within that range now more at the lower end of the range. So, therefore, overall we have not adjusted the tax rate range in our guidance.","But what I do want to say is compared to three months ago we have become incrementally more confident around our guidance in general. Because you will recall three months ago we came out of a very volatile quarter and it was very uncertain where the markets would go. If you now look where the markets are at this point in time, the outlook for the next few quarters in the year, the starting point for our subscription businesses with respect to annualized contract value, which is a leading indicator for future revenue for our subscription businesses ,if you look at the starting point of ETF AUM in the second quarter of this year compared to a year ago, overall the health of the debt markets at this point in time, we are incrementally more confident around the outlook and the guidance we have provided compared to three months ago.","Alex Kramm","Fair enough. And then secondly on the index side, I was a little surprised about the actually very good performance on the asset-based fees. Now obviously it was challenged by the ETF business. But you mentioned some of the other things that helped like the derivatives, I guess the OTC side and some of the mutual funds. Can you just give us a little bit more detail? It seems like that really helped this quarter. Maybe that's a little bit lumpy; maybe there was some one-timer stuff in there. I just want to make sure that if I think about that stuff going forward that we don't overestimate it going forward I guess. Maybe you can break out how big those fees are relative to the ETF side. Thank you.","Ewout Steenbergen","Alex, if you look at -- first at the exchange-traded derivative volume, you might recall due to market volatility, there was a very large spike in February 2018. So that's not recurring. markets have more stabilized. And then you also see the volumes on the derivatives trading coming down.","So we are looking more at the first quarter 2018 as an exception and this is more a normal level quarter, the first quarter of 2019. But we have always said that this business has a natural hedge. So if exchange traded derivative volume is going down that's usually because markets are more positive. And then we see the flip side with respect to the asset-based fee levels.","There is indeed a couple of elements that are going into the asset based fee level category. Overall, average AUM for ETFs was up 2%, so that helps in a modest way. Then there is also the mutual funds assets under management where we saw a positive increase.","There was not so much change with respect to the OTC levels. And there was one particular administrative matter. We have accelerated and implemented improvement in our processes where we have faster reporting of asset levels by certain managers. That is a one-time step-up in revenues and that will from now on basically be the new normal level going forward.","So that is I think the other element that goes in the mix here with respect to assets under management fees. But overall like I said, we are optimistic about the second quarter outlook because the starting point in assets is so much better than we have seen at the beginning of the second quarter of 2018.","Alex Kramm","Excellent. Totally get it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. You may ask your question.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you. Good morning gentlemen. The first question I had was I was just hoping you could help us understand the mix components of the non-transaction piece of your ratings business. Like how much of that is that the way you described the subscription?","And then just within that I guess I understand why Ratings Evaluation is down. Can you just help me understand what's going on with CRISIL?","Ewout Steenbergen","Good morning Manav. Non-transaction revenue was down $15 million year-over-year of which $9 million was FX-related. So, that's clearly the largest driver of non-transaction revenue.","Then the second driver here was Rating Evaluation Services. That is very much linked to M&A activity in the market. That was relatively modest and therefore also the rest fees and revenues were a bit lower this quarter compared to a year ago.","And then what we see with CRISIL is a couple of impacts. First impact of foreign exchange based on the difference in foreign exchange rates from a year ago between the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar.","With respect to the research and analytics business, we see revenue coming down due to some market headwinds, but that is then offset by the Indian ratings revenue which is actually up in a healthy way. But those are some of the elements that are happening within CRISIL.","Overall, we will expect to see maybe quarter-over-quarter slow and modest fluctuations for non-transaction revenue. But we still expect over a longer period of time a normal trend of growth of non-transaction somewhere low to mid-single-digits.","Manav Patnaik","Got it, okay. That's very helpful. And then maybe just on the balance sheet your leverage target or your current leverage is pretty close to your target. Just any thoughts on what the plans are there with the cash and the flexibility you have.","Ewout Steenbergen","Yes. We have -- of course have a very clear statement with respect to our capital philosophy and our capital targets. And we are disciplined around that and we are committed to stay within the targets that we have set. So, at a point, we will fall below the floor of our leverage range. We will certainly at that point start to consider adding new leverage to our balance sheet.","What we'll do with the proceeds I think is still to be determined. I think you know our first priority is to reinvest in the business. We are investing already this year in a stepped-up way in organic initiatives. You know all of those about ESG and China and technology and Kensho and other areas. We could also use the proceeds for inorganic investments. We will continue to remain very disciplined from a valuation perspective.","And then, of course, the third option we have is return of capital to shareholders. So, still to be determined, but we have clear targets with respect to our capital philosophy and you may expect us to continue to be committed to those targets.","Manav Patnaik","All right. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim McHugh from William Blair. You may ask your question.","Tim McHugh","Thanks. Just wanted to ask on Platts, the selling environment, I guess are you seeing any improvement? And I guess an update on the analytical solutions that you've tried to develop over the last few years the success with selling those to improve the growth of Platts. Thanks.","Doug Peterson","Hi Tim this is Doug. Let me take that one. Well, first of all, as in the past, people have always looked to see if there was any kind of major correlation of Platts with commodity prices. And as we've always said there's some kind of a range I'm not giving what exactly it is.","But if prices get too high, sometimes it squeezes some of the buyers; if they get too low; it squeezes some of the sellers we sometimes see. But we've been in a very comfortable range in the price of oil the price of natural gas. We've also been developing the new products which we've been highlighting like the JKM marker rebalancing the Brent components, et cetera.","So, we see that we're selling into a pretty benign -- actually maybe neutral to positive environment for Platts. And as we've mentioned in the past, this is very much about relationships and getting out to have a commercial approach to how we're dealing with the markets. So, we're seeing what we would call a neutral to positive environment.","On the analytical solutions, this continues to be part of our growth plans and investment plans. We had made as you know acquisitions in the last two years to build out a data set. Those data sets are included in products that we actually have as well as on their own basis.","One of the early wins I'd like to mention is that as you've heard us talk about the S&P Global platform, which is an initiative we have to have a single technology base to be able to provide our information in the market. Platts is piloting a new set of materials that they're delivering to the market which used to be via PDF. And now through our subscription services, they're able to deliver all that information online where instead of seeing a PDF, a customer is able now to download the information, building their spreadsheets using their analysis, et cetera. So, we're laying a very strong foundation for the vision of Platts analytically. And one of the key elements in that was building out this S&P Global platform, so we can deliver those kinds of solutions.","Tim McHugh","Okay. Thanks. And then just on the investment spending within I guess in particular Market Intelligence and Kensho. You maybe commented it builds as the year progresses. Can you help us think about the subsequent years I guess 2020, 2021? Is this an expense, I guess spending or project level that continues to build, stays at this elevated level? Or do we start to see savings in terms of data ingested cost and so forth as we go out a year or two where I guess you get a reversion relative to this I guess weight against the margins?","Ewout Steenbergen","Tim, if you look at the next few years for those business cases where we're investing in Market Intelligence, a part of the current expense for this year is really for the build-up phase and we don't expect those to recur. A part is really for operations and a setup of new organizations and new products we will provide to the market. So those expenses will remain going forward. I think the biggest difference that you should expect to see is that those initiatives will start to drop off revenues over the next few years; some a little faster some a little bit further out in time. For example, we have always said that the Chinese investments are more in the horizon of three to five years. But some others in Market Intelligence, the payoff in terms of revenue could be a bit faster. So there you should expect the biggest change that these investments we are doing this year will ultimately lead to an improvement of the organic growth in Market Intelligence going forward.","Tim McHugh","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Mr. Jeff Silber from BMO Capital. You may ask your question, sir.","Jeff Silber","Thanks so much. Doug, when you started the presentation, you talked about the markets having come a long way since the depths of December. I'm just curious in your conversations with issuers, are they thinking the same things? I'm just wondering in terms of the outlook there still seems to be a lot of uncertainty out there. If you could provide some color that would be great?","Doug Peterson","Yes. There definitely is a lot of uncertainty out there. I'd basically divide this into two the positive as well as then some of the uncertainties. On the positive side, business sentiment is still strong, consumer sentiment is strong, banking balance sheets are very strong. There's abundant capital. The accommodated policies of the central banks around the world have continued in place with very cheap capital and in Europe in particular flooded liquidity into the markets. So there's very, very strong conditions.","And then we've also seen economic growth. Even though it slowed down a little bit in China and Europe, the U.S. just had a very strong quarter. And our own estimations are for a slight slowdown in global growth from last year, but still a global growth. And we also see a low probability about 20% or so probability of a recession in the U.S. in the next 12 months, which is actually a very low level.","Now what are some of the challenges or uncertainties? Clearly, there's uncertainties around trade. There are still -- the markets are still waiting to see what's going to happen with the U.S.-China trade negotiations. European markets are still quite weak Southern Europe in particular. And even though Brexit is something that we were panicking about a few weeks ago, it went away for six months, Brexit still needs to be resolved. So you still have some political issues and trade issues that create some of the uncertainty. And then as I said, Europe is also -- continues to be a pretty weak area.","Jeff Silber","Okay. Appreciate the color. And Ewout, in terms of my follow-up, I know you haven't disclosed the potential details regarding the sale of the SPIAS business. But can you give us an order of magnitude roughly how large that business is so we can take that out of our model?","Ewout Steenbergen","Yes. We have not disclosed those details. But overall, you should see that that is a relatively small business for us. So not a material or large impact on the results and the difference in your models. I would say relatively small.","Jeff Silber","Okay. And that's happening at the end of the second part is that what you said?","Ewout Steenbergen","Yes. We expect closing somewhere mid of this year. So if you model this, you should probably take it out for the second half of this year.","Jeff Silber","Okay, perfect. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Sir, you may ask your question.","George Tong","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Your overall global issuance forecast for the full year is unchanged down less than 1%. Drilling deeper into the individual categories of debt, can you discuss how your issuance expectations for the year have changed? And what implications there would be from a pricing and mix perspective?","Doug Peterson","Hi, George, this is Doug. As we've looked at this and we've made a couple of quick adjustments to it looking at what we see from the pipelines, from speaking with debt underwriters and investment banks, by looking at what we see from issuers as well as taking a look at what we see in terms of credit conditions and global markets, as you see it's relatively unchanged. There is a slight, slight change in what we expect for corporates to be up a little bit, for financial institutions to be down a little bit, for public finance to be down a little bit.","But net-net, the overall change is very similar to what we had before. And the differences across those different asset classes and different types of industries are so minor, it doesn't really have much of a change in what we look forward to in terms of revenues and our revenue mix.","George Tong","Got it. That's helpful. And then looking at operating margins at Platts, they declined in the quarter despite reasonable revenue growth. Can you talk about what drove the margin decline? And how you expect profitability at Platts to evolve over the course of the year?","Ewout Steenbergen","George that was mostly driven by timing of certain expenses. So we have particularly some expenses related to initiatives and events that were a bit higher this quarter. We don't expect that to continue for the remainder of the year. So, therefore, from a margins perspective, we are very comfortable with respect to the outlook of the margins for Platts and we still expect that the margins will develop in a favorable way for the next three quarters compared to a year ago.","George Tong","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Mr. Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your question.","Drew Kootman","Hi. This is Drew Kootman on for Joe. I had a quick question on China. You mentioned you had a seminar in Beijing. And I was just wondering if you could provide any updates or give us a better understanding of the risks you may be seeing in the region.","Doug Peterson","Well, first of all, thanks for the question, Drew. Nice to hear you today. We opened up our credit rating agency in China officially, on March 26 with a seminar. We felt it was valuable to launch this with an approach to having relationships with issuers, with investors, with market players, with debt underwriters, the financial institutions, et cetera, by introducing them to our employees, by talking about our methodology and talking about how we're heading into the market with this very transparent approach to credit ratings.","Since then, we continue to see customers. We're now up to having had over 250 calls with relationships that we're starting to build, to open up the rating agency and to be able to do more and more issuance there. We have not done an issuance so far.","When it comes to some of the risks when we look at China, clearly there's the discussion about the level of growth in China and the type of growth that China has been developing. As you know, a few years ago China was very much of an investment-led export-oriented economy. They've shifted more towards a consumer-oriented consumption economy, with a lot more investment in the domestic markets.","We think that there are a few sectors which we're watching carefully there, which would be the -- a couple of the property sectors. In addition, there's some municipal debt which has been growing, but we don't see any major credit bubbles right now in China. If we did we would raise those.","But we think we're off to a great start and very enthusiastic reception from the market players as well as excellent relationships with the key regulators and official market players that we need to be working with to ensure the success of our ratings business in China.","Drew Kootman","Great. And then, you talked about Kensho a couple of questions ago. So as you're seeing -- any updates on the progress that you're seeing from Kensho and RateWatch and just anything moving forward?","Ewout Steenbergen","We're still very excited about Kensho and what Kensho is doing for S&P Global, as a catalyst for innovation and change in our thinking, with respect to our business models, our proposition to the markets. There's new initiatives going on. We have actually a very interesting initiative going on in Platts at this moment and there's a lot of enthusiasm from the Platts leadership team around the implementation of that initiative as well. And we are continuing on some of the implementation of the other initiatives that we told you before.","Think about some of the new initiatives around search, the Omnisearch on the platform that we expect to introduce in a beta form later this year. With respect to the financials update and particularly with respect to value-creation update, we're planning to give you more details once a year. We did that at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018, so we will provide you more details on that by the end of this year again.","Drew Kootman","Thank you.","Operator","This question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. Sir, you may ask your question.","Craig Huber","Thank you. Doug, I wanted to just focus on China if we can for your ratings business. Just curious, how big of an effort you guys have rolled out there. I guess, the number of analysts, if you could share that, that you have in that market right now. I believe, globally, you have probably something like 1,400, 1,500 analysts in ratings around the world. Can you just clarify that?","But as you sort of think of the China market from a ratings standpoint, S&P standpoint, how big of an opportunity do you think this is, kind of, going forward here? How do you -- what's your general sense, how you think it might scale up this calendar year and next year, as you sort of talk about -- talk with market participants and stuff?","Doug Peterson","Yes. Thanks, Craig. Well, first of all, just a brief comment on how we ramped this up, because I think that's important. As we've been going to this market for the last few years, trying to build up a relationship to understand the dynamics of the domestic market, we wanted to make sure that we built this out with a consolidated approach with a long-term view.","What we did is, we originally started with 10 veteran S&P Global analysts who are Mandarin speakers that we brought from offshore. And they spent a month building out criteria, working on how we're going to be able to rate in the market, using domestic criteria, domestic understanding of bankruptcy laws of -- recovery laws, et cetera. And then they back-tested 400 credits to ensure that we had the right kind of criteria in place.","As we were doing that we went out to the market and hired 21 more analyst. So right now we have 31 analysts covering the Chinese market. They've covered 40 different sectors and different types of sectors and subsectors and they've done 400-plus initial credit reviews that they've done. And now with that our sales teams are out in the market discussing what that means and building up those relationships.","Now just in terms of similar size you've heard this before, it's the second largest bond market in the world after the U.S. It's close to bypassing Japan also on the public side as well. They have -- most of the bonds are held by banks and financial institutions. They're still not necessarily into a pension system and individual holders and only 2% of the bonds are held offshore by foreign investors.","So we think that the dynamics of the market is shifting from a short-term bond market. A typical bond is about a 3-year duration more or less as oppose to U.S. which is depending on which market you look at 7 to 11 year duration. It's a very short-term duration. It's still being held by financial institutions with very little international presence.","We think that all of that is going to change. And then as that changes this is the opportunity for ratings. We have not built out a very aggressive revenue model for the first year. We think this is an investment year. And we think that over time we're going to build out a revenue model. I'd prefer to come back to you as the year progresses with some more information that could be either financial or directional because we're really right now just at the ground floor of getting this thing off and running.","Craig Huber","Great. Thank you, Doug.","Operator","This question will come from Mr. Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray. Sir you may ask your question.","Peter Appert","Thank you. So Doug, I was just interested in your thoughts on particularly for the second quarter what you're seeing in terms of activity in the debt market? And related to that, I'm wondering if refi activity is impacted by the more stable rate environment?","Doug Peterson","Yes. So what we've seen so far in the second quarter, it's only been a month it's similar to the kind of mix we saw throughout the first part of the year. Europe is still weak. The European markets were very weak in the first quarter. In fact if you look at the total market in Europe financial institutions was down 25% in the first quarter. Total Europe was down 8%.","In Europe the investment grade was down 12.5%, high yield was down 25%. And we've seen that continue. So you have very specific conditions in Europe that are a little bit different than the rest of the world, partially because of the economy has slowed down, there's some uncertainty and then also you have a new round of liquidity being pumped into the banks by the ECB. It's an LTRO-like situation in very, very low interest rates.","So putting Europe aside and coming to the U.S.. What we saw in the U.S. in the first quarter was as you know there was a very -- the bank loan activity was down over 26% on new bank loan, but high-yield issuance was actually up 6%. It's not quite apples-for-apples, but it is the markets that those types of borrowers will go to. They'll decide if they're going to the fixed income market or the loan market.","We have seen in April some refinancing starting to pop in as well as new issuance and we've seen -- April was not a great month either, but overall, though we did see a lot of the activity with people coming back to market for refinancing.","One last trend that we mentioned -- Ewout mentioned in his comments that M&A activity was weak during the first quarter -- actually in the fourth quarter and the first quarter this year was -- is the pipeline has actually started looking a lot better when you look at deals announced.","So one of the charts that I track which looks at deals announced has actually started popping up which is usually a good indicator for our Ratings Evaluation Services as well as issuance down the road.","Peter Appert","Got it. And then just on Market Intelligence quickly. Doug your performance as mentioned earlier is quite a bit better than what we're seeing from the industry overall. Is it possible to sort of delineate how much of that is a function of share gains versus some of the product line extensions you've been offering?","Doug Peterson","I don't have a precise answer for you to give you what's from share gains. But what I could tell you is that a lot of our growth and you saw it in the charts today is coming from what I would call the newer or nontraditional products.","We had strong growth on the desktop which you saw, but we had even stronger growth from data feeds and from credit services and things that we see are where the demands are growing from our users.","The users are looking for more and more granular data and new ways to incorporate data into their own modeling. And so that trend is something that I think we're investing in and we think it's going to continue going forward. But I don't have any specific comments about share gain.","Chip Merritt","The only thing I would add is that if you think about our customer base versus some of our competitors we're much less dependent on Wall Street. So I think that also plays into the numbers as well.","Peter Appert","Got it. Thank you.","Chip Merritt","Thanks Peter.","Operator","Thank you. Mr. Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. You ask your question.","Bill Warmington ","Good morning, everyone.","Doug Peterson","Good morning. ","Bill Warmington ","So a question for you about the competitive landscape. One of your main Ratings competitors has been aggressively adding commercial real estate data assets with a view to leveraging that data throughout Ratings. I think in Reis, CompStak and so on. Is that an area of focus for you as well something you need to have in your arsenal?","Doug Peterson","As we've looked at what we need to have to enhance and improve and continually update our approach to Ratings as well as all of our analytical products is right now our major emphasis is on ESG. As you can see we believe that there is an exploding demand. We don't know how it's defined yet or what direction its going, but we think it's exploding for ESG data and content. So this is where this quarter you saw that we launched -- or last quarter in the first quarter we launched two significant benchmarks for ESG products which we're out working on and building up. When it comes to specific data whether it would be real estate or if it's information about interest rates or credit recoveries et cetera we believe that we either have or have access to adequate information to fulfill our duty to produce excellent ratings.","Bill Warmington ","Okay. And then a question based on some of Ewout's comment about the first quarter ETF inflows. You mentioned that they had come in at $97 billion but the U.S. equity flows inflows are about $7 billion. I just wanted to get your thoughts on whether you saw that as a short-term phenomenon or more of a longer-term trend.","Ewout Steenbergen ","Good morning, Bill. This is clearly short-term. We see always some fluctuations in flows going in different asset categories either from a geographical perspective or from an asset class perspective. Overall, these movements can differ quarter-by-quarter. But we are looking at the overall ETF market share that we are having of the overall assets under management that are using our indices. That's close to 30% and that number is basically stable already for a longer period of time. So our market share is continue to be good. We're leading with that market share and this is really a fluctuation period-over-period. If we look at flows for example to U.S. equities in the month of April, we have seen that those are actually pretty robust. So again this can really move around a bit.","Bill Warmington ","Excellent. Thank you very much for the color.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our final question from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. You may ask your question.","Shlomo Rosenbaum ","Hi. Good morning, and thank you for squeezing me in. Hey, Doug maybe you can just elaborate a little bit more on the Kensho investment. It's going to be 30% of planned investment. Can you talk about any potentially new initiatives that might be going on right now or the things that you want to highlight now? Also -- so is it people costs? And I just want to be clear that this -- I don't think it's the retention bonuses included in there, but can you just clarify that?","Doug Peterson","Yes. So first of all, Shlomo thanks for asking the question. We're really thrilled and very pleased with having made the Kensho acquisition and all of the difference that it's making across the company. We have traditionally had a couple of areas that we've highlighted, which we're data-linking. We talked about enhanced search capabilities and omnisearch capability. Ewout just mentioned something that's going on with Platts where we have now a team embedded in Platts working on the market on close process to find different ways to look at the value of information and to get it in a faster way as well as identify potential opportunities to continue to improve our business model.","And if I use those as a few of the examples those are -- there's activities like that now going on in Ratings and Indices. And also even some of our corporate functions they're helping us look at some of the ways we manage the business overall. And as a result of the early wins that we've had we decided that it's valuable to invest in our businesses for growth opportunities and this is where the investments are coming from Kensho. So they're related to investments in growth. They're related to where we're going to be either opening new markets or launching new products where we think that Kensho can help us with that.","Some of those expenses are people and some of those expenses are additional computing capacity or capacity for data tools et cetera. But all of them are based off of early results that we're very comfortable with the progress with Kensho. And they're all geared towards growth. Although I would say there is -- some of the data work that's going on will potentially lead to productivity as well. So we're not just putting productivity behind us but a lot of this is being geared towards growth opportunities.","Shlomo Rosenbaum ","Okay. Great. And the investments are not part of the retention payments right? These are actual incremental investments?","Doug Peterson","These are incremental investments.","Shlomo Rosenbaum ","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Doug Peterson","Thank you. ","Doug Peterson","Well, let me just wrap this up and first of all thank everyone for joining the call today. As you've heard from us, we continue to be committed to growing our businesses to investing for growth to finding new ways to continue to have productivity. We're using our framework of Powering the Markets of the Future and the six foundational capabilities as a guide frame for us. We'll continue to show that to you as we use that as a consistent approach for speaking with our Board of Directors about our long-term growth with our employees and also with our shareholders. So we look forward to being back in touch with you at the end of the second quarter.","And with that thank you again always for your great questions and for your support.

Doug?","Douglas Peterson","Good morning. Thank you, Chip. Welcome to the call today. Economies around the globe are glowing. Equity markets face increasing volatility and the world waits for potential trade war. But S&P Global is off to a great start in 2018.","Let me begin with the first quarter highlights. Leveraging technology and data is becoming increasingly critical to the company, so we're thrilled to have added leading-edge technology and unique data sets with the acquisitions of Kensho and Panjiva.","S&P Dow Jones Indices delivered exceptional results as market volatility fueled record exchange-traded derivative revenue. Adjusted effective tax rate declined 860 basis points to 21.7% as a result of U.S. tax reform.","We generated approximately $299 million in free cash flow excluding certain items. We initiated a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program with the majority of the shares received in the first quarter.","We returned $1.2 billion through share repurchases and dividends with $1 billion from the new ASR. And as previously disclosed, we contributed $20 million to the S&P Global Foundation to support our investment in community programs.","Looking more closely at the financial results, the company reported 8% revenue growth on both a reported and organic basis. However, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, revenue increased 6%.","Our adjusted operating profit margin increased 10 basis points. We fully expect an improvement in our adjusted operating profit margin for the full year consistent with our 2018 guidance of 47.5% to 48.5%.","We delivered 24% adjusted diluted EPS growth. Our EPS included favorable impact of $0.03 from ForEx and $0.04 from the tax benefit from stock option exercises. Ewout will provide more information on these in a moment.","What I'd like to do next is provide some more color on the current and future drivers of our businesses. When tracking the issuances data, we always try to point out that where issuance takes place, which type of issuance, and the size of the deals make a difference in the revenue we realize.","Global issuance in the first quarter, excluding sovereign debt, decreased 5%. Structured finance, however, was quite strong. Geographically, issuance in the United States decreased 13% in the first quarter with investment-grade decreasing 17%, high yield decreasing 37%, public finance down 31%, while structured finance increased 29% due primarily to strength in CLOs and ABS.","In Europe, issuance was unchanged in the quarter with investment-grade decreasing 6%, high yield declining 11%, and structured finance increasing 29% with strength in CLOs, ABS, and RMBS.","In Asia, issuance increased 3%. The vast majority of a Asian issuance, however, is made up of local China debt that we don't rate. As you'll see later, there is never a perfect correlation between issuance and revenue because of frequent issuer programs, pricing, and non-transaction-related revenue. In fact, despite a decline in global issuance during the quarter, Ratings revenue increased.","One of the strengths of structured issuance during the quarter was CLOs, in particular, new CLOs. This was despite continued uncertainties surrounding U.S. risk retention rules. The Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit ruled against the SEC and the Fed Reserve Board, concluding that [Indiscernible] are not subject to the credit risk retention rules mandated under Dodd-Frank.","There was an appeal period that last, and the U.S. regulators chose not to appeal. While no longer mandatory, some managers are looking to continue to abide by risk retention and some debt investors have expressed a preference for the managers' interest to align with theirs.","Bank loan ratings have been a growing part of the Ratings business over the past few years. Bank loan ratings are primarily issued on leveraged loans, typically related -- typically rated BB+ or lower. While our first quarter bank loan rating revenue was a couple of million dollars less than a year ago, at $99 million, it is a solid start to 2018.","The next chart takes a longer term perspective on the bond market. This chart depicts average U.S. bond maturities for the past 17 years. We're frequently asked by investors if maturities have lengthened as corporate treasurers sought to stretch low interest rates further into the future. This data demonstrates that they haven't. Both investment-grade and high-yield average maturities have been virtually unchanged since 2010.","Turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. We continue to invest in our future. S&P Dow Jones Indices added Bolsas y Mercados Argentinos to our international securities exchange network, which has been at the forefront of index-based innovation. This is in addition to our agreements in Latin America with Brazil, Chile, Peru, Mexico, and MILA. MILA is a regional trade and exchange organization made up of Chile, Peru, Colombia, and Mexico.","We launched the S&P 500 Bond Mega 30 Index family. It includes the S&P 500 Bond Mega 30 Investment-grade Index, which is composed of 30 bonds representing the largest investment-grade issuance from S&P 500 issuers. And it includes the corresponding S&P 500 Mega 30 High Yield Index.","S&P Dow Jones Indices began publishing Carbon metric on majority of its equity indices, including the S&P Global 1200, S&P 500, and Dow Jones Industrial Average. We're the first index provider to publically display carbon metrics as standard alongside financial data on our indices on a monthly basis. The source for the data is Trucost, a company we acquired in 2016.","And last, in conjunction with the BSE in India, we launched the S&P BSE 100 ESG Index to measure the exposure to securities, meeting sustainability investing criteria.","Next up, Platts has developed a new blockchain application, the first at S&P Global. We believe this project, developed in conjunction with our partners in Fujairah, represent a first for oil markets by developing a full blockchain deployment to provide market participants with data that is increasingly critical in the region and to global oil markets. This is an example of our ongoing commitment to digital transformation in the energy sector.","Last quarter, we highlighted the first Black Sea wheat OTC swap trade. Since then, there's been more than 500,000 tons traded over the counter. In the first quarter, CME launched a new cash-settled Black Sea grain future base on the S&P Global Platts Price Benchmark for Russian wheat and Ukrainian corn.","The Platts prices should appeal to traders looking for correlations across markets. The Black Sea grain complex encompasses wheat, corn production, and exports from countries bordering the Black Sea.","Turning to technology, we're thrilled to have closed the Kensho acquisition in April. By employing Kensho's expertise across S&P Global, we can enhance the customer experience we provide.","Over time, we expect Kensho's expertise will drive a dramatic evolution of our businesses in areas like new analytical capabilities embedded in our products, improved user experience driven by natural language processing, visualization, and advanced search.","Automation of core workflows that will allow us to create new products faster, mitigate development risks and drive efficiencies.

But for those institutional investors and analysts who wish to attend in person, please RSVP ahead of time.","Let me turn the call over to Ewout, who will provide more specifics on our business results during the quarter. Thank you.","Ewout Steenbergen","Thank you, Doug and good morning to everyone on the call. This morning, I would like to provide additional color around our first quarter results. Doug already discussed the 8% revenue growth and the 24% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. I would like to touch on a few other line items.","First, on January 1st, we adopted a new accounting rule, ASC 606, revenue from contracts with customers and believe that it will not have a material impact on our financial results. You can find further information in our first quarter 10-Q.","Second, I would like to put the $10 million increase in unallocated expense into perspective. This increase is due to the $20 million contribution to the S&P Global Foundation. Without this contribution, unallocated expenses declined $10 million and this decline was primarily due to lower executive department expenses and reduced professional fees.","The $20 million contribution also impacted our adjusted total expenses and adjusted operating profit margin. Without this contribution, adjusted operating profit margin would have increased over 100 basis points. The most impactful item during the quarter was U.S. tax reform, which resulted in a dramatic reduction in our adjusted effective tax rate.","During our fourth quarter of 2017 earnings call, we estimated that the EPS impact from the tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation would increase 2018 EPS by $0.10 to $0.20, depending on SPGI's share price and option exercise activity. This also impacts EPS whenever the fair market value of employee stock grants ex-vesting differs from the grant price. The impact is reported as an adjustment in tax expense. During the first quarter, we recorded a reduction in tax expense that improved first quarter adjusted EPS by $0.04.","Net of hedges, foreign exchange rates had a $25 million positive impact on the company's revenue and a $10 million positive impact on adjusted operating profit or about $0.03 per share in the first quarter.","The bulk of the impact was in the Ratings segment. Ratings revenue was primarily impacted by the euro and British pound. The only non-GAAP adjustment that was made during the quarter was $24 million in pretax deal-related amortization expense.","In the first quarter, led by S&P Dow Jones Indices, every business segment contributed to gains in revenue. While 9% growth at Market Intelligence was notable, 25% growth at indices was outstanding.","Indices adjusted operating profit growth and adjusted operating profit margin growth of 28% and 160 basis points, respectively, also led every business segments. While it is unrealistic to expect every business segment to have an increase in adjusted operating profit margin every quarter, let me add to Doug's earlier comment. Not only do we fully expect an improvement in our adjusted operating profit margin for the full year consistent with our 2018 guidance for a range of 47.5% to 48.5%, we expect that all four business segments will contribute to this improvement.","Now, turning to the individual business segments. Since indices had such a strong performance this quarter, let's start there. Revenue increased 25% with large gains in both exchange-traded derivatives and asset-linked fees. This surge in revenue led to a 28% increase in adjusted operating profit and a 160 basis points increase in adjusted operating margin to 69.5%.","Asset-linked fees, which are principally derived from ETFs, mutual funds, and certain OTC derivatives, increased 21%, driven by a 28% increase in average ETF AUM. Exchange-traded derivatives revenue rose 59% to $50 million, setting a new quarterly record for this category. The previous record was $34 million.","Extraordinary market volatility led to increased exchange-traded derivatives trading activity. To put this volatility into perspective, during the first quarter, there were 23 days when the S&P 500 changed by 1% or more. For the full year 2017, there were only eight such days. And then subscription revenue increased 5% due to growth in data subscriptions and custom indices.","The trend of assets moving into passive investments continued in the first quarter with the exchange-traded products industry reaching net inflows of $128 billion. The quarter ending ETF AUM tied to our indices totaled $1.326 trillion, up 19% versus the first quarter of 2017.","As the chart shows, this was the result of $109 billion of net inflows and $101 billion of market appreciation over the last 12 months. The first quarter average AUM associated with our indices increased 28% year-over-year. This is a better proxy for revenue changes than the quarter end fares.","Exchange-traded derivatives volume was very strong during the first quarter. Key contracts include S&P 500 Index Options, which grew 38%, and fixed futures and options activity, which increased 56%. In addition, activity at the CME Equity Complex increased 48%.","Now, moving to Ratings. Ratings revenue increased 5% or 2% excluding a favorable impact from ForEx. Adjusted operating profit increased 8%, while the adjusted operating margin increased 190 basis points to 54.7%.","As we have said in the past, we manage the Ratings business on a rolling four quarters basis. And you can see, on that basis, the adjusted operating margin increased 270 basis points.","Loan transaction revenue increased 11%, due primarily to growth in fees associated with surveillance, new entity ratings, and rating evaluation service fees. New entity ratings are from customers that are coming to us for their first rating. There was a flurry of activity as we had 30% more new customers in the first quarter than in our first quarter of last year. In addition, with a jump in M&A activity and corporate carve-outs, our rating evaluation service fees were up over 40%.","Transaction revenue decreased 1% as declines in corporate bonds and public finance were slightly larger than gains in structured products. While market volatility helped our index business, it temporary sidelined a number of would-be issuers during the first quarter. On the days when the equity markets had sharp declines, there was often little to no corporate bond issuance.","If you look at Ratings revenue by its various markets, you can see the greatest gains were in structured finance. Structured finance increased primarily due to strong CLO and ABS activity in both the U.S. and Europe as well as increased CMBS activity in the U.S.","Corporate revenue was impacted by decreased issuance. The only revenue category that declined was governance, due to the 31% decline in U. S. public finance issuance that Doug mentioned.","Let me now turn to Market Intelligence. In the first quarter, revenue increased 9% and adjusted operating profit improved 4%. Our adjusted operating margin declined 150 basis points, primarily due to increased investments in commercial and technology, increased data cost, foreign exchange, and timing of expenses. We fully expect margins for Market Intelligence to increase in 2018.","Here, I want to briefly review some business highlights. We have discussed the movement through enterprise-wide commercial agreements for our desktop products, but it is important to understand that outside the desktop business, essentially all products were sold as enterprise-wide commercial agreements already.","With the emphasis on instituting enterprise-wide commercial agreements for our desktop business, by the end of the first quarter, approximately 70% of former Capital IQ desktop customers had been converted.","Also during the quarter, we realized a 14% increase in Market Intelligence active desktop users versus the prior periods. As for the new Market Intelligence platform, progress continues as there were several new releases during the first quarter. Mike Chinn will give a more comprehensive update on our platform and commercial rollout progress during Investor Day.","Looking more deeply at Market Intelligence revenue, all three components delivered strong revenue growth. Desktop products grew 7%, data management solutions increased 13%, leading growth for Market Intelligence. Risk Services grew 8% with RatingsXpress and RatingsDirect providing low teens and mid-single-digit growth, respectively.","Turning to Platts, revenue increased 3% in the first quarter. The mid-single-digit growth in our core subscription business was diluted by weakness in global trading services revenue, which experienced mid-teens declines.","Derivative trading was weak in certain oil and metals products. The adjusted operating profit margin declined, primarily due to lower global trading services revenue, foreign exchange, and timing of expenses.","In 2017, Platts margin declined as the year progressed, due primarily to the timing of certain expenses. We expect the margin to be more stable from quarter-to-quarter in 2018.","If you look at Platts revenue by its four primary markets, you can see that petroleum and power and gas make up the majority of the business. The two smallest categories, petrochemicals and metals and ag, each delivered 9% growth, and the two largest categories had little or no growth.","Now turning to our capital position. Our cash balance was reduced by approximately $1 billion from the end of 2017 due to the accelerated share repurchase agreement that we initiated in the first quarter. Our debt was basically unchanged since the end of 2017. Our debt coverage, as measured by adjusted gross leverage to adjusted EBITDA, remains 1.9 times.","First quarter free cash flow was $277 million, due to the incentive compensation payments that occur in March each year. First quarter free cash flow is generally the lowest of the year. As for the return of capital, the company returned more than $1.2 billion to shareholders in the first quarter with a $1 billion ASR, $100 million in open market share repurchases, and $127 million in dividends. During the quarter, we received 0.6 million shares from open market purchases and the initial shares under the ASR of 4.5 million shares.","Now, I will review our 2018 guidance. As part of the Kensho announcement, on March 6th, we lowered our GAAP guidance by approximately $0.20 due to increased amortization of intangibles as well as retention and integration cost. This slide depicts our initial GAAP guidance and our current GAAP guidance. Please keep in mind that our guidance reflects current spot market ForEx rates.","This slide shows our adjusted guidance. The differences from our initial guidance are highlighted on this slide. Our deal-related amortization increased by $30 million to $35 million as a result of the Kensho acquisition. In addition, we will incur post-acquisition compensation expenses for replacement equity awards and retention plans as well as anticipated integration cost.","Since both of these items are excluded from our adjusted results, our adjusted diluted EPS guidance was not changed. We're pleased to have begun the year with solid first quarter results and our guidance reflects our expectation that 2018 will be a very strong year for the company.","And with that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions.","Chip Merritt","Thanks Ewout. Just a couple of instructions for our phone participants. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we will now take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our first question will come from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Sir, your line is open.","Greg Bardi","Hi. This is actually Greg calling for Manav. I just wanted to ask questions quickly on the investments that you made in Market Intelligence. I understand the margins coming down in the first quarter had some one-time items in there, but maybe you can quickly touch on some of the investments you're making on the commercial and technology side.","Ewout Steenbergen","Yes. Thank you, Greg. This is Ewout. Indeed, we have said investments in commercial and technology. In commercial, you should think about expansion of the salesforce. What we have announced today is a very strong organic revenue growth of 9%, much higher than the market growth, so we're clearly gaining market share in our Market Intelligence business. And we're investing in expansion of the salesforce in order to stimulate future organic revenue growth and sales growth in the business.","With respect to investments in technology, you should think about investments in the Market Intelligence platform. That's a key strategic priority and we expect that will also help with our commercial position in the future.","So, overall, we expect margins to improve for Market Intelligence during 2018. Market Intelligence should contribute to overall margin growth for the total company during 2018. And we expect already to see a step-up in the margins during the second quarter of this year.","Greg Bardi","Okay. That makes sense. Thanks. And then quickly, also on the subscription piece of the Ratings business, which is really strong. How should we be thinking about that growth going forward in terms of some of that growth is probably coming from the strong results that you showed in 2017 and the monitoring that you get off that versus some of the evaluation services? So, just some thoughts on the moving pieces on the subscription piece for Ratings.","Douglas Peterson","Greg, this is Doug. Let me just tell you a little bit about what are some of the components in there. I don't have the ability to tell you what the growth rates are going to be going forward. We're going to be providing you some more information about that when we get to Investor Day of some of our outlook for that. But what the components include are frequent issuer fees, our ratings valuation services, our surveillance.","And as the same way that Ewout just talked about commercial activities and having a salesforce in place, we've been investing in our commercial activities across all of our businesses, including in Ratings, for the last couple of years.","And so this last quarter and over all of 2017, we've been growing in terms of number of entities that are rated, which has increased our new entity fees, which go into the frequent issuer fees. So, that's another one of the areas. As you see more issuers coming to market as that expands throughout the year, as you see more M&A activity, which could lead to more ratings evaluation services, those are the key drivers of that area.","Greg Bardi","Okay. Thanks so much.","Douglas Peterson","Thanks Greg.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.","Alex Kramm","Yes. Thank you. Good morning everyone. Maybe just coming back to, I think, the first question asked on the margin. I think, Ewout, you noted yourself that there were no non-GAAP adjustments this quarter other than intangible amortization. So, it looks like there's not a lot of integration cost than one-timers here anymore. So, is that just a temporary blip? Or do you still see other work that you personally can do when it comes to your driving that margin upside by integrating and doing something differently in the past? If there is still more, maybe you can just highlight the biggest inefficiencies that you still see by segment.","Ewout Steenbergen","Yes, good morning Alex. I think there's so much more to be done. I can talk for the rest of this call about all the opportunities, but that would not be respectful for the next callers that have questions.","In all seriousness, absolutely, there is a lot of initiatives that we're taking. Normally, adjustments are around restructuring expenses. It could be about some legal positions or certain one-time items. You should certainly not read in anything that we have no restructuring announced during this quarter that there are no activities happening. There's a lot of opportunities with respect to efficiencies, commercial growth, new markets, new products, new concepts, collaboration commercially between the businesses, the implementation of new technology, efficiency opportunities that we have identified within the company and so on and so forth.","So, we're definitely planning to give you more insight on that during our Investor Day. But in terms of our aspiration with respect to margins, we are certainly not at a point that we are done. On the contrary, we believe there's still a lot of runway in terms of margin expansion for the company going forward.","Alex Kramm","All right. Fair enough. Thank you. And then secondly, coming back to Market Intelligence and the growth in that business and the whole enterprise pricing move, et cetera. When we talk to clients, it sounds like there's starting to be increasingly more push back to the point where I think some senior management is getting involved in some of these discussions on the pricing side.","So, just wondering, in this maybe budget-constrained world, do you feel like you're having a harder time making the case for pricing increases? Or do you still feel like you have a -- you have all the tools to use that lever going forward? Maybe it's better for Mike Chinn, but I mean, if you have a view that would be helpful, too.","Ewout Steenbergen","Yes, Alex, it's always hard to react to anecdotal examples because we have a lot of anecdotal examples where actually we become aware of changes to enterprise-wide agreements where the customers are very happy. It's a very good transition. In effect, it provides a lot of additional value and a lot of more users for the platform than what we have now. And you've seen we've announced 14% increase in active users for the platform.","So, overall, we don't recognize this particular trends or signal that you're giving to us today. We believe that the transition to enterprise-wide agreement is going in a very positive and constructive way.","Alex Kramm","Fair enough. Thanks again.","Ewout Steenbergen","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Kramm. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Your line is open sir.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is [Indiscernible] filling in for Hamzah. Can you give us -- can you walk us through how you're thinking about the Platts business in both an oil up-cycle and down-cycle?","Douglas Peterson","Yes. This is Doug. Let me start with that. First of all, because our business is generally is a subscription business, we've seen over the years more stability than other organization that are more dependent on consulting or transaction-type approach. We do have the GTS business as you know which is a transaction-oriented business, but the core base of our business has given us a stability over time and where we continue to take advantage of that.","What we've seen typically in up-cycles is that there's more investment, there's more spending. And then when you see down-cycle, there's a pullback from the industry. As you know, actually using Ratings information from the past few years, the oil and gas sectors been out, which has the higher number of defaults and delinquencies and bankruptcies, which in some ways had some negative pressure as well.","But we see that the oil industry is getting back to an investment mode. We think that there's going to be a range of oil prices from our experts in the Platts business between $45 to $70 range, although it's above the $70 range right now. And that we've built our plan for oil prices that are kind of in that range.","So, we see -- over time, we see a steady growth in this business and we see compared to many of the other business models, we think that we have a more a smoother approach to how we can see that growth coming in.","Unidentified Analyst","All right. Thanks for that color. And then unrelated question. Can you frame for us how you're seeing the bond issuance longer term going forward in light of the higher interest rates? And then specifically, throughout the cycle may be different versus the past cycles?","Douglas Peterson","Yes, well, first of all as you know there's a couple of factors which we know drive bond growth -- bond issuance growth. The first is GDP growth. And so GDP growth has continue to be strong, in fact, our U.S. Chief Economist has increased our expectations for growth in the U.S. market this year up to 2.9% because of the tax reform that added about 500 to 600 basis points to that growth. And so we underlying most important factor for bond issuance is GDP growth.","Secondly, overall spread does have an impact on what happens with issuance. We see right now, in the first quarter this year, as we moved into this year, bond spreads are continuing to be very, very tight. The investment-grade composite was about 123 basis points in the most recent numbers of last week and speculative grade is up about 295, close to 300 basis points, but those are very tight compared to historic averages. ","But we look at interest rates. The last few days, there was a lot of people talking about the 3% 10-year bond rate. But if you look historically, bond rates have been low the last five or six years, but historically, 3% bond rate would have been very low because if you look at that how that links to inflation. So, there's a number of factors. Its underlying growth rate in the GDP, it's what are the spreads, it's what are interest rates, what are inflation expectation, but we really look at economic growth as a key driver of bond issuance overall.","Unidentified Analyst","All right. Thanks a lot.","Douglas Peterson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Mazari. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Jeff Goldstein","Hey, this is Jeff Goldstein on for Toni. I know there was some reinvestment within indices last year causing pretty flattish margin there, but you had a pretty healthy step-up this quarter. Should we be interpreting that to mean that reinvestment are there largely and we should be anticipating a higher flow through your revenue this year? Thanks.","Ewout Steenbergen","Overall, our approach with the indices business is that we would like to grow that business as fast as we can in that mid-60% of margin range. So, we have seen indeed margins going up this quarter based on the exceptional exchange-traded derivatives volumes, but the question is if that will continue. Of course, that depends a lot on market volatility. It's directly correlated to market volatility, but that shouldn't be a kind of new objective for the company to stay at this particular margin level.","I think you should continue with the expectation of we would like to reinvest, to grow the indices business, invest in new initiatives and products and concepts like fixed income indices, like smart beta, like ESG, like international. And we would like to do that within the room we create by growing this business in that mid-60% margin kind of range.","Jeff Goldstein","Okay, great. And then it looked like your international ratings growth was a lot higher than domestic in the quarter despite pretty tough comps at both. Can you talk about what you're seeing internationally that helped drive that growth? Thanks.","Douglas Peterson","Yes. If you go to the issuance overall, Europe was actually quite strong this quarter. There were both a combination of structured finance coming out of Europe that was a very strong market for RMBS, CMBS, ABS, covered bonds, et cetera.","And then across our Asian business, you did -- you also saw some growth from the business. We do not issue Chinese domestic bonds, but across Asia, there was growth there. But generally speaking, the main part of our drivers of the last quarter were in Europe.","Jeff Goldstein","All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Your line is open.","Craig Huber","Yes, hi. Thank you. My first question, Doug, can you just update us on your thoughts on global debt issuance, your expectation this year? I think before you've talked about flat -- slightly down for the year. And in particular, can you talk about what your outlook is for bank loans, what seems like a rising rate environment? Then I have a follow-up. Thank you.","Douglas Peterson","Yes. A couple of things there. I think, on the overall issuance, we just issued our update on our global forecast for the year. Even though the number itself shows that there's an expectation that the total issuance will be down about 2% to 2.3%. If you exclude what we would consider to be international public finance that we don't rate.","Overall, it looks like it still down about 1%. Its different components. Overall, corporate, globally, we think are going to be down for the entire year for various reasons, 2% or so. Financial services still could see some upside, even though in the first quarter it was weak.","There are organizations in Europe and Asia, a few in the United States that are still basically putting longer term debt on their balance sheet, TLAC, things like that. Structured finance is where we think we're going to see the strongest issuance this year for various reasons. It's for balance sheet purposes.","And then finally, U.S. public finance is the area that we see as the weakest for the year, where our full year expectations are down over 30%. And you saw that in the first quarter.","When it comes to loan issuance and CLOs, there's still a lot of demand for floating rate instruments. And that's one of the drivers. It's not just the deal activity itself, LBOs and structured deals that are taking place that drive the loan demand -- the loan issuance side. There's also a lot of demand from the investor side for floating rate investments and this is especially in this environment where there's a lot more volatility in the market, the demand for floating rate is still up.","So, we expect that the loan business is becoming a bigger business. Not only has it just become larger because there's more activity, but it's also become larger because a much higher percentage of it is rated than it used to be in the past. So, we believe that the loan market will continue forward. I don't have a specific projection for it, but we do think that it will continue to be strong in this kind of an environment.","Craig Huber","And then my other question, you touched on this a little bit, but on in Platts, the slow growth, roughly 2.5% on the topline being hurt by your trading operation. Can you just touch a little bit further about what exactly happened in the quarter? And then why are you optimistic that overall Platts revenue growth may improve as the year goes on?","Ewout Steenbergen","Craig, if we look at the different components, the core subscription business, the price reporting business, we see healthy growth both in revenues. And another indicator we're looking at is annual contract value, which is an indicator of future growth, that particular revenue category. So, we see healthy growth, positive development. And hopefully, with stronger commodity markets in the future, we could see some further improvement there.","Global trading services, as you are highlighting, is down. That can move around a bit quarter-by-quarter. It depends very much on the volume of certain products and indices that we have built together, mostly with ICE. And what kind of those products are seeing more volume and lower volume for quarter-to-quarter. So that can move around a bit. But overall, we are managing our business, as you know, not on a quarter basis, but on a full year basis. So, therefore, we are confident that Platts should be able to contribute to the overall margin expansion of the company for the full year.","Craig Huber","Thank you.","Ewout Steenbergen","Thanks Craig.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeff Silber","Thanks so much. Actually just a follow-up on the margin side. Ewout, you've mentioned a few times that you expect margins to increase year-over-year for all the segments. Again, I know you don't manage the business on a quarterly basis, but you started off in a hole in Market Intelligence and in Platts. And what gives you the confidence that margins will expand for the rest of the year in those segments?","Ewout Steenbergen","First of all, Jeff, I would like to point out that if you would not have done that $20 million contribution to the foundation, the overall margins would have improved by more than 100 basis points for the company during the first quarter. So, just to put that in perspective.","But focusing in on the two segments that you are mentioning, Market Intelligence has seen particularly certain expenses that were more timing-related. That should reverse during the rest of the year, and some expenses that we don't expect to occur at the same level during the remainder of the year. There was specific impact from foreign exchange, -- ASC 606, fringe, and many other categories. So, a lot of moving parts there.","But overall, we expect that that expense level should be different going forward. And therefore, with improvement of the revenue topline and you have seen the 9% organic growth in Platts, that therefore we should be able to see margin improvement for Market Intelligence.","With respect to Platts, let me put the margin of Platts a bit into perspective. So, if we look back to 2017, expenses were more backend-loaded. And this is expenses with respect to initiatives, discretionary spend, variable expenses. And therefore, we saw a trend of margins going down during 2017 from 51% in the first quarter down to 44% in the fourth quarter of 2017. And the full year margin for Platts during the during 2017 was 47%.","So, we started the year with 48% margins for Platts, which is above the fourth quarter and above the full year 2017. We expect expenses to be more even this year. So, therefore, also, March is to be more stable during the course of 2018. And therefore, we are confident that Platts should also contribute to overall margin expansion for the company during the full year.","Jeff Silber","All right. Really appreciate the color. That's helpful. And in terms of the follow-up, I want to shift gears to the Indices basis. Obviously, the numbers continue to be very impressive. But I'm just curious, do you think you're gaining share in that market? And if so, are there any ETFs or are there any specific markets that you're stronger than your competitors? Thanks so much.","Douglas Peterson","Yes, this is Doug. That's a difficult question to answer in terms of gaining share. What we can look at is what's the overall size of the asset management market and how that's growing as well as what is the component of the total asset management market globally that's in different types of passive or indexed strategies.","But there's a lot of movement within different asset class allocations between U.S., between global, with local, regional assets, et cetera. But we know if you look at the large cap U.S. market, we have a large share of that. Obviously, with S&P 500 being the being a very large component of the index position of that market.","So, we don't have a very specific market share itself, but we do see that there that we've done very well and there continues to be a big movement into index and passive strategies and we benefit from that.","Even if funds move from active to passive and they originally start in international position that we don't have. As they move around from different types of passive strategies, we, at some point, usually see a benefit from that.","Jeff Silber","All right. Thank you so much.","Douglas Peterson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Silber. Our next question is from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your question.","Joseph Foresi","Hi. I wanted to stick with indexing. I'm particularly wondering about the impact from fixed income and some of the newer areas and what the contributions are starting to look like?","Douglas Peterson","Fixed income is still, for us, a pretty small area. We have total revenues in there below -- it's about $30 million a year in total. But it's something that we can give you some more information on that when we get to Investor Day. But it's a nascent area.","In fact, for the total market, globally, fixed income indices is still a pretty small component of all the different investment portfolios. It's a new area. It's one that we believe is going to get a lot bigger. We want to play a much bigger position in it. But as of today, it's a very small component of our revenues.","Joseph Foresi","Okay. And then just maybe an update on the progress with Kensho and Panjiva.","Ewout Steenbergen","Yes, let me comment on Kensho. It is, of course, very early days. We closed the transaction two and half weeks ago. There's a lot of enthusiasm about this acquisition as well as about Panjiva because of the new datasets that Panjiva is bringing, the technology, the expertise that both companies are bringing, the data scientists, and the quality of the people that are coming to our organization.","With respect to Kensho, as you know, it is about $20 million in revenues that they have today with a small loss, which we will absorb in corporate unallocated. So, therefore, you won't see that showing up on an adjusted basis. But we will work on many projects that we have identified. And we will keep you updated on the economic benefits of those projects along the way. We will have a particular section during our Investor Day, where there will be a panel with Daniel Nadler and a couple of other people giving you more insight in Kensho. So, we'll definitely come back to you during Investor Day with a couple of more concrete examples.","Joseph Foresi","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question is from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray. Sir, you may ask your question.","Peter Appert","Thank you. Good morning. So, the Ratings margin performance is quite impressive in the context of a tougher regulatory environment. Any color you can share in terms of mix or cost initiative that's driving this performance? And then I'm also interested in any perspective on longer term targets in terms of where you think margins can go in Ratings.","Douglas Peterson","Peter, this is Doug. When it comes to longer-term margins, we'll provide some more of that when we get to Investor Day. But in terms of mix, you've heard me say before that we can have a very weak quarter and that over time, we know that there's going to be a lot of volatility in issuance. And we saw a very weak quarter in corporate, financial institutions, public finance, et cetera.","The overall global issuance was down 5%. If you take out structured finance, it was down even a lot more than that. But it's still a business that there's a couple of aspects we have to think about. First is the kind of mix of actual issuance itself. So, as you see more mix, as we know normally, lower-rated structured finance transactions or structured finance transaction, high-yield transactions, typically have a higher margin component, high revenue component.","But at the same time, we've also been able to balance our business with non-transaction-type fees from frequent issuer fees, from bringing more issuance into the business. So, we've been able to get through a very tough quarter because of the mix of our business as well as the mix of the issuance.","And as I've always said, we could see some very weak quarters, very tough quarters. And we think we just had one. There might be somewhere ahead given the volatility that we're starting to see in the markets, but we're trying to manage the business on the type topline.","But then as you've seen over time, we've done a couple of different restructuring reserves and restructuring actions, so we're also managing our expenses very tightly. But at the same time, we are investing in innovation. And there are innovations we're taking in terms of sustainability indices, ESG indices, Green Bond Evaluations, et cetera. Those are all very small now, but we think that over time, they're going to be important for us to build more revenue, but also importantly, maintain a relevance in our markets.","Ewout Steenbergen","So, Peter, let me add one thing here, because I think a lot of you folks are scratching your heads about the non-transaction. So, there's a number of components in non-transaction that Doug has alluded to. But the important thing is every single one of them was up. That doesn't normally happen in a particular quarter. So, annual fees, surveillance up. That's not abnormal. Our frequent issuer fees are up. Our program fees, that's commercial paper, commercial paper is up. The new entities, we have a surge of new entities coming in, that's up. RES, a lot of M&A activity, that's up. Intersegment royalty, so the business we get from Cap IQ, that's up. So, it's not common that every single component of non-transaction is up in a given quarter, but they did this quarter.","Peter Appert","Got it. Thank you for that. And Ewout, can you talk a little bit about the $22 million for legal settlements? I guess I was a little surprised the number was still so large. What's driving that? And how much more might we anticipate on that front?","Ewout Steenbergen","Yes, there was no particular legal settlement charge during the quarter from an accounting perspective. You might have looked at it from a cash perspective, so this was a payout of a reserve we have already established last year. We are very much at the end of the pipeline with respect to cases for the financial crisis. There's still a very few cases that are going on at this point in time. Obviously, we cannot further comment on that, but I would say we're very much at the end of the pipeline with respect to financial crisis cases.","Peter Appert","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Appert. Our next question is from Vincent Hung with Autonomous. Sir, your line is open.","Vincent Hung","Hi. Yes. Just on the Market Intelligence expenses, you talked about the higher data cost. Can you just give us a bit of color here what that relates to? Is it exchange data? Is it pricing data?","Ewout Steenbergen","That is -- Vincent, that is overall just data with respect to new products and new datasets we put on the platform. I would look at that as directly correlated with volume growth, business growth, revenue growth, customer growth. We're trying to expand our platform, adding new content, and therefore, new datasets.","So, for me, this is a variable cost, which is directly correlated with the strong organic growth we see in the business, again emphasizing the 9% organic growth we have seen in Market Intelligence this quarter.","Vincent Hung","Got it. And can you talk about Ratings 360 in terms of how you plan to use that to expand the value proposition to customers? And any feedback you've received from issuers so far?","Ewout Steenbergen","Yes. Ratings 360 is a replacement of a tool we used to have called My Credit Portal, which was a way that we could have a connectivity to issuers, so treasurers and CFOs. We're replacing that with Ratings 360, which is a much more dynamic platform and has more information on it. It allows us to have a dialogue or connectivity electronically between the issuers and the analysts.","We're also seeing the ability to add new data, new information to that, which makes it even more relevant for issuers to have the relationship with us. So, we see the feedback is excellent. We're continuing to improve it and to build it and to move it out. And so I'm really pleased with where we started with Ratings 360 and it's something that we will also talk more about in our Investor Day.","Vincent Hung","Thanks.","Ewout Steenbergen","Thanks Vincent.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Hung. Our next question is from Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company. Your line is open for your question sir.","Trevor Romeo","Hi, good morning. This is actually Trevor Romeo on for Tim today. Thanks for taking our questions. Just wanted to touch on the trading revenues for the Index segment. That was obviously driven up by the volatility in the quarter. But how sustainable is growth there going forward? Are there other factors beyond volatility that would drive further growth? Or do you see that kind of just continuing despite up and down with volatility?","Ewout Steenbergen","That is -- revenue is actually driven by transactions, so you should expect to see some volatility in it. We benefited tremendously this quarter from that volatility and from the level of transactions, but that revenue is pretty much directly linked to transaction volumes.","Trevor Romeo","Okay. Thanks. And then also on the Index segment, the asset-linked fees were pretty strong even with a little bit of a decrease sequentially in AUM. Just wondering if you could maybe give us an update on the pricing you're getting for that business, maybe if you're not seeing as much fee compression there lately. Thanks.","Ewout Steenbergen","Trevor, two comments on the fee revenue with respect to asset-linked fees. First of all, we're comparing, of course, first quarter 2017 to first quarter 2018. So, year-over-year, there's a significant increase in the asset levels.","And secondly, the fees that we generate is based on average AUM, so it's on the daily average of the asset balances of those products. So, you shouldn't look at a quarter end number because if there is a healthy development with respect to average asset levels, but markets come down at the end of the quarter, then the fees are much higher because it is generated over the average AUM. So that is to put it into perspective.","We do, of course, have the declining scales with respect to the fees and basis points over those exchange-traded products. But the flip side is that the marginal cost are very low. So, therefore, the incremental benefits of the additional volume is very high. The flow through to the bottom-line is very high. So, on a trade-off basis in terms of volume growth versus the fee structures we have in place, it's very favorable for the company when the volumes are going up.","Trevor Romeo","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Ewout Steenbergen","Thanks Trevor.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question is from Conor Fitzgerald with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open for your question sir.","Conor Fitzgerald","Good morning. Most of my questions have been asked. Just one for me. But just wondering if you're seeing any increased competition for talent and how we should be thinking about that impacting your compensation expense? It seems that we've heard a couple of management teams talking about a tighter labor market this quarter, particularly on the technology side of their business. Just wondering if you're seeing that in your business as well and how we should think about that impacting you as well?","Douglas Peterson","This is definitely one of the most important topics that we discussed about with our Board of Directors and our operating committee, and that is the high quality of people that we already have in our company and the high quality of people we will attract to the company. Clearly, the technology space is one that is a very competitive market.","We are seeing, obviously, a what you might want the call a war for talent. But any of the expected expenses enable to fund that, to train and develop our people, to ensure that we have great leadership in the company, that's included in all of the estimates and the guidance that we've given you.","Conor Fitzgerald","Thanks very much.","Douglas Peterson","Thanks Conor.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Fitzgerald. We will now take our final question from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Sir your line is open.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","Hey good morning guys. So, quick follow-up on Platts GTS revenues. Are there specific ICE products that you would point us to look at in terms of driving those GTS revenues? Because as we look at overall ICE energy volumes, they were up, I think, about 3% versus 1Q 2017. So, I'm guessing there's a very specific subset that's more relevant for you guys?","Ewout Steenbergen","Patrick, that is fair to say because if you look at the ICE overall trading volumes are up. And then if you look at our GTS, revenue for Platts, you see a decline. So of course, that raises the question of, how is that possible?","Our licensing agreements give us some significant exposure to certain contracts that we had built together with ICE. To mention a few of those products, the Singapore fuel oil, Dubai, but not to all others. So, it's very much the mix of the type of business and volumes of the trading activity on the ICE platform that will impact. And again, that can move around quarter-to-quarter.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Douglas Peterson","Thank you, Patrick. Well, I see that we've come to the end of the people in the queue for the call. I just want to thank everyone again that we're very pleased to have launched 2018 with very, very strong first quarter results.","As you've heard, we're going to continue to focus on our topline growth, customer experience, our commitment to improving our margins, which I hope comes through very clear.","You'll also hear from us throughout the year about our new corporate-wide emphasis on technology, specifically on Kensho's impact on our company. And we look forward to seeing all of you on our Investor Day in about another month or so. And thank you this morning for your comments, questions, and your ongoing interest. Thank you very much.","Operator","That concludes this morning's call. A PDF version of the presenters' slides is available now for downloading from investor.spglobal.com.

Sir, you may begin.","Chip Merritt","Thank you and good morning. And welcome to S&P Global's earnings call. Presenting on this morning's call are Doug Peterson, President and CEO; and Ewout Steenbergen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","This morning, we issued a news release with our third quarter 2017 results. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they could be downloaded at investor.spglobal.com.","In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we're providing adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the corporation's operating performance between periods and to view the corporation's business from the same perspective as managements. The earnings release contains Exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measures and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.","Before we begin, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements.

We are aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Jason Feuchtwanger at 212-438-1247.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?","Douglas Peterson","Good morning. Thank you, Chip. Welcome everyone to the call today. Consistent with the first half of the year, the company delivered another solid quarter. The underlying environment for business is unfavorable with global GDP growth in every geography, higher and stable commodity prices, strong equity markets and modest growth in US bond issuance. With this backdrop, S&P Global is doing well.","Let me begin with the third quarter highlights. We attained strong organic revenue and adjusted operating profit in every segment. We delivered 190 basis points of adjusted profit margin improvement and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 19%. As a result of our year-to-date performance, our expectations for the remainder of the year, we're increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a range of 6.55 to 6.70.","We will complete our $500 million ASR agreement and believe that reinvesting in our stock represents a great investment and a good use of our cash. We returned $604 million through share repurchases and dividends, bringing our year-to-date total to 1.2 billion. We continue to focus on delivering meaningful revenue growth, launching new products, investing in productivity and returning capital to shareholders.","Looking more closely at the financial results, the company reported 5% revenue growth and achieved 12% on an organic basis. The company achieved 190 basis points improvement in adjusted operating profit margin due to strong organic revenue growth, the sale of lower margin businesses, and productivity initiatives. We delivered 19% adjusted diluted EPS growth. There was some puts and takes to these figures, recorded $0.03 a share unfavorable impact for ForEx and $0.14 a share favorable impact from stock option exercises, both of which Ewout will discuss in a moment.","What I would like to do first is, provide a bit more color on some of the current and future drivers of our businesses. Let me start with bank loan ratings, which has been a growing part of the ratings business over the past few years. Bank loan ratings are primarily issued on leveraged loans typically rated BB+ or lower. Over the past few years both the volume of leveraged loans and the percent of leveraged loans rated by S&P have increased.","During the quarter bank loan revenue of $83 million was a key factor in the revenue growth of the rating segment. This chart shows the US leveraged loan inventory with each part depicting leveraged loans maturing in the next eight years as of the end of each period. At the end of 2014 for example, $809 billion was going to mature in the following years. At the end of 2015 850 billion was going to mature in the next eight years and so on. The total amount of outstanding leveraged loans has increased each other at a compounded annual growth rate of 11% since 2011.","When tracking issuance data, we always try to point out to where issuance takes place, which type of issuance and the size of the deals make a difference in the revenue we realize. Global issuance in the third quarter excluding sovereign debt decreased slightly. Structured finance sovereign was quite strong. Geographically issuance in the US increased 5% in the third quarter with investment-grade increasing 9%, high-yield increasing 1%, public finance down 19% and structured finance increasing 26% due primarily to the strength in CLOs and CMBS.","In Europe, issuance decreased 17% in the quarter with investment-grade declining 22%, high-yield decreasing 29% and structured finance increasing 13%, with strength in CLOs and RMBS. In Asia, issuance increased 4%. The vast majority of Asian issuance however is made up of local China debt that we don't rate.","Ratings recently published its final issuance forecast for 2017 combined with its initial 2018 forecast. This forecast provides a range of issuance estimates for each of the major issuance categories. For 2017, excluding international public finance which is not material to our results. We expect a medium increase of approximately 2% in 2017 and approximately 1% in 2018 in overall issuance, where both financial services and structured finance are forecasted to increase in both years, U.S. public finance is forecasted to decline in both years.","Our cautious outlook is primarily due to the expectation that most developed countries' central banks will begin to bring in a monetary stimulus and non-financial monetary programs. And many financial markets have reached new heights in low volatility and it has become more likely that in 2018 market volatility will increase.","Here is a new chart that shows how U.S. investment-grade corporations utilize bond proceeds. Issuance for M&A, buybacks and refinancing depicted in the bottom three colors of each bar has increased considerably in recent years. There has been a material raise in debt financed M&A and share buybacks since 2013 as investors have become more comfortable with blockbuster offers. Note that of the largest 40 deals ever printed nearly all had been transacted since 2013 for M&A or buybacks.","Results in our investment-grade financial sector issuance, which can make up as much as half of total issuance is included in the general corporate purpose category. If we take a look at U.S. high-yield issuance over the same timeframe, we see that the high-yield issuance is much more heavily dependent on refinancing needs than the investment grade market. High-yield borrower's general issuance bonds to maturing debt are for specific M&A or recapitalization efforts.","Finally providing let me share some of the progress we have made with our Green Evaluations. Propelled by the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, and the impetus it created to finance $1 trillion a year in investments for renewable energy and other initiatives to limit global warming, Green investment is on a firm upward trajectory. S&P Global Ratings launched its Green Evaluations in April and it includes evaluations of buildings, transport, energy efficiency, water, traditional power plants and nuclear. We are encouraged by the acceptance of our Green Evaluations in the market.","This slide includes some of the global bonds we have evaluated today, such as the Mexico Airport Trust and the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority subordinated revenue bond. Within Market Intelligence, we continue to extend our capabilities of our offering during the quarter. First, we launched RatingsDirect monitor, which features real time, visually interactive in intuitive ways for end users to receive information that is relevant to the company's investment and counterparty portfolio.","Second is an expansion of SNL data available via Data Feed. Historically, SNL is a very small data feed business. Earlier this year we began adding certain SNL data sets to Xpressfeed, our data feed management system. During the third quarter, we rolled out new alternative and unstructured data sets through Xpressfeed such as the regulatory data, bank branch data, real estate property data and corporate transcripts. This should prove valuable to investor seeking new sources of alternative data that can help uncover relationships and new alpha generating ideas.","Third is enhanced credit analytics workflow, which facilitates counterparty analysis and integration of SNL data. It also expands model coverage to include loss given default for Europe and the Middle-East as well as relative contribution analysis and 30 years term structures.","Turning to Platts, we often share new product launches, but today I want to share with you progress made on a launch from a few years ago. In the past, we have discussed the increasingly important role that LNG will play in unifying global natural gas market. Platts, Japan, Korea Marker is the LNG benchmark price assessment for spot physical cargos delivered into Japan and South Korea. As these countries take the largest share of LNG imports in the world, Platts JKM has become a key reference price for the physical shipment, and as often the case when a physical market develops, market participants want to be able to hedge their position.","This chart shows the surge in monthly JKM swap volumes on ICE. Volume depicted here represents a total amount of trading activity or contracts that have changed hands during the month. Open interest is the total number of outstanding contracts that are held by market participants.","Next, I'd like to share with you several new products in S&P Dow Jones Indices. The first is the launch of the S&P\/BMV IPC VIX Index in conjunction with the Mexican stock exchange. This index utilizes the same methodology as the CBOE Volatility Index. Second is the launch of the corporate carbon pricing tool, which helps companies assess exposure to regional carbon pricing mechanism. The tool combines the company's greenhouse gas emissions and financial performance data with Trucost regional carbon pricing information to provide insights on carbon pricing risk after 2030.","Trucost has accumulated a global database of current carbon regulation, emissions trading schemes, fuel taxes and potential featured carbon pricing scenarios designed to achieve the goal of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 2\u00b0 centigrade or less.","Third, Transamerica Asset Management has launched four new strategic beta ETFs designed to provide core equity strategies with an embedded risk management feature called the DeltaShares by Transamerica suite, the new ETFs first attract the S&P Managed Risk 2.0 index series, which offers exposure to a given segment of the equity market while seeking to control volatility. Even though ETFs were only launched in July two of them have market caps that are among the top 10 of the new ETF launches this year.","And fourth is a strategic investment in Algomi. Algomi is an innovative fintech company that has created a bond information network that enables buy side and sell side firms, as well as exchanges, to harness data to improve financial trading decisions allowing for greater transparency and artificial intelligence-powered trade facilitation.","With that color, let me turn the call over to Ewout who will provide more specifics on our business results during the quarter. Ewout?","Ewout Steenbergen","Thank you, Doug, and good morning to everyone on the call. This morning, I would like to discuss the third quarter results and then provide specifics on our increased 2017 guidance.","Doug already discussed the 12% growth in organic revenue and a 19% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. I'd like to touch on a few other line items. First, I would like to point the $12 million increase in adjusted unallocated expense in two perspectives. About one-third was due to due to a company-wide IT project to replace our order to cash system. About one-third was for professional service fees, encouraged to identify additional growth and productivity opportunities. We believe that this will be the big quarter for spending on both of these initiatives. The final one-third was for performance related incentive compensation.","Second, the adjusted effective tax rate of 27.9% improved primarily due to the discrete tax benefit on stock option exercises which I will review in a moment. And third, our ongoing share repurchase program coupled with our recent ASR led to a 7.4 million decrease or 3% decline in average diluted shares outstanding.","During our fourth quarter of 2016 earnings call, we noted a recent FASB guidance change for accounting of stock payments to employees which we estimated at the time would increase 2017 EPS by $0.10 to $0.15 depending on SPGI's share price and option exercise activity. This change also impacts EPS whenever the fair market value of employee stock grants exceeds the grant price. The impact is recorded as a reduction in tax expense.","Due to exceptionally high levels of option exercises, during the third quarter from private and recently retired employees we recorded a reduction in tax expenses that improved third quarter adjusted EPS by $0.14. It is difficult to estimate the impact in future quarters, but let me make two observations that should be helpful.","First, the company no longer grants stock options and at the end of the third quarter there were 2.1 million employee stock options outstanding. When the stock options are exercised assuming that they are still in the money there would be a tax benefit. Second, the company continues to grant restrictive stock. Each year in the fourth quarter an average range of restrictive stock units will pass and provide a tax benefit whenever the fair market value of the stock exceeds the grant's price.","For the fourth quarter of 2017, if we assume more stock options are exercised and the stock remains at today's stock price, we estimate that we will record a tax benefit of approximately $0.07 in the fourth quarter associated with restrictive stock. This amount is included in our updated guidance.","Net of hedges, foreign exchange rates, had $4 million positive impact on the company's revenue and $12 million negative impact on adjusted operating profit or about $0.03 per share in the third quarter. The bulk of the impact was in the ratings segment. Ratings adjusted operating profit was primarily impacted by the Australian dollar and British pound. Taken together, the quarter included a $0.14 gain in stock option exercises, a $0.03 loss from FOREX and adjusted unallocated expenses that were much higher than our annual run rate.","Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. Pre-tax adjustments to earnings totaled to a loss of $19 million in the quarter and included restructuring actions in Ratings and Corporate. We anticipate that these restructuring actions will result an annual savings of approximately $30 million. Despite strong year-to-date results we are continuously looking for opportunities to transition to lean our more effective organizations. In addition, we excluded $24 million in due related amortization expense.","In the third quarter, led by Ratings every business segment contributed to gain organic revenue. The reported revenue decline in market and commodities intelligence was due to several divestitures. Each business segment reported adjusted operating profit growth, market and commodities intelligence reported a 1% gain in adjusted operating profit as organic growth and synergies more than made up for the lost profitability associated with the divestitures. I'm pleased with the adjusted operating margin improvement in Ratings and market and commodities intelligence.","Well I'll just discuss Indices margins in more detail in a moment, let me just say that we want to invest intelligently in such a high margin business, while simultaneously maintaining a disciplined cost structure. Let me now turn to the individual segments' performance. I will start with Ratings.","Ratings revenue increased 15% or 14% excluding a favorable impact from FOREX. Adjusted operating profit increased 19%, while the adjusted operating margin increased 170 basis points to 53%. As we have said in the past, we managed our Ratings business on a rolling four quarters basis, and you can see on that basis the adjusted operating margin increased 270 basis points.","Both transaction and non-transaction revenue recorded strong growth. Non-transaction revenue increased to 7% due primarily to growth in fees associated with surveillance, entity ratings and short-term debts including commercial paper. Transaction revenue increased 24% primarily from gains, U.S. corporate bonds, global structured products and European bank loans.","If you look at the Ratings' revenue by its various markets, you can see the greatest gains were in corporates and structured finance. Bank loan ratings are part of corporates and boosted results in this market. Structured finance increased primarily due to strong CLO activity in both the U.S. and Europe as well as increased CMBS activity in the U.S. The only market that declined was governments due to the 19% decline in U.S. public finance issuance that Doug mentioned.","Let me now turn to market and commodities intelligence. This segment includes S&P Global market intelligence and S&P Global Platts. In the quarter, the third quarter, reported revenue declined 6% due to divestitures. Excluding divestiture and acquisition activity, organic revenue increased 7%. Despite the loss of earnings associated with divestitures, adjusted operating profit improved 1% due to organic growth and synergies realization. Adjusted operating margin improved 270 basis points primarily due to strong organic revenue growth, the sale of lower margin businesses and SNL integration synergies.","Turning to Market Intelligence, excluding recent divestitures organic revenue grew 8%. There are three primary reasons behind this growth. First, we serve a diverse set of segments beyond Wall Street, including corporations, banks, insurance, professional service firms and others. Several of these have better underlying growth characteristics than investment banks and investment management. Second, we serve all of those segments from the largest to smaller companies and grow our contract values as our clients grow.","Third, our renewal rates and sales performance are strong as we enhance the product, train customers and leverage our unique and proprietary conduct. One area greatest growth can be seen is in the number of SNL, S&P Capital IQ and risk surfaces desktop users, which expanded 13% year-over-year. Emphasis continues to be on instituting enterprise-wide commercial agreements and combining desktop platforms, approximately one-third of RatingsDirect and Capital IQ desktop business has been conferred to enterprise-wide commercial agreements.","With respect to combining desktop platforms, two events will occur in early November. First, we will launch a product of the new Market Intelligence desktop for all SNL customers. This will have an updated look and feel, will contain all SNL content and the new Capital IQ content and functionality. Second, we will launch an official beta release of the new combined platform for investment banking customers after just completing a successful preview campaign with selective users.","Looking more deeply at Market Intelligence revenue, all three components delivered a strong organic revenue growth. Desktop products grew 8%, enterprise solutions had been renamed data management solutions and revenue increased 9% leading growth of Market Intelligence. This surface has grown 5% with Ratings Xpress and RatingsDirect providing high and mid-single digits respectively. And finally note that about $37 million of revenue in the third quarter of 2016 from businesses that were divested.","Turning to Platts, organic revenue growth fixed higher, up to 4% growth in the first half of the year, Platts delivered 6% organic revenue growth in the third quarter. This growth was due to the poor subscription business which grew mid-single digits and Global Ratings services revenue which increased by more than 20%. The effective trading was strong at the intercontinental exchange in oil and at the Singapore exchange with iron ore.","If you look at Platts revenue by its four primary markets, you can see that petroleum and power and gas makeup the majority of the business. Platts growth this quarter came primarily from petroleum which benefited from solids of subscription growth and strong global trading activity. In addition petrochemicals contributed 6% growth and metals and agriculture returned to growth with a strong recovery in global trading services revenues. Please note that there was $9 million of revenue in the third quarter of 2017 from the PIRA acquisition.","Let me now turn to Indices. Revenue increased 14% mostly due to continued growth in ETF assets under management. Adjusted operating profit increased 10%, adjusted operating margin decreased 190 basis points to 64.3%, as revenue gains were partially offset by increased expenses related to performance driven costs and investments. Performance driven costs includes sales royalties paid to our partners, sales commissions and incentives. And investments include true cost expenses, expansions in India and Mexico and technology.","Asset-liked fees, which are principally derived from ETFs, mutual funds and certain OTC derivatives experienced greatest growth in the third quarter rising 17%, driven by 31% increase in average ETF AUM. Subscription revenue increased 6%, due to growth in data subscriptions and custom indices. Exchange rate of derivative revenue rose 6%, with gains in S&P 500 Index options and fixed futures and options activity.","The trends of assets moving into passive investments was again very strong in the third quarter, with the exchange traded products industry reaching net inflows of $124 billion. The quarter ending ETF AUM guide to our indices totaled $1.214 trillion, up 33% versus the third quarter of 2016. As the chart shows this was the result of $150 billion of net inflows and $150 billion of market appreciation over the last 12 months. The $1.214 Trillion was a new record.","The third quarter average AUM associated with our indices increased 31% year-over-year and this is a better proxy for revenue changes than the quarter-end figures. Exchange rate of the derivatives volume most mixed. Key contracts include increased S&P 500 index options and fixed futures and options activities which experienced robust activity and a decline in activity at the CME equity complex.","Now, turning to our capital position, there was little change from the end of the fourth quarter of 2016. We now have $2.3 billion of cash and $3.6 billion of long term debt. $2.1 billion of this cash was held outside the United States at the end of the third quarter. Our debt coverage as measured by adjusted growth leverage to adjusted EBITDA was 2.0 times versus 2.1 times at the end of 2016. Year-to-date free cash flow was $1.1 billion dollars of which nearly 500 million was generated during the third quarter.","As for return of the capital, the company returned $604 million to shareholders in the third quarter, $500 million through an accelerated share repurchase program with 2.8 million shares received in the third quarter and additional shares expected when the program is completed at the end of October and 104 million in dividends.","Now, I will review our updated 2017 guidance. Based upon strong year-to-date results and our expectation for the remainder of 2017, we have made several changes to our 2017 guidance. This slide epics our GAAP guidance and the changes that we have made. Please keep in mind that our guidance reflects current spot market ForEx rates.","This slide shows our updated adjusted guidance. The changes are highlighted on this slide. I'm going to discuss the changes to our adjusted guidance which were as follows. We have increased our organic revenue growth from high single-digit to low double-digit growth, with contributions by every business segment.","We have increased our unallocated expense from a range of $130 million to $135 million to a range of $135 million to $140million, driven by continued IT spend and higher incentive compensation. We have increased our operating profit margin guidance from a range of 45% to 46% to a range of 46% to 47%.","We have lowered interest expense by $5 million to $145 million and we have increased diluted EPS, which excludes deal-related amortization from a prior range of $6.15 to $6.30 to a new range of $6.55 to $6.70. Overall, this guidance reflects our expectation that 2017 will be a very strong year for the company.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions.","Chip Merritt","Thanks, Ewout. Just a couple of instructions for our phone participants, please press Star 1 to indicate that you wish to enter the queue to ask a question. To cancel or withdraw your question, simply press Star 2. I would kindly ask that you limit yourself to two questions; that's two questions, in order to allow time for other callers during today's Q&A session.","If you've been listening through a speaker phone, but would like to now ask a question, we ask that you lift your handset prior to pressing Star 1 and remain on the handset until your question has been answered. This will ensure better sound quality.","Operator, we'll now take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question.","Peter Appert","Thank you. Good morning. So Dough the performance on margin perspective continues to be exceptional and then you've addressed this before, but I'm required to ask you again, your confidence and the ability to continue to sustain the currency margin improvement you have seen, how much more upside is there how is been used up already.","Douglas Peterson","Peter thanks for the question, good morning. We continue to be committed to improving our margins and at the same we are investing the businesses we think that obviously one of the best indicators of improving our margins is to keep growing the top line. We have invested in however approaching commercial markets, we put in place commercial heads of all of our businesses we are working towards looking at the best ways to penetrate markets and then improve our top line growth, but at the same time we are also committed to managing our expenses in a way that are professional as well as appropriate for our business growth. So we continue to be believe that we can improve our margins, we have thought about a lot about this and it's something that we think that we can still do.","Peter Appert","Alright, thank you and with that I am just wondering if you have got any - if there has been any evaluation in your thought process in terms of appropriate level of leverage on the balance sheet.","Ewout Steenbergen","Good morning, Peter. If you have heard us speaking last quarter with respect to our capital philosophy and targets, that is a new frame work we have set out to you our investors that hopefully provides clear guidance on our expectation with respect to capital return. Our balance sheet, share buy backs, our dividends and also leverage expectations for the future. What we have said is that we want to be investment great overall and that our adjusted growth leverage should be in the range of 1.75 to 2.25 versus our adjusted EBITDA. This quarter we are at 2.0 so just at the midpoint of the range and therefore a very comfortable where we are with respect to leverage at this point in time.","Peter Appert","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. You may now ask you question.","Joseph Foresi","Hi, so you are obviously having a fairly good year here. How do you think about the long-term growth rates and margin profile for the overall business?","Douglas Peterson","Joseph, thank you for that, this is Dough let me just give you a couple of quick thoughts about that. As I just mentioned to Peter, we continue to look at top line growth as the best way to drive our margin improvements and we don't have necessarily projections for each segment, but our guidance is adjusted. Operating margins about 46% to 47% that you just saw in the slide that Ewout presented. In the ratings business over the long run we inspired to the low 50% range. We are continuing to look at how we can drive productivities through investments in IT, but maintain our quality, our controls and our analytical excellence in the market in commodities space we've got a high 30% margin over the next couple of years. We are continuing to complete the synergy program as well as the other approach to commercial discipline in IT investments as in ratings. And then in index, we don't really have a specific target in the index business. AUM levels and derivative activities in some ways are out of our control, but we are continuing to invest in the business and due target - in the extent we have it targeted. It's maintaining in the same kind of a range, but we are not giving a specific target for the index business.","Joseph Foresi","Got it. That's helpful. And then my second question, any thoughts on the new tax reform that's out there and how could impact the business going forward? Thanks.","Douglas Peterson","There is a couple of things on the tax reform. Obviously if the overall tax rate is reduced that would - we will be a beneficiary of a lower rate. We have been able to have a few benefits here and there and we're in this 30% range we used to be at the more of the 31% and 32% range. But if the corporate tax rate went down to 20%, we will have a very positive impact. There is other provisions which have been mentioned in the past like non-deductablity of interest expense, we have look at that carefully, we see what that might do to the debt markets. We think that there could be some potential impact to debt markets from that, but at the same time debt is the most important capital market in the United States and it's a way the corporations finance themselves and provide more leverage and better returns to their shareholders. But these are still - most of this specific details of the tax reform are really not known yet and as they become known we are going to be looking those, but based on what we know now, net-net we would probably get some benefits from the tax reform based on the provisions that we have seen.","Joseph Foresi","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Conor Fitzgerald from Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Conor Fitzgerald","Good morning. I want to ask a question on the treasury white paper particularly some of the comments around the pricing ForEx data feeds. I know the comment doesn't really specifically apply to your business, but you can see there's perhaps some prolog events just fit on data business, but pricing power. Does the white paper change, I think of our pricing power in this part of your business at all?","Ewout Steenbergen","Good morning, Conor. This is Ewout. Of course we have taken notice of that report and overall our expectation that those particular professions or proposals should not impact the S&P global. As you would see it's very much in between data providers of equity markets and broker dealers and the charge of data feeds from the equity markets. We are facilitating some of those through our platforms, but the end those are direct to relationships in terms of intellectual property between the exchangers and the broker dealers. So overall, we don't believe that will have an impact on the companies and therefore we are very comfortable that the company will have similar growth expectations in the future not impacted by this report.","Conor Fitzgerald","That's helpful, thank you. And then just another one on taxes, if there was a lower tax rate on foreign cash repetition how would you think about potentially utilizing that?","Ewout Steenbergen","Yeah, at this point in time, our foreign cash is focused on permanent reinvestments overseas. So that is the starting point. We might reconsider those plans when there is a change in tax profession and that could be repatriation, but we need to discuss at that point in time when we have the tax. So it might be that we reconsider our permanents reinvestments, plans we have today, but we need to see what will come out of the new tax regulation and we need to decide at that point in time.","Conor Fitzgerald","Very helpful, thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Miss. Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Toni Kaplan","Thank you. Good morning. In light of the outside strength in transactional ratings revenue this quarter, can just give us some additional color on pricing and share gains. It is seen like based on the issuance levels that we had seen that this was a real out performance.","Ewout Steenbergen","Good morning Tony. Let me just give you a little bit of color on the performance overall clearly this was not such a great quarter when it comes to issuance the global issuance was down almost 7% overall, but as usual there is a mix balance that we always look out to see where there might be sources of strength for the type of performance we had on the top line. In U.S. the corporate were up about 6.5% the financial services were up 9%. You know the public finance is down about 19%, but a combination of the corporate to financial services what we saw overall with some strength in the public and the - the structured finance area, there was a CMBS strength, it was up as 46% for the quarter as well as structured credit which was mostly CLOs that was up over a 100%. So truly the mix of what we saw that we benefited from and then as you know this quarter we had the first slide we showed you was bank loan ratings because that's been a very positive story for the market overall. The bank loan market has been strong through a combination of banks activities with their own balance sheets and then securitizations to go eventually sometimes into the CLO market. And it's a combination of all of that that is driven our top line growth.","Toni Kaplan","Great and then in the slides, it showed that the desk top users from market intelligence to desk top users were up 13%, but that desk top revenue itself was only up about 8. So could you give us a sense of what the divergence is there is it customer mix and if you could give any color on desk top client base like sell side versus buy side, banking versus research or other functions anything that you can provide there is very helpful. Thank you.","Douglas Peterson","Tony, let me take the first part of that question. On the first part of the question as you know we are slowly moving towards changing our contracts with customers to an enterprise wide contract which means that you have agreement with your organization and they can bring on its many users as possible. So as we move more, more of our contracts enterprise wide that means that there are - you open up the ability for anybody in that has approached using a license to use products and services so that's where you see the number of desk tops increasing and it's a good leading indicator for us in the future where we are going to be. We are negotiating contracts overtime as the usage goes up its gives us the ability to think about how we can get pricing increases over time on that. And Chip has some more numbers specifically about the different segments of who the users are.","Chip Merritt","Yeah, I don't know the very exact numbers, but a few quarters ago in our slide that we gave you a price chart which shows you the break down market intelligence cost by - customers and was roughly pretty evenly split between four categories. One of the categories that people don't think about a lot is corporates and others. So you know the corporate and accounting firms and consulting firms [indiscernible] those folks may buy not look at this specifically, but those kind of firms. Then that chunk with sell side, a chunk with buy side, a chunk within private equity. So please go look at that chart may, might exact figures, but take pick up that chart.","Toni Kaplan","Thanks very much guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm from UBS. You may ask your question.","Alex Kramm","Good morning. Just staying on that market intelligence topic for a second and I heard the one third no enterprise pricing and I know there was no other question what market data cost in general. When we talk to clients some of those move to enterprise pricing, it seems to be driving decent cost increases into the tune of like double digits or so. So just wondering at what point you are reaching the limit or you still feel like you got good upside. I guess what we are hearing is that folks increasingly are looking at the cost with you guys and wondering if it is getting ended a bit too much though. Any comments will be appreciated.","Ewout Steenbergen","Good morning Alex. This is Ewout. So we are very encouraged by the trends of moving to enterprise wide contracts. As you know that is an exclusive strategy of markets intelligence and we think that's good for the customers and good for S&P global. So let me give you a little bit of more color around that about one third of the previous capital like few customers are now come forwarded the plan in ultimately to continue to bring the whole customer set to enterprise wide contracts and we believe that's a good developments because it ultimately - it means that when one of our customers is adding new employees, new analysts they can all be added to the platform without any additional costs. And, still it will increase usage, it will increase embedding into the models, we like to see that number of 13% increase in usage, we think ultimately more users is always a positive in the long term.","So, overall this is an explicit strategy, we believe we provide value for the platform, we look as you know from the enterprise wide conflicts very much to actually usage, and we try to make an estimate of the edit value for the customers. How much that's embedded into the work close. So, there's a difference between a customer that is looking at a more high-level data sources, others that go in very deep prefatory intelligence and therefore there are some difference changes in terms of the price setting. But overall, we believe that the product is well priced, is competitive in the market, is heading functionality and that is the main drive behind the growth in users and the best of revenue.","Alex Kramm","Alright fair enough, and then just maybe, since somebody mentioned that treasury report earlier, I think one of the areas that didn't get lot of attention was, I guess, treasuries push for more securitization. So, Doug may be for you, I mean, any conversations you had to that regard with the administration and obviously structure plan as markets haven't been that robust last two years. Anything that could do, or time lines you would think about here, if officially pushed to get that going again?","Douglas Peterson","Well that the two aspects, the first in the US that's clearly interested in Washington and I have no idea what the term could be for GST reform, which might eventually change the dynamic of the R&BS market. The R&BS market in the US is gotten to be quite small, but in the last quarter, there was less the $12 billion of issuance of R&BS securities. So, there might be at some point, some reform there, but I'm not going to hold my breath for it. In Europe you know that Mario Draghi has spoken many times about wanting to revitalize the securitization market in Europe and they do think, to be some progresses, see more structured credits, this quarter they were $14.2 billion worth of CLO's and other type of structured credits. And we do see some interest in Europe to have a more robust securitization market, particularly because, it frees up capital on corporate and thinking down sheets, so that they can be re-invested in other type of activities and as well as provides more inventory for the securities markets and moves away from more terminal and banking market. So, I've had a lot of discussions with this with different central bankers and policy makers, but, there is no specific plans innovate that I've seen. And in the US the biggest market could get at least, if you saw the R&BS market, opening up again, but I don't see any timeline for that.","Alex Kramm","Okay, very good thank you.","Operator","Thank you, our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Research, you may ask your question.","Hamzah Mazari","Good morning, thank you. I was hoping you could address, how investors should think about your business, and any Nett benefits post Midrid 2, is that something you guys benefit from? Historically you haven't talked a lot of that, some of your peers have, so just curious there first?","Douglas Peterson","Thank you, Hamzah. Well first of all, when it comes to Midrid 2, we are obviously looking very carefully at this, there are sort of different in's and out's from this, and there is a lot of new discussions about this today related to how the US players are going to be able to deliver intelligence and research into the European market. So, first of all from our point of view, a direct point of view, we're providing research in data and analytics that is already paid for with hard dollars. When somebody gets the subscription to our products and services we are already paying for them, with a, to a subscription that is paid for with hard dollars, Euros, pounds whatever the currency is. And we are not part of the unbundling loops that is going to take place from the institutional self-side research analysis or now typically ramped in their soft dollars, which is part of a training credits or some sort of a training system. So, from a direct point of view, we don't think we are going to see any impact or business.","Second, as the market does become unbundled and you see new ways for research to be delivered, our platform at market intelligence can be used by the investor banks to deliver research and we can do in a way that we are able to track usage, we are able to track how many times of different reports are opened, so that they can be charged, we can set up subscription approaches and we can do that and reach out to different types of investors and analysts that are using the kind of research we have today.","Clearly the biggest question that's been coming up when I meet with you and your colleagues and peers is that, wilt her be any kind of negative impact on the research projects? And we don't know if that's going to, what kind of a potential make us impact it could be if there is a squeezing of research budgets and organizations have to look carefully about how they want to spend, how they want to spend their hard dollars overtime, if there is going to be any negative impact there. Well generally speaking, we are watching this very carefully, we're going to understand what it means for us, but, there is no direct impact initially.","Hamzah Mazari","Great and just a follow-up question, you know curious how investors should think about the plats business, in an up cycle relative to pass cycles. And the reason I asked that question is, you've done a ton of acquisitions in that business, it's more diversified, you probably have more supply demand data that you didn't historically when that acquisition was done. So, you know may be help us understand in a stronger oil and commodity market, I know you mentioned the business ticked up, but it could growth be similar to the numbers that business put up in the last up cycle? Granted we don't think energy is going to a 100 but, just curious any thoughts there? Thank you.","Douglas Peterson","Well first of all, our expectation right now for oil, is that it's going to be in a range somewhere in the $50 to $60 range, but, let's say $45 to $60 is the expectation that we have right now. At $45 you see people pulling up production when it gets into the mid 50s, people, sorry when you get there in the 40s, in the low 40s people stop producing, get into the 50s, 55, 60s people start producing more, you get more supply coming in. so, we've seen this dynamically, so we have a much more stable oil price. We've been growing portfolio of services that can allow us to provide all the way from the exploration and the well head to the refinery onto the product, with a combination of crude oil analytics, of refinery analytics, of shipping etcetera and we are just starting to see the promise of putting those businesses together to start growing. So, we think the plats in the overtime in the couple of different buckets, one is obviously the different acid classes and sales of petroleum, natural gas, energy, plastic, petrochemicals etcetera. And then the other is pricing and GTS, that go with trained services and secondarily the trade flow analytics and data products.","And we are investing in all of those to see if we can grow our subscription businesses overtime and make this one of our growing businesses. But, we do see this stability should be beneficial to the business, but I can't initially forecast what that's going to mean for us in the future.","Hamzah Mazari","Very helpful thanks.","Operator","Thank you, our next question from Finn Matthew [ph] from William Blair. You may ask your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks, just one from me, I guess, on the indices you talked a bit about the margins, but can you elaborate a little bit more, I know you are trying to seen some sort of range, but it seems like we've seen kind of the second year of a little bit more investments and I think it's rational, but I guess can you talk about from here to the , should we see elaborate from this point or do you see a sustained period of wanting invest in new products and I guess the infrastructure of the business?","Ewout Steenbergen","Hey good morning, this Ewout. So, let me first tell you about the big picture perspective have on this business and then I will provide a little bit more color, so overarching we think we can grow a business that has margins mid 60% range, mid 60% by 14% revenue growth during the quarter, that's a very good development and that creates a lot of economic value, for our shareholders. I have specific reasons why there was a 190 base point decrease in margins for indices this quarter. The first reason is, the addition of True cost on average is driving the margin down but truly that's a good investment and a capability that will help future growth. And secondly, there are some foreign related expenses, we think about certain royalties we have to pay where there is a revenue element on the one hand but then an offset on the expense line with respect to the royalty. So that is also having a slight impact on margins. But taken altogether, we believe that this is a business that we are able to grow, and the future is still at that mid-60% margin level in a very healthy way. So certainly we expect to continue to do that and will invest intelligently also in future growth in the Indices business.","Unknown Analyst","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik. You may ask your question.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. First, I just want to thank you guys for the notable increase in disclosure, color and commentary, very help for us. My first question is I guess around in the Platts side and Doug you pointed out the LNG product and the growth there and then in the Platts sort of break outside we saw power and gas I think declined 1%. And my guess is LNG is a fast-growing area but there just maybe some other offset there. So just a broad question on could LNG be a material contributor to that business, drive some more growth there, any thoughts there would be appreciated.","Douglas Peterson","Good morning, Manav. We look at the LNG business as one that's - which is really a long-term investment for us. I don't know if I could say that the contributions are going to be high over the next few quarters. I don't even know how long it will take to get there. But when it comes to development of a global market, this is one that we are investing in because we think it will become a significant global market. If you go back just about two years ago, the price of the BTU of LNG was $4 in Louisiana and $16 in Japan because there was no very unified markets through LNG but as the LNG terminals get built up around the world, cost for liquefaction and de-liquefaction and in particular with Korea, South Korea and Japan being the two largest importers over time, we really think this will develop into a global market and we would like to be on the ground floor. So right now we see it more as an investment market where we are buying the right kind of and building the right kind of capabilities to serve this market. And overtime it should get bigger and we hope it becomes one of our areas of growth.","Manav Patnaik","Got it. And then just on the bank loan rating and I guess it's the one side decision that's hard for us to track. So I was hoping for some color in terms of how penetrated you think you are in that market and I know it's been lumpy in the past, if any help, and how do you think in the next - in a couple of quarters it would be?","Chip Merritt","Yeah, so on the first quarter call, we shared some specifics with you, and once again I don't - how appropriate I think they were, but in the U.S. four or five years ago, we were up about 34% in the first quarter we were around 93%. And then when you got to Europe three or four years ago, we were down around 40% and got around 70% somewhere in there, but I encourage you to go look at first quarter slide. We might share that plot again, I didn't feel like putting it in there every quarter, but at least give you a sense for the really the big share gain, not taking share away from a competitor, but just more and more bank loans are rated.","Douglas Peterson","One of the things that I would also point out, it's not a Science what I am going to tell you, but it is a way that the bankers as well as issuers think about it. If you look at a combination of bank loan rate of high-yield bond proceeds and CLOs together, you will get a pretty good picture of what's happening in the high-yield markets because they are substitutes - somebody who couldn't go to the bond market, they could go to the bank loan market and they could also - the banks could securitize their loans and the CLOs. And when you look at those different volumes that's what - that's the way I look at the overall high-yield market, its different pieces. And clearly with the liquidity in the banking market in particularly in Europe and then in the United States with the access to the CLO markets for its banks and then there is a lot of investors who have also been interested in floating rate exposure as opposed to fixed rate exposure especially over the last few quarters. It's a combination of all of those factors that has driven such high activity in the bank loan rating market, and we do believe that we have a good penetration there and that we are one of the rating agencies that's a go-to rating agencies for that type of activity.","Manav Patnaik","Got it. Thank you for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Anjaneya Singh from Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.","Anjaneya Singh","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First, on margin performance and Market Intelligence, up nicely year-over-year, but flattish as we have been perhaps than previous year, so in light of the synergy capture opportunity that you folks have in that segment, can you talk about what's limiting the sequential margin expansion there and any update on how the removal of some of the redundant cost is progressing?","Ewout Steenbergen","Yeah, good morning. This is Ewout. Overall, we believe that there is a lot of opportunity to further expand the margins in Market Intelligence. You have seen very healthy growth with respect to revenues. So that is one side of the story and we believe we were talking before about the active users of the platforms. Ultimately that will help to drive up the revenues of the desktop in the future. Secondly, we believe there's opportunities for efficiencies, we are still working on the SNL integration. We will get back to you with an update at yearend where we are with those synergies, but we have all the reason to believe that we will be able to hit the target with respect to synergies we put out to you at the point of the acquisition but also at the beginning of this year. And lastly, if I look at the overall year-over-year trailing 12 months margin improvement; I am looking at 420 basis points margin improvement year-over-year. So we think that is a clear indication that we are on the right track. Again, growing the top line harder and higher than the expense line in the future, we will continue to derive the margins up.","Anjaneya Singh","Okay, got it. And as a follow-up I was wondering if you can share any updates on Project Simplify as you folks are moving to more of deploying pilots. Are you seeing any tangible improvements, just trying to get a sense of whether the initiatives are starting to bear fruit on the efficiencies or it's still little early to see the main results.","Douglas Peterson","What I would say is that it's two answers. The first answer when it comes to progress on getting the Project Simplify and pilots were making excellent progress with rolling it out across different practices and at some point, where we are going to be moving into the largest practices, where we are going to be rolling ourselves. So up until now, the philosophy is simplification and standardization of building an embedded control and thinking about an end to end data collection all the way to the publishing process has been really good work and the overall design progress, the piloting progress and how it is moving has been quite good. When it comes to the thing on the financial impact on it, it's starting to leak in, it's not a big driver of expense right now, but over time it's something that we will start becoming more significant, but as of now it has not been an important driver of expenses going down.","Anjaneya Singh","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Silber from BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Jeffrey Silber","Thanks so much. I get one question that investors ask a lot, I want to paraphrase that. Hopefully you could help us out. So keeping focus on margins again but that seems to be the same today. Specifically, looking at your Ratings business, you said your long-term goal is in the low 50%, you are already taking over 53% year-to-date. Now you mentioned margin expansion continues based on revenue growth, you got some really strong revenue growth this year. I mean if we kind of go back to a normalized environment, do you think it's possible that margins could actually go down if you continue expanding in the Ratings business. Again long term I know where you are heading but maybe next year, would it be possible to take a step back before taking a step forward?","Douglas Peterson","Jeff this is Doug, that's essentially a bit of a theoretical question, but the mid-50s or the low 50s is a medium-term goal, not necessarily a long-term goal. Clearly, there are flows of issuance that we benefit from sometimes when there is higher flows we are going to benefit from as the part of our revenue stream which is the transaction based revenue and from the point of the view of - if there is a quarter that doesn't do very well and you have heard me say this many times before that we could easily see a quarter or two or even more where there is weak issuance and our top line is not as strong as it has been and the mathematical calculation of that could lead to a lower margin. So theoretically to your question you could feel lower margin but when it comes to how we manage our expenses and how we are managing our business overall, we are very conscious of improving our performance, improving our margins. But theoretically from your question, there could be some quarters that the top line growth is very meek, and it could hit our margin.","Jeffrey Silber","Okay, I appreciate the answer. Thanks so much.","Ewout Steenbergen","So let me build on Doug's answer. The other side there is we are staying very tight and disciplined with expenses. So particularly in this period with revenues going up, we don't want the expense line to go up too much. As you have seen, we have even announced a restructuring in Ratings at this point in time. So the benefit of that is when there will be some headwinds at some point in the future that we have an expense base that can withstand that in a healthy way. So certainly at that particular point that on the expense side, we continue to be very disciplined, and that should help in a theoretical scenario as you described.","Jeffrey Silber","Okay, thanks so much.","Douglas Peterson","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.","William Warmington","Good morning everyone. So a clarification question on some comments that Ewout had made on the Market Intelligence piece. When you mentioned that about a third of Cap IQ base had now converted over to the enterprise wide contract, I just wanted to understand that, is that specifically just an enterprise pricing model, or is that enterprise pricing model including the combined SNL as well. And part what I'm curious about is what percentage of the Cap IQ clients who are offered that option have taken it?","Ewout Steenbergen","So make sure we are clear, make sure - the products have not been combined yet just the commercial agreement, okay. All the SNL clients were already on enterprise-wide. So they were already there.","William Warmington","Right.","Chip Merritt","So as we then work through our Cap IQ customers, some of whom are also SNL customers and some of whom are not. That's what we were referring to at the third that we have made it so far. It's not really a question of acceptance or are there choice because in the future there will only be one commercial offering, one product, a combined product. So we have to get to one commercial offering. It's really in our choice in the future, so it's working our way through it. I am not sure. Does that answer your question, Bill?","William Warmington","Yes it does. Thank you, Chip. And then one of the question on the Ratings side, just wanted to ask, how much of a factor has first time issuers been in the strength that you have been saying? I don't know how much of that applies to the bank loan issuance in terms of the issuers versus the guys who were refinancing over the past nine months, but I wanted to ask that question.","Ewout Steenbergen","I think where you see it, I don't have the numbers at my fingertips but there is one way you can see it occurs in a proxy is to go back to our slides and look at the part of our Ratings, which is what was transaction revenue versus what was, let me just find that slide if I could. Yes, so if you look at on slide 26 of our slides, the non-transaction revenue increased 7% and that is driven partially by the new issuers that come on that pay us for entity rating. So that would be the one area I would say that you could look at for proxy. Otherwise I think it would be better if Chip call it up a bit later with some more specific data on that question.","William Warmington","Got it. Thank you for the insight.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research. You may ask your question.","Craig Huber","Yes good morning. I have two questions. First one, can you just talk a little bit further maybe seeing assumptions behind the comment early on Doug about global debt issuance up 1% or so in 2018. What is sort of the thought there behind where credit spreads be in that scenario, the yield curve, how much of that might go up over time, what's your expectation behind that GDP? Does that pick up significantly from here? Obviously, there is a huge refinancing walls during the next two years, and how do you sort of get to that 1% and that was the first question. Thank you.","Douglas Peterson","Okay, yes. So thanks for that. First of all, this is something that our fixed income research team in Ratings, they do this report few times a year. And the basis of this report is a combination of analysis of what is the refinancing pipeline. So what we are seeing in terms of maturities that are coming through and all of the different bond markets in the world. It's also a combination of looking at what's the expectations are for growth in the world. And there is one big wild card this year which is something I mentioned in prepared remarks about monetary policy and what kind of impact that could have. So just in terms of couple of the key components, first of all when it comes to issuance forecast in 2018 overall, it's for about a - basically flat, let's call it overall flat even though it might be around you know about 1%, but generally speaking it's flat.","It's a combination of looking at financial services issuance, which is going to be up about 5%, structured finance up about 5%, U.S. public finance down about 7% and then overall globally corporate should be down a little bit based off of the maturity profile that's out there. And as a result of that, you see that the overall forecast is as I said flat up maybe you know about 1% to 2%. When it comes to GDP growth rate, our team is forecasting GDP growth rate next year on the global scale about 3.6% with the U.S. in the lows two's around 2.2%, 2.3%. We are also expecting that there will be three 25 basis point interest rate increases in the U.S. as the U.S. Fed Reserve starts to normalize monetary policy further and that's also something which is going to play in the market.","We don't necessarily think that there is going to be an increase in December but those three will most likely be next year. And that in Europe, there might be a slowdown or a potential paper of the purchase of bonds in the European market. So again these are all of the different factors that we look at maturities, we look at what's happening with overall with the interest rate, the base rate interest rates in the global market's expected growth. And the growth in the global economy is actually pretty good right now. There is only six countries around the world including Venezuela, they are not growing. And it's been a long time we have seen sequential coordinated growth across the entire global economy especially after coming out of financial crisis. So all of those generally give us a pretty positive, or benign to positive environment, and we look at that when we are preparing this forecast.","Craig Huber","Thank you for that. Another question, Doug, I think you mentioned earlier on that third quarter global issuance I guess the rate I believe was down 7%, your revenues, your transactional revenues were up 24%. Can you just talk a little bit further about the mixed issues while you outperform that revenue side soft handedly please?","Douglas Peterson","Yes, so first one we talked about and we were very specific about this quarter was the bank loan ratings and that's something when we talk about issuance we are including the bank loan rating market. That's - when we talk about issuance we are talking about fixed income instruments that are issued by governments, by financial institutions, by corporates, by municipal et cetera. And so the first really one of the important elements was the growth in bank loan rating. The second is in terms of the mix. When sovereign is an example was down about 11% but we don't get a lot of income from sovereign. It's not an area that drives a lot of our income growth. In addition, there is industrial side in the U.S. the corporate issuance was up 6.5% and that for us is one of the key drivers.","The corporates are those that go-to market, they pay us the ongoing issuer fees as well as how they are going to the market. There is also an addition, maybe the commercial paper market was strong in the last quarter with a lot of issuance there that maybe again hasn't really picked up. But think about for us the industrial corporate markets in U.S. were up 6.5%, financial services up 9% and despite the downturn in Europe in corporates and financial services, those were offset by the U.S. issuance. And then secondarily, CMBS and CLOs were up in both markets, in the Europe and the U.S. So it's been about the components, corporate issuance, financial institutional issuance and the world's largest capital markets in the U.S. and then structured finance issuance in Europe and the U.S. both in CMBS and CLOs, both of those up. Those are the components that drove the increase despite the total market being down.","Craig Huber","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our final question from James Friedman from Susquehanna Financial Group. You may ask your question.","James Friedman","Well thank you for taking me in here, I think most of my questions were answered, but I did want to follow-up about that slide 9 Doug about the banner year for bank loans. I knew you had a lot of questions about it, but you guys have been consistent when this is a theme since the first quarter. I guess my question is, it's a little bit difficult parse what is your gain in market share versus say the cyclical versus may be importantly the structural growth in this end market. I was wondering if you could help parse that between Europe and the U.S. we are trying to evaluate how sustainable this is and clearly you made a lot of progress since 2010 on the slide, but we are trying to anticipate how this is going to look going forward. Thank you.","Douglas Peterson","First of all thank you for the question. If you look at the instead of slide 9, if you look at slide 10, this gives you a view of what are the majorities over this following years and next 10 years at the end of each of these periods and that I think is the way to look at what is the potential growth of this market. I am not going to say that you can never predict what's going to happen in the future, but this just gives you a view of in 2011 when I joined the company, I could see from having worked in a bank setup, the bank loan market was going to actually expand and we put a major focus on this in 2011 when I joined the ratings business, because I knew from coming from the banking world, but this is going to be a major focus of the banks given the kind of capital allocation and risk capital approaches that were being imposed from the regulators.","And so we have seen now that over the last seven or eight years we have seen a 11 % triggered growth in that what you consider to be the majority if are going to call that the next 8 years were the majorities. The mix of this - this is the U.S. leveraged loan market on this slide. So this doesn't give you the European piece of that, but the European piece of this we look at that as the markets get more sophisticated and as the bank loan market gets more sophisticated that benefits us with the CLO markets as well as bank loan rating. But also as those many of those bank loan ratings turn into issuance they move from a bank loan into a bond issue that also benefits us as well.","And remember one of thing typically the leveraged loan market are double the plus or lower rated issuers which is the non-investment grade or the speculate type of issuance which is also one where we typically get a better type of the fee profile in the investment grade. So we look at this overall as it is really important area for us to stay close to, to watch the evolution in the mix between the different types of markets, loan markets, CLOs and non-investment grade its I think it's all kind of wrapped up into one broader type of non-investment grade market. And we think that one of the really good stories for last few years has been the leveraged loan market.","Craig Huber","And I think what we will do in the fourth quarter is resurrect that first quarter slide that shows the market shares that several of you have asked about that, so we will resurrect that chart in our fourth quarter. And you can get sense for that. The one thing I want to add is the underlying reason why these things are rated okay, if a bank were to keep the loan on books related to the loan they wouldn't need to get it rated. But if they want the flexibility they get that loan off of their books maybe wrap it up a CLO or sell it off. Then having a rating is very, very beneficial to them. So I think this to understand the logic behind why it occurs as [ph] that will occur in the future.","James Friedman","Thank you.","Douglas Peterson","Okay, James, any more question from you?","James Friedman","Oh, no. that's it for me. Thank you very much.","Douglas Peterson","Great, thank you. Well, let me close the call by thanking everyone for being on the call today. I think that consistent overall was how we have been doing this year. We delivered another very strong quarter and as you have heard throughout from our commentary as well as the questions and answers we are committed to continue to improve our margins. It's something that is important to us to have expense discipline, but at the same time also deliver high quality, highly valued relevant products to the markets. Whether it's things we have talked about over the years the strength we already have in industries and commodities and markets intelligence and ratings or at areas that we started growing in related to supply chain analytics in the energy industries whether it's the ESG products and climate and green evaluation areas where we also see a lot of relevance for us to create new standards as the markets continue to evolve. And we thank you very much again for all of your questions and we look forward to interacting with you as we approach the end of the year and we will be back on this call in about three months. Thank you very much.","Operator","That concludes this morning's call. A PDF version of the presented slides is available now for downloading from investor.spglobal.com.

Thank you for joining S&P Global's earnings call. Presenting on this morning's call are Doug Peterson, President and CEO; and Ewout Steenbergen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This morning, we issued a news release with our second quarter 2018 results.

However, this call is intended for investors and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Jason Feuchtwanger at 212-438-1247.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?","Doug Peterson","Thank you, Chip. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the call. Global GDP continues to be strong with trade tensions, Brexit, MiFID India, and the unwinding of quantitative easing present uncertainty and challenges. In the meantime however, companies continue to look to S&P Global to provide the data analytics benchmarks, insights and trade flow information to navigate market events. But let me begin today's call with the second quarter highlights.","The company delivered 26% adjusted EPS growth. Our adjusted effective tax rate declined 500 basis points to 23.9% as a result of U.S. tax reform. In the second quarter, we generated $488 million in free cash flow excluding certain items. Our 1 billion accelerated share repurchase program continues and we returned to $126 million in dividends. Our 2018 adjusted EPS guidance remains unchanged and we expanded our differentiated customer content with the acquisition of RateWatch and we incorporated new datasets from Crunchbase.","Taking a closer look at the financial results, the company reported 7% revenue growth and 6% on an organic basis. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, however, organic revenue increased 5%. Our adjusted operating profit margin increased 230 basis points to 49.1%. We delivered 26% adjusted diluted EPS growth. Please note that our EPS included favorable impacts of $0.04 from ForEx and $0.01 from the tax benefit from stock option exercises. Ewout will provide more information on these in a moment.","What I'd like to do next is provide some more color on the current and future drivers of our businesses. When tracking bond issuance in the quarter, we always point out that where issuance takes place, which type of issuance and the size of the deal make a difference in the revenue we realize.","Global issuance in the second quarter excluding sovereign debt decreased 3%. Structured finance, however, continued to be strong. Geographically, issuance in the U.S. decreased 12% in the second quarter with investment grade decreasing 19%, high yield declining 30%, public finance down 12%. But structured finance increased 5% due primarily to strengthened RMBS an ABS. In Europe, issuance increased 9% in the quarter with investment grade increasing 10%, high yield declining 29% and structured finance increasing 29% with strength in covered bonds in CLO.","Reverse Yankee Bonds in Europe are also getting traction from a very small base. Reverse Yankee Bonds are bonds issued in another country by a U.S. company. As Europe offers lower cost financing, issuers are beginning to take advantage. In June, Single B rated bonds in Europe offered average financing of a 150 basis points cheaper than the U.S. This differential is beginning to entice U.S. issuers.","In Asia, issuance decreased 4%. The vast majority of Asian issuance, however, is made up of local China debt that we don't currently rate. As you'll see later, there is never perfect correlation between issuance and revenue because of bank loans, frequent issuer programs, pricing and a number of non-transaction related revenue. In fact, despite a decline in bond issuance during the quarter, ratings revenue increased. One area of financing that continues to grow is leverage loans. During April, the inventory of U.S. leverage loans surpassed $1 trillion for the first time. It has outgrown uninterrupted every year since hitting a low in 2010.","In addition, the loan market now comprises more than 1,000 issuers, an increase of more than 50% since 2010. To meet their financing needs, speculative grade companies can choose whether to utilize the leveraged loan market or the high yield bond market as conditions warrant.","Bank loan ratings are primarily issued on leverage loans typically rated double B plus or lower. Our revenue growth from bank loan ratings has exceeded the growth of the market as the percentage of bank loans that we rate has increased.","Our second quarter bank loan rating revenue is $121 million. A 22% increase over the $99 million recorded a year ago. There was some downside, however. The sharp increase in new issue supply a whopping 102 billion of loan paper entered the secondary market in May and June has pushed spreads higher limiting potential savings for most re-pricing exercises. In fact, June re-pricing volume of only 16 billion was the lowest monthly total in the past year and July is on a pace to be even lower.","Turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices, at the end of June, we released the annual survey of assets. This chart depicts the highlights of that survey. Most importantly, there was a 17% increase in assets globally that track indices managed by S&P Dow Jones Indices to $13.7 trillion. This includes $8.9 trillion in active money that is benchmarked against our indices and $4.8 trillion in passive money that is invested in products index or indices.","Numerous indices support the $4.8 trillion. I'd like to highlight three categories. Clearly, the S&P 500 is the largest of all products with 3.4 trillion in assets. These assets increased 15% in the past calendar year. Smart Beta, the second category which has 234 billion in assets is up 27% and fixed income, the third category with 45 billion in assets is up 11%.","Agricultural commodities derivatives have historically been settled with physical delivery. Following success in the energy market increasingly cash-settled derivatives are being created. Last December, CME launched the first cash-settled futures in agriculture based on Platts price benchmark for Russian wheat and Ukrainian corn. As you can see from this chart, it's been a very successful launch with over 55,000 contracts traded in the first 6 months. Based on this success, last week CME introduced option contracts for Black Sea wheat and corn futures linked to the same benchmark.","Turning to other developments in the quarter, we continue to innovate, expand differentiated content and create new products. In June, the company acquired RateWatch. RateWatch is a subscription business that provides differentiated data and analytics for the banking sector, including custom reports on bank deposits, loans, fees and other product data. RateWatch was founded in 1989 and was acquired by The Street in 2007. It will be integrated into market intelligence; it will be a great addition to our existing bank data offering.","In April, Crunchbase data on almost 400,000 private companies became available on the market intelligence platform with the help of Kensho. Crunchbase utilizes a community of thousands of contributors to crowdsource data.","Trucost, a leader in carbon environmental data and risk analytics has launched the Trucost sustainable development goal or STG evaluation tool. The tool is designed to help companies to identify business risk and opportunities aligned with United Nations STGs. Over 9,000 companies and investors with more than 4 trillion in assets have pledged their support to the STGs.","S&P Dow Jones Indices launched the S&P 500 Carbon Price Risk 2030 Adjusted Index. It's designed to measure the performance of the constituent companies of the S&P 500, re-weighted to account for the potential specific impact of 2030 carbon prices on constituent stock prices.","Adjusting market valuations to account for the future possible costs of carbon emissions seeks to address potential company specific financial value at risk attributable to carbon rather than looking purely at quantity of emission.","Now, let me turn the call over to Ewout to provide more specifics on our business results for the quarter, thank you.","Ewout Steenbergen","Thank you, Doug, and good morning to everyone on the call. This morning, I would like to provide additional color around our second quarter results. We reported solid operating results and Doug already discussed the revenue growth and the increase in adjusted diluted EPS. I would like to touch a few other line items.","First, adjusted corporate unallocated operating loss increased 3 million due to $6 million associated with Kensho and a $3 million reduction in excess real estate in New York and London.","Second, I want to compliment our employees for their efforts in outstanding year-over-year expense control. It is important that we work to ensure that our revenue growth outpaces our expense growth. An increase of only 2% in adjusted total expenses is a result of numerous technology projects, lower incentives and productivity improvement.","Direct interest expense decreased $11 million, primarily due to the resolution of New Year state tax audits, FIN48 requires us to accrue interest and penalties associated with potential tax payments. Based on the resolution of these items, we were first interest expense accruals resulting in lower interest expense in the quarter. Fourth; the most impactful item during the quarter was U.S. reform which resulted in a dramatic reduction in our adjusted effective tax rate. We are continuing to review and evaluate the new provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.","During the second quarter, we recorded a $9 million provision for a global intangible low tax, income tax for all of the first-half of 2018. We are continuing to monitor regulatory guidance and interpretations of the new legislation.","Finally, well, it doesn't impact our financial statements. I want to update you on another tax matter. Some of you may recall that in the second quarter our conference call last year we discussed that the IRS issued a 30-day letter proportion to increase the company's federal income tax for the 2015 tax year by approximately $242 million. The increase related primarily to the IRS's proposed this allowance of claimed tax deductions or certain amounts paid in 2015 to settle law suits by 19 states in the district of Colombia. We stated at that time that we vigorously disagreed with the proposed adjustment and are pleased to report that we have reached a settlement with the IRS in April for $14 million that was fully reserved.","We continue to estimate that the EPS impact from the tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation will increase 2018 EPS by $0.10 to $0.20 depending on SPGI's share price and option exercise activity. EPS is also impacted whenever the fair market value of employee stock grants accessing reports from the grand price. The impact is recorded as an adjustment in tax expense.","During the second quarter, we recorded a reduction in tax expenses that improvement the second quarter adjusted EPS $0.01. Foreign exchange rates have a $12 million positive impact on the company's revenue and a $16 million positive impact on adjusted operating profit or about $0.04 per share in the second quarter. The bulk of the impact was in the rating segment, ratings revenues was primarily impacted by the Euro and the British Pound.","There were three adjustments to operating profit this quarter. The first was related to our legal settlement reserve. As we stated back in May, the company settled the final significant financial crisis litigation. We are increasing our reserve by $73 million this quarter to meet the settlement obligation.","Second is an item that will be ongoing for the next three years related to the retention expenses for certain Kensho employees. And finally, there was $33 million in pretax new related amortization expense. In the second quarter, every business segment contributed to gains in revenue, adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin, this was truly a solid quarter of operating performance by each of our business segments.","Now, turning to the individual business segments, let's start with ratings. As you may recall ratings revenue grew 10% in the second quarter of 2017 against this strong prior year comparison, ratings revenue increased 4% this quarter or 2% excluding a favorable impact from ForEx.","Adjusted operating profit increased 12% while the adjusted operating margin increased 400 basis points to 57.1%. The decline in expenses was primarily due to lower incentive accruals and productivity improvement. As we said in the past, we managed the ratings business on a rolling fourth quarter's basis and you can see on that basis the adjusted operating margin increased 380 basis points.","Loan transaction revenue increased 7%, due primarily to growth in fees associated with surveillance, new entity ratings, and rating evaluation service fees. Transaction revenue increased 1% as a 22% increase in bank loan ratings revenue was slightly decline in bonds rating revenue.","If you look at Ratings revenue by its various markets, you can see the greatest gains were in structured finance, a hedged indication for five straight quarters. Structured finance increased primarily due to strong CLO and RMBS activity. Corporate revenue increased despite a decline in issuance. The only category where revenue declined was governance, due to the 12% decline in U.S. public finance issuance that Doug mentioned.","Turning to indices; revenue increased 13% with higher ETF and mutual funds AUM, greater OTC transactions and strong exchange rate at derivatives activity. This strong growth in revenue led to a 15% increase in adjusted operating profit and a 70 basis points increase in adjusted operating profit margin to 65.8%, asset-linked fees, which are principally derived from ETFs, mutual funds, and certain OTC derivatives, increased 18%, driven by a 21% increase in average ETF AUM. Exchange-traded derivative revenue rose 17%, healthy growth but not near the record setting volume experienced in the first quarter.","Subscription revenue declined 4% due to delay in contract renewals as a result of a change in administrative prophecies. We believe these contracts will be renewed later this year. The trend of assets moving into passive investments continued in the second quarter with the exchange-traded products industry reaching net inflows of $119 billion. The quarter ending ETF AUM tied to our indices totaled $1.382 trillion, up 20% versus the second quarter of 2017.","As the chart shows, this was the result of $119 billion of net inflows and $107 billion of market appreciation over the last 12 months. The second quarter average AUM associated with our indices increased 21% year-over-year. This is a better proxy for revenue changes than the quarter end figures. Exchange-traded derivatives volume was mixed during the second quarter. Key contracts include S&P 500 Index Options, which grew 18%, fixed futures and options activity, which increased 25%. Lastly, activity at the CME Equity Complex increased 14%.","Let me now turn to Market Intelligence. In the second quarter, revenue increased 8%, organic revenue increased 7% excludes the acquisitions of Panjiva, which is increasingly sited in the media for a straight flow data and newly acquired rate voice.","Adjusted operating profit improved 9%. Our adjusted operating margin increased 40 basis points. There was some concern among investors during the first quarter when we reported an adjusted operating profit margin of 29.5%. We hope that the improvement to 32.8% will elate those concerns.","Looking more deeply at Market Intelligence revenue, all three components delivered solid revenue growth. Desktop products grew 5%, data management solutions increased 11%, leading growth for Market Intelligence. Risk Services grew 8% with growth in RatingsXpress, RatingsDirect, credit role and other credit analytics and risk solutions.","Here I want to briefly review some business highlights, we have discussed the movement to enterprise wide commercial agreement for our desktop products, which is important to understand that outside the desktop business essentially all products were sold at enterprise wide commercial agreements already. With our emphasis on instituting enterprise-wide commercial agreements for our desktop business, by the end of the second quarter, approximately 75% of former Capital IQ desktop customers had been converted.","Also during the quarter, we realized a 13% increase in Market Intelligence active desktop users versus the prior periods. As for the new Market Intelligence platform, progress continues. We have been systematically rolling out the new platform to investment banking clients and rounding the offering with additional Capital IQ content.","In conjunction with Kensho, work is on the way to enhance the screening and search capabilities and we are building unique user interfaces with functionality tailored to different customer types because we know for the corporate threshold wants to see is different than what in equity analyst wants to see. As we rollout future releases to offer flexibility for clients to preview and test platform changes as well as switch back and forth between platform productions to gain comfort with new enhancements.","Turning to Platts, revenue increased 7% in the second quarter including about one percentage point of the growth that was timing related. The single-digit growth in our core subscription business was diluted by weakness in global trading services revenue.","Global trading services generally represent less than 10% of Platts revenue. In the second quarter, it experienced mid-single-digit declines as derivative trading continued to be weak in certain high silver fuel oil products. After reporting a 48% adjusted operating profit margin in the first quarter of this year margins rebounded to 49.9% in the second quarter an increase of 190 basis points over the second quarter of 2017 and coincidentally the first quarter of this year.","Revenue growth outpaced a 3% increase in adjusted expenses. If you look at Platts revenue by its four primary markets, you can see that petroleum and power and gas make up the majority of the business. All four categories delivered revenue growth during the quarter with petrochemicals and metals and ag, leading the way with 20% and 10% growth respectively.","Now turning to our capital position; our cash balance was reduced by approximately $1 billion from the end of 2017 due to the accelerated share repurchase agreement that we initiated in the first quarter. Our debt increased approximately $100 million as we issued a $500 million 30-year bonds to redeem $400 million in maturing debt.","Our debt coverage as measured adjusted growth leverage to adjusted EBITDA remains 1.9 times. Year-to-date free cash flow excluding certain items was $787 million. This was an increase of $152 million versus the first half of 2017 and was due to higher net income from revenue growth, lower tax rate as well as improved working capital. As for return of capital, the $1 billion ASR initiated in the first quarter continues.","In addition, we paid $126 million in dividends during the second quarter. While we do not plan to provide headcount information quarterly, we thought that you might find this information useful. In the past year and half, our headcount increased 4% excluding acquisitions and divestitures headcount increased 3% while organic revenue grew 13% in 2017 and 7% in the first half of 2018.","The largest increase in employees was in corporate. This category increased primarily due to transfers from the businesses to centers of excellence, potential acquisition and in-sourcing of certain corporate functions like recruiting and accounting business support. The costs associated with most of these additions are allocated out to the businesses and are not included in Corporate Unallocated.","Now, I will review our 2018 guidance. This slide takes our previous GAAP guidance and our new GAAP guidance. Please keep in mind that our guidance reflects current spot market ForEx rates. The difference from our previous guidance is highlighted on this slide. The only change is that we are lowering our interest expense guidance by $10 million, diluted EPS guidance remains unchanged.","This slide shows our adjusted guidance. The only change is that we are lowering our interest expense guidance by $10 million. Adjusted diluted EPS guidance remains unchanged as we expect the tax on global intangible low-tax income to push our tax rate to the high end of the guidance. While our tax rate guidance remains 21% to 22.5%, we expect that the third quarter tax rate to be similar to the second quarter tax rate, and then decline in the fourth quarter when annual respected stock grants fest, creating a stock-based compensation tax benefit.","In addition, as you model the third quarter of 2018, remember that the third quarter of 2017 we recorded a $0.14 benefit to EPS as a result of exceptionally high level of stock option exercises. We can't expect that this will occur again in the third quarter of this year. We are pleased with our second quarter results and our guidance reflects our continued expectation that 2018 will be a very strong year for the company.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions.","Chip Merritt","Thank you.

This question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Capital. You may ask your question.","Hamzah Mazari","Hey, good morning, and thank you. My first question is just on the Ratings business. And Doug, I think you mentioned sort of offsets in terms of if issuance is down Ratings can still grow. Maybe if you could frame for us at what level of issuance declines does the Ratings business sort of not grow? Is it sort of double-digit -- issuance needs to decline double digits, just any sensitivity to issuance and how to think about cyclicality of that business?","Doug Peterson","So Hamzah, first of all, thank you for the question and welcome to the call. I don't know if I can always project exactly what that point would be. But let me just give you the dynamics and the different pieces that we look at. Clearly, issuance is very important for us. And as you saw during the quarter, issuance in the United States was very weak except for structured finance. On the corporate side it was down 18% with corporates and financials and public finance overall. So it was quite a weak quarter. But remember that we have two components of revenue. We have transaction fees, which are and could be directly impacted by this, but we also have non-transaction fees, which includes things like RES, it includes the fees that we get for surveillance; it also includes new-issuer fees when we're able to get new issuers to come to market, et cetera.","And so we look at the total, all the components. And as you saw this quarter, despite a weak issuance overall, down 3% in total for the entire market, we were able to increase our revenues 4%. So answering your question a bit more specifically, I don't have a number, I haven't run a sensitivity analysis, none of us have that would get you to what that number is, but we do think that we have flexibility to also flex some of our expenses if we were to see a really large downturn.","Hamzah Mazari","Very helpful. And then my second question, and I'll turn it over, is just on the Market Intelligence segment, that segment seems like it's over-levered to the U.S. Maybe if you could talk about just strategy to grow that business globally and how you're thinking about that? Thank you.","Doug Peterson","Yes, that's something that's really important for us, and not just of Market Intelligence but for every single one of our businesses to respond to the opportunities globally as different markets become more sophisticated, whether it's their capital markets or their pension markets or how they look at the growth of their banking markets, et cetera. We have two components of our businesses across the board, and I'll comment a little bit more specifically to Market Intelligence. Some of our businesses have traditionally done all of their billing in U.S. dollars out of the U.S. And for example in the index business we have always billed traditionally here, and you end up with a -- maybe it's not so easy to always exactly explain where was the client from because it ends up being U.S.-sourced income.","And that's one aspect I wanted to mention that we're always looking out to see how we can ensure that we're identifying the source of our customers, and over time be able to show the components that are international. In Market Intelligence, the combination of Cap IQ and SNL, first of all, the U.S. capital markets and the banking markets, they are the largest in the world. They're the most sophisticated, the largest, with the most number of transactions, whether it's M&A, it's the size of the banking markets, the equity markets, et cetera, and so we would tend to think that that business would be larger here than the rest of the world.","But we do have high growth around the world, especially in Western Europe and Asia. Those are the two markets where we see a lot of take-up of Market Intelligence services especially as there's more and more M&A talking places in those markets and as the capital markets get more sophisticated. But you're right, the center of gravity of MI is in the United States, but we're increasingly investing overseas and seeing much more growth there.","Operator","The next question comes from Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is now open.","Alex Kramm","Hey, good morning everyone. So, on the Ratings side, love to, Ewout I guess, for you to parse out the margin a little bit more. I know you made some comments already on the comp accruals and also the employee numbers were very helpful. But if you think about it from a year-over-year perspective, I mean how much of the increase is really efficiency gains versus maybe mix that you can talk about that may have favorably impacted the margin. And then, of course, how much opportunities do you still think there's left for from an efficiency side. And what are you focused on? Thanks.","Ewout Steenbergen","Hey, Alex, good morning. To put the Ratings result in perspective, 57% margins for the quarter, on the trailing 12-month basis around 55%. During our investor day we have indicated that our aspirational direction for Ratings margins is high-50s. So we have some nice way to go there, but as you have seen, a pretty significant step up in terms of margins this quarter on a trailing 12-month basis, 380 basis points. And we're very pleased to see that, particularly in a quarter where revenue growth is a little bit light. So revenue was up 3.7%, but if you exclude FX it was up 2.2%. And expenses were down, in fact, 5.1%, but excluding FX 3.1% down. So still a gap between revenue growth and expense decline on a basis excluding FX impact of 0 for 5% point, so a very positive development.","Why are expenses going down for Ratings? You see, there are the impacts of some of the restructuring actions that we have taken last year. You might recall the restructuring actions that we explained in the commercial organization, in the analytical organization. So clearly headcount reductions are helping there. We're also seeing that incentive compensation accruals are lower this year than previous year. And we start to see the benefit from some of the technology investments, the efficiency opportunities. So we're able to handle more volume without adding a lot of headcounts. So overall, those are the main drives we see in Ratings. And we expect that we will continue with those drivers in the future, hence the aspirational margin targets of high-50s in the future.","Operator","The next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Toni Kaplan","Hi, good morning. Market Intelligence had a slight revenue deceleration in the quarter with Desktop a little bit slower. Is there anything to read into that from the shift to enterprise pricing, and maybe taking less revenue dollars upfront in order to drive higher usage? Just any thoughts on that, that'd be helpful.","Doug Peterson","Toni, hi, good morning. This is Doug. I don't think you should read anything into it. This was a period where we have been, as you know, engaged in moving our contracts to the enterprise-wide pricing. We're making good progress there. But there's clearly a set of clients left that we will be getting to between now and 2019. Most of the contracts that we moved to enterprise pricing were the largest ones or the ones that had the fortunate convenience that the contracts were expiring. Some of those that are left where we have not gone into any sort of negotiation yet on the upside there are larger contracts, in some cases where they have multiple dates or multiple -- we already had multiyear contacts in place before that we're now going to be able to go in as those expire.","So I didn't read anything into it. We think that the leading indicator of the growth of users, up 13%, is a positive leading indicator for us. I'm not saying that that's -- you should build that into your models. But it's a good leading indicator to us over the time. And as we continue to move everyone to enterprise contracts we're getting toward the end of that, we're at about 75%. We have about 25% to go. But those 25% to go are going to be some of the harder ones that are longer to get those in place.","Toni Kaplan","Okay, that's helpful. And then I just wanted to ask my follow-up on Platts. With 7% growth in the quarter, is this mid-to-high single digits growth sort of a level you'd expect for the foreseeable future just given the high subscription mix. And if global trading services were to turn around what kind of upside could you see in that business? Thanks.","Ewout Steenbergen","Toni, good morning. This is Ewout. As I mentioned during the prepared remarks, of the 7% growth in revenues for Platts there was about 1% of increase that was more one-time in nature. There was some catch-up on some subscription revenue. So if you think about modeling this out in the future you should not take that into account that 1% more one-time revenue. Also, with respect to the Global Trading Services, we don't expect that to rebound in the near-term. That has to do with the specific nature of derivative trading on certain high-sulfur oil fuel products that we see declining that has mostly to do with marine fuel, where in 2020 we will see a prohibition of high fuel oil products in the marine business.","So derivatives trading is already coming down. And we expect over time low sulfur oil fuel products derivative trading to come up, but not in the near-term. So that would be our expectation. But overall we're very pleased that in the core business of Platts, the core price benchmarking subscription business, Platts is really doing well and we see there very steady and solid growth.","Toni Kaplan","Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. You may ask your question.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you. Good morning gentlemen. Maybe I can just follow-up on the Cap IQ Desktop piece. So the last three quarters it has decelerated, I think it was 9.7 and now 5, I guess outside of just maybe some of the friction of transitioning to enterprise, I mean are you seeing pressures on the client side, more people cutting costs, and missed impacts, stuff like that. I was hoping you could give us some color there.","Doug Peterson","There is -- when you come to those sorts of topics, obviously when we're negotiating the clients there's always going to be a give-and-take on different seams related to the circumstances of clients. And we do hear people saying that the two is increasing their costs, or we might hear them talk about the size of their businesses as they downsize. But we see, as you can see overall, the approach that we take to building these enterprise-wide contracts lead to higher usage and higher users. And that is fundamental to our overall relationship and how we think about the long-term pricing of these contracts. But remember that we also are coming off of some very strong growth.","So some of the comparable quarter-on-quarter year-on-year also have been little bit difficult on some of the quarters. But we do see that this is a business that is -- it's still growing. There's high demand and high interest in our products. And some of the pricing on Desktop is also made up on the feeds and the data services as you see some of our customers are moving away from analysts to modeling and sometimes we're able to -- if that there that's the case we can substitute over into the data services products.","Ewout Steenbergen","And Manav, if I may build on Doug's answer, I think you should also look at the Asian perspective of the whole industry. I think the growth numbers we are reporting are thus far exceeding any other player in the industry. So we are still clearly a net winner of the market share at this point in time.","The other additional perspective I wanted to share is the conversion to enterprise-wide agreements, what we see happening now is that the contract that we had in the past that were on an annual basis, those come up in the normal course calendar and have been converted to enterprise-wide contracts. But we also had a set of contracts that had multi-year at terms, and those will come up more slowly in the future because again the natural calendar when those multi-year contracts are expiring will be out in the future. So that's why the slowdown from the current 70% to 74% to 100%, that's what you should expect, but there is no specific underlying reason besides that these are now the more multi-year contracts that we need to convert, and that takes officially a little bit more time.","Manav Patnaik","Got it, that's helpful. And then my second question is just on the index subscription fees, the slowdown you talked about due to administrative process changes, I imagine that on your end, but I guess does that mean in the third and fourth quarter there will be a catch-up, which will make that growth look about normal?","Ewout Steenbergen","Hey, Manav, what is happening here is we made some changes early this year in administrative processes, and also we moved some of the billing and contracting on those contracts to another profile and other administrator, it's one of our partners. There is a bit administrative backlog they're sending out new contracts, and only when the new contracts are signed we can send out the bills. So therefore, from an accounting perspective, we cannot recognize that revenue. But this is purely a technical administrative matter, and we expect to see that catch-up again in the second-half of this year. So yes, we expect this to normalize, and there is no commercial disagreement or commercial matter behind it, it's purely administrative.","Manav Patnaik","All right, thank you guys.","Doug Peterson","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Jeff Silber","Thank you so much. Just wanted to circle back to market intelligence again, you had mentioned or you have highlighted the fact that margins went up year-over-year in the second quarter versus I guess the lower margins that you saw in the first quarter. Were there something going on differently between 1Q and 2Q, and what should we expect going forward? Thanks.","Ewout Steenbergen","Jeff, this is Ewout. We highlighted during our first quarter earnings call that there were certain specific expense items that were more timing-related that should reverse during the course of 2018 or should not recur during other quarters of 2018. Therefore, we always expected that margins of market intelligence would improve during the next few quarters. And what we assessed last quarter was we expect overall a year-over-year margin improvement for market intelligence at 2018 as a whole should be better than 2017 on the margin basis. So basically in line with that commitments and promise to our investors the space that we are delivering this quarter and we expect that to continue for the next few quarters. So overall, that commitment remains.","Jeff Silber","All right, great. And then -- I appreciate that reminder. In terms of your overall guidance except for the item you highlighted, I mean interest expenses didn't really change despite the fact that you really outperformed the first-half of the year. Are you being overly conservative, should we expect a slowdown in the second-half of the year, if you can give us a little bit color on that we appreciate it. Thanks.","Ewout Steenbergen","Yes. Our guidance is of course always middle of the road, neither aggressive nor conservative. So that's how you should always interpret this. There is indeed a couple of elements that go in a opposite and to a negative direction, but are basically offsetting each other. We expect that interest line to be a little lower as we have indicated. At the same time, we expect the tax rate to be more at the high-end of the range that we have indicated before. So the two are therefore more or less offsetting, and therefore we are still very comfortable to continue to affirm our EPS guidance raise as we done this morning.","Jeff Silber","Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question.","Peter Appert","Thank you. Good morning. Doug, you mentioned that the bank loan market got a little bit weaker late in the quarter. I wonder if that has any continuing implications for the second-half or even more broadly if you could just give your thoughts about outlook for issuance activity in the second-half.","Doug Peterson","Okay, good. In fact there is a little confusion; glad you asked that question. There is two components to the bank loan market; one is the issuance of bank loans, and those are as I mentioned many cases, those could either go to the high-yield bond market or they could go to the bank loan market. And that market is incredibly strong. And that's where you see the volume. That's where you see the crossing the $1 trillion mark for the inventory that's outstanding et cetera. That continues to be very strong as you see there is a lot of M&A activity.","The part that I said there was a little bit weak is the refinancing. There had been a period where bank loans that had been issued the last prior two or three years as rates and spreads had been coming in and getting tighter and tighter. There was many of the -- some of the activity was of issuer, so we are going back and re-pricing their bank loans. When a bank loan re-prices, we get a small fee, it's not the same kind of the fee you get when you have an initial transaction. But that's the component of the market that is a little bit weak. But the reason it's weak is because the initial issuance is so strong, and it's basically crowding out the ability of issuers to go to the market to tap refinancing, oh, re-pricing; sorry, not refinancing, re-pricing.","Peter Appert","Got it. Excellent, thank you. And then, maybe just an update on the Kensho transaction in terms of momentum you are seeing there and Ewout I think you talked about three years of incentive payments, can you quantify what those will be?","Ewout Steenbergen","Yes, Peter. Let me take the first answer -- the second question you asked and answer that first. With respect to the incentive compensation, so if you look at the transaction consideration for Kensho, a part was in cash and a part was in shares. And we deliberately paid a part in shares to get maximum alignments particularly with the employee shareholders. And those are being amortized over time. What we are doing in our results is any equity grants that were over and above what should be assumed normal compensation are pulled out as a performance correction on a non-GAAP basis. And all equity grants that are more considered normal course are kept in our normal operating expenses and results on a performance basis.","So if you look at $12 million of Kensho -- with Kensho related expenses that were pulled out, what basically the expense related to those excess equity grants, that number should come down over time. That's more because of the accounting. We use accelerating accounting methods. So over the next three years, that should slow the come down and three years from now that's particular expense line item should completely disappear. But then you see that Kensho itself had a normal course about $11 million of expenses that we have in our non-GAAP results as well as approximately $5 million of revenues that we have for the quarter.","Doug Peterson","On your first question about how the Kensho implementation and transaction is going, let me step in a little bit. We have an incredible amount of excitement both internally in the company as well as from the market. So since we purchased Kensho we have instituted a very thorough systematic approach to what I would call integration, even though you know that we are not integrating the company, it has to do with insuring that the resources of Kensho are deployed against the best opportunities where they can add value across the company. That means that every division has some type of work going on, probably most of it's in market intelligence, and the kind of work begins at the beginning of bringing data ingestion, data linking, it also involves projects in the middle part of our workflow that has to do with creating products analytics adding value, enhancing the analytics that we have.","And then at the front-end, the delivery end of our businesses with search and visualization and other tools, so we are very pleased with the progress. You saw that there were a couple of things during the quarter when we added the 400,000 private company information from Crunchbase. We were able to do that utilizing Kensho Technology. It was accelerated from something that would have taken about six months to a couple of weeks. And we have recently put a tab on the market intelligence platform which has a Kensho lab on it where you can see two different products, well, they are not products yet, but I guess you can call them a pilot or demo. Those are some of the things you can do at Kensho. One of them is for ","alternative credit indicators and the other is for analyzing the commercial real estate market. So we're very pleased with the progress, much more to come, and thank you for the question.","Doug Peterson","Thank you. If I may just add one other element to that, we will later this year come back to you about the economic benefit will have from all of those projects so we're setting up a value capture of methodology, so expect later this year that we get back to you and of course all your colleagues and investors with more specifics about what do we really get out of that and the value enhancement from those projects.","Peter Appert","All right, thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. You may ask your question.","Craig Huber","Thank you. Doug, my first question, can you just appreciate your thoughts on the bank loans earlier but can you just give us little bit further ideally you guys are thinking on the bank loan market for the back-half of this year in terms of where you are sensing there's an happen?","Doug Peterson","But what we're sensing in the bank loan market right now obviously is just based on where we are with the current banking environment and financial market environment. The first of all one of the key factors which we're watching very carefully are spreads and rate and you do have some shift from bank loan market as well as the high yield market moving to Europe.","I mentioned in my prepared comments that we've seen the reverse Yankee bond trend starting where there's more and more companies going to Europe to raise funds, clearly with the U.S. 10 year yield it almost 3% around 2.9% and the German 10 year yield it 0.4% that differential of 240 to 250 basis points means that sometimes raising funds in Europe is a lot more interesting, so in terms of where people might be raising funds we see some differences there but the key driver of the loan activity as well as the high yield bonds activity is much more linked to market activity M&A, investments in factories etcetera.","The only negative factor which we're obviously watching very carefully is just will there be any impact on global growth from some of the exogenous factors like trade, wars and things like that I mean it was encouraging yesterday to see that the U.S. and the E.U. are going to go to the table to negotiate the truth conditions. I would hope that at some point we can get to the same place with China but underlying market conditions are still very strong they're very robust banks have a lot of capital.","Investment community is looking replaces to invest but we have seen more volatility in the meantime but as of now we don't have any specific indicators that would change your outlook for the rest of the year in bank loans.","Craig Huber","And then also the new platform here in the process of rolling out for Capital IQ when do you think that will be fully deployed in the U.S. a little bit you have outside the U.S.?","Ewout Steenbergen","Craig, that's probably over the next two years or so because who will go step by step, customer group by customer group, persona by persona that needs a lot of support hand-holding explanation because some data might be in another place it is important that our customers can find it we don't want to confront them so only for one day together with a new platform and they are lost, so that needs a lot of support from our sales force and our whole market intelligence organizations, so therefore we do days in a step by step basis because it's very important we take our customers along the way with that transition.","Doug Peterson","One thing I would mention is that we've seen the success of the conversion of what was the S&L product to the in my platform and so that gives us the ability to understand what were the over the need to the customers along the way and as Ewout said this is a systematic approach over the next couple of years and it will have a conversion of cap IQ users and then also include certain risk products and we're very encouraged that the platform itself whether it continues with the name in my or it's an S&P global platform or rescanned for other products like plants etcetera that the kind of expertise we're getting from the technology is going to be beneficial to the entire company.","Operator","The next question is from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your may ask your question.","Mike Reid","Hi guys, this is Mike Reid on for Joe. I was wondering if you think this period was more normal for the exchange traded derivative growth or going to spike back up or probably just too volatile to tell?","Ewout Steenbergen","Mike, that is actually very hard to tell because as you've seen the three different categories and groups some are up some are down that you could say they are still a lot of market productivity in the world but in fact fixed contracts came down in terms of volume, so this is in fact an interesting situation that we could say there is quite some volatility in fix their volume trading period-over-period. So it's very hard to tell we definitely think the first quarter was more an exception with very high volumes. So that would be only what we would expect to see recurring if you're really high to heightened tension in the walls but otherwise it's very hard to predict.","Doug Peterson","Mike, this is Doug, this is just an anecdote for myself personally I watch VIX, I think that the VIX is a good indicator of market volatility to begin with but second that is one of the major ETDs and the more volatility there is in the market, the more trading there is, the more likely that the ETD revenues are going up, so when if you go back last year there was the VIX had been kind of locked into a very low level below 10 for many quarters. And then it started popping up again it got its highs into the 30s over a couple of weeks and that's typically the leading indicator that I watch to see how I think the ETD revenue is going to be coming out.","Mike Reid","Okay, thanks for the color on that, and then just quickly, do you think to be any impact the numbers at all this year from rate watch?","Doug Peterson","I would say relatively modest and it will help of course with some revenue impact but there will be some integration expenses as well and some synergies that will be able to achieve over time, so normally that would be about a year to year that we will be able to take to full economic benefits off of this acquisition. We are very enthusiastic about this acquisition. We think it helps with a new set of customers particularly community banks in the U.S. And so we're very happy that we added that set of customers to market intelligence but expect the benefits to see that slowly coming in over the next year to two years that's probably the best expectation.","Mike Reid","All right, thanks guys.","Doug Peterson","Thanks.","Operator","Next question is from Tim McHugh from William Blair and Company. You may ask your question.","Trevor Romeo","Hi, this is Trevor Romeo on for Tim. Thanks for taking the questions. First of all, revenue for structured products has been growing double digits for five straight quarters now as mentioned, that the global economy is a bit stronger and we've had some positive regulatory changes for structured products lately but you think the level of strength sustainable going forward particularly as comparison will start to get tougher in the next few quarters?","Doug Peterson","Just to be clear are you talking about structured finance in ratings?","Q - Trevor Romeo","Yes.","Doug Peterson","Okay, well, typically when we see this kind of strength coming in one product it from the banking sector and other sectors which are taking advantage of the securitization markets and access to capital there and I don't know, I don't want to project going forward exactly where issuance is going to be coming from but we've seen the strength in structured finance a lot of it is been related to banks wanting to manage your balance sheet, as they've been managing capital levels and they've been going to tap the AFS market for credit card receivables, other receivables things like that as the balance management tool.","And then you see a lot of special purpose vehicles in CMBS in the other areas but this is just been a period where the capital markets were drawn towards structured finance. It's has been growing every quarter but I don't what I think that I do obviously almost continuously but definitely at the quarter end it was very carefully at the all of the different sources of issuance around the world and one thing I can tell you that every quarter the components of where growth is coming changes from quarter-to-quarter.","Trevor Romeo","Okay, thanks. And then just wanted to touch on any geographic differences you're seeing for plats, revenue was kind of flattish in this quarter in the U.S., but grew double digits internationally, so is there anything you point out the trail of strong international growth that didn't necessarily happen in the U.S?","Doug Peterson","Yes, overall plats in general or most international business in fact they are headquartered in London and in fact their business is very international in Europe and particularly in Asia and we are very happy to see growth sales in Asia doing very well but also Europe is a strong. I think that has just to do with the saturation of, situation levels of the markets issue a lot of economic activity in Asia and we are clearly taking the benefit for our plats business so overall we would expect to see that continuing and they're actually coming back to an earlier question this is clearly as part of our strategy to more actively grow our activities outside of the U.S.","Trevor Romeo","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from Vincent Hung with Autonomous. Your line is now open.","Vincent Hung","Hi, on market intelligence, for those you converted to enterprise what pricing already is there anything you can share in terms of usage trends you're seeing with Cap IQ can just trying to get a sense of where the stickiness is building with the new uses?","Doug Peterson","I think that that would be a great question for us to take up on some future calls. I don't have enough of a granular view on that to give you an answer right now because we typically once we move to those kind of contracts in addition we start having a blended approach which is it's an enterprise wide contract, so if you don't mind let's get back to you on a future call.","Vincent Hung","Noted. And on indices just want to get your thoughts on the growing trend of ETS issue is like Black Rock investigated starting to get itself indexing in fixed income factorized arena, is it something that concerns you?","Doug Peterson","Overall, the answer is no. And that is a trend we don't think will be a large change to the markets because if you look at the big benchmark indices those are not really aim to replace those dishes more for new categories or for ETS. So overall that's only for a very small part of the markets but there is not in our few any intention to compete with the large benchmark indices, so overall we don't see that as a threat to our overall business model.","Vincent Hung","Thanks.","Operator","We will now take our final question from Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is open.","Doug Peterson","Alex welcome back.","Alex Kramm","Yes, not sure what happened there but thank you for actually just quickly on the rating side since I asked about the cost earlier maybe you can talk about the revenue opportunity there a little bit as well I mean anything new that you're investing and that, that you would point out I know you've talked about China, but historically you've lost some share in CMBS for example what are you doing there and then at Doug I think you pointed out cover bonds being an area of strength I thought you were actually pretty small in that business relative to your primary competitor, so are you catching up there anything I would point out we actually try to grow the business organically on the ratings that would be helpful?","Doug Peterson","Yes, well, just to give you some examples and some ideas as our goal is to cover every asset class in every region in the world and places where we don't have a position like in China domestic market we're investing there as, we had a weak run in the CMBS market over the last few years we've invested there in our team. Our criteria, our technology to be able to deliver last quarter we were participate in four out of the 10 conduit fusion.","Transactions in the CMBS market, we are definitely making a concerted effort to continue to support the structured finance market. We're growing internationally in China we're looking at more ways to go in Southeast Asia. We have some products that we're working on related to ESG whether it's our green bond products and some other ESG indicators so across the board if you see any type of analytical product or ratings product which is being developed, we're whether we're developing and we have it ready to go we definitely have somebody looking at it we're working on it but the ones that are more promising is getting our way back into much more, much larger position on structured finance globally looking at China, looking at Southeast Asia, looking at ESG.","These are some of those factors and I don't think I mentioned covered bonds, covered bonds is an area that we do not have a strong position in, I maybe I misspoke or I was more likely talking about the about the high yield bond market in Europe not necessarily covered bond market but anyway we're excited about the growth in the ratings business and the opportunities we have there, especially with all the new types of asset classes.","Alex Kramm","Thanks.","Doug Peterson","Well, thank you everyone for the call and as you've seen today we and as we presented on our Investor Day earlier in the quarter. S&P Global has developed a strategy to power the markets a future. We've been incorporating the dynamics of the markets around us looking at our competitors understanding the competitive landscape, what's happening with technology. And as you can see from the quarter, we appreciate all the questions that you came back with. The leadership team here at the company is committed to deliver our performance both on a quarterly basis, but also in a way that we can allocate what I consider to be our scarce capital, so that we can send it back to our shareholders, but also build and invest for the future of S&P Global.","So I want to thank everyone for their support for their participation on the call, the people in the northern hemisphere I hope you also get a chance to enjoy the summer. So, thank you very much everyone.","Operator","Thank you concludes this morning's call. A PDF version of the presenter slide is available now for downloading from investor.spglobal.com.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce Mr. Chip Merritt, Vice President of Investor Relations for S&P Global. Sir, you may begin.","Chip Merritt","Thank you, good morning. Thank you for joining S&P Global's earnings call. Presenting on this morning's call are Doug Peterson, President and CEO; and Ewout Steenbergen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","This morning, we issued a news release with our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results. If you need a copy of this release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at investor.spglobal.com.","In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we're providing adjusted financial information.

However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Jason Feuchtwanger at 212-438-1247.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?","Douglas Peterson","Good morning. Thank you, Chip. Welcome to the call today.","S&P Global completed an exceptional year with strong fourth quarter results with every division delivering topline growth or investing in new products and enhancing productivity. I\u2019m going to review our full year highlights and financial performance and Ewout will review the fourth quarter results for the moment.","Let me begin with the full year highlights. Every division produced strong financial performance while investing in new products and productivity. We delivered impressive financial performance with 13% organic revenue growth and 29% adjusted EPS growth. We generated approximately $1.8 billion of free cash flow and returned $1.4 billion through share repurchases and dividends.","We introduced a new capital management framework which includes our commitment to returning capital to our investors and late in the year, we realigned the company by installing a new integrated operating model designed to stimulate innovation and drive digital transformation. This should enable us to work together more efficiently as all of the businesses will have access to share digital infrastructure, data operations and engineering and technology.","We're fortunate to have so many iconic brands and products but none are as widely recognized as the S&P 500 which celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2017 but we must continue to invest in new products and strategic partnerships to maintain a competitive edge. Some examples from 2017 include when S&P Dow Jones Indices launched the S&P Green Bond Select Index.","ICE launched LNG derivative contracts which are cash settled against the Platts LNG Gulf Coast Marker. Ratings launched Green Evaluations which aim to provide investors with a more comprehensive picture of the green impact in climate risk attributes to bond. We reduced the first release of the new Market Intelligence platform to all SNL users and a beta release to our investment banking customers.","And we advanced in fintech with investments in Algomi, a company that has created a bond information network. Kensho, a company that provides next-generation analytics, machine learning and data visualization versus space systems, a satellite imagery data and analytics provider, an acquisition by CRISIL Pragmatix, a data analytics company for the banking, financial services and insurance industry.","Looking more closely to full year 2017 financial results, the company reported 7% revenue growth and reached 13% growth on an organic basis. The company achieved a 420 basis point improvement in adjusted operating profit margin due to strong organic revenue growth, the sale of lower margin businesses and productivity initiatives.","We delivered exceptional earnings with adjusted diluted EPS of $6.89, 29% higher than in 2016. This figure includes $0.04 a share on favorable impact from ForEx and $0.28 a share favorable tax benefit related to stock-based compensation both of which Ewout will discuss in a moment.","The financial success in 2017 was not an isolated event. Over the last four years, we produced a 7% compounded annual growth rate in revenue. In addition over the same timeframe, we've improved our adjusted operating profit margin by over 1200 basis points.","The company has consistently grown adjusted EPS with a four year CAGR of 20%. The multiyear growth in revenue, adjusted operating profit margin, and adjusted EPS are noteworthy achievements, however we are not done. We believe there is still plenty of opportunity to improve all of these metrics.","The strength of our portfolio is particularly evident on this slide as every segment delivered strong gains in organic revenue and adjusted operating profit. Keep in mind that the markets and commodities intelligence reported results were negatively impacted by the sale of several businesses.","What I\u2019d like to do now is provide color on some of the 2017 drivers of our Ratings business. This chart breaks down the components of full year 2017 global issuance but instead of depicting financial and nonfinancial issuance, this shows the split between investment-grade and high-yield.","Excluding sovereign issuance which is not a major driver of our result, 2017 global issuance increased 7%. Because high-yield issuers are seldom part of the frequent issuer program, their issuance is more impactful to our revenue than other categories. So this 53% increase in high-yield issuance was a key factor in Ratings revenue growth in 2017, an 18% increase in structured finance issuance was also a strong contributor.","When tracking issuance data, we always try to point out that where issuance takes place, which type of issuance, and the size of the deals makes a difference in the revenue we realize. Global issuance in the fourth quarter excluding sovereign debt increased 19% with strength across all regions. Geographically issuance in the United States increased 19% in the fourth quarter with investment-grade increasing 6%, high-yield soaring 47%, public finance increasing 39%, and structured finance increasing 12% due primarily to strength in ABS in RMBS.","In Europe, issuance increased 20% in the quarter with investment-grade increasing 15%, high-yield vaulting 192%, while structured finance dropped 7%. In Asia, issuance grew 15%. The vast majority of Asian issuance however is made up of local China debt that we don't rate.","Leveraged loan volumes become increasingly important to our revenue based on two factors. First, the level of issuance is increased over time, and second the percentage of loans rated has increased over time. This chart depicts both of these trends as they have played out in the U.S. and Europe.","In the U.S. the percentage of loans rated increased from 57% in 2012 to 89% in 2017. In Europe the figure increased from 48% in 2012 to 73% in 2017. For all of 2017, bank loan ratings revenue increased 39% with exceptional growth earlier in the year. During the fourth quarter, bank loan revenue of $83 million contributed to the revenue growth in Ratings.","In a moment, Ewout will provide more information on our fourth quarter results, but first I want to turn to our outlook for 2018, and let's start with our global economic forecasts. Our current economic outlook calls for continued global growth, in fact our expectation for 2018 is 3.8%, slightly ahead of our 2017 forecast of 3.7%.","In the U.S., low unemployment continues to contribute to growth. In 2017, job gains averaged 171,000 per month. In addition, new tax cuts should accelerate business and consumer spending. After years of anemic growth, the Eurozone is experiencing a strong cyclical rebound led by Germany, the Netherlands and Spain.","In China, authorities are focusing on a sustainable macro credit path or pursuing growth friendly policies. In Latin America stable commodity prices and low long-term interest rates in advanced economies have increased capital flows. Many of our businesses benefit from stronger global growth, so the expectation for improved global GDP is very encouraging.","Two weeks ago Ratings issued its annual global refinancing study. This yearly study shows debt maturities for the upcoming five years. The chart on the left illustrates data from the 2017 and 2018 studies. The five-year period in 2018 study shows a $600 billion increase in the total debt maturing over the 2017 study. We use this study along with other market-based data to forecast issuance.","Taking a closer look at data from the study reveals an important trend in high-yield maturity seen in the chart on the right hand side of this slide. Over the next five years, the level of high-yield debt maturing significantly increases each year which is a potential source of revenue in the coming years.","In January Ratings published it's 2018 issuance forecast. This forecast provides estimates for each of the major issuance categories. Importantly, we anticipate the impact of U.S. tax reform may produce a neutral to modestly negative impact on 2018 issuance.","For 2018 excluding international public finance which is not material to our results, we expect a medium decrease of approximately 1% in 2018 in overall issuance. Our forecast of a 31% decline in U.S. public finance due to tax reform will likely be off-site by increases in global structured finance and financial services. We expect a 2% decline among non-financial corporates due to some factors from the U.S. tax reform.","While not depicted on this slide, 2018 U.S. leveraged loans are expected to be flat or possibly decline with fewer refinancings after completing the busiest year ever for leverage loans. In Europe, 2017 leverage loan volume was at its highest since 2007.","Europe will likely also see refinancing in 2018. Although both the U.S. and Europe could experience a pickup in funding for mergers and acquisitions with private equity and corporate issuers looking to take advantage of improving economic conditions.","As we begin 2018, let me share some highlights of our enterprise goals. Creating shareholder value is always a top priority but we would like to add to our strong track record in 2018. We're introducing mid single-digit organic revenue growth and adjusted diluted EPS guidance of $8.45 to $8.60. This EPS guidance includes more than $1 per share, $1 per share of expected benefit from a lower effective tax rate due to U.S. tax reform. Ewout will provide additional detail on our guidance in a moment.","The core of our strategy and purpose revolves around serving markets and fulfilling the needs of our customers. Some key initiatives include increasing investments in new technologies, alternative data in ESG. We embrace data science and machine learning to drive product innovation and internal productivity.","Growing ratings beyond the core through expansion of additional credit tools include ESG, Green Evaluations and Ratings360. We're leasing multiple versions of the new Market Intelligence platform and starting a methodical, thoughtful transition with S&P Capital IQ users to new platform toward the end of the year.","Enhancing our Platts commercial model and simplifying our customer facing and operating platform for improved user experience and expanding index product offering in factors, smart Beta, ESG and solution-based indices. And we want to continue to deliver excellence by funding productivity initiatives and process improvements. There are countless projects underway to optimize and standardize processes using lean methodologies and automation.","Executing our IT and data roadmap to enhance the quality of our offerings and drive productivity and protect our assets, data and operations. And importantly, we want to deliver these results while maintaining our commitment to compliance and risk management.","Fortunately we have a strong leadership team and committed and dedicated employees around the world who strive to learn, grow and serve every day. Finally, we\u2019ll host an Investor Day in New York City on May 24. We will issue a press release with details of the event along with an invitation RSVP as get closer to the date.","Now let me turn the call over to Ewout to provide more specifics on both our business results during the quarter and our 2018 guidance. Ewout?","Ewout Steenbergen","Thank you, Doug and good morning to everyone on the call. This morning I would like to discuss the fourth quarter results, the impact from U.S. tax reform on our results and then provide specifics on our 2018 guidance.","The company finished the year with exceptional results in the fourth quarter. Revenue increased 14% with growth in every segment. Adjusted unallocated expenses increased 19% primarily due to performance related incentive compensation cost and a companywide IT project to replace our order to cash system.","Adjusted operating profit increased 28% and adjusted operating profit margin increased 530 basis points. Our adjusted effective tax rate declined to 28.5% primarily due to the discrete tax benefit from stock option exercises which I will overview in a moment. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 44% to $1.85 per share.","We introduced this slide during the third quarter earnings call and have updated it today. A recent change in FASB guidance related to stock payments to employees result in a tax benefit when employee stock options are exercised and this change also results in the tax benefit whenever employee stock grants vest and the fair market value of the stock exceeds the grant price. These impacts are recorded as reductions in tax expense.","During the fourth quarter, we reported a reduction in tax expense that improved fourth quarter adjusted EPS by $0.08, $0.06 was due to the vesting of restricted stock which occurs each year in the fourth quarter and $0.02 was due to the exercise of stock options. We estimate that there will be a beneficial impact for 2018 EPS of $0.10 to $0.20. This benefit is reflected in our 2018 effective tax rate guidance.","Net of hedges, foreign exchange rates had a $16 million positive impact on the company's revenue and a $3 million positive impact on adjusted operating profit or about $0.01 per share in the fourth quarter. The bulk of the impact was under rating segment. Ratings adjusted operating profit was primarily impacted by the Euro and the British pound.","Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. Pretax adjustments to earnings totaled to a loss of $124 million in the quarter and these included an increase in our legal settlement reserve, restructuring actions in Ratings, Market Intelligence and Corporate. Despite strong results, we are continuously looking for opportunities to transition to leaner and more effective organizations.","Lease exit charges associated with vacating double floors of space in London and New York as we continue to try to minimize our footprint in high cost locations. Together these restructuring actions and lease exits will result in annual savings of approximately $40 million.","$25 million in due related amortization expense, a charge associated with U.K. retirees or due to a change in the law chose to take a lump-sum payment from the defined benefit pension plan. These pretax items total $124 million. Because of U.S. tax reform, we're taking a net tax charge of $149 million which I will review in a moment. In addition, we incurred a tax benefit from prior year divestitures of $21 million. These two after-tax items total $128 million.","In the fourth quarter led by ratings every business segment contributed to gains in organic revenue, adjusted operating profit, and adjusted operating profit margin. It's very gratifying to see strength in every segment and progress in every metric.","Let me now turn to the individual segment's performance and start with Ratings. Ratings revenue increased 20% or 18% excluding the favorable impact from ForEx. Adjusted operating profit increased 40%, while the adjusted operating margin increased 810 basis points to 55.6%.","As we have said in the past, we managed the ratings business on a rolling four quarters basis and you can see on that basis the adjusted operating margin increased 400 basis points to 53.8%. This marks the 6th consecutive year that the adjusted operating profit margin has improved by more than 100 basis points, as the business continues to successfully grow revenue and identify and implement productivity initiatives.","Both transaction and non-transaction revenue recorded very strong growth. Non-transaction revenue increased 12% due primarily to growth in fees associated with surveillance, short-term debt including commercial paper and new entity ratings. Transaction revenue increased 29% primarily from gains in U.S. corporate bonds particularly high-yield bonds, global structured products and a modest gain in bank loans.","If you look at Ratings revenue by its various markets, you can see there were gains in every category with the greatest gains in corporates and structured products. Corporates revenue was boosted by a large increase in high-yield issuance structured finance revenue increase with gains in every asset class.","Let me now turn to market and commodities intelligence. This segment includes S&P Global Market Intelligence and S&P Global Platts. In the fourth quarter, reported revenue increased 7% and organic revenue increased 8%. Due primarily to divestitures, organic growth and synergies realization, adjusted operating profit improved 13% and adjusted operating margin improved 200 basis points to 36.5% and full-year adjusted operating segment margin increased 310 basis points to 37.2%.","Turning to Market Intelligence excluding recent divestitures, organic revenue grew 10% with growth across all major categories. We continue to benefit from a diverse sets of customer types with commercial banks, insurance companies and private equities bolstering growth.","At the beginning of 2017, Market Intelligence combined the former SNL and Capital IQ sales team into one market intelligence sales force and transformed the commercial model into one offering that is priced on an enterprise wide contract. This commercial process has contributed to growth of Market Intelligence desktop users which increased 15% versus the end of 2016.","At the end of the third quarter we told you that approximately one-third of RatingsDirect and Capital IQ desktop businesses has been conferred as to enterprise-wide commercial agreements. At the end of the fourth quarter, that figure reached approximately 55%. In addition we have migrated nearly all former SNL users to the new market intelligence platform. As with any beta release, our customers have provided important feedback and we're actively working to resolve all of the items on our funds list.","Looking more deeply at Market Intelligence revenue, all three components delivered strong organic revenue growth. Desktop products grew 9%, data management solutions increased 12%, risk services grew 9% with ratings Xpress and RatingsDirect providing low teen and high single-digit growth respectively. And finally note that there was $5 million of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016 from businesses that were divested.","When we announced the acquisition of SNL back in 2015, we established a $70 million synergy targets through 2019. This divest was later increased to $100 million. Over this period, we have delivered a significant improvement in the adjusted operating margin of this business. Today we are announcing the successful completion of the $100 million synergy program. We estimate that approximately $50 million of savings were reflected in our 2016 results and that an additional $25 million of savings were reflected in our 2017 results.","By the end of 2017, all projects have been launched. In total this program will deliver $105 million in annual synergies with $85 million of cost synergies and $20 million of revenue synergies. In addition to delivering on our synergy commitment, we have created a fully integrated business with a powerful new platform.","The Market Intelligence platform was built on the foundation of rich S&P Capital IQ financial data and deep SNL sector data combined with trusted analytics. The new Market Intelligence platform leverages the technology behind its predecessor the SNL platform to offer an intuitive interface with content and functionality that can be accessed on any device.","Turning to Platts. Revenue increased 5% with a core subscription business growing mid single-digit. This was somewhat offset by global trading services revenue which decreased mid single-digits primarily due to weaker derivative trading in petroleum and metals.","Beginning in 2018, Platts will be managed as a separate business and reported as a separate segment. To help you with modeling, Exhibit 10 in the press release has Platts pro forma 2017 data on that basis.","If you look at Platts revenue by its four primary markets, you can see that petroleum and power and gas makeup the majority of the business. Platts growth this quarter came primarily from petroleum which benefited from solar subscription growth partially offset by weak global trading activity. In addition, petrochemicals contributed 10% growth and metals and agriculture increased 8%.","Let me now turn to indices. Revenue increased 12% mostly due to continued growth in ETF assets under management. Adjusted operating profit increased 16%, adjusted operating margin increased 210 basis points to 63.7%. For the full-year, the adjusted operating margin declined 10 basis points primarily due to the acquisition of Trucost.","Asset linked fees which are principally derived from ETFs mutual funds and certain OTC derivatives experienced the greatest growth in the fourth quarter rising 17% driven by a 34% increase in average ETF AUM. Exchange traded derivative revenue rose 12% with gains in S&P 500 Index options and fixed futures and options activity. Subscription revenue decreased 3% with modest organic growth offset primarily by the timing of customer reporting.","The trend of assets moving into passive investments shows no signs of letting up with the exchange traded products industry reaching net inflows of $174 billion in the fourth quarter and establishing a new annual record with yearly inflows of $633 billion and this is an increase of about 67% over the prior record inflows in 2016.","The year ending ETF AUM guide to our indices totaled $1,343 billion up 31% versus the end of 2016. As the chart shows, this was a result of $146 billion of net inflows and $174 billion of market appreciation over the last 12 months. The $1,343 billion is a new record.","The fourth quarter average AUM associated with our indices increased 34% year-over-year. This is a better proxy for revenue changes than the quarter end figures. Exchange rate of derivative volume was mixed. Key contracts include increased S&P 500 index options and fixed futures and options which experienced robust activity and a decline in activity at the CME equity complex.","Now turning to our capital position. At the end of 2017, we had $2.8 billion of cash and $3.6 billion of short and long-term debt. Approximately $2.1 billion of our cash was held outside the United States at the end of the year. Our debt coverage as measured by adjusted growth leverage to adjusted EBITDA declined slightly to 1.9 times versus 2.1 times at the end of 2016.","2017 free cash flow was approximately $1.85 billion of which nearly $700 million was generated during the fourth quarter. Consistent with our capital management philosophy, we paid out approximately 75% of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2017. The company returned $1 billion to repurchase 6.8 million share and $421 million in dividends for a total of $1.4 billion.","As we look at U.S. tax reform we are impacted in three principal areas. First, we have recorded a net charge to Texas of $149 million in the fourth quarter. This is composed of a $173 million tax on deemed repatriated foreign earnings. The cash tax payments will be made over the next eight years. This expense is partially offset by a $24 million tax benefit from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities.","Second, tax form will have a significant impact on our effective tax rate. We estimate that we will have an effective tax rate of between 21% and 22.5% in 2018 down considerably from the 28.9% adjusted effective tax rate in 2017.","Third, the reduction in our effective tax rate will generate approximately $200 million both additional cash flow in 2018. The U.S. tax reform will have an impact on cash availability and capital deployment. Our ability to generate free cash flow will substantially increase as a direct result of the lower effective tax rate.","We now have access to offshore cash and our first priority is to reinvest it in our businesses and to strengthen core capabilities consistent with our strategic priorities and disciplined capital management philosophy. We will continue to return at least 75% of annual free cash flow generation through dividends and share repurchases.","Today we announced a large dividend increase of 22% bringing the annualized dividend rate to $2 per share supported by a significant increase in our net income and free cash flow and our desire to support the dividend yields. This marks the 45th consecutive year of dividend increases.","Also we are making a stepped up investment in our communities through a $20 million contribution to the S&P Global Foundation in the first quarter of 2018. Note that this will impact our first quarter results.","Now lastly I will introduce our 2018 guidance. This slide depicts our GAAP guidance. Please keep in mind that our guidance reflects current spot market ForEx rates. This slide shows our adjusted guidance, an increase in revenue of mid single-digit with contributions by every business segments. Unallocated expense of $160 million to $170 million, pension benefit of $25 million to $30 million and the past most of this benefit or cost was included in unallocated expense.","Due related amortization of $95 million, operating profit margin in a range of 47.5% to 48.5%, interest expense of $145 million to $150 million, a tax rate of 21% to 22.5% and diluted EPS which excludes deal-related amortization of $8.45 to $8.60. In addition we expect capital expenditures of approximately $125 million and free cash flow excluding certain items of approximately $2.3 billion. Overall this guidance reflects our expectation that 2018 bolstered by continued performance improvements and by U.S. tax reform will be a very strong year for the company.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions.","Chip Merritt","Thanks Ewout.","Just a couple of instructions for our phone participants, please press Star 1 to indicate that you wish to enter the queue to ask a question. To cancel or withdraw your question, simply press Star 2. I would kindly ask that you limit yourself to two questions; that's two questions, in order to allow time for other callers during today's Q&A session. If you've been listening through a speaker phone, but would like to now ask a question, we ask that you lift your handset prior to pressing Star 1 and remain on the handset until your question has been answered. This will ensure better sound quality.","Operator, we'll now take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","This question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Research. You may now ask your question.","Hamzah Mazari","The first question is just on U.S. tax reform, you mentioned it\u2019s a neutral to slight negative, you also mentioned your global forecast for 2018 down 1% on issuance. Could you may be flush out the puts and takes in terms of it being neutral to slight negative. And then can investors expect that carry on effect in terms of you U.S. tax reform as you look towards 2019 issuance and beyond?","Douglas Peterson","First of all, when we look at tax reform we look at all the different aspects that could be impacting corporate, financial institutions, as well as public finance. First of all we look at some of the positives to the tax reform or economic growth. There is also going to be an additional amount of potential accelerated depreciation which would be leading to additional investment. So we see a lot of positives in the general economic conditions which as you know in the long run are what actually drive issuance.","In terms of some headwinds to issuance, our repatriation of offshore cash could actually a slowdown issuance of companies that have been issuing what we call in the past a deemed repatriations or a synthetic repatriation. Our interest rate deductibility might have some impact on the high-yield market. And then the public finance market had a very robust fourth quarter in anticipation of different conditions in the market as well. So that as you saw we expect it would be down around 30%.","But overall we look at then - in addition to what\u2019s the impact from tax reform, we look at general growth as I already said and we also look at maturities and you saw on the slides that we showed that there is a very robust pipeline of maturities especially starting in 2019 and going forward in all different types of issuance and in particular in high-yield issuance. So we've taken all of this into account as we've built our forecast for 2018.","As you know always the mix is could change at any one time, I just want to give you one factor which is an interesting a mix shift. We do think that there is going to be strong financial services issuance in 2018. Last year in the United States financial service issuance for the entire year was up around 9% but it\u2019s actually down in the fourth quarter by over 13%, and in Europe it was up 65% for financial institutions issuance in the fourth quarter.","So as you know there's always a lot of different pieces to the mix of how this comes through, but we go back to tax reform being a very positive impact for the economy overall. And even though it might have some headwinds on issuance from point of view of repatriation and a couple of other factors we do see that the economy is in a strong position.","Hamzah Mazari","Just a follow-up question, maybe for Ewout and then I'll turn it over. Your adjusted gross leverage to adjusted EBITDA is at 1.9 times - you've given us a range of 2.25 on the high-end. You've also said 75% of free cash flow goes back to shareowners, we're also upping the dividend considerably on tax reform. Is it fair to say that you guys are out of the market for larger M&A assets and most of the deal flow you're looking at is tuck-ins or can we expect sort of you can issue equity to do a large deal assuming valuations right? Thank you.","Ewout Steenbergen","You're right. We have given guidance with respect to our adjusted growth leverage in a range of 1.75 on the low-end and 2.25 on the high-end. We are very comfortably within that range at this point in time and as we have told you this morning we have 2.8 billion of cash by year-end of 2017 which is now largely unconstrained after the tax reform.","So the balance sheet of the company is very strong. We're in a very good healthy financial position. We\u2019re obviously not commenting on any M&A opportunities, but what you should read out of the announcement this morning is we\u2019re clearly have the intention to reinvest in the business according to our strategic priorities, strengthen our core capabilities with the cash balance we have on our balance sheet today. And that could be organic, it could be inorganic. We would love as a first priority to reinvest that cash balance in our business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is now open.","Alex Kramm","Wanted to just come back to the Ratings forecast you put out there. I looked at the January piece you guys put out with a 1% decline, but obviously that's an overall number. So when you dig in a little bit deeper and look at the commentary, I think pretty big decline I think like 10% or so for high-yields when you back into it et cetera.","So I guess when I put all this together look at the mix of the business, and maybe assume like 3% to 4% pricing bumps that you usually take. Now I guess it's something like 2% Ratings forecast revenue growth, is that kind of like in the range of what you're thinking for the Ratings business for 2018?","Douglas Peterson","Well if you look at our total guidance overall we put together for the entire company a guidance of the mid-single-digit range, as well as an improvement of a 100 basis points in our margin, that\u2019s our guidance for 2018. Included in that as you said give-and-takes on what\u2019s going to happen in the markets.","Our overall outlook is about 2% decrease in overall corporate, industrial out of 5% increase in financial services, structured finance we\u2019re expecting an increase of about 4% for the year. And then U.S. public finance is one of the areas we think is going to be the most impacted by tax reform it will be down by about 31%.","I\u2019ve always said in the past its going to depend also on what's the mix of high-yield and what sort of structured finance comes out. Just very quickly you know January doesn't make a quarter, issuance overall in January was down year-on-year but on the other hand noninvestment grade spec rate issuance was up very strong. It was up 27% in the U.S. But you know one month does it make a quarter, we do think that a lot of where we\u2019re going to come out is going to depend also on leverage buyouts on what's going to happen with the M&A market.","And but we do think with the overall robust growth around the globe that this actually bodes well generally speaking for issuance. But we do see some of these as you saw in our forecast we did see lower issuance in particular from the corporates, but we built that into our forecast but I don't have a specific number related to the topline growth in Ratings.","Alex Kramm","Fair enough, I thought I'd try. And maybe just shifting on the margin side, obviously continued margin expansion pretty impressive even given them again as I said like softer outlook in Ratings if I just paraphrase I guess. But looking at the Market Intelligence now that you pulled out Platts I think last year it was something like 33% operating margin for that segment. Now I think that compares pretty favorably relative to like some other desktop players, but when you look at some of the pure play data providers out there, I mean some of those guys even have like 50% operating margins plus.","So just thinking about - can you give us an update on your - what you\u2019re thinking the margin that business could get to, what kind of self-help opportunities we'll have in that segment. As you know I think a lot of that segment is actually proprietary data that - I think you have good pricing power on et cetera?","Ewout Steenbergen","You're right. Now we have provided you the details of the split of the margins between Platts and Market Intelligence. You see 33% margins for Market Intelligence both in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2017. And that is up approximately 260 basis points compared to 2016.","We have indicated to you that we expect margin improvements for S&P Global as a whole in 2018. We haven't given you a breakdown for each of the segments. And what we should do is we realize with respect to the margins for some of our segments we're more or less at the point of our aspirational margin targets that we have provided for the mid-term.","So we will come back during the course of this year with new mid-term aspirational targets for each of our segments. Most likely we will do at the Investor Day late May. So I cannot give you any specific guidance with respect to the Market Intelligence margin going forward from here.","But what you may expect is we will drive operational performance for each of our businesses. We expect positive topline growth for each of our businesses. We look at operating leverages. We look at the efficiency opportunities and so on and so forth. So ultimately as Doug said in his prepared remarks, we are clearly believing that we can make S&P Global perform better also in the future.","Operator","This question comes from Mrs. Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Toni Kaplan","I wanted to ask about the margins as well. So in Ratings very strong quarter also mainly driven I think by just the topline as well. But are there other factors that drove the strong Ratings margins this quarter, was it the flow through from growth or some other continued initiatives with regard to like pricing and simplification that you've been implementing over the last couple of quarters?","Ewout Steenbergen","We were especially pleased if you look at the performance of Ratings this quarter that despite a very strong topline growth, expenses were more or less flat and even slightly down if you take into consideration the FX impact. So the combination of such a strong topline growth and expenses flat and very disciplined drove the margin up by 810 basis points.","What you have seen is announcements of restructuring actions both in the third quarter and fourth quarter. Those actions are applicable to several of our segments, but certainly also on the ratings. So we are looking continuously in transforming our organization to become more effective. So certainly we\u2019ll continue to look at the margins of Ratings and look at all the opportunities to improve those margins in the future as well.","Toni Kaplan","And then just on market and commodities, intelligence I think the margins there sequentially declined a little bit this quarter. Was there anything in particular that drove that and how should we look at margins in 2018 in that business? Thanks.","Ewout Steenbergen","Yes, I think that\u2019s mostly driven by the Platts margins. So if you look at the details in Exhibit 10, you\u2019ll see that the Platts margins were bit lower at the second half of 2017 compared to the beginning of 2017. The main reason behind that is timing of certain expense categories. We saw commissions, incentives, compensation, as well as certain marketing expenses more back end loaded during 2017.","We expect it to be more equally divided during 2018. So I would expect that - I would explain that more that it is more timing of those expense categories and Platts that drove slightly lower margin in markets and commodities intelligence at the end of 2017.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Manav Patnaik","My question is around in the Market Intelligence, so you showed 15% increase in the user growth and so the first part of that question is just more around what's driving that particularly in the context of all the other challenges the industry is facing like MiFID and so forth that's gone in. And also just a disconnect on that 15% growth with the 9% revenue growth number you said for desktop.","Douglas Peterson","Well as you know we've been moving towards an approach where we provide enterprise-wide licensing to our customers in Market Intelligence. And what we've always talked about how this leads to more users signing up when you see an organization that has now given basically free access across the entire organization for all people to sign up and use the product. We see that the user increases and it's a good forward-looking measure for us in our ability to then talk to our customers in the future about the value of the contracts and the value that we're providing.","As you know we have a very important discussion with customers at a value creation and value approach to how we think about the long-term relationship. And this is for us one of the benefits of the enterprise-wide pricing and this is one of the ways we can see it actually coming into effect.","Manav Patnaik","And I guess just the question on, if you're seeing any impacts like with MiFID and so forth?","Douglas Peterson","Yes, on MiFID we haven't seen any immediate impact on MiFID. Related to MiFID generally as you know we're not a sell-side research firm. We've always been a data and analytics provider the way we approach to our products and services that there are already paid for in hard dollars.","One interesting thing of note, during December we saw over 90,000 of our users go in and look at their entitlements or change their entitlement, and we believe that was driven by a MiFID where people had to ensure that they had the right sort of entitlement in the system.","We also though know that we have the ability to deliver research and be able to monitor and track usage and monitor and track how many people are downloading and as well as find ways that we can help it, sell-side get paid for the research.","I guess the risk that we've got is that on the buy side, if a buy side start getting squeezed on their budgets overall because they're looking at how they're going to pay for research, it could be that there could we have a negative impact from total research budgets under strain but we have not seen any of that so far.","Manav Patnaik","And then just your thoughts on the acquisition of Thomson Reuters just you know may be competitively you see that changing your approach here.","Douglas Peterson","We don't see any major change to our approach. We do think that Thomson Reuters is a very formal competitor. We think that the competitive landscape is getting tougher all the time not just with people like Thomson Reuters taking approach of how they're going to be going towards market but there's also a very large number of additional of fintech's and other types of company coming into the markets. You also have a company's like ours and others looking at ways to apply artificial intelligence, natural language processing and different ways of serving the market.","So we think that the Thomson Reuters transaction is going to make the markets more competitive but we welcome that competition and we're investing also to transform our business so that we can be more competitive as well.","Operator","This question comes from the line of Craig Huber from Huber Research. You may ask your question.","Craig Huber","Two questions please. One can you just give us a little bit better your outlook for speculative grade bank loans this upcoming year here obviously was very strong last year, so just given the thus seems rise in interest rate environment. What you guys outlook year for bank loans I guess in the U.S. and Europe if you could?","Douglas Peterson","Our general expectation is that bank loans are going to be flat to potentially down a little bit. Last year it was such a robust year and the first quarter, fourth quarter were both very strong throughout the year we saw the issuance. But it's going to depend a lot on what happens with high-yield financing, high-yield refinancing. It's going to also be driven by interest rates.","We do see a market in Europe which has been incredibly robust. Over the last few years we've see more and more of financing taking place through the bank markets, as well as ratings - the loans being themselves rated. But our general expectation is that the bank loan market is going to be weaker than it was last year.","Craig Huber","And then also, if we switch over to China for net income interest update us if you would on changes at the government level in China to allow foreign rated agencies like yourselves and your competitors to rate underneath your own brand name in that jurisdiction there? And how impactful would that potentially be. Can you maybe size it for us potentially? Thank you.","Ewout Steenbergen","We are very interested and very excited about the opportunity that has come up in China. Let me elaborate on that a little bit. So today the domestic Chinese bond market is about the third largest bond market in the world. We are not active in that market today but we do rate international bond issuance by Chinese companies. So as Chinese companies want to accept the international bond markets those are being rated mostly out of our office in Hong Kong.","The Chinese domestic bond markets in the past had some foreign ownership restrictions. So up to the mid of last year, we could not own an entity domestic ratings agency by more than 49% and that was the reason why S&P Global Ratings had never decided to enter that market but those foreign ownership restrictions have been lifted since the mid of last year, so we are actively looking at opportunities to enter that market at some point in time.","There is still a lot of regulation that has to be issued so there's still a lot of uncertainty how this ultimately will play out but we are very actively following this and actively looking at the best way to enter the Chinese domestic bond market at some point in time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Hung from Autonomous. You may ask your question.","Vincent Hung","So just on adjusted unallocated expense, the 160 million to 170 million guidance looks to be up on the 1.1 figure from last year. Are you also including that 25 million to 30 million pension benefits while the actual increase is higher? Can you just talk about what's driving that?","Ewout Steenbergen","So that's a great question Vincent so let me explain that a bit because if you take all the pieces into consideration I fact you unallocated are - expenses are coming down year-over-year. So look at 160 to 170, then what is included in that number is a 20 million contribution to the S&P Global Foundation, so you have it out.","And then in the past the pension benefit, the pension income loss methods in the corporate unallocated expenses and now is broken out due to a new accounting rule. So what we have indicated is $25 million to $30 million of benefit that now is broken out but in the past was negative on that line. So if you look at those two elements and take those into consideration, in fact year-over-year corporates unallocated expenses are down.","Vincent Hung","And on the non-transaction revenues and ratings, there\u2019s been an acceleration in value growth there in the last few quarters. So can you just give us some color here in terms of how much relates to the pricing changes, the frequent insurer programs and whether win rate continue to 2018?","Douglas Peterson","On the non-transaction revenues, if you look at what the components are there, they are combination of frequent issuer fees, it's rating evaluation services that include some of the revenue from CRISIL and also includes short-term issuance under one year for instance our commercial paper. And it's really combination of all of those factors that is driving that growth.","As you know there's been a lot of mergers and acquisitions activity that's been increasing in the Ratings valuation services. With the very, very attractive financial markets in the last year there been a lot of shorter-term issuance in the commercial paper market, that's been part of it.","And then net, net we've also increased the number of new issuers and number of new issuers come to the market also has helped to increase that. So there's not any one specific factor, it\u2019s a combination of all of those together.","Operator","This question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Raymond James. You may ask your question.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","Just one from me, in early - I guess maybe mid-January as must put out, a report kind of complained a bit about lack of fee schedule clarity from you and your competition on the Ratings business. Any thoughts on implications of EMSA's views and any potential adjustment you might have to going forward.","Douglas Peterson","We have looked at that report that's where we've been working very closely with ESMA as well as with the Parliament in Brussels to understand the implementation of the rules for CRA 3 which were put in place about five or six years ago. One of the provision had a basically instructed ESMA to review the pricing markets and look at the cost structure of the rating agencies to see how that would be related to price - fees and prices.","We think this is very, very early stages of what ESMA is going to be working on. We're working closely with them to tell them what we disagree with in their analysis. We do think that the overall structure fees relates to many, many different factors, it's not just cost alone. And so we are working closely with ESMA to give them our viewpoints and as of right now we don't see any impact to the markets and this is probably going to be a very long gain in how we work with ESMA and Brussels on the Ratings market in Europe.","Operator","This next question comes from the line of Joe Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your question.","Unidentified Analyst","This is [Drew Cumin] on for Joe. I was wondering if you could discuss some of the progression from the index business outside of equities?","Douglas Peterson","What is the exact question, what do you mean by progression?","Unidentified Analyst","What's going on with fixed income or ESG, any of the other opportunities?","Douglas Peterson","First of all as you know we have a combination of different approaches to revenues and in the index business we have our AUM fees, we have our data fees and then we have other services, ETM and ETD fees. So we're looking at how we can continue to diversify our revenue streams plus also how we can diversify and grow our - the economic impact of new opportunities like ESG.","What you see is that we've made a lot of progress in fixed indices with new issuers going out of ETFs using fixed indices. We're seeing a lot of take-up of ESG, different types of ESG indices which use either some sort of a carbon, low carbon in particular environmental approach. None of those have any major impact so far or material impact on our revenues.","The way we see the evolution of these types of products as we have to invest upfront, we have to build the relationships of the channel partners. We have to be responsive to what are the demands coming from asset owners and asset managers and come up with new indices that are responsive to those needs and as we build them and as we set the new products out, they start getting take-up and then that's when you start seeing the revenues.","So in terms of our total revenues in the index business, none of these are creating any major material lift so far but in terms of volumes and growth, we believe overtime all of these are going to have more and more impact and it\u2019s going to be important to us that we also do have this innovation in this market relevance for what are the demands coming from the asset owners.","Ewout Steenbergen","And we broke out I believe it was in our second quarter earnings call, the year-over-year gains in fixed income and ESG and from a percentage standpoint they were significantly that Doug's point from a total standpoint that it will remove the needle in our business. And we\u2019ll likely put those out again probably in the second quarter next year based on annual survey that goes out.","Operator","This question comes from Jeffrey Silber from BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Henry Chien","Its Henry Chien calling in for Jeff, thanks. I just wanted to go back to the guidance for organic growth for 2018. Just thinking for 2017 there is a number of - I'd say special items that sort of drove pretty high growth rates in both ratings and the Market Intelligence. So just trying to understand how should we think about the mid-single-digit growth rate, is that driven by sort of the new market and new initiatives that you outlined early in the presentation. And just in light of issuance, it looks like just going to be down a bit this year as well? Thanks.","Douglas Peterson","Let me just clarify the question, when you say special items for revenue growth in Ratings and MI this year what are you alluding to there?","Henry Chien","Yes, I know not special item is wrong, I just meant there seem to be a number of strong growth headwinds in the year whether it\u2019s you know the pickup in issuance which was a record year and in the Market Intelligence side shifting over to the enterprise thing. Just thinking of those which don't sound like they would recur this year. So I'm just trying to understand what would be driving growth this year?","Ewout Steenbergen","You're right, we see a lot of positive momentum and positive drivers around our business. I can point at bank loans, I can point at corporate issuance in Ratings, below investment-grades, structured finance, I can point at the user growth in Market Intelligence. I can point at commodity pricing going up for our Platts business. I can point at move from active to passive investments in the indices business.","So all of those drivers are very favorable and I have really helped the company to be positioned well for the future. And therefore you saw a 13% organic revenue growth for the company as a whole during 2017.","We have guided to mid-single digit growth in revenue for 2018, that's mostly because we are now starting from much higher base then we were a year ago so we have to take that into account. But if you look at some of those drivers, we are confident that those will continue and will be continued positive drivers for the company going forward because we think those are not all market related, those are largely also related to methods where management can have some influence going forward.","So therefore we think mid-single digit growth is a reasonable expectation for revenue growth during 2018.","Douglas Peterson","I just want to add one thing which is maybe a little bit philosophical it was embedded in the comments I made at the end about our 2018 enterprise goals. And you\u2019ve heard me talk about this for the last few years that we're driving towards having much higher quality customer experience, much commercial organizations that are out there customer focused, building products providing services that's relevant and responsive to our customer\u2019s needs. And we think this is critical in a very competitive world.","We have to be out there that in a way that we\u2019re serving our customer needs and anticipating their needs in the future and we believe that this is actually one of the most important and necessary component to our topline growth is to have that approach to customers and not be complacent in very, very competitive markets.","Operator","This question comes from Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question.","Peter Appert","Buybacks versus dividends, the big dividend increase I assume doesn't suggest any shift and how do you think about the allocation between the two. And can you also related to that talk about how we should think about the timing of buybacks in 2018?","Ewout Steenbergen","If you look at the growth in dividends as such if you look at the underlying growth in net income and free cash flow, this is very much supported by those factors. Just look at the free cash flow in 2017, 1.85 billion going to 2.3 billion in 2018. If you look at that 2.3 billion and you take into consideration our commitment to return 75% of the 2.3 billion to our shareholders, then a 22% dividend increase is really in line with those underlying growth percentages.","So I don't think you should read anything out of this that it is a shift in the mix. What you should read out of it is that the underlying fundamentals in terms of net income and free cash flow are really very strong and we expect also that to continue during 2018.","Peter Appert","And how about on timing?","Ewout Steenbergen","Yes, timing obviously we are not commenting specifically on that management has a philosophy as you know that we\u2019re not market timers, we believe in dollar cost average that might be sometimes tactical decisions why we scale up or down is certain periods. But otherwise we like to be as much in the market as possible during the year.","So I cannot give for obvious reasons further specifics on that, but we would like to be as much in the market as possible because these are significant numbers in terms of return of capital to shareholders. And like I said management doesn't believe that we should be market timers ourselves.","Peter Appert","And Doug your prepared comments might have suggested that you're seeing a little bit of pushback from Capital IQ users on the model change. Am I hearing that correctly and maybe you could just expand on that?","Douglas Peterson","No, I'm sorry if I gave you that impression, not at all. It\u2019s just that we have a very large number of clients we\u2019re going to have to go out to look at the approach to what their current contracts are. In some cases it's a combination of shifting from a per seat contract to an enterprise wide contract but also in some cases we have multiple contracts, it's an opportunity to go out and simplify our approach to a customer. In some cases we have five, six different contracts across different divisions of an organization that gives us a way to unify those contracts and to want to move them shift them to an enterprise-wide contract.","My point is that the difficult to my point - this still has another year maybe even till the end of 2019 before we complete the final approach to all of the Cap IQ accounts on the conversion, but it's going very well. I'm sorry I gave you a different impression.","Chip Merritt","And if we use the word punch-list, you know what we\u2019re trying to deal with there is just anytime you have any sort of release there\u2019s going to be bugs, there\u2019s going to be things that need to be resolved and in fact the MI just had a new release over the weekend to deal with usability feedback and application performance and things like that.","So just one trivial fact for you, if you\u2019re out there on an old Internet browser your speed seems to slow mostly we don\u2019t use that browser, but now we\u2019re fixing that. So that's a kind of thing that we work on.","Operator","This question comes from Conor Fitzgerald from Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Conor Fitzgerald","Just looking for a little more color when you mentioned on reinvesting back in the business some of the benefits of tax reform or is your marginal reinvestment dollars going?","Ewout Steenbergen","So we are looking at all of the opportunities to grow our businesses to reinvest and to strengthen our core capabilities. When we announce our capital philosophy and targets in the mid of last year, we have indicated some areas that are for us strategically important. Think about growing ratings in some of the emerging markets and looking at domestic ratings businesses. Think about indices for fixed income ESG international, Smart Beta. Think about in Market Intelligence our risk analytics and surfaces business, but those areas that are strategically important and then for Platts some of additional commodity price reporting without certain benchmarks or supply demand analytics.","So those are the areas for the businesses itself. We\u2019re also looking at some core capabilities of the company, investing in technology, specific talents, and other areas that are important in terms of core capabilities for the company. We're looking at this investing on organic basis, inorganic basis, but please be assured we apply a very disciplined capital management philosophy metrics and look at the valuation perspective.","So the company is very critical with respect to those opportunities that they hit certain hurdle rates that we think are important going forward.","Conor Fitzgerald","And then just looking for your thoughts, there has been a lot of more conversations recently about the potential for an infrastructure bill. Obviously there's a lot of ways such a bill could be structured if it did pass, but as we start to hear more about that over the coming months what are the key things you\u2019re focused on that could potentially drive a positive impact for your business if we do see and if it\u2019s a structure bill make its way to the Congress?","Douglas Peterson","Well as you know we've been looking at infrastructure now for over five years. We bolstered our infrastructure practices across the businesses in particular in Ratings. We brought in a team of people that are able to be very responsive infrastructure and that's not just in United States it\u2019s a global team.","We've included additional data in analytics and Market Intelligence. We also have some infrastructure indices that we have through the index business. And then obviously Platts benefits from infrastructure investments in energy, and oil and gas, but the bill coming through Washington is going to have a few key elements that we\u2019ll watch carefully.","One of them is permitting. Permitting is one of the areas which is quite slow in the United States compared to countries like Australia and Canada that have very robust approaches to infrastructure investment that also bring a lot of private capital. Permitting can be done a lot faster literally in a couple years instead of some cases United States 9 or 10 years. So we think that permitting is one of the critical factors that will get investment moving a lot faster into infrastructure.","Second will be the approach towards support or leveraging capital coming from Washington into the states and local communities where most of the real infrastructure takes place. It's at that level, it\u2019s at the state and municipal level where most of that takes place and one of the factors on that is going to be an openness to seeing more public, private partnership as I said also very important in Canada and Australia.","So the more we see private capital coming into infrastructure, the more we see it coming in a lot faster, when we see other fixes to the federal programs that are used for transportation and ports and airports, those will also stimulate more investment.","So our overall view is the faster that this starts getting into the market, the more comprehensive the approach is and particularly if - you see us reach out to the states and municipalities, we\u2019ll see a robust infrastructure investment which will benefit growth, it will benefit jobs and part of that will be then more investment activity which we will be supporting through all of our different divisions.","Operator","This question comes from Tim McHugh from William Blair. You may ask your question.","Tim McHugh","Just want to follow-up the comment around some additional restructuring in the Ratings business. I guess can you elaborate on what type of activities are you doing at this point, is this still kind of trying to automate some of the roles, any color there would be helpful. And then secondly, I apologize if I miss this, but given exchange rate movements have you assumed a lift much to revenue as you think about the 2018 guidance here?","Ewout Steenbergen","Tim, let me first take the restructuring question about the ratings and then I will make a few comments on your FX question. Ratings restructuring we\u2019re looking at many areas where we would find opportunities to make the organization more effective. I can give you two examples, one example is in our commercial organization. Until recently we had two commercial organizations in Ratings. We have moved those together we created one commercial organization and based on that restructuring, we\u2019re able to reduce the run rate particularly in more senior management positions going forward.","Another example is the ongoing project simplified which is putting technology tools in place, workflow support and more standardization in the work of the ratings analysts and that will help with also efficiency, think about population of mobiles data intake, and so on that will be more automated so that our analysts can focus more to higher value-added work going forward. So those are clear areas where we see opportunities in Ratings going forward.","With respect to foreign exchange rates, let me give you a couple of perspectives. The company's exposure is what we call a negative exposure on Indian rupees, British pound and the Australian dollars and negative exposure means we have higher expenses in those currencies and revenues. And we have positive exposure on Euro which means we have higher revenues in Euro then our expense base in Euro denomination.","We have an FX program to offset to a large extent those exposures in order to make sure that the company's impact on economic basis is mitigated to some extent. So overall if you look at our guidance we have provided to you that is based on the most recent spot market rates with respect to ForEx and where our currencies are today we are confident that is properly reflected in the guidance we're providing you this morning.","Tim McHugh","And just one other follow-up in terms of numbers, the pension benefit that you're counting on for 2018 how is that compared to - I guess last year and the last couple of years. Is that kind of a normal level I guess now that is being broken out?","Ewout Steenbergen","Yes, it\u2019s more or less on a similar level if you compare it to previous years and the background there is that we have a well funded pension plan. So particularly the asset assumption on our plan is helpful to create this pension income but more or less similar compared to what we have been reporting in previous years.","Operator","This question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel Nicolaus. You may ask your question.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","First question is how is the tax deductibility of interest expense is treated by the recent legislation, how is that impact the forecast you have for leverage finance and some of the deals that will come from PE funds?","Douglas Peterson","We've been looking at this - we\u2019re trying to model it out. We see a very minor impact from this for a few reasons, one is that a lot of the companies that could be potentially impacted by the leverage rules are not paying taxes anyway and even though there's always been a theoretical tax shield to leverage type organizations just given their overall operating procedures and operating profits, they\u2019re not necessarily really paying taxes.","We also think that there is a level of profitability which is about a six times leverage that's more or less where we've modeled it out that will still allow you to have deductibility of your interest expense. So we're not quite sure exactly what the impact is going to be but our initial modeling doesn't show that it\u2019s going to have that big of an impact because - leverage is a very, very legitimate way to use for corporate financing for different types of organization.","And we've seen a little bit of fishing around for some other opportunities from the investment bankers looking at whether its securitizations or other types of tools that aren't necessarily directly financial tools or leverage. So, we don't think that we\u2019re going to see much of an impact.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","And then just in terms of the enterprise migrations with SNL Capital IQ. Is the increase in seat count largely from displacement of competitors or you just seeing people just put a lot of the organization on there that might not necessarily have had access to this kind of information beforehand? I'm trying to see basically competitively is this enabling you guys to displace competitors?","Chip Merritt","I don\u2019t think you\u2019re seeing any meaningful displacement at this time. You might have someone who has access to competitive product and they have been using that competitive product. And now their firm gives them the opportunity to use our product so they might use them in conjunction in tandem for a while. So I don't think anything happens right away but over time I think that certainly robust.","Douglas Peterson","What I'd add is that a lot of the penetration that we have is new users. So as you mentioned when you get a new - a firm which has maybe 10 or 15 or 20 seats whatever it is and we open it up for a firm-wide enterprise-wide contract you see new users coming in. And then we've also been able to get some new customer. So customer growth itself is also important to us and that's another thing that we measure carefully.","Operator","We will now take our final question from Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.","Bill Warmington","So quick question for you on the Capital IQ business. You had mentioned that sell-side is not a big part of what you do. But my question is given the fact that the sell-side is under a lot of cost pressure and likely facing more with MiFID II. What kind of an opportunity does that create for Capital IQ specifically since it\u2019s lower cost option versus Bloomberg and FactSet?","Douglas Peterson","First of all let me just point out, I don't have the figures in front of me Chip might have them at his fingertips. We believe one of the advantages of our business models that we are very diversified across different types of industries, investment banks, sell-side, buy side, we've got insurance companies, banks, other types of financial institutions, regulators, academic et cetera.","So we believe that it's a model that allows us to have diversification across different kinds of users between the SNL content and the Cap IQ content which is coming together and other types of data services that we\u2019re adding specially alternative data services et cetera that we can provide multiple types of users with good experience, as well as the data they need.","So we're not as dependent on any one type of industry, but in terms of overall your point of your question is, will we see an opportunity to displace other more expensive products? We believe that that is one of the areas where we can be more competitive.","Bill Warmington","Then a follow-up question on the index business, how big is Smart Beta and ESG within the index business these days. And then how long does it take to get to a point where it starts to move the needle?","Ewout Steenbergen","I think in absolute numbers it\u2019s still relatively modest certainly if you look at it from a revenue perspective. But this is the nature of benchmarking business, you have to invest early, you have to put a lot of effort in trying to become the standard in the market and once you are the standard you're being picked up then it can take off and your revenue streams in the future can be very large.","So those kinds of investments can be over multiple years. Think about the fixed. That was an investment that was done over very long period of time to get over CBOE and at some point it took off and it is a very successful product at this point in time.","So relative modest today, but that is exactly why we're making those investments. We\u2019re taking the benefit of the margin of the larger benchmark indices, and vest back into the new industries and over time that will be revenue driver for the company.","Chip Merritt","Bill if I recall if you go back to our second quarter slides we gave the exact number.","Bill Warmington","Got it.","Chip Merritt","I don't know the number exactly.","Douglas Peterson","And in addition it\u2019s also part of the custom indices business. This is one of the areas where it's not necessarily just ETS, we also see a lot of interest from structuring debts and investment banks which are using these types of products for their family offices and other sovereign wealth funds, other types of direct investors where we provide the structuring of the index itself that's responsive to their needs.","Chip Merritt","Bill found a number for you. At the end of 2016, Smart Beta accounted for 184 billion in assets side to it.","Bill Warmington","And then, okay, so end of 2017 - that's the reference point we don\u2019t have the 2017 number?","Chip Merritt","That was the end of 2016. So I don't have a new end of 2017 number for you yet.","Bill Warmington","I look forward to seeing. Thank you very much for the insight.","Douglas Peterson","Thank you, this is Doug. Let me just make a couple of closing comments. I do want to comment very briefly on the market drop yesterday, 1,175 points in Dow Jones. It was the largest drop in history in index point terms, but it actually doesn't even make the list of the top 10 drops in percentage terms. Given that we've been managing this since over 125 years, we've got all the data and it's actually the 100 largest single drop in percentage terms. So its way down there, it\u2019s only number 100 in overall percentage terms and we think we should put that in context.","We've built our plan, our approach to the markets looking at the economies right now which are growing. Our inflation is still low, rates are still low, banks have very strong liquidity and very strong capital around the world, tax reform we think is a tailwind for the U.S. economy. And so we do believe that overall economic conditions putting aside some volatility in the markets and all of the transformation taking place and technology around us are going to be very positive aspects to how we\u2019re going to grow the business going forward.","We\u2019re very pleased that we concluded 2017 with strong momentum and very strong performance. Our topline growth for the entire year of organic growth of 13%, the margin improvement that we've been carrying through for the last five years. We are starting off the year also benefiting from U.S. tax reform with a strong position in cash and capital with a very good leadership team and what we think are very promising approaches to how we're going to work with the markets in the future.","So, we appreciate all of you listening on the call. We look forward to working with you during the year. We will be on our first quarter call in between now and the time we see you at our Investor Day. Thank you very much.","Operator","That concludes this morning\u2019s call. A PDF version of the presented slides is available for downloading from investor.spglobal.com.

Thank for joining us for S&P Global\u2019s earnings call. Presenting on this morning\u2019s call are Doug Peterson, President and CEO; and Ewout Steenbergen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This morning, we issued a news release with our fourth quarter 2018 results.

However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Soogyung Jordan at 212-438-2297.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?","Doug Peterson","Thank you, Chip. Good morning and welcome to today\u2019s earnings call. As the S&P Global team focused on powering the markets for the future, volatility and uncertainty returned to the market since 2018. The causes were numerous, rising interest rates, trade negotiations, Brexit and the unwinding of global monetary stimulus.","And during the fourth quarter, this volatility, uncertainty impacted debt issuance and therefore our ratings business. Fortunately, our remaining three businesses performed well and the company delivered strong financial results. I\u2019m going to review our full year highlights and Ewout will review the fourth quarter results in a moment.","In 2018, we delivered 3% revenue growth and 23% adjusted diluted EPS growth. We generated significant margin improvement in every business. We reported $2 billion in free cash flow, excluding certain items and 8% increase year-over-year.","We returned $2.2 billion through share repurchases and dividends, as you know our target is to return at least 75% of free cash flow, excluding certain items to shareholders. But we returned more than 100% in 2018.","We initiated a new \u2013 we\u2019re initiating a new $500 million ASR in the next few days and we made great strides towards our Investor Day targets. But in the meantime, we always need to build for the future, both through organic projects and by adding new capabilities from outside the company. To that end, we added leading edge technology and unique data sets with the acquisitions of Kensho, Panjiva, and RateWatch.","Revenue for 2018 increased 3% despite a 4% decline in our rating segment. Adjusted operating profit increased 8% and our adjusted operating profit margin increased 230 basis points to 48.8%. This marks great progress on our Investor Day adjusted operating profit margin target over the next three to four years of low 50s.","In addition, we continued to reduce our shares outstanding. The 2% reduction achieved in 2019 helped us to reduce shares by 10% over the past five years. Finally, our adjusted diluted EPS increased by 23%. While revenue growth, margin improvement and share count reduction play a role, approximately one half of the increase in 2019 was a benefit U.S. Tax Reform had on effective tax rate.","Revenue growth and productivity efforts propelled the adjusted operating profit margin in 2018. Revenue declined in ratings due to reduced issuance. Despite this decline, ratings delivered greater margin improvement than any other segment. I\u2019m pleased with the efforts of our employees to continue to drive revenue growth and productivity gains across S&P Global.","This performance extended our succession of solid revenue growth and adjusted operating margin growth. We\u2019ve delivered a four-year CAGR for revenue of 6% and improved our adjusted operating profit margin by more than 1200 basis points in the past four years.","The results of these collective efforts has been a 21% compounded annual growth rate of adjusted diluted EPS over the past four years. As we\u2019ve delivered these results, we\u2019ve continued to invest for future growth and productivity.","In 2018, we continue to invest in technology and data. We acquired world class artificial intelligence and machine learning technology with Kensho, unique technology and supply chain data with Panjiva, differentiated banking data with RateWatch and in the fourth quarter certain index intellectual property rights.","In addition to these acquisitions, we invested in companies pioneering new technologies. These included regtech solutions of FiscalNote, and energy production information was extensive. We also licensed private company data from Crunchbase and through our other agreements license new data sets for companies in China and the U.K.","Finally, we accelerated our ESG investments organically, and through the full acquisition of the climate data pioneer true cost. This has allowed us to expand true costs unique data across S&P Global and combine our data resources with our world class data operations in market intelligence.","In aggregate, during 2019 we invested more than $800 million in acquisitions. We made another $60 million in internal investments that were expensed for work associated with Kensho, Panjiva, RateWatch, ESG in China.","One of the highlights of 2019 so far has been our recent approval to enter the China domestic bond market. We\u2019re honored to receive the first approval for a wholly-owned subsidiary of an international CRA to rate domestic Chinese bonds.","We\u2019re now authorized to rate issuers and issuances from financial institutions, corporates, structured finance bonds and panda bonds or Renminbi denominated bonds from foreign issuers.","Our new entity S&P ratings China Ltd will be headquartered in Beijing, and has 36 employees, 31 of which are ratings analysts. We\u2019re able to assemble an exceptional team made up of our existing ratings employees as well as experts from the Chinese debt capital markets and local ratings agencies. It\u2019s important to understand that S&P ratings China Ltd and S&P Global ratings are two independent entities, each with their own methodologies and analytical autonomy. The methodologies in the new business have been developed with reference to and leveraged from S&P Global ratings methodology.","This brings our total presence in Greater China for ratings to more than 200 employees. We plan to initiate coverage on the roughly 400 existing corporate clients that already issued cross-border bonds. Today issuance spreads within China\u2019s bond markets are virtually uncorrelated with domestic rating categories. We intend to offer a national scale rating for issuers in the Chinese market. We\u2019re well-prepared and ready to issue Chinese domestic rating.","Both our ratings business and our indices businesses can be impacted by short term market movements. I\u2019d like to put some of these movements into perspective starting with 2018 issuance.","Global issuance decreased 6% in the volatile market environment. In particular, high yield issuance declined 40%. This category has a disproportionate impact on our revenues since few if any of these companies are in frequent issuer programs.","We often talk about the correlation between spreads and issuance. This can be seen very clearly in the high yield market. Issuance levels have a strong negative correlation with spreads, so spreads widened in 2018 progressed especially in the fourth quarter issuance was impacted.","Just for comparison purposes, you can see that the correlation between spreads and issuance is not nearly as strong in investment grade, where GDP growth, business confidence and maturity pipeline are more highly correlated to issuance volumes.","While the impact from U.S. tax reform has been positive for our bottom line, it has, as we expected been a drag on issuance. In fact, the 50 U.S. companies with the largest overseas cash balances at the end of 2017 issued $170 billion of debt in 2017 and only $42 billion in 2018. This drop is responsible for a 10% percent decline overall in investment grade issuance.","In aggregate over 2018, the global cash balances of these 50 companies have declined by $91 billion or 10%. While 18 of these companies have returned to the bond market, we expect more will return as cash balances continue to normalize. We\u2019ll continue to monitor this very closely.","During the fourth quarter, global issuance decreased 19% as the weakness in corporate issuance exceeded strength in some pockets of the structured market. In the U.S. issuance declined 36% as investment grade decreased 34%, high yield cratered 79%, in fact, December was the first month since LCD began tracking issuance in 2005, that there was no high yield issuance.","Public finance decreased 44% and structured finance declined 16% with gains in our RMBS offset by declines in ABS, CLOs, and CMBS. In Europe, issuance decreased 11% as investment grade decreased 25%, high yield declined 73% and structured finance increased 59% almost entirely due to strengthened covered bonds, a category where we have very little presence.","In Asia, issuance increased 8%. Since much of this is made up of local Chinese debt that we currently don\u2019t rate, this increase is not meaningful to our results. While these declines are very significant, let me put the fourth quarter global issuance into perspective.","This slide depicts quarterly global issuance for the past six years. The fourth quarter of each year highlighted in dark blue. As you can see the fourth quarter of 2013 was in line with historical fourth quarters. It\u2019s the exceptional issuance in the fourth quarter of 2017, which created a very difficult comparison.","There is another dynamic increasingly impacting high yield issuance. This chart shows that U.S. speculative grade borrowers are increasingly turning to the bank loan market. The light and dark blue bars illustrate leveraged loans and the brown bars depict high yield bonds.","The movement from high yield bonds to leverage loans is not a concern for the company. These charts depict in both the U.S. and Europe, leveraged loan volumes have increased and the percentage of these loans that we rate is also increasing.","In fact, in 2018, we rated 92% of U.S. leveraged loans and 84% of European leverage loans. And so our bank loan ratings revenue continues to increase reaching $380 million in 2018. Remember when doing your analysis, leveraged loan activity is not included in bond issuance data.","Now let me turn to Indices. The savings to investors from the lower fees associated with index investing has been dramatic. The bars on this chart depict the growth in total index assets invested in products linked to the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and the S&P SmallCap 600.","As the end of 2017 they total $3.6 trillion. The line on this chart depicts the fees saved by investors on these products, more than $150 billion in the last 10 years. Turning to industry trends affecting our indices business, this chart depicts the continuing outflows from actively managed U.S. mutual funds into indexed based ETFs and mutual funds, a trend that has benefited us as we\u2019ve worked with the markets to provide index products and solutions.","And much of this success arose from the visionary legend in the index investment world who passed away last month, Jack Bogle, the father of indexing. Jack wanted to help individual investors save and give them as he would say a fair shake, and we\u2019re grateful for his vision.","In 1976, Jack introduced the first index mutual fund now called the Vanguard 500 Index Fund. Today this fund, based on the S&P 500 is one of the largest mutual funds in the world with more than $400 billion in AUM.","Jack didn\u2019t just build a fund, he built an industry. Specifically to ETF AUM associated with our indices, we saw a decline in 2018 to the year-end market correction. For the full year, market declines led to a $125 billion reduction in year-end ETF AUM. Despite this decline, inflows continued, adding $90 billion in ETF AUM.","I\u2019d like to shift to our 2019 outlook. Our economists expect 2019 Global GDP growth of 3.6% slightly lower than the 2018 forecast of 3.8% with lower growth in the U.S, Europe and China. Our economists believe that there is only a 15% to 20% chance of a U.S. recession in 2019.","Last month, Ratings issued its annual global refinancing study. This yearly study shows debt maturities for the upcoming five years. The chart on the left illustrates data from the 2018 and 2019 studies. The five year period and the 2019 study shows a $400 billion increase in the total debt maturing versus the 2018 study.","We used this study along with other market based data to forecast issuance. Taking a closer look at data from the study, reveals an important trend in high yield maturities. Over the next five years, the level of high yield debt maturing significantly increases each year, which is a potential source of revenue in the coming years.","The company updated its 2019 bond issuance forecast in a report issued last week. Excluding international public finance, issuance is expected to decrease less than 1%. During Investor Day, we introduced the framework powering the markets of the future, including six foundational capabilities. We use this framework to set our goals and allocate resources.","So in 2019, here are some of the top projects and initiatives we prioritized and aligned to this framework. Under Global, we believe that they\u2019re in a unique position to bring additional transparency and independent analytics to the capital markets in China. The ratings opportunity that I just discussed is one example.","In addition, market intelligence will be expanding its private company and local content within rich data, risk analytics and models in China. Platts will be extending its commercial presence in Asia in additional locations with a larger Salesforce.","Under customer orientation, we continue to build out the market intelligence platform, which will be rebranded as the S&P global platform. We\u2019ll continue to migrate both Capital IQ content and Capital IQ users to the platform.","In addition, we\u2019ll be adding Platts pricing and news content to the platform and expanding the ratings 360 content. These efforts are intended to create an increasingly rich user experience for our customers.","Under innovation, we\u2019re ramping up our ESG data factory by centralizing datasets from across the company, as well as adding new datasets. We\u2019re also creating new data feeds for our customers. Our indices business will be expanding its offering at ESG and smart beta indices.","Under technology, we\u2019re moving out of several data centers and into cloud operation. In addition, as Ewout will review in a moment, we\u2019re implementing numerous Kensho related projects. Under operational excellence, we\u2019ll continue our efforts to optimize the management of data ingestion and operation.","We\u2019ll also be leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning capabilities throughout our data operations. And while cybersecurity has already been an area of focus, it\u2019s important that we keep improving our capabilities as benchmarked against the nest framework.","Under people, we\u2019ll extend a program that was initiated in 2018 to raise the technological acumen of all of our employees through a series of online and classroom training courses. We\u2019ll also maintain our commitment to diversity and inclusion.","And finally, I want to bring your attention to a campaign that we introduced at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month. It\u2019s entitled, ChangePays. These are our data and insights; we were able to demonstrate that greater workforce inclusivity leads to healthier, stronger economies.","Our campaign illuminates the positive impact of women in the workforce, on companies, organizations, economies and global communities. Please take a look at our research and watched the ChangePays video. And while you\u2019re at it, take a look at our 2018 corporate responsibility report for all we are doing in ESG.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who will provide additional insights into our capital plans and financial performance. Ewout?","Ewout Steenbergen","Thank you, Doug and good morning to all of you on the call. Let me start with our fourth quarter financial results. Organic revenue decreased 4% as issuance driven declines in ratings exceeded growth in the other three segments. Adjusted, corporate, an allocated loss was improved by 24% due to lower incentive compensation as well as our productivity efforts to lower real estate costs and a reduction in professional fees.","Adjusted total expense declined due to lower incentive compensation and success with our ongoing productivity efforts. This led us to a 270 basis points improvement in our adjusted operating profit margin.","While U.S. tax reform has substantially lowered our adjusted effective tax rate, this quarter it was unusually low because new tax regulations related to U.S. tax reform were issued in the fourth quarter, which altered our previous assumptions.","When the stock declined in the fourth quarter, we initiated a new 500 million ASR. This program along with other share repurchases resulted in a 2% decline in our diluted weighted average shares outstanding.","And finally, we achieved a 20% increase in our adjusted diluted EPS to $2.22 during the fourth quarter. Because of the unusual level of stock option activity in the third quarter of 2017, the stock based compensation tax benefits that we received in 2018 was $0.14 lower than in 2017. As the number of employee stock options continues to decline, we expect the stock-based compensation tax benefits to decline as well. For 2019, we estimate a positive EPS impact of $0.05 to $0.10.","Changes in foreign exchange rates had a modest negative impact on revenue in the ratings business, and a positive $15 million impact on adjusted operating profit for the company or about $0.05 of adjusted diluted EPS. Our expenses were positively impacted by the weakening of the Indian rupee, British pounds and Argentine Peso.","For the full year, changes in foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of $0.19 on adjusted diluted EPS. There were a number of non-GAAP adjustments to operating profit this quarter, $16 million in restructuring charges, in ratings and market intelligence. We expect that this will result in $15 million in annual savings, $5 million non-cash accounting adjustments associated with our U.K. pension plan. $9 million in Kensho retention related expenses and we had $31 million in dual related amortization.","This is a slide that we shared at our Investor Day in May. It\u2019s a big set framework that we outlined to show the areas where we can most impact shareholder value, the first to require investments. We need to continue to invest to fuel revenue momentum, by improving our products, introducing new technology, adding new data sets and entering new geographies.","We have made great progress delivering EBITDA enhancement, and we must continue to fund new organic opportunities to drive additional productivity gains. Driving financial leverage, involves optimizing interest costs, reducing shares outstanding, and optimizing the tax rates.","And finally, we want to return capital to shareholders, while maintaining flexible debt capacity. We are committed to returning at least 75% of annual free cash flow to shareholders each year.","This quarter, we recorded strong revenue growth in S&P Dow Jones Indices, Market Intelligence and Platts. Ratings declined due to lower debt issuance. With the exception of the revenue driven shortfall in ratings, revenue growth and productivity efforts resulted in substantial adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin improvement in every other business segment.","Here you see our headcount by business at the end of the last three years. The key takeaway is that over the past two years, headcount has increased 6% and revenue and adjusted diluted EPS have increased 11% and 59% respectively. The major additions have been from acquisitions and insourcing of contractors.","At Investor Day, we cited a new $100 million three year cost reduction plan. It was based on productivity improvements often through investments in support functions, real estate, technology and digital infrastructure.","I\u2019m pleased to report that after our first year, we estimate that we have achieved run rate savings of approximately $60 million of which about $40 million was realized in our 2018 results.","Examples includes, reducing our real estate footprint by exiting space at our New York headquarters, and at our London office consolidating data centers and offshoring certain business services.","Now turning to the balance sheet, in 2018 our return of capital to shareholders exceeded 100% of 2018 free cash flow. This was accomplished by returning $1.66 billion to repurchase 8.4 million shares and paying $503 million in dividends.","In addition, we\u2019re actively working to fuel future revenue growth through acquisitions and organic investments. Collectively these actions resulted in a 800 million dollar decline in our cash balances versus the end of 2017.","Our adjusted gross leverage to adjusted EBITDA is holding steady at 1.9 times well within our targeted range. While we have begun already our 2019 share repurchase program, with open market purchases of approximately $130 million in January, will initiate a new $500 million ASR in the next few days.","Free cash flow, excluding certain items, increased 8% in 2018 to $2 billion. This level is a bit lower than our 2018 forecast, due to lower fourth quarter ratings revenue and a longer renewal process associated with enterprise wide contracts in Market Intelligence. The letter is due to a timing issue that will reverse in 2019.","Now let\u2019s turn to the segment results, starting with ratings. The decline in issuance particularly high yield issuance that Doug discussed resulted in a 16% decline in ratings revenue. Nevertheless, we reported a 16% decline in adjusted expenses, resulting in a 10 basis point increase in adjusted segment operating profit margin.","The expense reductions were primarily from productivity programs, lower incentive compensation accruals, and lower IT spends as Ratings has established an IT center in India and has insourced much of its IT spend.","For 2018, Ratings delivered a 240 basis point improvement in adjusted segment operating profit margin to 56%. This is particularly notable in light of the 4% decline in revenue for the year. The Ratings cost structure is well positioned for a recovery in Issuance.","Non-transaction revenue decreased primarily due to a $6 million impact from changes in foreign exchange. In addition, there were lower excess issuance fees associated with medium term notes and lower rating evaluation surfaces activity.","Transaction revenue decreased due to debt issuance reductions, partially offset by increased bank loan rating activity. Loan transaction revenue has been a steady source of growth. This is because the majority of the revenue is subscription like. However, there is some volatility and certain components namely; Rating Evaluation Services, ebb and flow with M&A activity and changes in foreign exchange rates can always have an impact.","This slide depicts Ratings revenue by its ends markets. The largest contributor to the decline in Ratings revenue was the 15% decline in corporates, primarily as a result of U.S. Tax Reform that Doug discussed earlier.","Issuance declines, associated with market volatility also drove the declining revenue. Financial services revenue decreased 22%, structured finance declined 14% and governments decreased 33%. While the CRISIL and other category decreased 2%, it included an increase in in intersegment royalties for Market Intelligence, offset by a decline in CRISIL\u2019s dollar-denominated revenue.","Market Intelligence delivered a strong quarter with organic revenue excluding revenue from Panjiva and RateWatch increasing 7% and active desktop user growth of 12%. With adjusted expenses down 1%, adjusted segment operating profit increased 27% and the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 570 basis points to 38.5% a new high point.","For the full year the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 200 basis points to 34.1%. While we are thrilled with the fourth quarter margin, the full year margin is more representative of our current run rate.","Beginning this quarter, we begun into integrating through cost into Market Intelligence. Market Intelligence has a lot of ESG activity underway, and we believe that business is better suited to be included here.","Desktop, the largest category grew 6%. Data Management Solutions realized 12% revenue growth, once again benefiting from expansion of the data feeds business. Registrar offices grew 6% with the Ratings express providing the greatest level of growth, as we continue to expand that data feeds portion of Risk Services.","Turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The segment delivered 13 % revenue growth, 7% adjusted expense growth and 17% adjusted segment operating profit growth. This led to an adjusted segment operating profit margin of 67.1% for the quarter, and 68% for the full year, increases of 220 basis points and 160 basis points respectively.","Strong revenue growth during the quarter was driven by a 43% increase in exchange traded derivatives from increased market volatility and a 19% increase in data and customer subscriptions. Data and custom subscriptions increased due to a catch-up in real-time reporting that we first discussed in the second quarter, as well as from organic growth.","Asset linked fees increased 4% primarily due to increased average AUM in ETFs and mutual funds linked to our indices. It is important to understand that asset-linked fees include revenue associated with ETFs, mutual funds and certain over-the-counter derivatives.","Investors frequently assume that all this revenue is related to ETFs. Despite the market downturn, at the end of 2018, inflows into passive products continued in the fourth quarter, both for the industry and for ETFs tied to our indices. For our indices, business ETF, net inflows were $22 billion in the fourth quarter and $90 billion for the full year.","The average AUM in the fourth quarter increased 9% year-over-year. I want to make a clear distinction between average AUM and quarter ending AUM. Our contracts are based on average AUM. We disclosed quarter ending figures because flows and market gains and losses are best depicted using quarter end figures as shown in the waterfall chart on the right.","While average AUM increased, quarter ending AUM declined versus the end of the fourth quarter of 2017. A year ago, there was $1.343 trillion in ETF AUM linked to our indices. At the end of 2018, there was $1.309 trillion. During 2018, we sold $90 billion of inflows, and $125 billion in stock market declines. Industry inflows into exchange traded funds were $168 billion in the fourth quarter and $499 billion in 2018. Clearly, we are encouraged by the recovery in ETF AUM in January.","Key indicators for our exchange-traded derivatives volume were extremely strong during the quarter. S&P 500 index options activity increased 36%, VIX futures & options activity increased 2%, and activity at the CME equity complex increased 71%.","For the full year S&P 500 index options activity increased 26%. VIX futures & options activity decreased 6% and activity at the CME equity complex increased 34%.","And now turning to the last business segments, Platts delivered healthy revenue and margin growth. Revenue increased 7% as a result of a 7% increase in core subscriptions, and a 11% increase in global trading services, partially offset by a decline in other revenue, which is mostly from conferences.","Adjusted expense declined 2% due to reduced incentive accruals and the reduction in outside services. The fourth quarter adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 470 basis points to 48.2%, the full year adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 200 basis points to 49.1%.","This chart depicts Global Trading Services revenue by quarter for the last three years. This volatility from quarter-to-quarter and the underlying trading volume fluctuates. However, GTS does provide a constant revenue contribution to the Platts business.","During the fourth quarter, revenue improved, due, mainly to increased trading volumes in certain gas oil, and fuel oil markets. Platts revenue increased in the quarter as all four commodity groups delivered mid-single digit growth.","During Investor Day in May 2018, we introduced medium term aspirational targets for the company. We\u2019re pleased to use this morning\u2019s investor call to reiterate these targets and to share the great progress we have made in just the first year.","We target to deliver organic revenue growth of mid-to-high single digits each year. During 2018, we achieved targets in three of our four businesses. Unfortunately, Ratings fell short due to market factors.","We target low, double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth. During 2018, we delivered 23%. We\u2019re committed to return at least 75% of our free cash flow each year.","In 2018, we returned 108% through share repurchases and dividends. And we established adjusted operating profit margin levels that we target to achieve in the next three to four years.","In the first year, we made substantial progress, with each of the businesses contributing to an overall 230 basis point improvement in the company\u2019s adjusted operating profit margin. We\u2019re energized by our progress and confidence as we begin the second year of this effort.","In 2019 we plan to invest $90 million to $110 million in new projects to fuel additional future organic growth. This is an increase over the $60 million we invested in 2018. The first category for investment is global growth. With regulatory approvals now secured, Ratings will continue to build its domestic Ratings capability in China, and Platts is working to expand its commercial operations in Asia.","Market Intelligence has a China initiative that involves setting up digital infrastructure and domestic operations as well as adding additional local capability to the S&P global platform. The second category is innovation, that plans to ramp up our ESG data factory as a central source to serve ESG offerings from various business segments, including new ESG, analytics and data products that we will be piloting.","Platts agriculture acceleration involves extending news and data offerings and expanding into additional commodities. We\u2019ll also expand the number of projects that are underway as part of our Kensho initiative.","The third category is in technology. We\u2019re adding investments to continue the deployment of data science, AI, clouds, machine learning and robotics tools. We also continue to raise the technology acumen of all employees through a multitude of training programs. All of these investments are aimed, at either growing revenue, or enhancing EBITDA.","Next, I would like to update you on Kensho, one of the greatest challenges we have had with Kensho is prioritizing the large number of projects that employees have identified. Projects generally can be grouped in three key areas; data ingestion, data processing and data and document delivery. Within these categories, there are a number of projects that are underway.","Omnisearch and Entity linking are two we have cited in the past. Omnisearch is the next generation of search capability for our Market Intelligence, Ratings 360 and Platts LNG surface applications. It leverages advanced machine learning techniques to bring natural language search to our web and mobile platforms. We\u2019re also working to link user personas to more relevant responses, as well as expanding the datasets that will be searchable.","The first release will be available in the first half of 2019 to a select group of clients for preview and feedback, and then released in a broader capacity later in 2019 or the first half of 2020.","Entity linking involves using machine learning, to link data from different sources to correct entities without errors and in a fraction of the time it would take our employees. It unlocks the ability to ingest datasets that are too large to be done with traditional methods.","In addition to the Crunchbase data we previously discussed, we have been working on certain datasets for private company data in China and the U.K. For the U.K. data, we plan to make the first 1000 companies available in the first quarter of this year, with subsequent releases of coverage throughout 2019.","Codex is a next generation customer oriented platform, designed to ingest any documents and provide the relevant data and information for a particular user needs. A first version of the platform has been built and demonstrations are underway.","Proof-of-Concept user case has been created for Ratings analysts, to alert them to new, relevant information more quickly. We have numerous other projects underway in data processing, and delivery.","The first projects were initiated in just nine months since acquiring Kensho. We estimate the initial projects in Omnisearch, Entity linking and Codex, which are the most advanced, have the potential to generate a net present value, equal to approximately one third of the purchase price of Kensho. We have numerous other projects under way in data processing, and data delivery and numerous others that have been identified, but not yet begun. We believe that this is a very positive start with much more value generation to be achieved during the next few years now.","Now lastly, I would like to introduce our 2019 guidance. This slide depicts our GAAP guidance. Please keep in mind that our guidance reflects current spot markets, ForEx rates. This slide shows our adjusted guidance, an increase in revenue of mid-single digits with contributions by every business segment. We have decided to record Kensho revenue and Market Intelligence going forward. Therefore, we are providing guidance on corporate and allocated expense, excluding any revenue of $155 million to $165 million.","Deal-related amortization of $120 million to $125 million, Kensho retention plans of $20 million to $25 million, operating profit margin in a range of 48.8% to 49.8%. Interest expense of $145 million to $150 million, a tax rate of 22.5% to 23.5%, this is an increase over 2018, because we expect to have a lower benefits from employee stock-based compensation as well as less discrete benefits from prior year tax adjustments, and diluted EPS, which excludes deal related amortization of $8.95 to $9.15.","In addition, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $120 million and free cash flow excluding certain items in a range of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion. In 2019, we are increasing our organic investments in productivity programs and new revenue opportunities. And we will continue to look for opportunities to add unique data, analytics and geographies. Despite so many pending global economic issues, this guidance reflects our expectation that we will continue to deliver solid financial performance again in 2019.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions.","Chip Merritt","Thank you. Just a couple of instructions for our phone participants. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we\u2019ll now take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. This question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Toni Kaplan","Thank you. Good morning. Transaction revenue this quarter was not surprisingly weak just given the issuance levels and January issuance was maybe modestly better than 4Q, but still down double-digits according to our sources. So, can you give us a bit more color on how you\u2019re thinking about the credit environment as we progressed through the year? Thanks.","Doug Peterson","Hi, Toni. Thank you. This is Doug. First of all, as you know during the year last year, we had a solid year during the year, but the fourth quarter in particular December ended up with very weak comparables from prior years.","In particular, there was a shift in the high yield market where people started thinking differently about the type of covenants that were going out to the markets. We also had as you know the impact from tax reform from the largest cash holders that started bringing their cash back and had not gone to the market. We think that the January is not necessarily indicative of the entire year.","As you know, typically January is a pretty weak month. One of the things that was important in January is to see in the second half of January in the third and fourth week, the markets actually started rebounding. You saw more people coming back to the market. You saw spreads came down in the high yield market, but as you know in our forecast overall, we have a forecast for total issuance, which takes into account the pipeline that we see coming in from maturities. We speak with the investment banks and with issuers","And right now, we have projected that for the entire year that issuance will be down about 0.6%. So call it down a little bit or flat. We think that in the corporate sector that\u2019s going to be down about 4%. Financial services is going to be down of about 1.3%, structured finance, basically flat, and public finance up over the prior year of about 9%.","So if you look across different categories this is how we\u2019ve calculated and this is what we\u2019ve used to build into our plans for the year.","Toni Kaplan","Great. Thanks for that. And then, in Market Intelligence I expanded margins significantly this quarter. And I know you said that full year is probably more representative of run rate margins, but could you get some additional color on what I guess maybe the onetime pieces were in for Q and what\u2019s ongoing?","And then, our margins in and Market Intelligence, an area that you can flex when you know if there\u2019s a weak cash to its environment. Thank you.","Ewout Steenbergen","Good morning Toni. This is Ewout. So the strong margin improvement in Market Intelligence was driven on the one hand as you\u2019ve seen by very healthy revenue growth, and then on the other hand, by small decline in expenses. If you look at the underlying components in the expense movements, there were a couple of items that were going in opposite directions, and therefore showing the decline, small decline, modest decline in expenses.","Compensation, base compensation was up, but then there was an offset in lower incentive compensation accruals. So the net was close to zero. We saw strong sales in the fourth quarter, strong sales was driving up the cost of sales, as well as intersegments royalties, but then also strong sales leads to a higher capitalization of acquisition costs under the new revenue accounting methods.","So those are also a bit offsetting. We saw FX having a positive impact on the expenses of Market Intelligence. Allocations were down, so corporate allocations were down, but then acquisitions that were down during the year, most notably, Panjiva and RateWatch were driving expenses up.","So a lot of moving pieces, but net, net small decline in expenses and therefore a good improvement in margins, but we don\u2019t expect all of these items to recur in every quarter. So therefore, the full year margin is a better guidance for Market Intelligence going forward.","Toni Kaplan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. You may ask your question.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you. Good morning. Just on the 2019 top line guidance, what\u2019s the FX impact here assuming and also you kind of gave us the framework for the Ratings business. I know you don\u2019t like to give specific guidance on the others, but is there anything to call out for next year, for each of those businesses, or can we just assume kind of you know the trends that we\u2019ve seen so far.","Ewout Steenbergen","Good morning, Manav. This is Ewout. First, in our guidance we assume current spot market ForEx rates. So that is what is the underlying assumption. If you look at our guidance with respect to top line for the company as a whole, as you know we\u2019re not breaking out guidance for each of the segments. But what I can explain to you is some of the assumptions underneath.","So if you have to think about Ratings as Doug already mentioned, our assumption is more or less flat issuance markets during 2019, and then we have some small adjustments in market shares in certain segments. And then we also take into account price increases based on the new list price that we are using from the first of January of this year.","So that is the underlying assumption we have under our plan for 2019 for Ratings. We have two subscription businesses. So those are, I think businesses that fee growth based on the annualized contract value that we are increasing every year. And you have seen the good progress we\u2019re making for Platts and Market Intelligence. And then with respect to indices, as you know there is a natural hedge in our indices business. If stock markets will come down, we see exchange traded derivate volumes going up, and the other way around. So you have to take that into account in your modeling to also reflect the growth of our indices business. But as we have said in the prepared remarks, we expect mid-single digit revenue growth for the company as a whole and contributions by each of our segments to achieve that.","Manav Patnaik","Got it. Thank you. And then, I guess just thinking about China. You\u2019ve talked about the Rating opportunity there for some time, but I guess, I was struck by you know it sounds like Market Intelligence is doing something new Platts, Kensho I was just wondering if you could briefly address how we should think about the opportunity that those other areas present?","Doug Peterson","Let me take that one. Well, first of all as you know that the Chinese financial markets are still a very big centric market. In fact, as were doing the work to understand the opportunity for Ratings business, we did a lot of macro analysis of the market and just to share with you a couple of the numbers.","For instance in the bond market in China, 54% of the bonds are held by banks and 32% by mutual funds and wealth management projects. Only 2% of the bonds in China are held by foreign investors.","And the issuers themselves are spread between corporate bonds, which are actually quite low compared to other markets local governments\u2019 commercial banks etcetera. But what\u2019s important is, is the Chinese market becomes more sophisticated as the bond markets shift to become a true bond market and not a commercial banking market as more foreign investors start going into the Chinese market.","We looked at the structure of markets and the way they change over time as they become more developed. And what we believe is that there is our basic thesis is that there will be more and more demand for independent analytics. So, one of the first products is obviously the ratings. And we think that, that is a market which will develop pretty quickly especially because there is going to be demand not just from the domestic investors, but also over time from international investors. And along with that, as in any market comes the demand for other types of products and services, data products, information, more information about private companies that don\u2019t have that are not publicly traded.","And this is where we\u2019re looking at the Market Intelligence offering to be able to provide more data and analytics at Cap IQ, SNL like data service for the Chinese markets. And we\u2019ve just started mentioning that, and we\u2019ve just started rolling it out. We have a team on the ground. One of the other elements which is for us is, actually quite exciting of the launch of the Chinese market is that we\u2019re -- we\u2019re also doing this as a team. We\u2019re doing it as S&P Global, even though the Rating agency has its own license, and it has its own staff. We\u2019re also going in with one effort, when it comes to hiring and our human resources and people policies, one legal and compliance team. So we can actually leverage our sources on the ground so we were able to go to market.","But, overall our thesis is that as the market becomes more sophisticated, more connected, there\u2019s going to be a whole set of data and analytic and financial products, which are going to be necessary in the market and we want to be on the ground floor as they become more important.","Operator","Thank you. This question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Capital. You may ask your question.","Hamzah Mazari","Good. Good morning. You talked about the shift from high yield to leverage loans in the U.S. Could you maybe remind us what the margin difference is in your business between loan ratings and high yield, and then whether you\u2019re seeing the same trend in Europe because a secular thesis a while back on Ratings was European bank disintermediation, so wondering if that has sort of reversed any color there?","Doug Peterson","Thanks Hamzah, this is Doug. First of all on the pricing, it\u2019s basically about the same, it\u2019s not -- there\u2019s not a material difference between the pricing, between the two different products. In Europe, we continue to see Europe, the capital markets are continuing to develop. But you have one major impact, which has in a sense slowed down what we thought was going to be the ultimate development and that is the ECB is continuing to provide a lot of liquidity for the markets. But in the last in the last quarter up until you had the slowdown of the leverage loan market, the European markets were actually moving quite fast. There was a lot of issuance. And in the last two weeks of January, the European leverage markets actually came back to life, and there was there was issuance back in the European market.","So, we do think in the long run, the European markets will continue to move towards capital markets more quickly obviously compared that we just talked about in the prior questions about China. Europe is a much more developed capital market than what we see as one that\u2019s just starting out, but it\u2019s not quite still at the level of U.S. when it comes to participation of traditional capital market entities like insurance companies and pension funds and asset managers. But it -- but we\u2019re seeing continued move in that direction.","Hamzah Mazari","Okay. And just a follow-up question. On Ratings margins you talked about up 10 bips on a 16% revenue drop and highlighted various reasons. If Ratings revenue does come back, how quickly do costs come back in that segment? Just any comments on operating leverage in that segment being structurally much higher? Or any thoughts on sort of how costs come back to that segment if you see revenue come back?","Ewout Steenbergen","Good morning Hamza, this is Ewout. A couple of thoughts that hopefully are helpful. On the one hand, Ratings is working on very active programs to think about how to redesign its operations, its business model, its processes, its systems, is introducing new technologies in order to make the life of the [Indiscernible] analysts, more effective to take away some of the lower value added work, the spread work on updating of the models, and to replace that with new technologies and to get that done in a more efficient way.","So, we expect operating leverage for Ratings to continue. You saw that we took another restructuring charge for Ratings as well. So, those are benefits in the programs where we will continue to see improvements in overall productivity in the Ratings organization.","The other element that you have to take into account is incentive compensation. And we had some expense benefit during the quarter from the incentive compensation accruals. For the full year, the way how to dimensionalize that is the following. So, first Ratings had a very good year in 2017, as had some other businesses in the Company as you will recall. So we had very good payout. So we will see a reduction just every year a reset to a 100% of the accrual levels.","And then this year particularly in the fourth quarter, the performance was of course lower. So now you have a reflection of lower pay outs from that 100% level. So if you look at the overall expense reduction, year-over-year for Ratings, which was approximately $120 million, the majority of that came from incentive accruals. A little over half of that was just a reset year-over-year to the 100% level, and a little bit less than half of that reduction came from the lower accruals that we established in 2018 that of course will come back up to the 100% level in 2019.","So that is an automatic increase in the costs that we'll see in 2019 from 2018. But again, we expect also at the same time continued improvement all of the productivity programs that we are implementing in Ratings.","Hamzah Mazari","Very helpful, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This question comes from Alex Kramm from UBS. You may ask your question.","Alex Kramm","Yes. Hey, good morning everyone. Just hoping you can expand on the conversation about China that was asked about earlier and in your prepared remarks, you gave some nice data points. I think 35 employees in that new entity, but 200 in the in the other parts. Like, how quickly are you ramping people here, and what cost is tied to that end, secondarily, you said 400 companies already rated out of the other entities, so that can come pretty quickly. So maybe just talk about the next few quarters, few years in terms of how quickly that business can ramp, and then in terms of pricing, like how do you thing envision the pricing structures, they are very comparable to the rest of the world, or is there something we should be thinking about differently in terms of basis points? Thank you.","Doug Peterson","Okay. Thanks Alex. Well just to give you a little bit more of the ramp up plan. As you heard, we have 36 employees in the entity, 31 of those are analysts. Of those analysts, about 10 of them are employees from S&P Global that transferred in from other parts of the world, who are bringing the core knowledge and expertise of how S&P Global works everywhere else. They are native Mandarin speakers that have come in from other offices. And then, we've hired 21 more analysts from the markets, being a first mover was an advantage to us, because we were able to go out the market and attract a very large pool of candidates and hire a really highly qualified set of people.","And because we were there first, and we already have started hiring, we think, that we can ramp up very quickly if the demand comes in. Right now in China there\u2019s about 4000 issuers that are rated across the markets by the domestic rating agencies. We rate about 400 of those offshore. We\u2019ve already developed plans to go out and meet with all of those different 400 that we\u2019re working with already as well as the others as many as possible of the other issues that are rated.","I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to give you any kind of financial projections on this, but I can tell you that the pricing that we\u2019re looking at over time will develop to a similar level as around the globe. It\u2019s likely to start out where you need to enter the market at a level pricing that\u2019s going to be able to get us to close the transactions and get out into the markets. But, we expect over time that the pricing is going to be similar to the rest of the world.","As you know, pricing on Bond ratings is actually a very low amortized cost for compared to the cost of actual bond issuance. And so that\u2019s why we think we can over time, we can develop to that level of pricing. We -- when we look at the different kinds of bond markets, is as you saw in our prepared remarks, there\u2019s four different categories of bonds that we\u2019re able to rate, that we\u2019ve been approved for. We think that the financial institutions in the corporates are really the core area that we will start rating right away, because that\u2019s where we have the relationships with the 400 issuers.","We do have as you as you know; we have very long term thinking about this. This is something that developed over the long term. This didn\u2019t just come about over one quarter. We've been working on this for years. John Berisford, Ewout, and myself have been visiting China for years to build the relationships and to understand the markets. And with that kind of a long-term commitment to the way we've approached to this is the same way we think about building out the business and ensuring that we build it with a really strong foundation and a really strong team on the ground.","Alex Kramm","Excellent, super helpful color. Thank you. And then secondly, maybe also coming back to a prior question. But, if you think about the issuance forecast, and I know it\u2019s another team that does it, but if I think about the last few quarters, I think it was always lower every quarter and you know obviously they\u2019re difficult to forecast. But if you think about it from a bigger picture perspective, what are the big puts and takes that you thinking about as you look at that forecast and where things could you know do a lot better or do worse. And a couple of things to maybe highlight is like you said the loans business has been an area of strength, but I think people are getting increasingly more worried about what\u2019s going on that market. And then, you know we\u2019re hearing increasingly CFOs talking about deleverage -- deleveraging the balance sheet. So, what are the kind of puts and takes I guess, you would be watching out for? Thank you.","Doug Peterson","Yes. So let me give you a few of the thoughts on that. And let me start with the leveraged market. And it\u2019s as you have seen in the numbers we presented, the leverage market has the component of the financial, the corporations that go to leverage market can go either to the bond market or to the loan market. They\u2019ve increasingly been going to the loan market for various reasons, based on the kinds of borrowers -- the kinds of lenders and investors that have gone in the market. The attraction of a floating rate, versus fixed rate. The attraction of the kinds of covenants and other aspects of the loan market that they could get.","We saw a correction in that market in December, and there\u2019s a lot of people including myself that think that some of the aspects of that were probably healthy. Leverage had gotten quite high. You saw leverage in some deals going over 6, 7 sometimes even eight times.","And so since the market has opened up, even though there\u2019s a lot of investors going back to the market. There\u2019s been some correction in terms of leverage not so much in covenants so far, but much more in total leverage amounts.","And so we see that as one of the factors which will be driving our forecast going forward. A little bit more specifically on the forecasts. And you mentioned that since our October outlook, our December outlook, and our January outlook we\u2019ve seen actually a moderation of the -- of that when we first did our 2019 forecast in October we expected that it was going to be up about 0.6%, December about the same up 0.6% and now we see it going down 0.6%.","So just to give you some of the sentiment and some of the areas that we see those changes. We -- we did drop a little bit on the corporates, we dropped it by about another 1% down from the prior forecast just based on the pipelines that we\u2019ve seen from the market participants. But financial services is the one that we saw the largest shift between the end of the year and now the beginning of the year.","And that had originally been expected to go up 5% and now we\u2019re expected to only go up about 1.3%. And the main difference there is based on what we expect financial institutions are going to be issuing related to reserve requirements and some of them by speaking with them a lot of them are not going to be growing their balance sheets as much as we had originally expected.","So this goes back to policies, capital policies at the Fed as well as capital policies of the banks themselves. And that\u2019s probably the largest difference overall that drove that. So a little bit in the corporates, a lot more from financial institutions and then our outlook for the leverage market it\u2019s come back, not necessarily with the same level of leverage that we saw in the middle of the year last year, but it actually has come back pretty healthy .The last couple weeks of January the markets were back, they were open again after 45 days of being closed.","Alex Kramm","Excellent, thanks again.","Operator","Thank you. This question comes from Tim McHugh from William Blair & Company. You may ask your question.","Tim McHugh","Thanks. I just wanted to ask about how you would characterize that you talked about the incremental hundred million of investments. I guess you\u2019re always investing somewhat in the business. So is this a stepped up level of investment that\u2019s different than other years or are you just trying to highlight to us I guess what you -- what the focus is for the year. Just trying to understand the context of what you\u2019re seeing with that.","Doug Peterson","Good morning, Tim. Yes, we are just trying to highlight and to make this transparent to you and also show you the specific areas where we are investing. To give you a little bit broader perspective, we\u2019re of course always investing in our businesses, in business as usual to keep our balance marks relevant in systems, and processes, in new designs of the organization. So, there is always a lot of level of business as usual investments.","What we are trying to highlight here is investments specifically in new initiatives, new products and new markets. As we showed you in 2018, those investments were at the level of $60 million. And that will go up by approximately $40 million to $50 million to that new number for 2019 in those areas like China. And I think everyone would agree with me that the Chinese Ratings opportunity for the Company is very large and it makes a lot of sense to make this investment. And the Company will see hopefully a lot of benefit out of that in the mid- and long-term.","So obviously we are self-funding those initiatives. You see that we have productivity programs going on, where everyone has savings on the one hand, and capturing the operating leverage and then reinvesting it. And also you see the margins still going up for the company. So another indication that we are self-funding those initiatives.","So we hope it\u2019s overall helpful that they get this clarity. And do you have a feel where the company is making the large investments in new initiatives going forward to expect future revenue growth for the company on top of our current business activities.","Tim McHugh","Okay. That's helpful. And then, just want to follow up. I think it was -- when you're talking about the cash flow, there was quick comment you made about longer renewal cycles for some of the enterprise deals in Market Intelligence. I guess, can you elaborate on what that was? And I guess just you said I think you thought it was a timing issue. So why do you think that necessarily?","Doug Peterson","Sure, Tim. What is happening is as you know we\u2019re going through the process to move all Market Intelligence customers to enterprise wide contracts. So this is purely an administrative process where we are changing the contracts, you have discussions about the new language of the new contracts, those contracts then need to be signed new invoices needs to be issued, and then there needs to be a cash collection on those new invoices.","So going through this process right now, the change in timelines have shifted from about 10 days to fifty two days in terms of cash collection. So this is purely a delay in the process. We expect to catch up off that during 2019. So therefore you see a free cash flow number guidance for 2019, which is up 10% to 15% over the free cash flow we generated in 2018.","Tim McHugh","Okay, so the comment about that, the delay is more about the collection process on, not necessarily the sale or negotiation of the agreement.","Doug Peterson","Just going through the whole process of new contract, legal documentation, signing, processing, invoicing and so on. It\u2019s purely administrative renewal process itself.","Tim McHugh","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Jeff Silber","Thanks so much. I know it\u2019s late. I just ask a couple of quick ones. You mentioned when talking about the outlook for the Rating segment, the price increases, you instituted at the beginning of the year. Can you give us some order a framework roughly what that was and how that compared to prior years?","Doug Peterson","The list price that has been issued is 6.95. You see that was up from approximately 6.75. So, about 3% increase year-over-year. That is just the headline, list price of course there\u2019s a lot of differentiation by type of customer, type of arrangements and so on. But that would be the headline number.","Jeff Silber","And what was the headline increase in 2018?","Doug Peterson","More or less the same. So that is the usual increase that we see over the past few years.","Jeff Silber","Okay. Great, and again, I know you don\u2019t give quarterly guidance. But beside you know potentially Ratings being more back end loaded. Is there anything you want to point out for the quarters for 2019?","Doug Peterson","No there\u2019s nothing else that we can point out at this moment.","Jeff Silber","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. This question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. You may ask your question.","Craig Huber","Thank you, Doug I want to just get back to China for a second. Here you mentioned about 31 analysts in that market you\u2019ve hired or switched over there, roughly it\u2019s roughly 2% of you are -- just analyst on a global basis. How quickly do you think this market from your perspective from a Ratings revenue standpoint could can pick up here in the coming years, will actually or maybe we\u2019ll see it in the numbers? I mean, just it\u2019s a long term play off obviously, but do you expect any material positive impact on revenues and profits in the first two years say, is there any big pent up demand or we get a big bump upfront in your revenue boost here with the Ratings being in that market, or just could take a little more time to play out?","Doug Peterson","My expectation is that this will take a little bit to play out. What I'd like to do is, give you numbers as we start looking at this over quarter-by-quarter. We'll figure it how often and how much we're going to -- we will give you about our progress. But just a couple of more -- couple more statistics about the market. Overall in China the total lending market, including everything is about $20.6 trillion. Of that, about $13 trillion is corporate. So it's -- little bit more than half of the market is corporate loans. And of that about $2 trillion more or less are bonds of which $1 trillion are bonds outstanding of corporates.","So think about $1 trillion corporate bond market, about 4000 issuers. We think that we\u2019ve got 400 that we are going to have relationships that we can tap as the first companies that we go to. We also, as you know the panda bond market where foreign issuers go into the Chinese market, is one that is it\u2019s very small right now, but we think that\u2019s another area that will bring specific expertise as well as interest from foreign issuers to go into the Chinese market using S&P as the company that\u2019s going to do the rating.","So I don\u2019t want to give you any projections or numbers on the revenues over time. As I\u2019ve said, we see this as a market which is going to transform to more of a global capital market, much more connected. As I mentioned earlier, that it\u2019s only 2% of the bonds in China are held by foreign investors. So we see that growing.","And so let us come back to you to give you updates on our progress. So we can really understand how fast this is going to move once we\u2019re starting to see volume come in through the door.","Craig Huber","And then on second. Doug, you mentioned, I guess in a global basis expecting debt issuance down zero to 1% call it, if you could just segment for just U.S. part of that, I\u2019d be curious for your thoughts, how you think that might play out the debt issuance for investment grade and high-yield? And then also maybe with -- how you maybe see bank loan issuance for this year playing out those three segments within this country?","Doug Peterson","Well, the two pieces which are the most significant that I mentioned a couple of minutes ago, the corporates which are down 4.8% more or less what we\u2019re projecting, that\u2019s mostly the U.S. And that\u2019s mostly the U.S. and it\u2019s partially because of tax reform and what our projections are as to what will be the issuance level for the companies that have very cash rich balance sheets.","And then the other which is, is probably the most significant as I said financial services. That\u2019s also U.S. And that\u2019s the \u2013 that\u2019s the U.S. financial institutions that are the ones that are projecting they have smaller balance sheets, or less growth on their balance sheets than we had expected three and four months ago. So that\u2019s the color that I can give you based on the analysis that our team has done.","Craig Huber","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This question comes from Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your question.","Joseph Foresi","Hi. My first question is just on China. Do you -- can you give us a little bit of a better understanding of maybe what the risks are of having Ratings in that region? Is there sufficient accounting standards there? Do you feel like you\u2019re more exposed? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of you know how the market works from a risk perspective?","Doug Peterson","Well, thanks Joseph for the question. As we\u2019ve gone into the Chinese market, as I mentioned earlier, this is something that we\u2019ve been looking at for years. This isn\u2019t just something that cropped up in the last quarter. And we\u2019ve also already had a business on the ground for over 10 years of with ratings analysts on the ground in China, who have been rating Chinese corporations on offshore issuance or dim sum bonds that are issued offshore.","And as I mentioned, we have 400 of those that we\u2019ve already rated. So we know that there is at least 400 companies that are already audited by global auditing firms. They have transparency in their financials. They\u2019ve been going offshore to raise funds. And so there is already a core group of corporations and financial institutions in China that are rated and are already issuing bonds at global standards.","But clearly you\u2019re raising what for us is are very important points, and how do we -- how do we roll out the Ratings business in a market, which is developing. We are using our knowledge and experience of how we\u2019ve gone into other markets, like India through CRISIL or Mexico with which we did an acquisition many years ago to go into that market. Both India and Mexico are markets where we issue with local Rating scales, where we do not have Rating scales that are linked to the global scales, they\u2019re there based on local market conditions.","And so one of the reasons, that we\u2019re rolling out are China Rating agency is a local independently scaled Rating agency is that we want to be able to meet and understand all the local conditions of what are the conditions of bankruptcy laws. What are the conditions of workouts? What are the conditions of companies that could potentially have any kind of a default or a payment issue? And this is why it\u2019s important for us to go in that market independently with a locally managed Rating agency.","We\u2019ve been working closely with the regulators to ensure that they understand the Rating agency model, as we roll it out. It\u2019s critical that they understand that we\u2019re independent and that our ratings are going to be issued with an independent opinion that we\u2019ve got the right kind of analysts that are well-trained.","So we\u2019ve understood, we\u2019ve looked at what are the kinds of risks. Do we get the right kind of disclosure from companies? Do you have the ability to understand if there\u2019s been a payment issue? Do we have the right kind of regulatory environment, which we think is being developed in a way that\u2019s very professional and understanding what are the other environments around the globe for four rating regimes etcetera.","So we\u2019ve gone in with this over many many years of analysis, many, many years of building relationships and we think that some of those risks that you mentioned are things that we have a good ways to mitigate or manage.","Joseph Foresi","Got it. And then just to switch gears, any way to start to quantify the impact of the increase in your focus on data. I\u2019m thinking more on the Kensho side and I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of you know I know early stage and you\u2019re sort of building the foundation, but clearly it\u2019s a focus, clearly it\u2019s something that I would agree is going to be an important part of the future.","But I\u2019m wondering how internally you\u2019re starting to think about quantifying that, and any anecdotes you could provide. Thanks.","Doug Peterson","Yes, let me give you a couple of thoughts on that. First, we are looking at more and more datasets. Ideally, proprietary data sets that are unique, and only can be found on our platform, but it could also be other data sets that we license and therefore incorporate. As we mentioned during the prepared remarks, with data sets it\u2019s very important that those data and assets are linked to our existing mast or database.","So that there is an automatic link between entities, between individuals, between a lot of different other data sets because data is only valuable if it is put in perspective of all the other data, rich data, that we have already today on our platform.","Therefore, it\u2019s so important that we are working on that new search engine. The only search with Kensho because the more data we put on our platform, the more important it will be for our customers to find the right data, and to use that data in the future. Hence, the investments we are doing with Kensho on the Omnisearch.","Moreover, we are having a lot of data intake elements within the organization, and we\u2019re thinking now about a design of the overall data factory to make data and more a commodity within the firm, based on the same definitions, the same data architecture, have an efficient data intake which is based on a lot of technology tools and to take the benefits of the enterprise as a whole.","So data is core to our strategy, core to our business growth, core to the commercial propositions that are being developed by our businesses, and we make a lot of investments in this area. But ultimately, this will be the main driver of revenue growth for the company in the future.","Joseph Foresi","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This question comes from Dan Dolev from Nomura Securities. You may ask your question.","Dan Dolev","Hey thank you for taking my question. Just from a housekeeping item, is the Kensho $20 million to $25 million expense embedded in the guidance for retention. Is that the main difference between the 2018 and allocated expenses and what you\u2019re guiding for 2019?","Doug Peterson","No, if you look at the unallocated, what we are doing is moving to Kensho revenue to the Market Intelligence revenue. And the reason why we are doing that is more or more the Kensho contracts with Kensho customers are being folded into overall Market Intelligence relationships with the same customers, and therefore it\u2019s more difficult to separately identify Kensho revenue in the future. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s being integrated with revenue of Market Intelligence.","So if you look purely at unallocated expenses, unallocated expenses were $171 million for 2018, which is then excluding the $15 million Kensho revenue. That included $20 million of funding 40 foundation that happened last year, and Kensho expenses. But Kensho expenses you have to realize those were Kensho expenses over a nine month period. So now we are of course having Kensho expenses for the full year 2019.","So if you look at those -- all those elements, we\u2019ll continue to see a nice reduction in unallocated expenses to that range of $155 million to $165 million in 2019 which is ultimately then based on the productivity programs we are introducing within the company.","Dan Dolev","That\u2019s helpful. I just -- so the Kensho retention plan, I believe they were excluded from the adjusted number, right, the $34 million in 2018. They were not in the non-GAAP number?","Doug Peterson","If you look at Kensho expenses, we have Kensho expenses that are being included from a performance basis. And then we have access Kensho expenses that are based on the rollover equity as part of the consideration for the acquisitions. So, what we have done is we looked at what is market compensation for employees of Kensho. Everything that is market level is being included on the non-GAAP basis and everything that's over and above what will be normalized market levels which is based on that rollover equity that is being stripped out as the Kensho retention related expenses.","That number you should see coming down over time. And the reason is just purely the accounting is an accelerated accounting methods. So every year you see that number coming down very quickly, the excess expenses for Kensho that are being pulled out on a non-GAAP basis.","Dan Dolev","Got it. Thank you. And then just my follow-up is on the overall headcount. I see some nice growth in the headcount on a year over year. If you have to sort of think about the different segments it looks like the corporate headcount increased dramatically. Yes. Say in reading the headcount decline. If you had to sort of normalize that in terms of the centers of excellence like how would that roughly look like? Would you be expecting ratings headcount to go up as well if you didn't allocated into corporate that's sort of a question?","Doug Peterson","That's really a great question. So there is always going to be some movements in headcount. So when we do acquisitions of course headcount will go up. So for example, in corporate headcount went up for example based on the Kensho acquisition. But also headcount in market intelligence is up and that's based on the acquisitions of Panjiva, RateWatch, but also new content sets that MI is introducing. So we will have reductions of headcount based on productivity on existing data sets in market intelligence and then headcount additions for the new datasets that are being introduced.","Corporate headcount might go up a bit overtime because when we are centralizing certain activities in centers of excellence it might mean a shift from headcount in the divisions to corporate. So that could be an other shift. Also when we are in sourcing certain activities for example the IT and engineering activities in ratings will ultimately be an increase in headcount for ratings, but that is an offset on external surfaces that will be eliminated going forward. So that's a shift in headcount numbers but not so much a shift in expenses or actually that is a decline in expenses that we will realize as a company.","Ewout Steenbergen","And just to add one thing. One of the thing that John's trying to do in ratings is he aspires to try to be able to handle more and more and more credits each year with the same number of analysts. But we're not real looking to reduce there. We're looking to try to make the more more efficient with all the technology that we're trying to deploy.","Dan Dolev","Makes sense. Thank you so much.","Doug Peterson","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Thank you. This question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","George Tong","Hi thanks. Good morning. Your non-transaction revenues took a step back in the ratings business in part because of tougher comps. Were there specific items that weighed on non-transaction revenues this quarter? And how do you see non-transaction revenues performing next year?","Ewout Steenbergen","Hey, George, good morning. FX had a negative impact on non-transaction revenue. If you strip that element out it was more or less flat. The other elements that impacted non-transaction revenue was Rating Evaluation Services. We've always called out that debt could go up or down by quarter. That\u2019s very much driven by the M&A environment. So we\u2019ll have quarters where the rest revenues will be a little higher or a little lower. But overall we look at non-transaction revenue as a very stable source of revenues. And we expect that to continue to be a very steady source for the ratings business in the future.","George Tong","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. You\u2019ve achieved $60 million in cost savings through year end 2018 out of your $100 million of cost reductions planned in your Analyst Day over the intermediate term. Can you talk about the pacing when you expect to achieve the remainder of your cost savings and what the principal drivers of savings will be going forward?","Ewout Steenbergen","We are very encouraged by the progress we have made during the first year, $60 million in run rate and $40 million of that in our annual results for 2018. We will continue on the same pace what you have seen towards our targets and the main areas where we find those opportunities are in our functions. So we are trying to create new operating models for our functions across the enterprise both in the businesses as well as in the corporate center.","We are looking at opportunities in our digital infrastructure area. For example, consolidation of some of our data centers moving to the cloud, other outsourcing arrangements et cetera, and we are taking care of real estate costs. We are reducing excess real estate we have in the company and are significantly driving down real estate expenses. And we will continue with all of those levers over the next few years. Of course, we will let you know once we have achieved this target and at that point announced to you a new target. But at this moment we are very encouraged by the progress we are making with all of those programs.","George Tong","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our final question from Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.","Bill Warmington","Good morning, everyone. The final question here it is. Actually two right. So first on Kensho, you mentioned the entity linking work you\u2019re doing with Kensho, Crunchbase, the private company databases in China and the UK. Can you frame that opportunity for us? That\u2019s commercial credit information space is typically in the area we associated with DNB and BBD and it sounds like you\u2019re moving increasingly into that space.","Doug Peterson","This is an area where we are very pleased with some of the first results of the Kensho collaboration. We have talked to you about Crunchbase. But in the meantime, we have done the same with the algorithms that have been developed on other private company data sets. And the benefit of entity linking is the following; it\u2019s not only a expense-reduction opportunity. Of course, in the past, we could do the same entity linking but by asking a lot of teams and a lot of employees to work on that. And that will take a lot of time to achieve data linking with the right quality of data. Is it the same entity, the name is spelled at a slightly different way, slightly different abbreviation? Is it a subholding? Is it in another jurisdiction? So a lot of work has to be done to make sure that entity linking is correct and accurate.","So by doing this now based on algorithms, of course, we find efficiency opportunities, but the larger benefit is in fact in the revenue opportunity. Why? Because of speed to market we can significantly increase speed to market of new data sets, the quality of the products we bring out because in the end with the algorithms we can achieve a higher quality and less errors going forward. And we can think about new products that you could never bring to the market in the past. Certain data sets are so large that it is almost impossible to achieve any ingestion of that by humans, but we can do that now in a fraction of the time by our algorithms. And therefore we can now introduce products to we could never think of in the past. So in the end, we always look at this as a larger revenue opportunity than an efficiency opportunity. And again, we are very pleased with the results so far we have been able to achieve.","Bill Warmington","And then, for the second and final question. The $8.95 to $9.15 EPS guidance for 2019, just wanted to ask about the level of share repurchases built into that number? I know you announced the $500 million ASR today. I would assume that was built into that guidance. But then if you assume about $550 million in dividends that would leave about $600 million in excess cash you're going to return. Is that $600 million built in as well as the $500 million ASR?","Ewout Steenbergen","Yes. Obviously we cannot give you a very precise answer on that question. But let me give you some of the components. We have provided guidance with respect of free cash flow generation for this year. You know that we\u2019re committed to return at least 75% of that number. You are aware of the dividend payout level we will do this year. So it\u2019s not too difficult to assume what is the remainder in share repurchases that will be achieved. If we are going to exceed that number or not is to be seen. That depends very much on opportunities we will have this year.","We always look first investments in organic opportunities because we think those are the most valuable as long as those make sense strategically and we can achieve the right returns in organic opportunities, but if those are not available then we can always return more than the 75% commitment that we have to the market. So, those are the components and I think that probably helps you, Bill with what you are looking for in terms of question.","Bill Warmington","Thank you very much.","Chip Merritt","Bill, you asked some great pile of questions but the operator said we do have one more in the queue. Let\u2019s see if there's -- if anyone is still out there.","Peter Appert","Hi. Peter Appert. Am I on?","Doug Peterson","You\u2019re on, Peter.","Peter Appert","Okay. So, much for Bill Warmington. Doug, I was just interested in a quick thought you have on market share trends in the ratings business. Your revenue in the first part of the year lagged a little bit about -- some of your competitors, we don't know the second half number is obviously relatively, but wondering if that\u2019s a red flag at all for you? Maybe does it suggest that some of the cost cutting initiatives perhaps are hurting you a little bit from a share perspective, just your thoughts on that? Thanks.","Doug Peterson","Yes. Well, first of all, thank you, Peter that you\u2019ve been able to get on the call. And when it comes to the ratings business or when we look at the market share globally we continue to have a very strong market share. It\u2019s -- there\u2019s a couple of areas where we see weaknesses. One of them is in CLOs. As you know there\u2019s a couple of other businesses like covered bonds that we\u2019re not really active in at all. So if there\u2019s any place where we have seen areas that we will put some additional concentration on looking at our penetration it\u2019s all in the structured finance area.","Peter Appert","Okay great. Thanks so much.","Doug Peterson","Do you have a second question?","Peter Appert","I do. Actually on Market Intelligence, the migration.","Doug Peterson","[Indiscernible] Bill\u2019s question.","Chip Merritt","Is this way better than Bill's question?","Peter Appert","Okay. Probably not as good as Bill's, he\u2019s way more intellectual than I. Market Intelligence, the migration to enterprise contracts, I mean, how far along are we in that? And how has that had measurable implications in terms of profitability for the segment?","Doug Peterson","Peter, the progress we have made over the last quarter is moving from 76% to 81% Cap IQ customers moving to enterprise wide agreements. So a nice 5% step up. What we're seeing now is what we call the long tail. We are now making those changes for a large group of smaller customers. We're not planning to really call out those numbers anymore in the future. We\u2019ll continue over the next period to drive this to a 100% level over the next year or so. But we will continue to make progress to ultimately have 100% percent of our customers on enterprise-wide agreements. So good progress. And I think, basically for us the last final number of customers we'll deal with over the remainder of this year.","Peter Appert","Thank you.","Doug Peterson","Great. Well, thanks, everyone for joining the call this morning. I\u2019m sure you can hear how enthusiastic we are about the company -- a company about our prospects for the future. As you can see we have a lot of initiatives to look at our top line growth and our productivity. We\u2019re committed to continue to manage towards important productivity, but also very importantly to growth.","And you heard about some of our plans for our data operations for technology in particular around artificial intelligence and machine learning and the kind of impact that can have on us. And I also want to thank all of you for the questions about China and our international operations. We\u2019re very enthusiastic about the opportunity we have going forward in China and we'll keep bringing you updates on that as we go forward.","And on top of that, I want to thank our great Board of Directors, our management team, our global workforce the commitment they have as well to power the markets in the future and the framework that we'll continue to show you new going forward as to how we're allocating capital where we're growing. And again, I want to thank all of you and we look forward to even more success in 2019. Thank you very much.","Operator","That concludes this morning\u2019s call.

Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% of more of S&P Global should give me a call to better understand the impact of this legislation on the investor and potentially the company.","We are aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors and we would ask questions from the media be directed to Jason Feuchtwanger at 212-438-1247.","At this time, I would turn the call over to Doug Peterson, Doug?","Doug Peterson","Thank you, Chip. Good morning and welcome to today's earnings call.","We're pleased to report excellent second quarter financial results. All four divisions delivered revenue growth and adjusted operating profit margin expansion. Between revenue growth and progress on our productivity initiatives, we achieved significant margin improvement contributing to a 12% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. Based on these results and our expectations for the rest of the year, we're raising our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance which Ewout will detail in a moment.","Share repurchases are an important component of capital return, and in late July, we concluded the $500 million ASR that we initiated in February. We anticipate initiating another $500 million ASR later this month. As you know, we've earmarked funds to make investments in meaningful growth opportunities.","In a moment, I'll share details around several of these including our first ratings in the domestic Chinese bond market, our first ratings ESG evaluations, and the successful launch by CME Group of Micro E-mini index futures.","To recap the financial results for the second quarter, revenue increased 6% to more than $1.7 billion. Our adjusted operating profit increased 11%, and our adjusted operating profit margin increased 220 basis points to 51.3%.","Well, this is a meaningful improvement, we measure in track adjusted margins on a trailing four-quarter basis, which increased 230 basis points to 49.5%. In addition, we reduce shares outstanding by 2%, which contributed to the 12% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. Each quarter, we take an opportunity to highlight key drivers to our business and important projects underway.","This quarter, let's start with ratings issuance trends. During the second quarter, global bond issuance decreased 3% with mixed performance across geographies and asset classes. If we also include bank loan ratings, total global issuance declined 13%. In US, bond issuance in aggregate declined 4%, as investment grade increased 5%, high-yield toward 41%, public finance declined 11%, and structured finance dropped 19% with declines in CLOs, partially offset by gains in RMBS and CMBS.","In Europe, bond issuance decreased 12% as investment grade decreased 17%, high-yield declined 4%, and structured finance decreased 1% due to declines in CLOs in ABS partially offset by gains in RMBS and covered bonds. In Asia, bond issuance increased 10% overall.","On the fourth quarter 2018 earnings call, we introduced this chart to attempt to track debt issuance and global cash balances of the 50 companies with the most overseas cash at the end of 2017.","As you can see here, the cash balances of these companies continue to decline. And bond issuance among these companies is increasing compared to the anemic 2018. The latest 2019 global bond issuance forecast is modestly more upbeat than the previous forecast. Excluding international public finance, which has minimal impact on our financial results, issuance is expected to increase 1.4%.","Investor demand for leveraged loans was more appealing when rates were rising as loans have variable rates. Now that the tone from the Federal Reserve is more dovish, expectations have shifted to a rate decrease. In this environment, high-yield debt with its fixed rates looks relatively more attractive than loans to investors.","This led to a decrease in bank loan ratings revenue in the second quarter to $85 million versus $121 million in the second quarter of 2018. During Investor Day, we introduced the framework powering the markets in the future, including six foundational capabilities. We use this framework to set our goals and allocate resources. I'm pleased to share great progress on a number of our new initiatives in the areas of global customer orientation and innovation.","Last month, S&P Global China ratings published its inaugural credit rating in the domestic Chinese bond market. This first rating issue was for ICBC Financial Leasing Company Limited, a leading Chinese leasing company, which was assigned a rating of AAA on S&P Global China Ratings National scale. And just this week, the second rating was issued to Luzhou Banking Company Limited, a city commercial bank headquartered in Luzhou City of Sichuan Province. It was issued a BBB rating on the same scale.","These two ratings begin to demonstrate the wider rating spectrum that they can expect as S&P Global China ratings brings a fresh perspective to a market of significant domestic and global interest built on our longstanding principles of objectivity and transparency. In doing so, we hope to contribute to the goals China has for the evolution of its domestic financial markets, and its connectivity to the global financial system.","S&P Global Ratings issued its first ESG evaluation. Separate from a credit rating, the new ESG evaluation is for companies looking to help their investors gain a better understanding of their strategy, purpose, and management quality. The ESG evaluation is grounded environmental, social, and governance factors to assess an entity sustainability efforts. The ESG evaluation process is unique, and that includes interactions between our ratings analysts and the company's management.","I recently met with several investors who expect the granular factors considered such as greenhouse gas emissions, water usage, safety management, and transparency in reporting that each have a score will further differentiate our ESG approach. You can see the factors on this slide.","The first ESG evaluation in the US was for NextEra Energy, the world's largest producer of wind and solar energy. The first ESG evaluation in Europe was for Masmovil, Spain's fourth-largest telecom operator, providing fixed and mobile voice, and Internet services to business and retail customers.","Each year, S&P Dow Jones Indices releases the annual survey of assets. This chart depicts the highlights of that survey for 2018. Due to the stock market correction that occurred late last year, asset levels and actively managed funds that benchmark against our indices were actually down versus the end of 2017 to $7.7 trillion.","The assets and passive funds invested in products index to our indices were unchanged year-over-year at $4.8 trillion. Numerous indices support the trillion. Clearly, the S&P 500 is the largest with 3.6 trillion in assets. Other categories include Smart Beta and Fixed Income which both declined, and ESG and other which increased with ESG more than tripling in the past year.","S&P Dow Jones Indices is continuing to advance opportunities in ESG. The S&P Dow Jones Indices, ESG scores service foundation for Index eligibility. In May, 22 new indices were added to the ESG Index family with versions of well-known country and regional benchmarks, including S&P Global 1200 ESG, S&P\/ASX 200 ESG, and S&P Japan 500 ESG.","On our first quarter earnings call, we shared that UBS had just launched in ETF in Europe based on our S&P 500 ESG Index. Earlier this week, the AUM for the ESG ETF reached $125 million. In June, DWS launched the Xtrackers S&P 500 ESG ETF based on the same Index, which screens out firms with the lowest environmental, social, and government's profiles.","In May, Micro E-mini futures were launched at the CME to make trading more accessible. Micro E-mini futures are 110th the size of existing E-mini equity index futures, and that's more affordable for certain investors. These new Micro E-mini futures are based on four prominent indices, including the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.","The new Micro E-mini were recently dubbed the most successful launch in CME Group's history with 2.6 million contracts traded in the first full week. This chart shows the average daily volume of each of the products with the S&P 500 contracts seeing the largest trading volume.","Delivering innovation, delivering innovative new products and nurturing existing benchmarks is an important emphasis at S&P Global. Indices recently launched eight new sector indices in Chile, with a focus on local investors of the Santiago Stock Exchange. Examples include the S&P\/CLX Construction Real Estate Index, and the S&P CLX Food and Beverages Index.","The development of a market for US crude delivered into Europe took a further step forward last month with the first ever trade of a delivered WTI Midland cargo in the Platts market on close assessment process. Two price assessments that we have discussed on a number of earnings calls have been the 0.5% sulfur marine fuel and the JKM LNG marker. Both of these are being added to the Platts eWindow.","The Market on Close or MOCs Platts process for offering transparency into bid, offers, and transaction submitted by participants to Platts editors. eWindow enhances the MOC process. The inclusion on eWindow is an important milestone in the ongoing maturity and evolution of marine fuel and LNG markets.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who will provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout?","Ewout Steenbergen","Thank you, Doug and good morning to all of you on the call.","Let me start with our second quarter financial results. Doug covered the highlights of strong revenue and adjusted operating profit growth. I will take a moment to cover a few other line items. Adjusted Corporate Unallocated improved by 10% primarily due to reduced project spending. Please keep in mind that Kensho revenue is included in the 2018 figure, but starting in 2019 it is included within Market Intelligence revenue.","Interest expense increased 41% because the prior-year figure was unusually low due to a reduction of FIN 48 interest accruals associated with the resolution of New York State tax audits covering several years. The adjusted effective tax rate was 23.1%, 80 basis points lower than a year ago. This was primarily due to slightly higher stock option exercises as compared to the second quarter last year.","Share repurchases, continued to be an important element of our capital return program. These actions resulted in a 2% decline in our diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Stock options associated with 120,000 shares were exercised during the second quarter.","This resulted in a stock-based compensation, tax benefits on EPS of $0.02. Year-to-date stock option activity is running well ahead of last year. However, as the number of employee stock options continues to decline we expect the stock-based compensation tax benefits to decline as well.","Changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact on the revenue in the Ratings and Market Intelligence divisions, and a $0.01 favorable impact on adjusted EPS for the company. Ratings revenue was negatively impacted primarily by the weakening of the Euro, Australian Dollar and British Pounds. Operating profit in Market Intelligence was favorably impacted by the weakening of the Argentinean Peso, Euro and Indian Rupee.","Of our four non-GAAP adjustments this quarter, a $20 million restructuring charge primarily in Ratings and Corporate, a $5 million Lease impairment associated with Platts vacating office space at 2 Penn Plaza in New York City, and these employees are relocating to our headquarters downtown. $5 million in Kensho retention-related expenses, and we had $31 million in Deal-related amortization.","This is a slide we shared at our Investor Day in May 2018. At the pics of framework that we outlined to show the areas where we can most impact shareholder value. The first two require investments.","We need to continue to invest to fuel revenue momentum with product innovations, introducing new technology, adding new data sets, and reaching out to new customers in new geographies. We have made great progress delivering EBITA enhancement, and we must continue to fund new organic opportunities to drive additional productivity gains.","Driving financial leverage involves optimizing interest cost, reducing shares outstanding, and optimizing the tax rate. And finally, we want to return capital to shareholders while maintaining flexible debt capacity. We are committed to returning at least 75% of annual free cash flow to shareholders each year.","This quarter all four divisions delivered revenue growth and margin improvement. This is a testament to all the hard work by our employees, creating innovative new products, nurturing benchmarks, and delivering on productivity improvements our section important focus across the company. I'll provide color on the individual business results in a moment.","Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents declined slightly versus the end of 2018 principally due to $644 million of share repurchases during the first quarter. However, cash and cash equivalents increased considerably versus the $1.4 billion on hand at the end of the first quarter this year.","Our adjusted growth leverage to adjusted EBITDA was 1.9 times remaining within our targeted range of 1.75 times to 2.25 times. On an un-adjusted basis, our gross debt to EBITDA leverage multiple decreased to 1.1 times based on its EBITDA growth in the first six months of 2019.","Free cash flow excluding certain items increased $98 million to $956 million in the first half of this year. With an existing ASR underway, there were no additional shares repurchased during the quarter. This ASR concluded in late July and we expect to initiate a new $500 million ASR later this month. $140 million of dividends were paid during the quarter.","Now, let's turn to the deficient results starting with Ratings. Ratings revenue increased 3% despite bank loan volume and bond issuance activity that declined 13%. We have emphasized ","in the past, the changes in total issuance aren't necessarily indicative of changes in revenue. The issuance mix is very important.","With that in mind, high-yield issuance is very incremental to our revenue, and was up 41% in the U.S., our largest market. High-yield revenue growth combined with modest price increases at the beginning of the year cost Ratings revenue to increase 3%. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, revenue increased 5%.","Adjusted expenses increased less than 1%, resulting in a 5% increase in adjusted segment operating profit, and a 120 basis points increase in adjusted segment operating profit margin. On a trailing four-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 70 basis points to 55.7%.","Non-transaction revenue decreased due to a $6 million impact from foreign exchange rates, with changes in the other components offsetting each other. Transaction revenue increased as debt rating activity driven by high-yield bonds outpaced the decline in bank loan rating activity. Over time, non-transaction revenue has been a steady source of growth. This is because the majority of the revenue is subscription like. However, there is some volatility at certain components, namely Rating Evaluation Services, ebb and flow with M&A activity. In addition, changes in foreign exchange rates can always have an impact.","This slide depicts Ratings revenue by its end-markets. The largest contributor to the increase in Ratings revenue was a 7% increase in Corporates. In addition, Financial Services revenue increased 3%, Structured finance declined 6%, governments increased 4%, and the CRISIL and other category decreased 7%. This includes an increase in inter-segment royalties for Market Intelligence, which was more than offset by decline in CRISIL's dollar denominated revenue.","Market Intelligence delivered a strong quarter with revenue increasing 8%. I need to remind you of two changes that both became effective on January 1st. First, we now include Kensho revenue in Market Intelligence, rather than recording it as a corporate item as we did in 2018. Second, Trucost has been transferred from Indices to Market Intelligence, and results in both periods have been adjusted for comparability.","With the ESG and climate, data analytics efforts under way at Market Intelligence, we believe Trucost is better suited to be included here. Adjusted expenses increased 6% as investment spending began to pick up in the second quarter. Adjusted segment operating profit increased 14% and adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 180 basis points to 34.3%, despite increased investments in the business.","More importantly, on the trailing four-quarters basis, the deficient delivered an exceptional adjusted segment operating profit margin increase of 380 basis points to 35.6%. We expect increased investment spending in the second half of 2019 as we continue to invest in strategic growth initiatives. The sale of the SPIAS business that we mentioned on our first quarter earnings call, closed on July 1st. SPIAS revenue was approximately $20 million a year, and was included in Desktop.","Desktop revenue, the largest category grew 3% excluding acquisitions while active desktop users grew 11%. Growth in this category has been slowing for the past few quarters due to industry trends and a shift towards Data management solutions as customers increasingly prefer data feeds.","Data management solutions continues to exhibit strong growth. Credit Risk Solutions grew 12% with RatingsXpress providing the greatest level of growth as we continue to expense the data feeds portion of Credit Risk Solutions.","Turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The segment delivered 14% revenue growth, and this included a non-recurring benefit of approximately $11 million associated with several recent contract re-negotiations. We do not expect a material change to future revenue from these contract to changes.","In the second quarter, we reported 4% adjusted expense growth, 19% adjusted segment operating profit growth, and adjusted segment operating profit margin of 69.6%, an increase of 280 basis points. On a trailing four-quarter basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 130 basis points to 68.4%.","Revenue in the various categories was mixed during the quarter. Asset-Linked fees increased 18% due primarily to AUM growth in ETFs and mutual funds as well as the benefit from recent contract re-negotiations. Exchange-Traded Derivative revenue declined 6% from lower exchange fees.","Data & Custom Subscriptions increased 21%, but recall that a year ago we reported a 4% decline associated with a delay in contract renewals as a result of a change in administrative processes. This is all behind us now and the second quarter 2019 revenue reflects a more normalized run rate.","Our indices division over the past year ETF net inflows were $70 billion and market appreciation was $69 billion. This resulted in an increase in quarter-ending ETF, AUM of 10% over the past year to more than $1.5 trillion. I want to make a clear distinction between average AUM and quarter-ending AUM. Our contracts are based on average AUM, which increased 9% year-over-year.","We disclose quarter-ending figures because flows and market gains and losses are best depicted using quarter-end figures as shown in the waterfall chart on the right. Industry inflows into exchange-traded funds were $108 billion in the second quarter, with the majority going into fixed income and global equity products. Flows into US equity funds were $42 billion.","The indicators for our exchange-traded derivatives . Volume increased modestly in the second quarter. S&P 500 Index options activity increased 2%, VIX futures & options activity increased 4%, and activity at the CME equity complex increased 12%. ETD volumes increased during the quarter, but revenues declined.","While changes in volume are often a good indicator for changes in revenue, our pricing elements that change as well. For example, we aren't paid on volume at the CME, we're paid on the percentage of the profits of the equity complex at the CME and that could differ from volume.","Now turning to the Platts division. Platts revenue increased 4% as a result of a 4% increase in Core subscriptions, and an 11% increase in Global Trading Services with increased trading volumes of oil, LNG, and Iron ore. Adjusted expenses decreased slightly leading to an adjusted segment operating profit margin of 52.1%, an improvement of 220 basis points. The trailing four-quarter adjusted segment operating profit margin was exceptional, increasing 260 basis points to 49.5%.","Also yesterday, we closed on the sale of RigData to Drillinginfo. RigData is a small business that we purchased three years ago to secure the rights to North American rig information. In conjunction with this sale, we have secured the licensing rights to RigData datasets for use by Platts Analytics going forward. Power and gas delivered the largest rate of growth at 7%, primarily the result of increased adoption of our LNG Benchmark. Petroleum and Metals & Ag grew 4% and 3% respectively. Petrochemicals revenue declined 1%.","And now lastly, I would like to discuss our 2019 guidance. This slide depicts our GAAP guidance. Those items that changed are highlighted. Please keep in mind that our guidance reflects current spot market ForEx rates. And now, let me review the changes to our adjusted guidance.","Corporate Unallocated expense has been reduced by $10 million due to a reduction in professional fees, resulting in an increase to our operating profit margin range. Interest expense has been reduced by $10 million primarily due to improved accounts receivable collections and cash management benefits associated with converting overseas cash to US dollars. Tax rate has been reduced by 0.5% points with higher levels of stock option activity than initially anticipated.","These items resulted in a $0.10 to $0.15 increase to our diluted EPS guidance range. While these changes increase our expectations for free cash flow, we're still within the guidance range we provided before.","In conclusion, we continue to execute upon our corporate initiatives, including our stepped up investments in growth opportunities, and our $100 million cost reduction program. Some of our progress can clearly be seen in our current results, other programs are just getting underway. We are pleased with the progress we are making, both to advance the company and to deliver on our new 2019 guidance.","And with that let me turn the call back over to Chip for your question. Chip?","Question-and-Answer Session","A - Chip Merritt","So, thank you. Just a couple of instructions for our phone participants. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we will now take our first question.","Operator","I would now introduce Ms. Manav Patnaik (sic) [Mr. Manav Patnaik] from Barclays. Your line is open.","Manav Patnaik","The first question is just on the Market Intelligence Desktop growth of 3%. I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on some of the trends, I think we know the obvious ones, but the deceleration was a little bit more notable to the 3%, and also the 11% user growth is obviously positive, but at what lag do you monetize that user growth to show better desktop growth?","Doug Peterson","Manav, this is Doug. Thank you for your question. Well, first of all, the 3% growth as you know, is something that we, it's a little bit below what we've been targeting. We're targeting a mid single-digit growth going forward.","And as you know, there has been a few industry trends of some equity shops that have been shrinking et cetera, so occasionally we get a request from customers like that to negotiate, but what's really - what we're focused on is the diversification of our business model. If you think about it, we have a different customer sets. We've got - we have banks investment banks, insurance companies buy side, sell side, corporates, governments, regulators et cetera.","And so when we look at our user growth, 11% is a good leading indicator for us. We also were coming up during the year, we have different cycles of re-negotiations of our contracts, but overall we're still projecting mid single-digit revenue growth for the rest of the year.","Manav Patnaik","And then just secondly, given you guys obviously still have one of the most flexible balance sheet in that universe right now. Just trying to think about how you plan to maybe use that flexibility in the appetite for M&A, just given some large deals recently including the one today just curious and how we should think about that?","Doug Peterson","Well, first of all you should think that we are very careful stewards of our capital and our balance sheet. We take it very seriously, our obligations to manage those funds on behalf of our shareholders, as you know, we're always looking to see what would be potential opportunities for us to grow and to invest.","In the slides I included a framework, which we call powering the markets for the future and that's really how we guide, where we're going to be investing in the future, and we've put a major emphasis as you can see, the last year so on internal organic investments as in China with ESG, with other initiatives.","So as you would imagine, we're looking all the time to see what would be out there, it's just part of having a corporate development strategy, but nothing specific that I would talk about right now.","Operator","This question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS. You may ask your question.","Alex Kramm","Yes, good morning everyone. Want to ask about China, obviously, I know it's a little bit more long term, but obviously things are happening. Wondering, Doug, what other I guess metrics you can provide so far in terms of what you've seen, you obviously have a couple of ratings now. But, and I know it's early days, but anything you can disclose around pricing you're getting, new interest levels you're seeing, this is opening up any sort of data sales opportunity at this point already, and if you can comment on what these companies have seen in terms of, you mentioned BBB just now, I mean if credit spreads have been impacted. So I guess a big question about would like give us what would you can about what you're seeing so far?","Doug Peterson","First of all, the reception for our business in China has been very positive, both from the markets themselves from issuers from investors. As you can see, we were approached to issue a bond that was actually not a AAA rating, is the first time this week that we that anybody has issued a BBB rating in the market, and the market reaction was actually curious and very positive.","They were interested to see what is the criteria we're using, how it's going to be applied, as well as people have very high expectations for the way that we're applying our global expertise into a domestic market. As you know, the market is still very large, it's the third largest bond market on approaching the number two bond market.","But overall, as you know, the bonds are still there, they are very short-term, about three years. A corporate issuance is about 12% of the total market, local governance about 31%, policy banks about 17%, commercial banks about 14%, overseas investors still only own about 2% of the total bonds in the Chinese market.","And so if you think about those dynamics the people we've been approaching for on the issuer side we have a very active program with our commercial team to approach issuers and talk to them about what are the opportunities to be rated by S&P China, and we're getting very good response from them. We're starting to build a pipeline. Nothing that we would be able to talk about formerly yet.","And then on the investor side, we're really swamp with investors calling us to learn more about our approach and especially now having two different ratings at AAA to a BBB, it demonstrates that there is going to be a widespread of ratings in China as opposed to the domestic ratings, which are all cluster around the AAA and AA level.","What we'd like to do is over time as we get more track record as we have more ability to give you data. We will start sharing more of that, but we're very pleased with the progress we've had so far. And also, I'm really pleased that we've already had two ratings, especially that cover a range of ratings.","Alex Kramm","I'll stay tuned. I guess then for Ewout, on the margin side, I mean you continue to do really deliver good operating leverage, but also seems to show that you're still finding new efficiencies. So I guess it's a broad question, but just curious how you feel about the ability to continue to do that, how many stones they are still to turnover to find these efficiencies or if we are starting to run out? Thank you.","Ewout Steenbergen","I would say a whole pile of stones we still to have in the company, and we are very pleased with the progress we are making. As you have seen, we are very disciplined with the execution of all of our programs to deliver on the commitments we have given to our shareholders. So if you look at the margins overall, we have now one business that has its aspirational margin targets, that is the Index business.","On a trailing four-quarter basis, 68.4%, and we set the aspirational target is mid to high '60s. We have one business that is getting close to the aspirational target, that's the Platts business, that is on the trailing four-quarter basis now at 49.5%, and then Ratings and Market Intelligence have still a little bit of room with Ratings being now at 55.7 with the aspirational target of high '50s, and Market Intelligence at 35.6 trailing four-quarter margin and the aspirational target is mid to high '30s.","So, we will continue to execute on our plans to deliver on the operational leverage that we have to deliver on our productivity programs to grow the top line, which of course the best way to expense margins is to grow the top line in a healthy way. You've seen that we have had strong revenue growth this quarter in all of our businesses, and that's way you may expect us to continue with that and we have a lot of opportunity still to continue on the spot.","Operator","This question comes from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Toni Kaplan","Similar to your largest competitor, your ratings performance in the quarter notably outperform the issuance environment, and I know you attributed a lot of that to mix, just given the strength and high yield, but could you also talk about if there are any other drivers outside of mix and price. Are you seeing similar mix shift in the quarter to more infrequent issuers and M&A financings or is there anything else that can just explain really, really strong performance in ratings, even though the environment is still pretty muted? Thanks.","Doug Peterson","This is Doug. There is really nothing that is really more beyond what you just mentioned what we've talked about, and it is the pricing. It's also the mix as you saw there was a 41% increase in high-yield issuance, which is really a significant increase, and the mix this quarter was very different in prior quarters. We saw the 41% increase in high yield in the US is definitely a big part of that.","We also saw a corporates, which many of the corporates went to go to the markets during the quarter were people that actually pay us with transaction fees versus those that on a frequent issuer fees that we're not going to the market this quarter.","So those are really the most important drivers, there is nothing that was unusual overall. What's unusual is that there was the 41% increase in high yield in all of a sudden in really dramatically in June as well. But other than that, there is really nothing that a main shift quarter-on-quarter from prior quarters.","Toni Kaplan","And then shifting to Market Intelligence. With the recent large M&A announced this morning, maybe you could talk about if you see the industry changing in the coming years? And if you plan to make any changes to your CapIQ strategy or Intelligence strategy overall, just I guess does large M&A sort of change anything in your view going forward?","Doug Peterson","Well, first of all, it's a very interesting transaction, and I don't want to comment on the actual transaction itself, but they're both formidable competitors, both in MI and in Indices. But when it comes to the landscape, we've been watching, and obviously watching very carefully, what would be the landscape, and what could be some of the changes that take place with this type of a competitor which is already very formidable on its own, but we are very pleased with our strategy at Market Intelligence and indices. We've got a diversified segments in our businesses, as I mentioned earlier, we have customers and government agencies, corporates, universities etcetera.","And we have a growing data business, which is something that's not only in Market Intelligence, but also across the company. We're looking to see how we can harness our data business even more than we have already.","So these are some of the things that we will watch in terms of industry trends from our competitors, but we also feel with the various transactions we've done the last few years for data assets like Trucost what we're doing with ESG, Kensho which is showing that there is a lot of value in artificial intelligence machine learning data linking etcetera. We feel that we're very well positioned to be also to be a tough competitor in this space.","Operator","This question comes from Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.","Bill Warmington","So, question for you on Market Intelligence. You've been talking about and you've been executing on creating a unified platform for us SNL and Capital IQ, I was hoping to get an update on how the migration of the Cap IQ users onto that new platform is going?","Doug Peterson","Yes, first of all, the MI platform is we've discussed is a platform that we're in addition to working on the migration, it's also important for us the way we're supporting other divisions. As an example, the S&P Global platform, which we're using to support Ratings360 & Ratings, and new very dynamic data delivery products for Platts. But going back to your question, we continue to add Cap IQ data sets and functionality to the MI platform on an ongoing basis, and this will continue in through 2020.","And so along the way, we've found some ways to be more flexible to - our clients to also be more involved in the transition from Cap IQ to MI, so that the customers themselves can choose the timeline for their own migration to make sure that they can transfer all of the functionality along with that. So the transition is going well, but it's probably a little bit slower than we had originally envisioned. So it's now moving into more of a timeline into 2020.","Bill Warmington","So when that transition is completed, what kind of a - you're able to actually shut down the legacy Cap IQ system, what kind of a margin benefit do you think you can get from that shutdown?","Ewout Steenbergen","Well, we haven't really quantified that, but obviously running two platforms with all the maintenance expenses that come with that is expensive. So there should be operating leverage benefit that will come out of that, but we haven't really quantified that at this point in time.","Operator","This question comes from Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your question.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Drew coming in for Joe. Could you provide a little more color on the ESG scoring system and the early customer reaction you're getting?","Doug Peterson","Yes, so, thank you. First of all, there is various ESG products we have across S&P Global, with in Indices, in ratings, and in market intelligence. And we in the prior call talked about how we had put together design team to ensure that we had a common data architecture, which we've been managing, as well as to ensure that across the different groups where we have a consistency of approach in methodologies. But the on the slides this time , there was a Slide 14 where I included the profile factors which are used for the ESG evaluations, and not to go into too much detail.","Just as an example, the ratings ESG evaluations, it starts with an approach to look at the overall geography and an overall market. It then also has a way to look at 44 different industry structures for environmental and social factors. We've been doing a lot of governance over the years.","And then for each of the different ESG companies are being evaluated. There is factors - four factors for environmental, four for social, and four for governance and each of those are scored. What makes these unique compared to some of the other tools being used in the market right now is that the person that receives this evaluation can then dig into and analyze each of these different factors to understand how they led to the total score.","In addition, in the Ratings ESG evaluation, there is also a management meeting, which takes place, which allows the ratings Analyst and the management team to discuss their overall ESG and overall governance and stewardship profiles. So we think it's a really interesting approach.","We've only issued two of these ESG evaluation so far. Although Trucost which is one of the other companies, which we acquired three years ago and as Ewout mentioned earlier, is now included in the MI Pro in the MI segment, is also a very advanced company when it comes to the 15,000 different companies that they have included environmental profiles including greenhouse gas emissions, waste and pollution et cetera.","So this gives us also we think a real, a leading position with having Trucost that we can use across all of our ESG products. So much more to come, really good-- really, really good feedback so far from the markets on what we're developing.","Unidentified Analyst","And then just to add on top of the one of the previous questions about China. So with that BBB rating, are you seeing any push back or hesitancy from companies that we're thinking of getting rated and now they see you guys are going to be all over the place, and now they are a little concerned by that?","Doug Peterson","We haven't seen that at all. In fact, quite the contrary, people especially institutional investors have come to us to really learn more and more about our methodology because they see this granular approach with a wider spread that actually is much more reflective of what the pricing is in the market as well. So we haven't, this is - it's probably too early for me to draw conclusions from two ratings, but the response has been really enthusiastic.","Operator","This question comes from Tim McHugh of William Blair & Company. Thank you. You may ask your question.","Tim McHugh","Just wanted to ask about Platts, both in terms of I guess it was a slightly slower growth rate in the Subscription piece, so is there was anything happening there? And then the sale of RigData, is there anything that's reflective of in terms of the broader strategy with regard to additional research and analytics you're selling on top of the price assessments products? Thanks.","Ewout Steenbergen","Tim, this is Ewout. I think you should not read anything with respect to the Platts results that there is a change in trends. We expect the Platts business to grow mid-single digits growing forward, that's going to always surrounds a bit that's a little bit quarter-by-quarter, but this is a very steady business where there is a lot of recurring revenues, we see the GTS business doing well. We see strong margin improvements and we expect to Platts business to continue on that path.","So again expectation of mid-single digit revenue growth going forward. With respect to RigData, RigData was acquired approximately three years ago. The main strategic reason at that time was to secure the data source of the rig counts in North America, and the only way to secure that at that time was through the acquisition. In the meantime, we had an opportunity to secure that going forward through a licensing agreement.","And therefore, there was a better owner for these assets in the future, and that's why we decided to sell RigData to the other owner. But at the same time have access of this data sets on an ongoing basis. As I mentioned in the prepared remark RigData, it was a relatively small business, approximately $10 million of annual revenue for this business.","Tim McHugh","And then just more, you also sold the kind of investment advisory business, I guess, is this - is there any sort of sign that you're doing a refresh portfolio review or reassessing some of the smaller business units or is it just I guess coincidence, two of these situations popped up reselling?","Ewout Steenbergen","So, Tim, we are very happy with our portfolio, we think we have a fantastic set of businesses. So there is nothing large happening on the need for suspect to a portfolio review, but we always are looking at certain elements, and where we first of all can strengthen our portfolio based on acquisitions, but sometimes there are short and elements and smaller businesses that we think there is someone else who could be a better owner.","So don't see that this is anything large in terms of a change in our strategic intent. This is just continued healthy review of our portfolio. But these are all in general term small businesses, so there is nothing behind that.","Operator","This question comes from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","George Tong","I'd like to dive deeper into your Ratings revenue performance this quarter. Your other major competitor reported a 2% decline in Ratings revenue in 2Q compared to 3% Ratings revenue growth at S&P, would you say that you have structurally higher exposure to high-yield issuance that explains this difference or perhaps different pricing power?","Ewout Steenbergen","And George, good morning. This is Ewout, I think it's hard to of course for us to comment on some of our peers. But I think in terms of our market profile, in each you always have to go two three layers deeper and looking at mix changes and to understand the impact on our company. So for example, if you look at structured finance, we are having strong market positions in certain areas, and we have smaller market positions in other areas.","So for example, if there is a decline in CLOs, our CLO position is relatively modest. So we won't be impacted so much based on that. And the other element is what's Doug mentioned before at the previous question and that is that we saw particularly a decline in - sorry, we saw an increase in issuance from issuers that are paying us more on a pure transaction basis.","So we have our frequent issuer programs where we have more a fixed fee arrangement. And so we saw more an increase on the customers that are on a transaction basis and therefore benefiting a bit, a little bit more this quarter then if the issuance growth would that have been in the frequent issuer programs which wasn't the case.","George Tong","You increased your full-year EPS guidance to reflect lower corporate expense, interest and taxes given the strength in your ratings business is your view on full-year revenue has also improved, or do you expect weaker trends in the back half of the year that could offset 2Q outperformance?","Ewout Steenbergen","George, I think you should look at the increase in our guidance. Overall, that we are very optimistic around our current performance, the growth progress we are making, the progress we are making with respect to our productivity programs. Doug mentioned the issuance outlook, that is modestly stronger for the full year.","So overall, you have to take all of these elements into account if you think about our new EPS guidance. One element I would like to point out that the investment spend will be a bit higher in the second half of this year.","So think about approximately $15 million higher investment spend in the second half than compared to the first half of 2019 and that $15 million will mostly be incurred in the market intelligence segments.","And then also, if you look at the two divestments we did is SPIAS and RigData, on an annualized basis both companies combined had a revenue of $30 million, $30 million, so we're also missing a bit of revenue in the second half of the year because of those divestments.","So look at that all in combination but I think what you should clearly take out of our improved guidance is we are very happy with the current performance, as you have seen this has been a very strong quarter for the company, and we are also optimistic about the outlook for the second half of this year.","Operator","This question comes from Craig Huber of Huber Research Partners. You may ask your question.","Craig Huber","Doug, curious to hear your updated thoughts on the debt issuance environment out there when you think about where we are at right here in the cycle in terms of credit spreads, M&A calendar, strong refinancing calendar coming up et cetera and follow-up?","Doug Peterson","Thanks, Craig. Well, first of all, as Ewout just mentioned was - mentioned earlier, we have built our global issuance summary based off of many different factors. We've been looking at obviously what's the pipeline of refinancings coming up, what's on people's balance sheets for having to for maturity schedules, we speak with the debt capital markets groups of various investment banks, and we also watch very carefully what we think are going to be some of the factors driving that including rates and obviously growth.","So in our current forecast, we see that in Corporates are going to be up about 2.5%, Financial Services about 0.8%, Structured finance about flat for the rest of the year, and Public finance up a little bit as well, which leads to about a 1.4% total.","But a couple of the factors which you've asked about though are pretty interesting right now. The investment grade composite spread has been pretty low recently, its recent high was about 176 basis points right now, in July it was down to below 140. In speculative grade, high-yield investments - high-yield issuance right now the spreads about 400 basis points, it's been as high as 500 recently, it's been as low as around 300 recently.","So it's still a little bit higher than it had been down at 300, but we see that the conditions for issuers is still very strong low rates. And then on top of that, you know that the overall rate environment is very low the United States 10 year as of yesterday was just 2.06%, the UK is a 0.6%, Japan is negative at 0.15% negative, Germany is now down to 0.43% negative, and Switzerland's down at negative 0.64%.","So with underlying 10-year base rates this low and trending lower along with spreads which are very attractive. They're not as low as they have been, but there is still attractive, financing conditions are attractive. There is still a lot of liquidity out there, we think that overall, it's a good environment for issuers, it's a more of an issuer-friendly environment, although we don't see the markets going gangbusters, which is I think reflected in our overall 1.4% expectation for growth for the rest of the year.","Craig Huber","My second question, Doug. Can you just comment on your Kensho acquisition in terms of, curious, in terms of employee retention rates there, how that's doing? And also, what do you guys most excited about right now with, working on it from a cost perspective, but also enhancing the products that you have with four, five areas that you're willing to talk with you most excited about? Thank you.","Doug Peterson","Yes, let me start and then I hand it over to Ewout. So I am really excited about the things that I've been seeing in Kensho, and recently I've had opportunity to meet with some employees and in Platts as well as Indices, in Ratings who are having direct contact or direct product development beyond just what we had originally done with MI.","And so the enthusiasm is really great, and there is interesting enhancements that are being looked at for the Market on Close, for Surveillance, in Ratings for the new Index team which is joined the Index team from Kensho into our Index business.","So there is a lot of enthusiasm across the company. We're starting to see tangible products delivered or beginning to be scaled but let me hand it over to Ewout who will elaborate on that and tell you a little bit more also about the attrition.","Ewout Steenbergen","I can just share the enthusiasm of Doug around Kensho. If, for example, here about the redesign on the Market on Close process in Platts, the enthusiasm in Platts, and the people that are involved with that in working in a joint team with Kensho to redesign such a process, which will be really a leapfrog in terms of the proposition at Platts has to its existing customers. That's fantastic.","If you think about the Omnisearch and how much of that is completely changing the experience of our customers in terms of the market intelligence platform, and looking at more and more data that we add to this platform which will make it more and more difficult to search what you're really looking for, so a very strong search engine is important, and in fact, it doesn't really exist in the B2B markets today. So that is already being rolled out today to certain customer groups and the feedback is very positive.","I can give you the whole list, but of course, I don't want to spend too much time on that. Craig, you also have one very specific question about retention which is of course an important metric that we are measuring and following very closely, and I'm happy to tell you that the current attrition levels are below industry benchmarks for Kensho. So, we're pleased with that as well.","Operator","Dan Dolev from Nomura. You may ask your question.","Dan Dolev","Thanks for squeezing me and I appreciate it. Great results. So I look at your guidance, starting from last year, you went from negative to 0.6 to plus 1.2 to plus 1.4 in terms of the issuance outlook, maybe ask differently, is this just a matter of being deeper into the year or increased optimism or a little bit of both?","Doug Peterson","Well, this is a combination. It's - I wouldn't - I would say that this is really a combination of what we saw in the first half. As I mentioned a little while ago and I can give you a few more statistics, there was a lot of volatility in the first half of some numbers, as I've mentioned before with high yield up 41%.","In Europe, investment grade issuance was down 17%, in Europe corporates are down 17%, sovereigns were down 28%, public finance in the US was down 11% but corporates were up 17%. So what we do is we try to look and see what was the issuance so far this year against our initial expectations.","Also looking at, as I mentioned what are maturity schedules that are coming forward. And so this is something that our team, our fixed income research team, they put this together in a way that they are taking into account all of these different factors based on what was the issuance earlier in the year, what is the upcoming maturity schedule, what are they hearing from the banks, what are they seeing from the M&A pipeline, and the one of the most important factors which is also part of that is the outlook for rates, and we've seen the ECB, Japan and then yesterday in the US, the Fed lowered rates by 25 basis points as well, which is really setting a more attractive rates environments as well.","So those are all of the different factors that would be built into this 1.4% increase for the rest of the year.","Operator","Next question comes from Jeff Silber of BMO. You may ask your question.","Henry Chen","It's Henry Chen. Good morning, Doug. Just wanted to ask a high level question on the strategy around powering markets. I guess especially in that Market Intelligence and Platts business, I was wondering if you could just comment on how you're thinking about investments in either data and analytics for and how you're thinking about which markets you can sort of attack and to build products for? Thanks.","Doug Peterson","Well, this is the one of the things that we've done with this the strategy of powering the markets for the future and you saw the framework in the materials that we provided. It gives us a way that we can speak to our businesses about their core investments in their core businesses as well as areas of disruption or what we would call adjacencies.","And as part of that, we're looking and driving this on what our customers want, and what we hear from our customers, we decided that we needed to drive our investments and drive our growth by hearing what comes back from the markets instead of just trying to come with come up with ourselves.","So in addition to our strategic teams and our executives, we also have our commercial teams and others out listening as much as they can, what are the key trends, and you mentioned what is one of the most important trends for not only Platts and market intelligence, but also Indices and Ratings and that's the future of data.","This is where we are very pleased to see the growth of over 10% and 11% in the data feeds business in market intelligence. When we meet with our Platts customers, they're talking about data, they have oodles and piles and an avalanche of data in their own business that they're trying to make sense of.","And one of the questions they are asking us is \"Can you provide us with more data that's easier for us to use and also make sense of our own data?\". So the data equation is one that is most on the minds of our customers with the combination of how do you use that through technology, through modeling tools etc.","And as we look at that, that's how we - how we decide where we're going to invest. It's really based off of customer feedback, customer insights, and it's not just a team that is doing this in a theoretical way. We're actually out, boots on the ground, visiting our customers to listen to what they need.","Operator","We will now take our final question from Michael Cho of JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","Michael Cho","Thanks for squeezing me in here. My first question. I want to touch on ESG. I mean, we talked about ESG on this call, but I was hoping if you can give an update on how you're thinking about framing the overall size of the ESG opportunity for S&P, and then do you think S&P has all the assets today to adequately capture that opportunity?","Doug Peterson","Let me start and give you a little bit of a view of the market opportunity and how we're thinking about it and then Ewout will give you a little bit of thoughts about market sizing and where we're heading from that point of view. In terms of the opportunity and how we think about it, it's one that's really expanding very rapidly. When people ask me about this and meetings that I met I usually say that I think we're in the second inning. This is a very early stages of the development of the ESG Data market.","We're finding demands from the investor side, the buy side is trying to understand what this means for their portfolios, and it's going beyond what were the traditional impact investors or investors that had some sort of a sustainability quotient already included in there in their mandate. And so this is also starting to now filter through to pretty much all and institutional investors.","When we look at this, we also know that there are needs from governments, from corporates, from issuers, etc and we're trying to see and make sure that we have the right mix and right portfolio of products and services. We think that there are opportunities for every single one of our divisions to provide ESG products and services. We also believe that with Trucost as an anchor, which is an excellent anchor for what we do, this gives us the ability to have a starting point for environmental factors.","Our governance work that we've been doing for over 30 or 40 years in the ratings business also helps us with the foundation there. So you're going to see us developing these products and services coming out of all of the different divisions, and as we've shown in the last couple of quarters this is a commitment for us, an investment commitment. We've also started building in a way that we designed it from the ground up. So we've got a very sophisticated approach to data across S&P Global, so we don't duplicate our efforts.","But that's the general approach, you should see us continuing to talk about this investing in it and growing it from what we think is a strong foundation but in the very early innings. And let me hand it over to Ewout.","Ewout Steenbergen","So if we look at the overall size of our ESG business we're looking at activities and products across all of our divisions as Doug just explained. So think about renewable energy in Platts, think about Trucost and ESG scorecards that are being developed in market intelligence, the S&P Dow Jones Sustainability Index, and the new 500 ESG Index, in Index the ratings ESG evaluations and many more products that are currently under development.","Overall, last year we reported approximately $37 million of revenues for ESG, the forecast for this year is approximately $50 million of revenue for the whole company and the outlook is growth of approximately 40% over the next few years. So 40% growth, so this will be clearly a growth driver for the company in the future.","Michael Cho","I'm going squeeze just one more in on China. Doug, I mean outside of ratings on the call you talked about powering market harnessing data but in China, I mean can you give us framework, an update on how we should think about the incremental essence, the opportunity within China, because of the establishment of the local ratings business?","Doug Peterson","Well, first of all, thank you Michael for initiating coverage. We appreciate having JPM as one of the organizations that's covering us and thank you for the questions. On China, just we've mentioned this before, we are thinking about China and we're entering it with a consolidated comprehensive effort for all of S&P Global.","So right on the heels and I could say even nipping on the heels of ratings as market intelligence that's also building out a domestic data and analytical service for the financial markets as well. So we look at this as a really important transition of a large financial market that is moving towards becoming more of a capital market than a bank market.","As you know, right now in China, most of the financing is actually on bank balance sheets as opposed to bonds and most of the bonds that are actually issued are very short term, there's three years and they're also going on banks' balance sheets.","And so when we look at this transition that we think is going to take place as the capital markets are reformed, they become more sophisticated and also more linked globally, we believe that there is going to be opportunities for all of the S&P Global businesses to establish domestic onshore products and services.","We don't have a sizing for you yet. We will provide that over time as we get more experience and we build out the roadmap for you, but right now, you can be assured that we look at this comprehensively across S&P Global, the first onshore investments in the first products that are launched in ratings but market intelligence is really close behind.","Doug Peterson","Thank you. So with that let me thank everyone again for joining the call today. I'm very pleased with the strong quarter that we had. I'm pleased that we're continuing with a lot of progress in all of our investments in our core businesses which you saw demonstrated today from our strong results.","And then, it's also encouraging to see the progress that we're making on these new investments such as the China discussion we just had, the ESG products and services that are based on anchored off of some of the Trucost benefits that we had from that investment, so thank you again everyone for following the company. I hope everyone has a great summer and we'll be back in a quarter. Thank you very much.","Operator","That concludes this morning's call. A PDF version of the presenters' slides is available now for download from investor.spglobal.com. A replay of this call, including the Q&A session will be available in about two hours. The replay will be maintained on S&P Global's website for 12 months from today and by telephone for one month from today.","On behalf of S&P Global, we thank you for participating, and wish you a good day."]}}
